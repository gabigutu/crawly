		<shortDescription>Future classic...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, once again I think the critics have got it wrong. Like Blade Runner and 2001, this is a film that will be properly judged in 10/20 years or maybe more. Its way ahead of its time, the combination of Kubrick and Spielberg is unique, its unlikely we will ever see anything like this again.Did I like it? The answer would have to be yes, the mix of styles will put many people off, but I found it to be unlike anything I have ever seen, and all the better for it. The story is by no means original but everything else about the film is so different that this can be forgiven. To get one thing straight, Kubrick decided Spielberg would be the better man for directing it, and I think this was a very wise decision, many of the ideas are pure Kubrick, but Spielberg has the neccassary attributes to direct such a film, and great credit has to go to Kubrick for handing it to him.Haley Joel Osment is amazing, the robot/human emotion must be amazingly difficult to pull off effectively, but Osment does it with such relative ease to the point where you do believe he is a robot, not that he is just acting as a robot. Jude Law is excellent, and so to is Frances O'Conner.As for the ending, as brave as an idea it may of been to end on a downbeat note at "the first ending" I think the slightly upbeat ending is much more appropriate.All in all I would say A.I is a wonderfully unique film that should be judged for what it is, a film. Forget everything about the Spielberg/Kubrick "issue" and just sit back and take in a truely amazing film. You may hate it, you may love it, but no matter what, it will effect your emotions in some way and you will discuss the film afterwards.This film will be truely judged in 20 years or so, when it can be assessed purely as a film, as with 'Blade Runner', '2001', and even 'The Thing', it will get better with age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I.--A Film With Heart And Brains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's latest movie A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, which he took up at the encouragement of the late, great Stanley Kubrick, has caused widely divergent comments. And I can't help wondering if the most scathingly negative reviews of this movie aren't just an open desire to see Spielberg crash, as he had with "1941" and HOOK.For my money, Spielberg has done it again with this futuristic science fiction drama, regardless of what the negative reviews say. Its story of a robot boy (Haley Joel Osment) who desires to be a real boy in a far future in which humans (Orgas) and machines (Mechas) exist side-by-side but not always in harmony is very much modeled on the Pinocchio story, though it is actually based on a 1969 short story by Brian Aldiss. It raises some interesting and sometimes unsettling moral dilemmas that few films of late have done. Can a parent love a child, even if that child is not real? What might happen if that child desired to be real? How will Man and Machine be able to co-exist?Like all intelligent science fiction, such as Kubrick's own 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and Spielberg's own CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, A.I. forces us to ponder where we've been and where we might be going. It's an incredible combination of Kubrick's icy intellectual and clinical mind and Spielberg's emotional heart; and I think it works exceedingly well. But it forces the viewer to not leave their heart and brains at the door, which I think is why it is being so negatively received in this season of mindless summer movie fare. It may be too intelligent for its own good, and many don't have the 145 minutes of patience needed for the movie. I did, however; and I would call this an absolute masterpiece. Out of ten stars, give this one a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Stanley Kubrick !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has SO many angles, so much information... I was completely blown away by it and will definitely go see it many more times in the cinema. This is one of the classic movies of all time and I was appalled by the complete lack of understanding by many of the other user-comments.If you like Tomb Raider or Disney Movies...just don't bother. This is so far removed from the Hollywood-style of scripting that many would just be bored to death by the surrealism and impressionism Kubrick uses in all of his films.If you are looking for a Spielberg action-flick...also stay away. Don't bother. I can only guess Spielberg finished this 'Kubrick' with the proper respect for one of the greatest directors of all time.This is not a movie, this is pretentious art. Pretentious, but actually making GOOD on its pretense. From my point of view, not in the negative sense of the word. Questions are asked and possible answers given, letting the viewer decide for themselves. Mindbogglingly, impressive camera-action. Brilliant soundtrack. Absolutely perfect acting by all players. Superb casting.One of the greatest movies of all time. High in the list, together with "2001, A Space Oddyssee".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the year's best films -- thought-provoking and deeply moving. ***1/2 (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French: "AI - Artificial Intelligence" is the hardest kind of movie to review-but it's also the most enjoyable kind of movie to watch. It's been over three weeks since my screening of Steven Spielberg's emotionally harrowing epic about a robot boy. Before writing my review, I wanted to let its themes, content, and characters sink into my head and make a solid impact. The film was based on an idea by Stanley Kubrick, but when he died in 1999, Speilberg took charge of the project. I could spend pages discussing the techniques of Kubrick's intentions and Spielberg's decisions, but I will not. Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg are two of the greatest directors American cinema has to offer; it's pure pleasure watching their ideas clash and flow. I am not going to examine each individual theme here, either. That would ruin the movie for you. "AI - Artificial Intelligence" presents many themes on screen, but it's important to take what you get out of it. Whenever I read a review of Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" or "2001: A Space Odyssey" I feel influenced by the reviewer's interpretation of the movie's themes. Every time I watch either of those movies I get something new out of it. I hate it when other critics state the movie's themes on paper as if it's a fact. There is far too much room for interpretation to reveal this movie's message, or the message of any Kubrick film for that matter. Ask 100 people, and you might get 100 different answers. "AI - Artificial Intelligence" is that kind of movie-one of the year's best.Critics and audiences alike have torn apart this movie's ending-a clear miscalculation by Spielberg. If Kubrick were in charge, the movie would have called it quits about twenty minutes earlier in an unsettling sequence that takes place in the ocean. But Speilberg, who always seems entranced by science fiction, injects an additional segment into the mix that does not work quite as well, but isn't so completely awful that it deserves such harsh criticism. It still leaves us with an open, startled emotional disorientation. I left the theater with tears in my eyes. The movie before the conclusion is so complex, moving, and involving in so many different ways the last twenty minutes didn't even come close to spoiling the movie for me. "AI" transpires sometime in the near future after the polar ice caps have melted and flooded coastal cities and reduced natural resources. Mechanical androids have become popular since they require no commodities. Reproduction has also become highly illegal. Machines provide sexual services and if anyone wants a child, they will purchase a robot. However, the difference between a robot child and a living child is that robots cannot love. That's the task professor Hobby (William Hurt) of Cybertronics Manufacturing has solved. He has made a robot child that can love.  We can separate "AI" into two separate segments. I do not want to reveal too much about each plot because the pleasure of watching this movie evolves from the revealing of the connecting plots. I will, however, briefly say the first details a robot child's interaction within a family, and the second deals with the robot's estrangement from its family and the quest to regain the mother's love. I can imagine the material in Kubrick's hands. The movie's opening scene has a female robot begin to undress in a public office. Speilberg cuts the action before she reveals any explicit nudity. Kubrick would have had various shots of full frontal nudity. Spielberg, never comfortable with sexual material, leaves out much of the motivation behind Kubrick's ideas. One of the biggest problems in "AI" is the lack of edge with the sexual content. Jude Law plays a robot gigolo who lives in a sex fantasy called Rouge City where people from everywhere come to seek sexual satisfaction. The central character, a robot boy played by Haley Joel Osment, motivates every action in the story except for the scenes in Rouge City. Why contain such a perverse character and setting when his entire existence simply displays a mood that has already been well established. Obvious, the filmmakers toned the aspects of "AI" down to warrant a gutless PG-13 rating-but why? The movie isn't appropriate for children anyway, and it's far too complex. Undoubtedly if Kubrick were in charge "AI" would have to be re-cut to avoid an NC-17 rating. Spielberg should have either taken advantage of the perverse material or completely eliminated it. Here I am, doing exactly what I said that I wouldn't do, and at nearly 900 words, I still have not clearly expressed my own opinions on the film. I have many notes in front of my that display my reaction as I watched the film, but I am not going to use them-they reveal too much about the movie. "AI" is a very personal film, a deeply moving, scientific, careful, and harrowing motion picture that displays startling talent on screen and behind the scenes. The special effects are extraordinary. The performances are alarming-the immensely talented Haley Joel Osment may once again be up for an Academy Award nomination. Go see the movie, then talk about it with others. It's the kind of film that you can spend hours thinking about, then go see it again. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film. It isn't one of the greatest films ever made, but it's a personal favorite of mine. I cried at the two sad points, I laughed at the mannerisms of Gigalo Joe and Teddy, the super-toy, my heart pumped faster at the action, suspense, and horror, but overall, I really enjoyed the film on a whole. I didn't find an ounce of it boring at all. It's practically the same as observing an extraordinary life and extraordinary tale of a boy who just wants his mommy. But the boy is not a boy, and rather a robot. But the way he acts can pass for a human any day.The look of the film was dazzling and amazing. From the facilities in the underwater Manhatten, to the curvy, sensual architecture of Rouge City. I really felt as if I were really going along for a great ride and once I stepped out of the theater, I wanted more.The film is from Steven Spielberg based on Brian Aldiss' short story, "Super-toys Last All Summer Long" which was doctored up by Stanley Kubrick. The film is a tribute to the legendary filmaker, but it is not his film, but rather Spielberg's. Sure it sometimes tries to mimic his styles, but that's practically the same as a filmmaker paying homage to a great. It's more or less the same as somebody making his adaptation of a novel or maybe graphic novel, since Kubrick supplied some of his artwork through designs. The story is Kubrick's, but the film is Spielberg's.Although it may seem ridiculous to some at some points, it's a future, not THE future, but a rendition of it and somethings may happen in THIS future that may seem unrealistic. The film has a great score, but it just doesn't stand out like some of John Williams's other scores. The end could be considered a homage to Spielberg's "Close Encounters Of the Third Kind" or it could be something different, something more along the lines of the film's title, Artificial Intelligence, but only a far more advanced form of it.The acting in this film is great along with the emotions, visions, humor, and fright. I found this film to be extraordinarily superb, but whether you think it's as good, is up to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's cinematic tribute to Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is fitting that A.I., Steven Spielberg's monument on film to Stanley Kubrick, is a shoe-in for Best Picture in 2001. A.I. is cinematically beautiful, and tells a wrenching emotional story of a child's quest for maternal love.In A.I., Spielberg masterfully adopts Kubrick's hard, bare-essentials style of direction, letting the photography tell the story, rather than the dialogue. This style allowed Kubrick to develop an enormous scope of ideas, stories and emotions in his movies. But it often left casual movie goers behind. He had difficulty finding the right treatment for A.I. so he handed the project to Spielberg before Kubrick's death last year.Spielberg textures A.I. with obvious dollops of his own soft-as-whipped-cream touch. It is Spielberg's great skill that blends the two styles together with mesmerizing results. This blend allows the emotional story of a young robotic boy to come to life, and Kubrick fans will be able to enjoy one last film made by the master -- with the respectful help of another great artist.The Kubrickian style demands the very best from actors, who must appear unapologetically real, and must, in long sequences with no dialogue, convey strong feelings and emotions. The A.I cast, especially lead actor Haley Joel Osment, meet every measure of the demands. Despite his youth, Osment will surely receive a nomination for Best Actor.A.I. will rank high among the best movies ever made, but viewers should come prepared for an intense emotional and intellectual work-out. If you want to take in a quick flick to escape life for a couple of hours, this is not your movie. If you want to explore the cinematic depth of a master artist like Spielberg, A.I. will take you places you've never been before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mind-blowing movie that will grow in stature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! That was all I could say when I walked out of the theatre after my first helping of A.I. I wasn't sure whether I loved the movie or was disappointed by it, I just knew it had had a huge effect on me. Having seen it a further three times at the cinema, I still find fault with it, but I keep returning to it, thinking about it, discussing it, and it has left me with a feeling that, five months later, I've still not shaked. In many regards, this movie reminds me of Fight Club, not in terms of theme or emotional content, but due to it's level of craft, the daring nature of it's execution and the fact that I keep re-evaluating it. All the things that are possible to comment objectively on (if anything ever is) are handled expertly. The performances are top-notch, especially Haley Joel Osment as David, the little robot child that longs to be human. The effects are not only very impressive, but are integrated into the story rather than calling attention to themselves. Januz Kaminski's photography is, as one has come to expect, impressive, and the movie is unusually unpredictable for such a big-budget experience. In my opinion, John Williams' score is among his most impressive. I listened to it on CD for three weeks before seeing the movie, and thought it was fantastic, but once the movie started rolling I completely forgot about the music. That says a lot about both the score and the film itself. I also liked the three-act structure, in which the tone and feel of the movie changes drastically as the story progresses. Part one, as one reviewer noted, feels like a cross between E.T. and The Shining, an odd, but very effective combination. The second part of the movie is awash with Spielbergian imagery, but with the darkness and coldness of a Kubrick movie. And the last part is a head-scratcher that has the intellectual resonance of most Kubrick-films, and the emotional tone of something like Cinema Paradiso. I purposely refrain from saying that it is as emotional as Spielberg-films, because I think the director's complexities, the dark aspects of his style, and the occasional subtleties of his work are often overlooked by critics. It's difficult to discuss the themes of the movie without spoiling it, but while many people criticised the movie from having several false endings, I felt that each continuation added layers of though and complexities that the movie would have lacked had it ended sooner. I have come to the conclusion, over the past months, that I do love the movie and that it is my favourite film of 2001, even ahead of The Fellowship of The Ring and Amelie. In other words, buy it on DVD, it's more than worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kubrick Dialectic, the Spielberg Inheritance, the AI Challenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "literalists" are clearly not happy with A.I. So now is a good time to recall that "2001: A Space Odyssey" was greeted upon release with derision, confusion, dismissive reviews, public consternation, and, oh yeah, some thought it was an absolute masterpiece. Beyond the monolithic influence of that film (think of Han Solo's jump to lightspeed, etc.), the symbols of "2001" -- TO THIS VERY DAY -- cannot be decoded using anything but the most personal, interpretive language. The obelisks, the message of the obelisks, the Star Child, Cosmonaut Dave's "room", HAL-9000's true motivation ? all these things remain in our collective subconscious as indelible images that refuse to be concretely defined between or among viewers. WHAT CAUSES THIS CONFLICT OF PERCEPTION? IS IT INTENTIONAL? Again and again, Kubrick's films take us to a No-Man's Land of narrative and moral ambiguity, stranding us, forcing us to make decisions, demanding interpretation (or we can judge the surface, walk away, hate the film). To my perception, Kubrick is the only, true "Brechtian" film director. The device Brecht proposed is "Alienation Effect", or put simply, Leading the audience down two, divergent paths at once. My favorite example is "Barry Lyndon". Being the adventures of a young man, handsome, virtuous, well-meaning, ambitious, full of promise. Yet in every scene, the camera "pulls-back" revealing Barry (but never to himself) to be womanizing, self-absorbed, criminally inclined, socially inept, not very bright, morally bankrupt, and at last, a broken shell of a man. Or let's consider "Strangelove": Did Kubrick really create a headbanger, slapstick comedy about nuclear proliferation, mass destruction, and military/political incompetence? The real question is "Who else could have?" Well, that's my take on Kubrick's artistic sensibility, and, without daring to presume Spielberg's motivation, it's what drew them both to "A.I." Pinocchio, the Blue Fairy, cuddly Teddy Bears on one hand, but on the other hand ? social institutions are faltering forever -- parenthood, childhood, science, industry, sexuality -- all distorted beyond repair. And Humans, the ultimate A.I. protagonist, seem blissed-out, in denial, more interested in creating "Davids", "Darlenes" and "Gigolo Joes" than in rising water levels and the imminent threat of extinction. Therefore, I believe A.I. is getting precisely the response all Kubrick films "INITIALLY" get. Spielberg's reputation and career can withstand anything that public perception might bring to his films, but I keep thinking that A.I. is the riskiest moment of his artistic life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought A.I. was a very good film. I'm sure it is somewhat different from what Kubrick had thought but he and Spielberg had worked on it for a long time. I liked the questions that it posed about such as what does it mean to be a being? Does the boy robot have genuine feelings or are they programmed? But we as people do we have genuine feelings or are they "programmed" in our genetic code, by society, and by other factors? Intriguing questions from an intriguing film. Definitely a thinking persons movie. The acting by Haley Joel Osmet was outstanding and the supporting cast was equally good, too. The portrayal of the future was somewhat frightening but also extremely fascinating. Especially the ending of the film. I saw this film with my brother who's first word when the film ended was "Wow!" He only expresses that for films he really likes. Those who like science fiction and those who like films that make them think definitely see this film. Even if you are not as impressed as I am you will find parts of the film fascinating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you don't like this movie, here's a suggestion...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't say people will either love this movie or they will hate it. I'm sure it breaks down that way to some extent, and the range of opinions expressed about the movie support that notion, but I'm nevertheless also sure there are those out there who are ambivalent or indifferent about it, neither loving or hating it. That's because I'm one who was ambivalent about it after I first saw it in 2001. There was much to like about the movie. Film makers par excellence, Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Does it get any better than that? The cast was good too, all of it. Especially Haley Joel Osment. Production values galore. The film is beautifully rendered. But even with all that there was something about it that bothered me, even annoyed me, and whatever it was it got in the way of my enjoyment of it. So I dismissed this movie and didn't even think about again it for years. Recently it popped up on HBO. I took the opportunity to watch it again. I found myself not being as bothered by the movie as I was before. HBO being HBO, I watched it again. And then again. Now there is nothing about the movie I dislike or that bothers me. I now like this movie without reservation. I also figured out why I reacted the way I did in the initial viewing.My suggestion to those who don't like the movie is watch it again, and give it your thorough attention. Your opinion may change. For a couple of reasons.First, this is a very complex movie. There's a lot to take in, visually, cognitively, philosophically. I've now seen it four times and I don't believe I've yet absorbed all there is. We're talking Kubrick AND Spielberg here. That alone tells you this movie contains much to behold. I'm not of the school who believes that Spielberg mucked this up after Kubrick died. Yes, Kubrick nursed this project along for over 20 years, from initial writing and treatment through rewrite after rewrite. But it was Kubrick who hand-picked Spielberg to direct it, years before it finally was made, Kubrick leaving his indelible imprimatur, but Spielberg likewise leaving his too was always anticipated, including by Kubrick. Kubrick wanted Spielberg's touch on this movie. Nor do I believe the movie is "20 minutes too long". Those last 20 minutes are not just Spielberg schmaltz, they are important to the resolution of the story. Throughout the first 126 minutes of the movie we are asked in myriad ways to care about David. The last 20 minutes gives meaning to that caring. Without that conclusion there is no meaning, just a cold void.Which leads directly to the second reason why I recommend repeated viewings, and the explanation for my initial reaction. The story is about a robot designed and programmed to be just like a little boy, who wants to be a real little boy, and who literally spends thousands of years seeking the return of love from his human "mother" who he was programmed to bond with and love. That's the basis from which all manner of questions are asked and explored, about the meaning of love, humanity, and of existence itself. I submit that this storyline told that way --about a child-- ultimately overwhelms the emotional senses. It more than tugs at the heartstrings. It yanks at them. While we might care about the android Data on Star Trek, or about the robot Robin Williams plays in Bicentennial Man, both of which also want to be human, our caring for those "adult" robots is nothing compared to the caring we feel for the child David here. With an innocent child seeking his mother's love it all goes way over the top. Add to the mix that Haley Joel Osment played the role masterfully. With this recipe the movie bluntly manipulates our emotions, something it does too well. It becomes distracting and difficult to watch, let alone to process analytically. Think Bambi, but on steroids. Many of us just shut it down, saying to ourselves, "I don't need this maudlin stuff in my life." Thus affected, the viewer never appreciates the movie's rich themes because the shutdown blocks all that. What I found, however, is that subsequent viewings lessens the distracting effect, and the movie becomes much easier to watch and fully appreciate. Oddly, it appears that Kubrick and Spielberg knew exactly what they were toying with in this respect, and they did it intentionally. It is embedded in the story itself. The flesh fair's barker, as he was getting ready to destroy David, has to keep reminding the audience that David is only a machine, not a real boy, and he implores the audience to not allow their emotions to be manipulated by the machine's child-like appearance. As David tearfully pleads for his life the audience is swayed, giving David an opening to escape. The inner audience, the audience within the story, is is being manipulated the same way we in the outer audience, were being manipulated. This must be a conceit by intent and design.As a child actor Haley Joel Osment was nonpareil. The Sixth Sense told us that. This was his last role as a child, and after this he became a different actor (see e.g., Secondhand Lions). Puberty did that. His career as an adult actor is just now beginning, and what that holds in store remains to be seen. But as a child he was very very good. Maybe the best ever. And this is him at his bestIf you haven't seen it, be prepared to see it more than once. If you have seen it, see it again. This is a movie that gets better each time you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg is good. The film is not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(++++Spoilers) Can anybody answer these 4 questions about A.I. for me:  One, is there a single scene in this movie that doesn't go on way too long? Two, is it true that a movie's in trouble when it suddenly sprouts an omniscient narrator in the last ten minutes, just to make sure it overstates whatever point the preceding 2 ? hours failed to drive home? Three, how'd we go from global warming to Ice Age in just two thousand years? Four, I get it that the omnipotent liquid-metallic aliens could clone the weird android kid's mother from her hair -- despite the fact that it was cut hair, and you need the hair root to clone from, because it's the scalp cells that contain DNA, not the protein fibers of human hair. But the liquid mind-reading aliens aren't bothered by that technicality, and they clone her anyway. And somehow the aliens got all her memories back into her brain, including her recent memories of the freaky android kid, because the aliens evidently have discovered that human beings encode memories in their hair. (Is that just scalp hair, by the way, or is it body hair as well?) So the liquid omnipotent psychic benevolent post-Ice-Age anorexic aliens clone the android kid's mother from the cut hair fragments that Teddy had in his pocket for two thousand years, the hairs that somehow didn't rot, but then the loveable well-meaning aliens ran afoul of this metaphysical barrier dictating that cloned mothers can only last for a day, because the space-time currents have decreed that once a space-time pathway is used, it can never be used again -- or least it *can* be used, OK, but just for 24 hours ? because metaphysical barriers are flexible that way, and it's more of a guideline, really, than a rule. Now this guideline, flexible as it is, really befuddles the elegant long-limbed super-badass-cloning alien guys, the ultra-smart and so-very-nice aliens who can clone the mom from acellular cut hair just as they could probably clone her from her exhaled breath ? but this super-restrictive space-line continuum 24-hour-maternal-expiration-date problem they just can't get around. My question is this: wouldn't it just be better if Spielberg himself stuck his head in the frame of the movie at this point in the film and said, "Look -- OK -- I've got a point I want to make, and the plot I've got running here won't really accomodate my point. Could I just say it to you straight out, and then I could avoid all these corny plot contrivances? Would that be OK? Great. Here goes: Kids, once you leave home, your moms will never love you again, even if you run into these super-omnipotent cool biotech alien guys, OK? NEVER. Not even then. Thanks. You've been super. Let's roll the credits." Would that not in fact be a more enjoyable movie-going experience?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this movie, be grateful. *spoilers ahead*First, the good parts. In the first half of the film, Osment plays the role of robot incredibly well. Ok. That's it.Overall, the first half of the film is bad. The second half, however, is completely unbearable. There were two or three places where the film could have ended and made as much sense as it did ultimately, but instead it dragged on for ages. Other reviews mention A.I. as being a great work by Kubrick or Spielberg. I wonder, if their names had not been associated with this movie, would people claim to like it just as much? Having to listen to a 13-year old squeal "Mommy" over and over just doesn't appeal to me.A.I. had so many flaws that I can barely think of a place to begin. Somehow, water does absolutely no damage to the robot, but spinach does? Cold temperatures affect it as well? The other physical problems were insane: The helicopter can submerge to those depths? The ferris wheel falling on it doesn't crush it? Statues and their painted surfaces remain perfectly intact after being submerged and encased in ice for thousands of years? The buildings in Manhattan (and don't even get me started on the explanation of the city's name) are still standing after all that time? My personal favorite is the school of fish being able to swim the submerged robot back to the surface.The flaws in reasoning are just as bad. Monica can't bring herself to have David dismantled (since we apparently cannot simply turn him off or erase any stored data), so instead she dumps him in the middle of the woods in a state of complete despair? Yeah, that'll be better for him! Technology has advanced to the point where robots can be made to perfectly resemble humans, think, and even love, but they have no common sense. Hmm... not everything you read is real? Isn't that a lesson that every 13-year old (even if he does only have 7 candles on a birthday cake) would know? So once the short ice age comes and goes, we need to create Monica once again. Since she'll be dead in a day, because... well... she just will, why bother with a DNA sample? I'm sure a realistic version of her could have been created. Squeals of "Mommy" could have been heard for years to come. And why does she never once question the sudden disappearance of her son and husband? Finally, the whole "Teddy-saves-the-hair" bit went beyond the realm of possibility for everyone.I know, I know. I missed it. I didn't understand it. It was too deep for my mind. Disneyesque voice-overs automatically make a movie deep, I know. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing deep about A.I. was the non-stop crap on the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. Is a good union of two great film makers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw A.I. on the first night it ran here and I must say I was disappointed in the size of the audience. How strange to see so few people show up for a Spielberg film. This film did not enjoy the normal hype that most of Spielberg's films enjoy, I think I know why. Lack of product placement. They're may have been some somewhere but I didn't see them. A.I.'s story line and flawless visual effects reflect what I can only describe as the meeting of two great film makers. Kubrick (who started work on the project after he read the Aldiss book in '83),and Steven Spielberg who's long list of intelligent blockbusters made him the perfect person to bring this story to the screen. I could, I believe see the story boards and concepts Kubrick developed and I could also see the sensitivity that Spielberg added to scenes and characters. These two things are not entirely separate in good Science Fiction. All good science fiction has some human sensitivity in it otherwise it would just be a horror film. The script reflects some of the darkness and coldness that sometimes underlies each character human and machine, there is no fear of this in the story. This darkness draws us on in the story.The visual effects are stunning and come darn close to genius. The story line takes us in and the visuals make it almost real.I wish I had Mr. Mannings grip of syntax, but all in all at the end of the day it's good science fiction and a good story too. I beleve that Stanley Kubrick's choice of asking Steven Spielberg to make this film was the kind of genius that Kubrick showed in all his work. It is a tribute to both men that they saw a vision of something and worked toward it's creation. I think they came to a great place in film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve's game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Artificial intelligence can be clearly divided in tow parts, quite different in mood and theme. The first hour imitates Staley Kubrick, who had worked on the project before his death. It is as if Spielberg is playing with Kubrick's fans: he films that part of the film exactly like the dead master would do it, reproducing very well that very disturbing mood from "full metal Jacket"'s first half, "A Clockwork Orange" and "Paths of Glory".It feels like a game. Spielberg knows that people could not this film and not ask: "I wonder how would Kubrick have done it", or start comparing the two to Spielberg's disadvantage. So he answers the question showing which film Kubrick would do in the 1st hour (the exact moment when the mom leaves the boy-robot), which proves his control over the medium (something no one ever questioned) and then moving on to HIS film, with the human content and theme he thinks he can provide (something you can easily question his ability). Now he has to prove he can do a better job. So he extends and overfilms to the point of exhaustion his "vision", putting as much visual and emotion you could expect. Overall, it felt kind of boring and empty.So it's like "I gave you Kubrick and more! By the way, wasn't my vision more interesting?". No, it wasn't, Steve. You proved you are a talented director enough to bring to life a dead cinema master in a way we can almost believe he directed from the dead. But you proved, once more, that as an artist you can only be obvious and dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would say that I was disappointed by this movie, except that I admittedly went in with relatively low expectations (based on reviews) and it wasn't THAT bad. But the movie WAS a mess. There is a great idea buried in here somewhere, and its an interesting topic with great dramatic potential. But the movie only achieves emotional fusion in fits and starts, and it just sort of wanders on along rather than moving with force and purpose. The ending, in particular, should have been much, much better, and felt tacked on, perhaps in service of the fairy tale narration. In the end, this one felt like it needed two or three more passes beneath an editor's red pen to tighten it up, focus the plot, highlight the theme, etc. I was very ready for it to be over, long before the final credits rolled.There is a great movie about this topic out there waiting to be made, its just disappointing when arguably the greatest living director failed to deliver. Maybe a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh wow! Never in my life have I seen a film quite like this one. It leaves you pondering such weighty issues as the nature of love, humanity, technology, existence. Before this puts you off I must add that it asks these questions without the pretensions of an art house movie. Rather, it is a film that does not demand too much of the viewer to enjoy on the surface, but reveals itself when one starts to look deeper, starts thinking about what one has just experienced.The generally negative reception of this film from the public is probably due in part to a misleading publicity campaign - the trailer paints the film as a nightmarish 'dark-future' action film, somewhere in the realm of Blade Runner. What the audience was given was an emotionally driven piece of drama, and a phenomenal one at that.There is also a large contingent of people who deride the film as Spielbergian schmaltz. They accuse him of perverting the original intentions of Stanley Kubrick, and applying a sickly sweet veneer to what should have been a substantially darker, more disturbing piece. They seem to be unaware of the fact that Mr. Kubrick approached Mr. Spielberg to make the movie years ago, because he felt that his style of filmmaking would not suit this project, and that a more positive approach would be more appropriate.Of course, most of these people will never accept that anything remotely connected to the mainstream could have any value...What I am saying is that you should take a chance and go and see this movie. Maybe you will be left cold. Maybe you will be changed forever by a film the like of which has never been seen before. Just go into the cinema with an open mind and an open heart, and leave your cynicism at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is frustrating beyond it's sappy ending or overwhelming bad sense of forced sentimentality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is frustrating for so many reasons.Spielberg and Kubrick were purportedly good buddies, but that should not have been a reason for Spielberg to think he could work off of Kubrick's pre-production without butchering it.I expected this movie to be so much more interesting and thought-provoking, and instead all I am left with is a ridiculous fairy-tale.The first twenty minutes or so of this movie show great-potential. The idea of inviting something like David into your home is chilling, and the problems that his programming begins to cause are handled well. Suddenly and without warning he's running through the woods with a talking teddy bear being chased by guys in a hot-air balloon that looks like the moon. It feels like a really bad rehash of elements found in E.T.The 'Flesh Fair' sequence is where things get really bad. Suddenly the cool futuristic design sense has been thrown out the window to make way for a 'spooky' carnival theme. It feels completely disjointed from the rest of the movie. I understand that it was intended to show human animosity and resentment towards the 'mecha'(what a stupid term to use), but there could have been so many better ways to do it instead of re-creating the droid torture scene from Return of the Jedi.The idea of using robots for sex is a great moral dilemma and I'm sure was one of Kubrick's ideas for the film. Again this could have been handled so much more intelligently, yet we're left with Jude Law as a tap-dancing cartoon character.At the end of the day, the biggest problem I have is that I couldn't care less about David or his convoluted Pinnochio-esquire quest. Sure it's really sad that he's so obsessed with Monica, but at the end of the day it's only his programming. I'm not sure why the movie kept trying to say that he actually 'loved' her, because from my point of view this simply wasn't so. He can reason to some extent, but his primary directive is not coming from any 'feeling' for her, simply a bonding that is hardwired in his system. To this extent, he may be one of the dumbest robots in movie history. The fact that he seems to be painfully unaware of his own existential dilemma, or simply won't acknowledge it, is perhaps the most annoying element of this film. The reason I feel that similar movies dealing with this topic such as Bladerunner and Ghost in the Shell are so successful is that the artificial protagonists are either painfully aware of their own existence or at least intelligently questioning it.My final gripe comes from the ending of the movie. I think the idea of highly evolved robots sifting through the frozen remains of human civilization is great. Why on earth would they suddenly turn into benevolent faeries who are in the business of granting wishes? This was clearly Spielberg's final attempt to suck some tears out of the audience . The only reason I would have to cry at the end of this movie is the loss of Stanley Kubrick and the loss of such a potentially great movie.</fullReview>

A big, incoherent, pointless exercise in the typical Spielbergian club-you-over-the-head-until-you-get-it style that has absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever. Even the special effects are a waste, adding nothing to the plot and serving only as a place to dump millions of dollars where a few would have done just fine. Does it have a point of view? Who knows? The story is as disjointed as a road map of Afghanistan. Does it have humor, charm, pathos, insight--the few things, at least, you think you can count on from Steven Spielberg? No, no, no, no. Does it have a keen insight, a cold, dispassionate worldview, straightforward emotions, economy of action, like most of Kubrick's films? Uh, no, again. This film is simply miserable. A hateful, ill-conceived, pointless, overblown, fragmented, shrill, poorly-executed disaster of a film that should serve as a cautionary tale to thousands of wanna-be filmmakers when they wonder if success is something that can be maintained after thirty years in the business. A disaster and a colossal disappointment, from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time of this film's cinema release no less a critic than the much admired and feared HMS Germaine Greer discharged a broadside in its general direction to the effect that it had several perfectly good endings, all of which the director chose to ignore in favour of another. I find myself in agreement.Though somewhat lacking in focus in a number of important respects, this film has a degree of intelligence and some powerful moments; the film successfully raises questions about the point at which a 'machine' becomes a living thing, since after all, isn't a human being a biological machine? And if machines might be considered 'alive', can we deceive ourselves into believing that a non-conformity to 'normal' human behaviour makes the faux-human androids any less alive than us? It's an interesting question.Another interesting question is 'What On Earth Possessed Steven Spielberg???"I gather that some very old dramatists in some foreign country or other had this thing called a Deus Ex Machina, probably familiar to keen viewers of Star Trek; when a storyline had reached an unsatisfactory and unresolvable point, the playwright would simply write in a divine intervention that would make everything alright again, in direct contravention of dramatic progression... logic... decency... all that stuff.Well, Spielberg seems to have been taking notes from his ancestors, for when this film reaches a very sad but dramatically very sound ending, and you get that familiar pang of 'oh, please don't let it end here', Spielberg does the worst possible thing he could - and listens to that silent cry of the sentimental heart.Indeed, Spielberg's Deus Ex Machina is startlingly literal when it appears, but I'll leave you to enjoy that discovery in your own time.I find it extraordinary that a man of Spielberg's ability could go to such grim lengths to crowbar in the sweetly toxic ending he finally, unconvincingly does. It is this single decision which ruins the film, tainting this interesting if not especially distinguished effort with an artless, child-pleasing finale. This is made all the worse by the fact that it takes a good 20-30 minutes to import this unwelcome and out-of-place conclusion. I do not wildly exxaggerate when I say that I spent much of this time with my head in my hands, ridden with despair at the stupidity unfolding before me.Nice film, shame about the Ending. It's right up there with Stephen King's 'IT' on the "WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAN???" factor.You are warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of both Kubrick and Spielburg, this movie was a surprising miss. It tries real hard, but gets confused and lost.I've read that Kubrick originally worked on this project before Spielburg picked it up. I don't know to what extent each actually worked on filming, but it sure does feel like two different directors worked on this movie - which is problem # 1.Both have a unique style that do not mix well. Kubrick is a master at disciplined contemplation of a moral issue while Spielburg is a master at spinning a wonderfully entertaining yarn. This film tries to do both and it just doesn't work.The first act of the film, which to me feels entirely Kubrickian, is great. We are immediately immersed in a moral conundrum. The pit is deep, dark, poignantly adorned with characters against a somber stage that compels us to engage the material. It also is very much in the style of Kubrick: sets, lots of master shots, slow moving and ponderous "photography in motion." The ambience is there to serve the story in every detail. If this was Spielburg's homage to Kubrick, well done. If this was Kubrick's work, wel l, it was right on target. (I really miss his work.)The characters are drawn clearly if not archetypically and draw us unabashedly into the ring of moral discourse which we achingly yet eagerly embrace.Then, the story that is being constructed is completely abandoned in the second act as the main character (boy robot) is taken completely out of the setting that's been developed to this point and we embark on an odyssey of sorts. I spent most of the second act wondering what was going to happen in the plot that was being developed in the first act. We never find out.From this point on, the movie is all Spielburg. Fanciful staging, lots of effects, the obligatory allusion to the holocaust and gut-wrenching turmoil for our little hero and his friend. This is a huge contrast to the beginning of the story and is so different that it really feels like a whole different movie. Following the sublime Chardonnay of Kubrick with the super-charged Frappucino of Spielburg is unsettling and frustrating. For example, the staging in the first act is dominated by polished wood floors, furniture that is both kitsch and futuristic and smoky corporate offices. The second act is pretty much Back to the Future meets Thunderdome. The two have their place - but not in the same movie!Where the first act compels us to consider the matter, the second act throws us against the wall, puts a gun to our head and screams, "listen to me!"By the third act, I had really lost interest. I never quite got over the abandonment of the original story and didn't really feel like getting involved in the second one - both because it wasn't as interesting and because I didn't want to be cheated twice in two hours.The end of the third act is really where the movie should have stopped. It was sad, pitiful and left us with the core moral issue of how we tend to implement an idea without thinking of the consequences.But, no, here comes the fourth act - and the other major problem with this movie. Epilog, coda, call it what you want, the ending was tacked on and was just horrible. More face time for the FX folks and some really trite, contrived and irrelevant dialog from robots about the space-time continuum. Really, who cares? It's just an awkward plot device and you roll your eyes and ask "Wha--?" all at the same time. The second ending, as I like to call it, attempts to fulfill the demand for emotional conclusion that the odyssey portion of the film has built up yet fails to do so. "Whatever" comes to mind. I bet this was done in response to test screening.Still, I'm glad I saw this movie. It has some great moments, compelling subject matter and Osment puts in a truly great performance. Just don't look for coherent plot and a sensible story line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Futuristic Pinnochio Story Told With An Age-Old Warmth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge Steven Spielberg fan and I have never seen a Kubrick film. So, I can't compare the two, though there are certain elements in the movie, which definitely Spielberg wouldn't think about putting there in the first place. This is a Kubrick script and he chose Spielberg to direct the movie before he passed away. I am quite sad about that, because if he had been alive and he saw this interpretation of his idea, what would he have thought about it? From the comments of the nay-sayers I assume that the first thing he would change is the PG-13 rating and make it a rated-R. Spielberg thankfully cuts short the opening scene where a robot is made to undress in front of many people. Also, he doesn't explore Gigolo Joe's (Jude Law) back story, if other user comments are to believed, would be quite dark in Kubrick's original story. Spielberg has always been driven by the heart of the story which makes him such an awesome director. I became his huge fan from Jurassic Park 2 which had me cowering in fear for days after I saw the movie (I was a kid then). After watching the film, I have to say I don't understand how anybody could not love this movie. It is not your typical big budget sci-fi blockbuster, but it is one of the best movies which has a coherent plot with big special effects. This is definitely one of Spielberg's greatest movies and has great camera-work, dialogues and an amazing background score. The world he has created in the movie is mesmerizing. Even though it is kind of an apocalyptic world, I liked it very much.In the future, humans have created every kind of robots imaginable, to help them during the crisis. All the glaciers and ice caps have melted and most of the cities in the world are under water. The natural resources are extremely strained and it is a natural choice to involve robots in every field due to their conserving nature. There are two types of robots - the widely distributed normal robots and the 'Mecha' robots which can think for themselves. But, never before has there been a robot which could love - the kind of love between parents and their kids. Prof. Hobby creates such a robot in memory of his own kid, David. David is brought into the Swinton family where, at first, Monica (Frances O'Connor) is extremely nervous around him. The Swinton's kid, Martin (Jake Thomas) is in a coma and could never wake up from his slumber. After some hilarious and heart warming few days with David, Monica activates his sensors which induce him to real love. He begins to understand that she is his mother and he adores her. She, in return, begins to love him.Then, one day, the unimaginable happens - Martin wakes up from his coma and comes back to home. Martin is jealous of David and coerces David to do bad things, which David thought would make his mommy love him more. After a few such incidences, Monica decides to let David go. If she returns him to the robot company, they would destroy him. She loved him, but couldn't keep him as her son. So she leaves him in a forest and tells him that he could come back to her when he becomes a 'real' boy, like Pinnochio. She advises him to stay away from the flesh market and other dangerous places for a 'Mecha'. Along his journey to find the 'Blue Fairy', he meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) - a love robot - and he helps David on his journey. The path is filled with perils and how can a robot with metal fibres ever become a real boy. David doesn't understand one thing - he is already more real than any other robot before him.David (Haley Joel Osment-'The Sixth Sense') is a very lovable character, and Haley gives such a heart wrenching performance that I had tears so many times while watching this film. David is a modern Pinnochio - he wants to be real so that his mother can truly love him. Haley Joel Osment is amazing, the robot/human emotion must be amazingly difficult to pull off effectively, but Osment does it with such relative ease to the point where you do believe he is a robot, not that he is just acting as a robot. Haley was one of the best child artists ever. Frances O'Connor's character is torn between her own son and David. She gives a very real performance, which makes one feel for her. Jude Law is perfect as Joe, but what did his story add to the story in the bigger sense? He only showed him the path, but did he have to be a love-robot for that? No, definitely not needed. William Hurt is also perfect as Dr. Hobby. The teddy bear deserves a special mention. The ending is perfect - David could finally go where no other robots had gone before him, he could finally dream. If Spielberg had ended on Kubrick's climax, I would have been utterly dejected about David's end (i would have still liked it though). This ending gave us hope (I know humans are extinct, still hopeful for David), it could happen in the real world too. 2000 years is a long time, but in the end David was truly happy for the first time in his life and I rejoiced in his happiness. Though the visual effects are amazing, it is the story and narrative structure which propels this film to the status of a classic, for me. Even though it has its flaws, I give it a perfect score because AI is a unique movie which has a heart as huge as Mt. Everest :) 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a sci-fi fan and appreciate the hypothetical situation of what could happen if a robot is given feelings of love and attachment to a person or people. Some good actors made the best of it but I can only blame the directing and screenplay adaptation of the original story.What's so insidious about it is that it had a pretty good start. Slow as Kubrick, but not bad. Then the pathetic Artificial Idiot is introduced (the computer that was not fed certain basic knowledge such as eating will do severe damage to him or people can drown in a pool or the difference between fact and fiction or that a statue is not a sentient being.) Then Scare Bear is introduced (an animatronic teddy bear with an attitude, an unexplained ability to balance on round feet and mysteriously unlimited power source.) Then came Gigilo Joe, a glorified vibrator with onboard MP3 player. Inexplicably women succumb to this robot who has all the charm of Max Headroom. Then came Robin Williams as the ripoff of a Microsoft Office help icon (why Robin? WHY!?)THEN the movie got silly. As they escape from New Atlantic City and fly to Man-hattan (now a city of the drowned) he makes his way from uptown to midtown to Coney Island in faster-than-fiction time and parks his semi-futuristic vehicle in front of a statue and waits...and waits... and waits... and waits......for 2000 years. By this point it feels like that was filmed in real-time. At this point in history, robots inhabit Earth exclusively and man is extinct {coughMatrix.} Scare Bear produces a locket of hair from (gad! I don't wanna know) and replicates mommy for one more day of fun before mecha-kid shuts up permanently.I suppose even greats like Spielberg are not perfect and capable of schlock. I mostly laughed at at this one - with a hint of suspense and marvel at the special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the DVD of this movie last night (or rather, this morning!). The ending is a little unbelievable and drawn-out, but the movie is nonetheless excellent for two reasons.First, the very interesting and pertinent themes and issues that it raises: (1) Can human beings ever master sufficiently advanced technology to create 'artificial intelligence' / robots that can simulate human beings (i.e. with feelings, emotions, etc.)? (2) If the answer is 'yes', should human beings create such a robot, for ethical and moral reasons? (3) If the answer is 'yes' again, what obligations do human beings owe this robot with feelings and emotions, i.e. what 'rights' does the robot have?The second reason is of course the spectacular performance by Haley Joel Osment. That boy is really quite an amazing actor. He provides the core of the movie as he undertakes his powerful emotional and physical journey. I have only watched two of his movies ('The Sixth Sense' and this one), and he is seriously brilliant. He captures the character so well; robotic in physical nature, but imbued with human emotions and enduring unconditional love. His facial expressions display such a natural childish innocence and affection, that it is almost impossible to believe that he was acting. A few scenes which particularly impressed me: (1) where he begs his adopted human 'mother' not to leave him in the forest; (2) where he speaks to the 'Blue Fairy' after the 'super robots' excavates him from the ice wreckage; and (3) the closing scene where he hugs his 'mother' before climbing onto the bed next to her, clasping her hand.That boy truly should have won an Oscar for this.It would not be fair if I did not also mention the superb performance of the Teddy Bear (voice by Jack Angel) and the spellbinding musical score by John Williams.All in all, highly recommended. Stimulating, compelling, moving, touching and entertaining - a classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artificial, but not Intelligent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's AI fails to live up to its billing, which really bothers me, because artificial intelligence is such a rich and variegated subject, traversing the fields of biophysics, psychology, philosophy, and even religion, that the payoffs for careful consideration of this subject are potentially great, perhaps even inspiring. Spielberg, it seems, didn't even bother to make a trip to the library, preferring instead to invest awkward and incomprehensible phrases like `human beings are the key to the meaning of existence' with eschatological gravitas.Throughout this film, Spielberg drives home one theme over and over and over: humans are more programmatic, both in their thinking, and their behavior, than `mechas.' We watch David's parents first adopt and then abandon the robot boy because of their prejudice about what is `real' and what is not, a deliberate irony seeing as how David is in many ways more human than their biological son. We see a perfectly ridiculous `Flesh Fair' thrown into the movie to embellish this point: the `artificiality' these humans seek to destroy might just as well be their own.At worst, the movie has a psychotic message. At the heart of the film, Professor Hobby, who designed David, delivers an impassioned speech, telling him that his singular quest to become a `real' boy at the magical hand of the Blue Fairy is a human flaw which is also humanity's `greatest single' gift: The ability to `chase down dreams. ` Problem is, if a human dreamed of becoming a non-organic being, and could not find surcease from his labors to do so, he would become, if not already, psychotic. Why Mr. `Hobby' couldn't have made the boy to accept himself as he is, which is the essence of human spirituality, seems never to have occurred to him. And so one leaves the movie with a sick feeling in the pit of one's stomach, due largely to the fact that this psychotic idea is presented as an axiom, with religious fervor.AI succeeds in being artificial, but not in showing intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Biblical scholars spend a lot of time looking at the text to tease out who inserted what part in order to change the meaning of the rest and thus promote their own point of view. One can do that here as well.Spielberg's style is to completely design everything ahead of time in storyboards. The film is designed as a comic. Then in production, he's blam blam blam. Kubric's notion of filmmaking is to just start and muddle about until the film emerges. Spielberg notion is to deal with comfortable realities (yes, even -- especially -- in Schindler), to abstract emotions and motivations to the simplest, and exaggerate their effects. The camera is invisible in his films. Kubric's camera is always acknowledged. His films are self-consciously films and he likes to posit uncomfortable emotional physics. It is not complex so much as sophisticated. Spielberg is inherently optimistic, Kubric is the opposite.These two notions cannot mix, so we have bits of one, then another. The problem is that Kubric is such a powerful cinematic thinker that even dead he overpowers Spielberg, even though poor Stephen is doing all the work. The editing is poor here, but shortening the film would make the jarring shifts in world-views more apparent. Incidentally, in 200 years, we have evolved AI, but our computers and screens are the same as now? And doorknobs and roads and food and beds and clothes (even including those neck labels)? Even pills are the same? At the demo derby there aren't more clever ways of destruction (probably the single most innovative sector of industry)?Osment is interesting in playing a machine that plays a child. But Law uses a completely different, radically different acting approach to portraying a robot. David's basic mechanism is supposed to be the same, but these guys are in different movies. Francis O'Conner did the best acting; she did a superb job in "Mansfield Park" too. Someone to watch.I think the boss must have known he was in trouble. At about the third false ending, the kid is trapped by a falling ferris wheel oddly reminiscent of his biggest (until now) failure, 1941. This isn't bold filmmaking, it is incompetent filmmaking because Spielberg tried to do something that wasn't simple and wasn't up to it. "Hook" was a competent execution of an odd view, just that the odd view didn't connect with viewers. It is a better film than this one which never finds its world.I've been in AI for 30 years now. The term is obsolete now as the various factions coalesce around different theories and goals. In fact, the notion behind this film is from the 70s, in scientific terms placing this at the Jules Verne level. The notion of a single scientist working essentially alone always was a film conceit, and seems to here be reference to Bladerunner which itself referenced Frankenstein. That also puts the film in a quaint distant past.A strong theory now has it that emotions may be the among the FIRST basic capabilities required to adaptively learn and support abstract reasoning, and that the human model of reasoning is clearly not a superior option.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Fast Forward' is a great help</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>W.C. Fields is oft quoted as having said "Anyone who hates children and dogs can't be all bad." In this film, Stanley Kubrick leaves dogs alone, but does a great job of trashing children, shades of his own unhappy childhood, perhaps? If you have to watch this, and have the good fortune to do so on video, the 'fast forward' button can reduce the amount of gratuitous hatred and violence. Trying to outdo "Clockwork Orange," or reset it with children? There were four parts in the first half that persuaded my wife to quit watching altogether, and myself to watch the second half almost entirely in fast forward: 1. The hatred of the 'real' Martin for the 'mecha' David 2. The 'Snow White' scene where the mother abandons David in the woods. 3. The subsequent meeting with the homeless 'mechas' 4. The subsequent cruelty and violence at the 'Flesh Fair.' There seem to be enough news stories of parents who hate their own children to the point of seriously injuring or killing them, and raw unshakable hatred in many parts of the world, paying to watch it for 'entertainment' was for us, pointless. Perhaps if the four points above had not been immediately sequential, this film would have been less horrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a promising 20 minutes I was lead to one of the most disappointing cinema experiences I've had in a long time. The only other movies in which expectation has been replaced by utter disappointment being Batman and Robin and Blair Witch 2 both of which didn't even have a promising 20 minutes. The plot meandered backwards and forwards from one unbelievable situation to another even more unlikely situation. During the final minutes I could actually have believed that a different film was being shown, which was even more ludicrous than the previous one. Why oh why were stereotypical looking aliens with televisions in their heads waxing lyrical about the wonders of humanity when the evidence of our own fall, at our own hands no less was frozen in the ice all about them. Spielberg runied a good premise with his usual overdose of saccharin, Kubrick must have turned in his grave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI could have been a thought-provoking movie about the moral dilemma of programming robots to think, feel physical pain and experience human emotion, but not giving them the same rights as living individuals. But instead it was a long, boring movie with David crying for the affection and attention of his "mother" (for whom he had been programmed to feel love.) **SPOILER** AI should have ended about twenty minutes before it did. The already too-long movie did not benefit from that ridiculous Spielberg ending where Aliens (of course!) come and rescue David and Teddy from the ocean floor, to reveal that it is possible to give life to his mother (from DNA from a clipping of her hair) but that she would only last one day. Was this added on to be a genuinely heartfelt moment where all of David's sadness and tears are alleviated because he gets to spend twelve hours with a mother who for some reason will remember and love David, but forget she had a son and husband, when she is brought to life? Or is it a cheesy ending tacked on as an excuse for Spielberg to throw some aliens in the mix and try to get the audience to cry so they will walk away thinking that it was a fabulous, heart-wrenching movie (and forget about the three hours it took to get there)? The movie had some interesting effects, and Jude Law's character was fun, but on the whole, I thought it was a long, boring movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I.= Almost Intelligent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:What do you get when you mix two of the greatest visual geniuses but one is a penetrating misanthropist and the other a ten year old boy in a man's body? A pastiche of antithetical images and themes all blended together to make a truly illogical, self contradictory mess. I understand Stanley was dying of pneumonia and needed someone to complete his work but Spielberg? Are you kidding me? I own all of Kubrick's films and let me tell you how well I know his work. Here are Kubrick's scene's; The cruelty to David by the natural brat, the swimming party, the Flesh Farm, mom dumping David out in the woods like a sack of garbage, these are Stanley Kubrick. What is Steven Spielberg? The maudlin, syrupy ending, the whole blue fairy plot that drags on for ad infinitum. The bonding of Law and David, these are Stevie's. Now what happens is the film does not work for either group. For families, they will be put off by the cruel Flesh Farm, the abandonment and the other trademark Kubrickian dark views of human nature. Intellectuals, like myself, are put to sleep with the eternal blue fairy quest, Law and Davis perambulating about chatting and aimlessly wandering and the gooey ending.The tones mixed together could not be more disparate. Yes, Steven rivals Stanley for visual skills, unfortunately, philosophically, he could not be more alien. It would be like Ridley Scott doing half of Gladiator then hiring Walt Disney to do the other half, how do you think that would go? Thematically, David is programmed to adore that reptile mother who left him out in the woods and drove off. Viewers simply cannot identify or share David's adoration of that beastly mother and it ends up boring us to tears. The quest drags on and on. This is really where you can see glimpses of the great Kubrick movie that might have been if he hadn't died. String together the cruelty towards David, the Pool nastiness, his abandonment and the Flesh Farm; do you see where Stanley was going with this? It is utterly covered with Spielberg's syrup that has to be vacuumed away. The ending, the eternal friendship of Law and David, the psychotic attachment of David to his evil mother is completely antithetical to what Stanley is trying to say about human nature and how it would treat A.I.The answer he was working on mirrors Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove and 2001. The canyon between our beliefs about our nature and its actual contents. This is what he was building until he got deathly sick and made the mistake of turning his movie over to a man whose visual genius is equaled only by his psychological regression to a little boy who wants his mommy. Yes, it has many good parts still buried within it but it is such a mess of conflicting themes: Spielbergian Regression and Kubrickian Misanthropy: it is beyond salvage. It is exactly how it appears: Put E.T. and 2001 in a blender, this is what you get. An incoherent mass of opposing philosophies residing in the same movie. A and ~A Non Sequitur Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One or two nice bits, but ultimately disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSFor years up until the death of Stanley Kubrick, one of his best friends was fellow director Steven Spielberg. Following the death of Kubrick, it was Spielberg who ended up directing Kubrick's idea of the links between humanity and artificial intelligence. This film "A.I." or "Artificial Intelligence" was released in 2001 and whilst it had some beautiful ideas and potential, ultimately this film was disappointing.When Monica (Frances O'Connor) and Henry (Sam Robards) Swinton's son Martin is ill and cryogenically frozen, it is through the wonders of modern technology that they are presented with David (Haley Joel Osment), an artificial child to give their love. Eventually upon the healing of Martin, a decision is made regarding David and David is forced, with his Teddy, to search the world looking for a blue fairy and a chance to become a real boy.In "Artificial Intelligence", the modern moral dilemmas regarding artificial lifeforms is brought to the forefront. With terrified humans killing the robots they fear so much, we are shown the typical fear that we will become obsolete. On the other side of the equation we are also presented with people like Professor Allen Hobby (William Hurt) who creates David and who believes in the benefits of artificial lifeforms. This typical argument between the scientist and the religious is brilliantly shown in this film and is one of the few highlights.Aside from the discussion of the benefits and flaws of artificial intelligence, this film should be a beautiful piece of cinema, but sadly it just doesn't click. Whilst during the middle of the film, David's adventures with fellow artificial life form Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) are actually quite enjoyable. The problems with this film are it's beginning and it's end.At the start of this feature, David begins without emotion and as a result is positively disturbing, resembling more a demon child than a loving child. This drags slightly and never really gets going. It is only after David's abandonment by his mother that the film kicks into gear.Skipping however long it might be, the ending of this film is worse than the beginning. Without giving too much away, when watching "Artificial Intelligence", it feels like Spielberg has tried to simply extend the run time when it isn't necessary. For the last thirty minutes, so many viewers sit in agony just waiting for the film to finish. There are one or two clever points in which the film could be finished and it could be quite a satisfactory conclusion, unfortunately, the film isn't finished at this moment and by the end the viewer is left feeling less satisfied and more disappointed.It's hard to understand aspects of the logic behind this film and why certain things happen as they do. What is even harder to understand is the logic behind including the final thirty minutes. If Spielberg had ended this film when he should have, "Artificial Intelligence" could potentially be up there in the top films of all time. Sadly, due to the excruciating ending, "Artificial Intelligence" ends up as an almost ran which had potential but ultimately failed. If there is ever a shorter edit created of this film, watch that. If not though, it's probably worth avoiding, simply because you'll hate Spielberg for running it's potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bump in Steven's career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie was first released, I had a very high interest in watching it. Seeing the trailer made me wonder what the hell this movie was about. I was not allowed to view it, and now I think I know why. I am a much older and more mature person and an experienced movie critic; hence why I am writing this review. The history or origin of this movie goes back quite a bit. Stanley Kubrick was working on this idea for decades and collaborated with Steven Spielberg to try and get the storyline straight. He worked tirelessly to develop the ultimate screenplay. Unfortunately, he passed on before he was able to bring his vision to the screen. Steven then decided to take Kubrick's script and completely disregard it. He re-wrote it his way and made this his movie. Apparently the content of Kubrick's script was too vulgar and pretentious. The result was this movie. I have several problems with this movie. For me there were very few redeeming qualities, and I can say now that I have actually seen it, that I would like to see the version Kubrick would have made. Kubrick and Spielberg are vastly different filmmakers so I'm sure the significance would have been impeccable. The movie has an extremely slow pace that drags the movie out to the point that you swear the film is at least another hour in length and that you've been tricked into seeing a longer movie. The story was also taken into the wrong direction in my opinion. A story like this can be told in many different ways, and this was not a very appealing movie to watch. The acting was not good and I felt little sympathy for anyone. The only scene that worked for me was the last scene. The only character I really liked believe it or not was the teddy bear. The movie went from one extreme to the next and the alternate universes that Steven explored made no real logical sense to me. I found several places where this film could have ended. Either way, none of my questions were answered and several characters were more or less left in the dark and never seen or heard from again even though their part could have been extended. I do not plan on ever seeing this movie again simply because I found it a chore to watch the first time around. Steven Spielberg has made a number of films in his career, and sadly this one is not the one he will be remembered for. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, however, if you do find yourself with 2hrs and 30min to spare then by all means watch something, just not this.</fullReview>

Is being human inhumanely destroying conscious machines? Humans being inhuman to themselves --- unable to accept death? Humans trying to make perfect artificial human like beings?I am impressed by how much Stanley Kubrick touches this film actually made by Spielberg.

		<shortDescription>One of the worst Spielberg Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg has written some great movies in the past such as Close Encounters and Schindler's List, but this is not one of them. I never came out of a movie feeling so depressed as I did from this one since I saw "Soylent Green" (one of the sickest SF films I have ever seen) a couple of decades ago. Even the terrible "Soldier" with Kurt Russell wasn't this bad. And I am a die-hard SF fan !!Spielberg can't seem to go beyond the clich characterizations of adults being totally dysfunctional in their relationships with each other, and with their environment. For example, fathers are always irresponsible, absent, or distant. The children always seem to be in some dream world existence (e.g. "Poltergeist", "E.T."). (By the way, I thought "E.T." was a great movie). One could possibly consider "A.I" to be some synthesis of Pinnochio with E.T. Beyond that, there seems to be nothing to redeem this film, because as things turn out, people in the film seem to be totally unredeemable.On the subject of machine intelligence, "2001: A Space Odyssey", "Android", "Collosus: The Forbin Project", "Star Wars", and "Creation of the Humanoids", (all top-notch, excellent movies) treat the subject with much more sophistication and, well, intelligence. This movie "A.I" has no real scientific foundation at all. The story of a thinking, feeling android searching for love through the centuries never finding it leaves one with a deep feeling of sadness, if not depression.The only redeeming aspect of this movie is Osment's acting.Dan Basinger</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My two cents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot has been said about Spielberg's AI and there are numerous points that will certainly be debated about for a long time. It strikes me as another one of those 'love it or hate it' type movies (another good example is Fight Club, although the 'loved it-hated it' split tends to be more along the lines of gender). My own take? When I saw it for the first time, I found it to be profoundly moving and immensely watchable, largely as a result of its rich atmosphere and excellently acted-out characters. The only thing I found problematic was the ending, which (without giving away anything) I felt to be weird and a bit dragged-out.The second viewing changed my perception of the film. I found it to be even more poignant and entertaining and the ending, though still weird, did not trouble me as it had in the first viewing. AI's greatest strength is that it gets philosophical about the human/robot issue and this is done wonderfully by Mr. Spielberg in such a way that it doesn't seem too insignificant to the film nor too over-the-top. It argues about issues that you yourself will start pondering about endlessly. The technical aspect of the film is top-notch. Editing, cinematography, set design and the awesome special effects work together under the masterful coordination of the director to give the film an even greater effect. As I have already mentioned, the actors all perform outstandingly and there are more than a few undeserved oscar misses.What most people might hate about the film is that it doesn't really give any answers to the issues it raises. The ambivalent nature of the film towards itself is not something for all tastes but in my opinion, had AI solidly put its foot down and provided firm answers, it would not have been as striking or profound.Lastly: the ending. I'll give a SPOILER ALERT just in case the guys in charge blacklist me but I'll try not to give anything away. On the two occasions when I saw AI, I found the ending to be open enough to be left up to the my own interpretation. I'm aware of a very popular interpretation that most people have of the ending but I don't agree with it because a)it seems too whimsical and b)the tone of the film at the end, though sentimental and sad, doesn't really seem to suggest it. I think people just see it that way because they took the narration too literally and didn't want to think it through. With regards to the scenes before the actual ending: I still don't know why a second viewing changed my opinion of the bits before the final scene but they did. That is why I advise a second viewing.So, to anyone who doesn't hate it outright: see it a second time. If you give it another chance like I did it actually might grow into a great movie (I'd rank it as Mr. Spielberg's second best after Schindler's List). Of course, if it makes you hate it even more... well, what can I say?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strange, "ET" made me weep so did "Close Encounters" but I didn't weep in "Schindler's List", where the horrors depicted are devastating and the pain, unbearable. How can I explain that? It's not just me, discussing the subject with friends we were all in agreement, a situation more unique than rare, the only in disagreement was a friend from Aberdeen, she cried in "Schindler's List" from beginning to end, but she doesn't count, she also cried in "Zoolander". So the mystery persists. Steven Spielberg, the most commercially successful movie director of the last 30 years, has touched and ventured into different genres with the uttermost confidence. His most artistically, emotionally and financially successful movies are the ones that appeal to a child's imagination. The child in all of us. So, why is it that "Artificial Intelligence", with a child, and what a child, at the centre of the story, is so cold, so confused, so unsuccessful. I think, I suspect, I imagine that it has to do with intellect. Spielberg is an anti intellectual. When he feels we feel when he thinks we don't feel anything. The boy's need for his mother's love could have been the definitive Spielberg movie. Instead, is as if he was telling us the story against his will. The scene in which the mother has to abandon his robot son, could have been unforgettable, instead, a lot of acting in a Disney like little forest. That's also the end of the movie. It is followed by a second feature that should be called "Mad Max meets Dr.Who" with a splendid Jude Law. I went to see the film at the first matine on its opening day. I left the theatre kind of depressed, not sad, depressed. I was reminded of it today because my friend from Aberdeen had rented the DVD, she was watching it and of course, she was crying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The very essence of being human</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Spielberg's work and though nowadays he is often criticised for his shamelessly tear-jerking sentimentalism, I've never seen that as a problem. It's just a sign of the times, I guess, people leaning towards dark, disturbing, gritty movies and being way too harsh with emotionally charged ones. I personally feel if a movie like A.I. does not move you to your very last cells, then something is deeply wrong with your human capacities.A.I. is a real tear-jerker, in the best possible sense. Spielberg has always had exceptional skills in eliciting great performances from child actors but what Haley Joel Osment does here is simply amazing. For me, it's right up there with the very best performances in the history of cinema. But Frances O' Connor, Jude Law and William Hurt give equally strong performances, as well.Visually, Spielberg superbly recreates Kubrick's idiosyncratic style, especially in the first third of the movie. From lighting and camera angles (Janusz Kaminski's outstanding cinematography, his best to date) through the ominous atmosphere created by John Williams's perfect score (one of his very best, as well) to Kubrick's trademark, highly symmetrical framing, it really feels like watching a Kubrick picture.Curiously, I am not really fond of the second act (the Flesh Fair scene and Dr. Know), but the rest is so strong that I tend to forgive and forget. The visual effects are just jaw-droppingly flawless. I'd easily say they still haven't been matched in any film. But it's ultimately the sheer emotional power that makes A.I. one of the best SF movies ever made. For me, it is Spielberg's greatest film and an all-time Top 10 contender, in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoilersIt's not really a popcorn flick. It's worth noting that cuz a lot of the negative reviews seem to come from people disappointed by the film's slow pace and (often needless) expository chatter. (Then again, with all the reviews referring to the aliens at the end, I can't help but conclude that Spielberg is right - people do need to have everything spelled out, hammered home and repeated.)First act - interesting. Spielberg introduces a robot boy into a vaguely sympathetic family. Camerawork and great acting on the part of Osment succeed in keeping the whole thing uncanny. Lotsa interesting themes are set in motion, including a particularly brutal Kubrickian one that says that Gods owe nothing to their creations.Then David gets dumped in the woods and the movie lurches between audaciously good elements and some annoying self-indulgence. Spielberg begins beating the Pinocchio theme like a gong and vast set pieces are introduced that don't add up to much. The rather long trip to the red light district seems to contribute little to the story beyond redirecting the group to Manhattan. Also, sometimes Spielberg uses sets and fx a little too much. There were just too many shots of sadists revving dorky motorcycles at the Flesh Fair and the exquisite moon blimp got to seem ordinary after a while. Losing and then reuniting with Teddy Bear and Gigolo Joe seemed to eat up time needlessly. And there was far too much expository dialogue as well as a Capt. Obvious voiceover narrator. "Hi Jude Law! Bye Jude Law!" His very likeable character filled an interesting niche (nonthreatening male, surrogate family) but his on-the-run subplot went nowhere.Even with those complaints, I found the middle section of the film impossible to look away from. The climax walking through Gepeto's workshop was nice. The mech junk pile and moonrise was riveting. I was unreservedly thrilled by every choice in art direction. The direct way Spielberg handled the essentially Oedipal hangup of his hero was touching.Then there's the cornball brain-damaged ending. All I can say is DANG, THAT SUCKED! Except for conceding that the kid was only really interested in feeling wanted, the ending dropped or ignored almost every theme and sentiment established in the previous two hours. Also, I had a hard time believing that the Flesh Fair audience would be so completely offended by the idea of killing David.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie trying to get out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. is a difficult film. Some of it is brilliant, while some is dire.The acting - Haley Joel Osment as David the mecha (robot) boy is superb. He plays the role with such intelligence and maturity - it's a real achievement and bodes well for his future (if he can avoid hitting the self destruct button like so many other child stars.) Jude Law puts in another solid performance as 'Gigolo Joe' the mecha prostitute. In a similar vein to his previous roles in Gattaca and eXistenZ, he's quirky and somehow detached from reality - it works brilliantly. He's rapidly turning into one of my favourite actors. "Hey Joe - Waddya know?"The rest of the cast is very good but doesn't shine, perhaps because their characters were treated lightly and not fully explored. Overall though - good performances by all.The sets , costumes and special effects are of a very high standard. Until the last 30 minutes or so, the use of computer graphics is tastefully done and never feel like an excuse to wow the audience with some clever CGI. The scenes at the Flesh Fair (a kind of rock concert where mecha are destroyed for the entertainment of spectators) are powerful, visceral and in your face. The flying and underwater scenes were also very well handled, although not mind blowing. Now the downside, and it's a big downside. The plot is incredibly disjointed. I didn't expect it to be so obvious that this movie had been directed by two different people and thought Spielberg to be more subtle. There was apparently little attempt by Spielberg to blend his parts of the movie with Kubrick's to create a coherent whole. Instead what we get is a wonderfully dark first 60-90 minutes and then something reminiscent of 'Close Encounters of the E.T. kind' tacked on to make us feel good. As a result, the feel of the film quickly evaporated into a mush. There were a couple of chances to end the movie earlier (notably at the end of the underwater section) and it was a mistake to take the movie beyond these points. The poignancy is lost with repeated attempts to extend and explain the story in unnecessary ways, the scene with David's mother towards the end being especially contrived and saccharin. The sum up, this felt like two movies in one - an intelligent, dark and fascinating film mixed one that's formulaic, sentimental and cheesy. Because of this it fails to reach the promised heights and at times feels messy. It's ultimately unsatisfying and left me very disappointed, but not because it's bad, but rather because I expected so much more. As many others have said, I can't help wondering what heights it would have reached if Kubrick hadn't passed away.An interesting film, but rent it first as it's not for everyone. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An artificial dud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was nothing intelligent about this artificial movie. One point most movie critics and I agree on with this movie, "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" is unlike any other Steven Spielberg because he has not directed a film this awful in a very long time.I was shocked to see such a wonderful concept and premise wasted with a story I saw just a few years ago with the release of "Bicentennial Man." Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Sam Robards and William Hurt give their best effort in their respective roles; however, nobody could save the movie from the disastrous script the cast was given by the writers.I have always maintained that bigger is not always better. In the movie that Spielberg inherited following the death of Stanley Kubrick, this statement seems to be true. There has been a tremendous amount of hype surrounding "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" because it was supposed to be directed by Kubrick. "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" have taught me two very important lessons: never believe the hype of a film and always go with your instincts when deciding whether the movie was good or bad.Spielberg has a knack for turning movies into magic when directing films, so it came as a shock to me when I realized "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" is a film without emotion, structure and intelligence. It took me 20 minutes to tell myself this was a disappointment because all of the excitement and joy drained the life out of the movie leaving Spielberg to rely on the special effects to save the rest of "A.I. Artificial Intelligence."Osment follows his breakthrough role in "The Sixth Sense" as David, an eleven-year old android who takes an emotional journey to see if the love he gives his family is returned. Under the direction of Professor Hobby, played by Hurt, David is part of an experiment to create android children for families to love. Robards and O'Connor play parents who take David. Osment will become a huge superstar in Hollywood, but with his role as David, he won't accomplish this achievement.Hurt, Robards and O'Connor were among the only bright spots in "A.I. Artificial Intelligence." Their roles were the light I was looking for in the dark world of this movie. These three actors were responsible for bringing integrity, honesty and genuine emotion. It is refreshing to see actors bring characteristics like this to a role because it truly shows the range of talent they possess; however, "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" was the wrong decision for them to make as well intentioned the movie planned to be.The biggest problem I had with "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" was the urgency to care about David or any of the other characters in the film. For example, Gigolo Joe, played by Law, had no reason to be placed in a film like this because he didn't fit in with the storyline. Furthermore, there was no pizzazz or flash that stood out and made a statement that this is the film to see. One thing I have noticed with awful films was the endings were always better than the previous 120 minutes. This is true with "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" because the most interesting scene came at the end. "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" never seemed to get on track with one major theme. For example, it jumped from storyline to storyline without clear and complete explanation. I reached my tolerance limit early on in the movie, so when the movie was over; I was relieved and couldn't wait to get home.Despite my hatred for "A.I. Artificial Intelligence," I must give Spielberg credit for bringing some enjoyment to the film. For example, Hurt's role as Professor Hobby stood out because he was the only actor that seemed to be genuine to the role, roles as mother and father put Robards and O'Connor on my favorites list, promising premise surrounding the film as well as the start and finish of the film were the only aspects of the movie that stood out from the rest of the movie."A.I. Artificial Intelligence" contains heart and spirit and I can understand how people may enjoy this movie; however, Spielberg failed to capitalize on the golden opportunity handed to him by Kubrick, "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" is a shallow and empty movie, which was made several years ago with Robin Williams. With their heart and spirit misplaced, my only advice about "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" is watch at your own risk because it may not be anything you hoped it would be.</fullReview>

There's something to be said about that.But having said that, I thought it was a great film. Sure, it has its "issues;" but the premise is a good one, the acting smooth, it has some great special effects, and the plot keeps moving. Sure, it almost seems like it switches gears about halfway through, at which point the action picks up quite a bit; but throughout it is a very intellectually deep movie and anyone looking for thoughtless entertainment will be put off by it!

		<fullReview>I could possibly agree that this movie is worth watching only if you can truly argue your point of view to convince me. i am tempted to follow the example and just say that the "movie is s**t" or something along those lines but that is hardly fair to the people who invested their time and their money to bring their view onto the big screen for us to watch.The movie doesn't really cover the issue of morality very well. (and that is the main theme of this film, or at least it should be) The beginning is very good, showing the contrasts between humans and machines leading the viewer to the conclusion that the movie would be about the moral issues surrounding the creation of the robots.But once we get past the point where the mother abandons the robot child, the film spirals down into just following the child around. There is no further portrayal of the immorality of abandonment. They really should have made the mother pay or at least squeezed it into the plot somehow, instead of focusing on a happy ending in which everything becomes far fetched to a point of ridiculousness.Yes i am aware it is science fiction, but even fiction needs to be believable and the ending is too perfect for such a heavy theme. I truly felt that i was suddenly thrown into a children's story, the kind my brother watches where the main character lives happily ever after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew little about this film before seeing it on cable - I can now safely say it was two-and-a-half hours of my life I will never get back.A.I is at times almost embarrassingly inept and hopelessly over-sentimental throughout. Osment, as with all child actors, is entertaining enough in a supporting role but grates over the course of an entire movie, though that's the least of this film's problems. The major talking points of the plot have already been eloquently discussed in the far-superior Blade Runner, which this film at times shamelessly apes, even in the stylistic detail of vehicles and buildings. Things deteriorate quickly - what starts out as a vaguely interesting sci-fi proposition soon mutates into a futuristic road movie ruined by Jude Law's characteristic over-acting, before a final 40-odd minutes of such cloying sentimentality and pointlessness (witness, for example, the "aliens" - need I say more?) that most discerning movie-goers will have lost the will to live.With an unlimited budget and a free rein, most big-name producers let themselves down and Spielberg has done so here. I'm not ashamed to say that by the finale I was actively hoping a grisly end would befall the lead character, as it would have provided the only genuine entertainment on offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard so many bad critics about this movie that I thought I would just see a barely enjoyable Sci-Fi movie about robots that could be just as bad as a bad Spielberg movie. Well, I was ready for something like The Millenium Man.Surprise... The movie is a very good Sci-Fi flick, with an intelligent story line, good acting and great special effects used with efficiency.Haley Joel Osment is not giving a performance as good as in the Sixth Sense but he sure confirms he knows how to act and understands the script (something not every child actor does). Jude Law is truly amazing in his character and William Hurt just being the usual William Hurt (he reminded me a lot of the character he played in Until the End of the World).The story line has lots of good ideas. It takes you on a 2 hours and 20 minutes journey in a grim and dark vision of the future with a smart transposition of old themes: "Do robots dream of electric sheep?", Pinocchio, rejection of the different - well, the last one is Spielbergian, ain't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A two-sided film that surprisingly works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick films have always creeped me out, so I had to endure the long wait for the DVD/VHS release. I didn't want to see this in the theater, but now I wish I had. This is definitely not another "A Clockwork Orange" or "The Shining", which is a good thing for me. If you're looking for horror, you won't find it in "A.I." It's a sci-fi/fantasy fairy-tale story, complete with storybook-like narration. If you're a hard-core Kubrick fan, you might be disappointed by the saccharine nature of the film. But if you're a Spielberg fan, you'll probably enjoy the experience. The acting is top-notch and the visuals are incredible. The DVD is worth buying for its extras alone. I'd recommend this movie for sensitive viewers who want to see the excitement of an intelligent, dark film, minus the gore and violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be wonderful. I compare it to a combination of Mission To Mars with the aliens, Bicentennial man with the use of the robots, and 2001 A Space Odyssey with the feeling that you are left with afterwards. It almost seems to be a reproduction of the fairy tale Pinocchio with today's standards of the future. The teddy bear that went everywhere with David represented Jiminy Cricket. David represented Pinocchio. The Swintons represented the old man that created Pinocchio. And Martin played the part of all the other boys that Pinocchio wanted to be like. It is an enchanting tale of a "boy" who explores he realm to find his true desire, his mother's love. Yet there is so much happening in the movie, in order to enjoy the movie you need to go see it with an open mind and imagination. Credit must be given to both Spielberg and Kubick for creating such a wonderful story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. is a perfect example of negative criticism born from expectations based on assumption or ignorance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's right, Steven Spielberg is back. He has taken it upon himself to helm the story started years and years ago by the late Stanley Kubrick, and Kubrick's influence is strikingly clear, especially late in the film. A lot of people were put off by A.I., but this is because they expected a cute kids movie, something in the tradition of E.T. I don't know, maybe it's the fact that both movies have initials in the titles that caused this association. Spielberg is no stranger to dark content. I don't think I need to take the time to explain the content of much of Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List or even pars of Jurassic Park. Before I saw A.I., I read that Spielberg described the tone as what you would get if E.T. had been killed and dissected by the scientists, or if he had never recovered from that mysterious disease. This is a surprisingly accurate description of what you get with the film, so be warned! Don't come out disappointed because of false expectations, as I'm sure is the case with soccer moms around the world. The other thing that people are likely to criticize A.I. for is the almost uncomfortable closeness with which the film parallels the Pinocchio story in many ways. Sure it does that, but it never pretends that it doesn't. On the other hand, you have to keep in mind that this is also a tremendously different version of the Pinocchio story. This is not the story of a puppet, made for entertainment, miraculously attaining consciousness and emotions and wanting to be a real boy, it's the story of a hugely advanced artificially intelligent robot, created to love and comfort humans, attaining consciousness and emotions and wanting to be a real boy.(spoilers) The thing to remember here is the extent to which reality was considered when creating a film with such a fantastical premise. Sure, this is science fiction, but one of the greatest pitfalls of the sci fi genre is the excessive dismissal of reality. In A.I., everything that can go wrong, does go wrong, and it's a good thing, because that's life. Monica decides to keep little David (Osment), but then her real son comes out of his coma, which no one expected. Needless to say, all sorts of complications come as a result. Martin (Monica's son) treats David with all of the inhumanity and cruelty as he would treat any lifeless toy. He has no respect for David's feelings, and while this does not seem to bother David, it does have an impact on the development of his emotions. Later on, we find out how hated these androids are by real humans, we see them destroyed, we see them rotting in dumps filled with sickening body parts, where damaged and mutilated robots wander, in search of replacement parts.This is not a perfect futuristic world, although it is a lot cleaner and more optimistic than the future presented in the majority of science fiction films. The emphasis here is not placed on making everyone happy. You won't walk away from the film with a contented smile on your face, everything does not go as planned, and no one lives happily ever after. In fact, the end of the film runs the risk of ruining the rest of it, the way the end of Mission to Mars absolutely wrecked what was otherwise a decent sci fi film. The unimaginably advanced machines of 2000 years in the future are at first frighteningly disappointing, but also strangely beautiful (they look like machinery encased in flawless glass...) and not entirely beyond reason. They may have been a little too computer animated, but they ultimately served their purpose well. Haley Joel Osment gives a stunning performance as David, he even surpasses his excellent performance in the great film The Sixth Sense. Haley Joel is on his way to big things. The special effects were spectacular, both with all of the machines as well as the scenery and also the little things, like the great character Teddy. Teddy was a much better character than Wilson in Cast Away, by the way. And Jude Law gave a strangely refreshing performance as Gigolo Joe, the lover robot who also ends up inadvertently as David's fortunate sidekick. With A.I., Steven Spielberg has taken his uncanny ability to please huge numbers of people and mixed it with Stanley Kubrick's uncanny ability to perplex huge numbers of people, and the result is a tremendously pleasing film that unfortunately went completely misunderstood by a substantial portion of the audience. There can be no mistake about the quality of this movie, but the subject matter is something that today's spoiled audiences are not likely to swallow too easily. Modern cinema is so sugar coated and drab that people just can't take it when a little robot boy spends 2000 years in a stolen police helicopter at the bottom of the ocean, pleading to a lifeless statue to make him into a real boy. If you just can't stand not having a bright side, consider the fact that if she had made him real, he would have died. The movie ends in death, but it is a desired death. It is a rest for a robot who has searched for closure for all those years, much like what was seen in the far inferior Bicentennial Man. If you hated the movie, I'm sorry to hear it, but I can say with reasonable certainty that it's because you didn't understand it or you had unjustifiable expectations. Watch it again with an open mind, and enjoy this excellent film for what it is. Steven Spielberg was obviously not concerned with making everyone happy when he wrote the screenplay for A.I., he was concerned with telling a good story, and that's exactly what he did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw AI today, and let me tell you, it was breathtaking. Steven Speilberg is truly a brilliant director, and this masterpiece just proves it once again. The movie is completely original, like nothing I have ever seen before. It sends you on an emotional rollercoaster. At one point you want to laugh, the next you want to cry, then you are frightened, then you are all warm and tingly. This movie, from beginning to end, is a classic. It is one that gives you this deep chill that I have never felt before from a movie. It makes you truly forget everything and everyone, and think of nothing but the film. If you were to see one movie this year, it should be this. I can smell Oscars for Haley, Speilberg, score, SFX, and Best Picture. I know it will win best picture, because I cannot imagine a film that could be better. Hate to say it, but it is better that last years winner, Gladiator. So, to close up my review...the movie is amazing. I would like to thank the brilliant Mr. Speilberg for giving us all this film. You know what you saw was amazing, when the screen goes to black, and the credits roll, and there is this eerie silence in the theater. No one moved, no one talked. Just silence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg does sci-fi in the style of Stanley Kubrick, and the result is an intensely original and fascinating movie that seamlessly blends the best attributes of both.Spielberg's penchant for maudlin sentimentality is kept in check by Kubrick's clinical distance, while Kubrick's lack of humanity is tempered by Spielberg's warmth. The final product, about a little boy (albeit a robotic one) searching for a parent figure in a world full of things and people who want to hurt him, is mesmerizing. The final 20 minutes or so made my heart literally ache, but in a way that for once didn't make me feel cheaply manipulated.Haley Joel Osment gives an astonishing performance as the little boy, and Jude Law, as a robot gigolo, and Frances O'Connor, as Osment's human "mother," do terrific work in supporting roles.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I is, in my own honest opinion, Steven Spielberg's best film of the decade (to date)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I is, in my own honest opinion, Steven Spielberg's best film of the decade (to date). The master director crafted a haunting vision of alien invasion in War of the Worlds, a gripping tale of futuristic moral dilemmas in Minority Report; but only in A.I. did he manage to cream all these into one epic tale that included both over the top visual effects, as well as engaging characters and a sentimental story of family and love. Granted, this is still Spielberg and we are dealing with unconventional robot love, but still, I bet he'd rather we all think of it as a 21st century Pinnochio if anything else.A.I. places us sometime in the not-so-distant future, where humans create realistic and highly advanced robots (mechas) to serve them. David (Haley Joel Osmont from The Sixth Sense fame, in his last big role before disappearing into oblivion) is a child-robot, who is designed to give his undivided love to his adopting mother, Monica (Frances O'Connor), who decides, with her husband, to take him into their home after their biological son Martin turns ill. When Martin returns, he decides to get rid of his android brother, whose robotic programming isn't all that fit to deal with sibling rivalry. When an unfortunate sequence of events make David unwillingly hurt the ones he is programmed to love, Monica gets rid of him in one of the most heartbreaking scenes I can remember. But David is determined to win back his mother's love, and since that's what he's programmed to do, he goes out on a quest to find the Blue Fairy, after he learns of her ability to turn him into a real child (and there's Pinnochio again, for those who lost count). David's journey is a destructive one, since it takes him into the darker realms of this alternate future. In this world, humans eliminate obsolete robot in horrific "flesh fairs", and even his faithful robot-teddy bear, Teddy (one of the cutest special effects I've ever seen), can't always talk sense into him.Even though the film demonstrates the corruption of human ethics in the future, it portrays David as a pure and gentle spirit, much more human and humane than most of the habitants he encounters on his journey. Jude Law shines in his supporting role as Gigolo Joe, the charming escort robot who, like David, fights for survival while developing emotions he was never supposed to have.I remember watching A.I in theaters shortly after 9/11, and the thing I found most ironic about it was that with all the apocalyptic nature of the film, we still get to see the World Trade Center 200 years in the future; teaching us that sometimes reality can be far harsher than what we may expect even in our darkest dreams. Despite the overlong ending that bothered me in War of the Worlds as well, A.I. is nothing less than an impeccable and disturbing vision of what our future might look like, if we don't wake up fast. It also demonstrates the length a child might go through to win back his mother's love, a worldwide theme anyone can relate to.</fullReview>

He has made us cry with "ET," "Saving Private Ryan," and "Always." He has even depressed us with "Schindler's List," and again, "Saving Private Ryan." He has never given us all of those emotions at once in one movie until now. "A.I." was the best movie of the entire summer of 2001. The movie was one long emotional roller coaster ride and it was well worth the seven bucks admission for the night show. How this movie didn't make more than 78 million dollars is beyond me.

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** A.I. is one of the most fascinating, complex and poetic films I've seen in my whole life. I still cannot understand why this brilliant film got just $80 million at the U.S. box office while the stupid "Tomb Raider" managed to collect $131 million. I've been reading many complaints about A.I. in this site and I'd like the comment briefly on some of them:1) "The film is more Spielberg's than Kubrick's." WRONG! I believe A.I. is pure Kubrick, right to the very end. I wonder if the ones who said that really know Kubrick's films.2)"It is pointless asking the audience to invest its emotions in a robot, because a robot is not real." WELL...If you believe that, don't go to the movies either! MOVIES ARE NOT REAL and that is precisely one of the film's subtexts.3)"The ending is lame, sentimental, ludicrous." Hahaha...The ending is, in fact, VERY clever. It is a hoax...to both David and the audience. A hint: In order to get DNA out of hair, you need the root. And no...That wasn't a mistake in Spielberg's screenplay! ;o)4)"The film never answers any question." Of course not. This is an OPEN film. Kubrick worked that way and Spielberg followed suit. You have to do your homework. 5) "That stupid narrator! Spielberg needs to spoonfeed his audience." Kubrick liked to use those "stupid narrators" too. If you don't believe me, check "Barry Lyndon" and "A Clockwork Orange". The narration in A.I. does make sense...if you know who the narrator is. And I'm not talking about Ben Kingsley! ;o)I think that those who dislike the film will never change their minds, even if one analyzes the movie frame by frame for them. I checked imdb's user ratings for A.I. and they are almost identical to those of "Eyes Wide Shut", another misunderstood work of Kubrick. I guess that is the best compliment Spielberg could ever get! Fortunately, those under 20 y.o. seem to enjoy A.I. the most. That is what counts, because they are the critics of the future. The same happened to "2001: A Space Odyssey" 33 years ago.Do not be fooled: A.I. is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David is a robot boy programmed to experience human emotions, after a series of unfortunate home life events he embarks on the ultimate voyage of discovery.Spielberg and Kubrick! Hmm ,well on first glance they appear to be odd bedfellows, but strip away the formers' high concept blockbusters and you can see traits that bring the two giants together. Debate will rage forever about if Spielberg's finished product is in line with what Kubrick had envisaged before sadly passing away to witness what he had asked Spielberg to mould. You can find hundreds of comments and philosophical arguments about the merits of Artificial Intelligence: AI, this site alone has been party to aggressive discussion about its intelligent worth, with the ending alone particularly causing consternation to many. So with that in mind I don't wish to over do my brainiac leanings on this bleak and cold masterpiece, I just wish to jot down my emotional thoughts about how this film makes me feel.I love this film so much, I really do, which considering it leaves me feeling quite desolate, makes it even more of a interesting statement. What Spielberg has done here is take Kubrick's cold eloquent style and fused it with a sort of edgy Pinocchio meets 2001's meaning, this is in short the polar opposite to his own E.T fable. Considering that this story is played out thru a robot child's point of view, the subject matter is shatteringly adult, it resonates with grim violence as it poses many unanswerable questions. What does it mean to be real? Can we replicate ourselves into a synthetic being? And just how close can that being be to being perfect? Love and it's power, where is the cut off point where we can say they are only human traits? You could go quite mad thinking too hard about it, and this is one of Spielbeg's masterstrokes with the picture, he is not here to spoon feed us {those thinking the ending is syrup are seriously misunderstanding it}, he outlays his grim tale and asks us if we dare to ponder these prevalent questions.Hayley Joel Osment is David and it's a hauntingly brilliant show from the youngster, intensely creepy and borderline freaky. David demands empathy as his loving family union comes crashing down around his newly emotive life, and it's here when the film takes a tonal shift that Osment excels. This then brings the excellent Jude Law, as mecha sex robot Gigolo Joe, into David's world, and here the film on the surface goes jaunty, but it's merely a brief diversion from the film's core bleakness and is in fact adding to the head scratching nature of the beast. The visuals are wonderful, from the colour explosion that is Rouge City, to the underwater sequences in the final third, Spielberg not only dazzles with his tools, but also shows that he can fuse CGI with a serious storyline and let them benefit each other. Must give a nod of approval to John Williams' score, nominated for an Oscar but not winning, it is however memorable and intensely touching.Artificial Intelligence is not for everyone, I can see quite easily why it is so hotly debated time and time again, but the work on the film is brilliant, almost as brilliant as the dark grim nature of the picture's heart. I firmly believe that in time this film will be revered as a classic, while I'm also convinced that they will dissect it in film studies classes long after I have left this mortal coil. I just know that it's poetically beautiful and that come the end credits I have a multitude of questions in my head and a multitude of tears in my eyes, it's an incredible movie experience. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not science fiction or fact--a fairy tale! CONTAINS A SPOILER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly an amazing film. What seemingly starts off to be a science fiction story about a robot, given human characteristics, turns into a Pinocchio-like fairy tale. I know many critics have blamed this film for doing exactly that: switching gears, as it were, mid-stream. However, I didn't see it that way at all. Knowing beforehand that this was going to be a fairy tale from the beginning made the picture all the more poignant and telling.The filming is superb. The film, I mean the actual visuals, has texture, feeling to it! Each section of the film has a different "feel" to it, making it interesting. From the opening almost Rembrandt-like sepia-toned Operating Room in which a specimen is being examined to the expansive aquamarine, underwater Coney Island scene, this film is incredible visually. The return to the intimate living pod at the end of the film is also breath-taking with its narrator, soothingly wrapping up the story in a happily-ever-after setting is haunting. The set for the living quarters, by the way, is reminiscent of the house in "A Clockwork Orange." So much of this film is suggestive of other Spielberg/Kubrick films. Oh yes, and of course there's that ending, the beings from another planet, Time Beings, whatever! But if you look at it from the fairy tale point of view, every fairy tale has a deus ex machina in it. David thinks it's The Blue Fairy, and in one sense it is, but then because The Blue Fairy is really only a statue, the true "saviors" arrive and he can "live" happily ever after. All of the acting in this film is top notch. Haley Joel Osment is truly remarkable. In the beginning of the film, he captures what being a boy-like robot must be. He has just enough of the "robotic" character and the right mix of boy-like characteristics to be truly convincing in this role. Jude Law is amazing in the role of Gigolo Joe. He has a robotic amorality to him with a touch of Gene Kelly (did the programmers of Gigolo Joe do that intentionally?) that make him interesting and remarkable.This is truly one of the great movies of all time, and it is, indeed, a fine tribute to an incredibly gifted film maker by yet another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great cinematic achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IT HAS to be one of the stranger meldings of cinematic history. Steven Spielberg, the virtuoso of emotional audience manipulation, takes on a project originally conceived by Stanley Kubrick, the auteur of clinical cinema. The result is nothing short of breathtaking. In a waterlogged world where reproduction is restricted, 'mechas', advanced androids, are created to serve and help mankind, Professor Hobby (William Hurt) has a dream to create a robot capable of love. His name is David (Haley Joel Osment), and he is adopted as a test case by a Monica and David (Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards), distraught with their own son cryogenically frozen because of a terminal illness. Initially Monica is horrified - but her instincts to cherish take over and the couple activate the robot's love circuits.David is a strange child - despite his unconditional love, his incomprehension of human emotions is clear. And finally, a series of events lead to the inevitable rift between mother and 'child', and the boy programmed to love is abandoned.From the detached household environment where we start, David now finds himself alone in the world. A world where abandoned mechas scrabble through scrap piles in a ghoulish attempt to replace their own damaged parts, providing some of the film's CGI highlights.. A world of flesh fairs, where disillusioned humans take umbrage at the insult to humanity they see in the prevalence of robots, and 'celebrate' their humanity by rounding up and destroying unlicensed mechas. Coming across the love mecha Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), the pair embark on a quest to help David achieve his humanity, by becoming a real boy - the way he dreams that Monica will come to love him. Cementing his reputation as an acting prodigy with an astounding performance, Osment carries the film. From the cold mechanical personality he shows at the start, David changes almost imperceptively through the film, and it's only near the end it hits home just how much the character has changed. With every mannerism and quirk precisely executed, for any other actor it would be the performance of a lifetime. Spielberg's creation overflows with questions. From the debate of whether humanity is playing God, who created mankind to love him, to the Pinocchio quest of whether it is possible to earn humanity, and the utopian question of whether we create our villains and then punish them for our mistakes. The film's atmosphere is precisely gauged at all times - the dispassionate nature of David's starting home, the Blade Runner qualities of den of iniquity Rouge City, the 2001-reminiscent air of the strange and distinctly Kubrickian closing scenes. Debates will doubtless rage about whether the very ending, where the film finally gives in to a little sentimentality, is in tune with the rest of the film. But it doesn't detract from the fact that this film does what so many these days fail to do - it transports you to a different world, and makes y</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More than four part-movies strung together. Each of them OK but not coherent. Kubrick - Spielberg - Spielberg - Kubrick. Half expecting Haley Joel Osment to say "My God! It's full of stars!"Very disappointed, with Osment's Character being called David, and his talking teddy bear having such an impassive voice, that they missed the chance to have Teddy say "I'm sorry David, I can't do that".I think the movie raises some interesting questions, doesn't always address them, forgets about them for a bit and gives you some brainless mid-'80s future-flick nonsense to watch while you think about them, then comes back with a sentimental tear jerker... the movie resolved three times, each time - oh THAT's not the end? OK so are we going to get a different final message? Answer: yes, three times. Movie violates it's own integrity to deliver a Hollywood resolution at the end. Pity.My verdict? Visually lush, characters fair to good, acting from Osment absolutely fantastic. Shame about the overall composition. Recommended watching if your brain is only half-functioning that day, as was mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strays from its own plot too much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Artificial Intelligence could have been a good movie. It could have even been a great movie. But somewhere along the line it was a little mussed up. I feel that the directors were a little unorganized.Spoilers.Nothing seemed to have to do with anything else. I found the first half of the movie to be utterly boring since it simply showed how David lived and how the family had to get accustomed to his presence. Interesting, but not enough to satisfy an avid movie-goer such as myself.Now the second half was a little better. But it failed to get to the point. David is searching for the "Blue Fairy", sure, but that's a little childish. I mean, great idea, have him search for something that doesn't exist because we will see if a mecha is capable of grief, suffering, and disappointment. But it didn't get into that at all.Instead, we have a few excellent scenes (with some excellent music) of the flesh fair members as they chase down the exiled mechas. I was impressed by some of these scenes, even when David hijacked the police helicopter.But, once again, it strayed too much from the plot. The end is completely wacked out, and not even necessary. We did not need to see what happened two thousand years later. I only wanted to know what would happen when David found the "Blue Fairy", and the movie showed it. But then it dragged on for another twenty minutes in showing that David was finally happy, but couldn't really be happy since he could never be real.Jude Law and Haley Joel Osment are both great actors. However, they could not save this movie. It was a nice idea, but when it came down to it, it flopped by itself. Too much going on, not enough with the plot, and definitely not enough action. I like psychological and scientific movies, but they have to sustain themselves with something more. A.I. failed to do so.I was very disappointed, to be honest.I would like to comment about the music, but I can't since I didn't hear much of it. The movie's sounds drowned it out. I remember when the flesh fair motorcyclists were chasing them, and that was some good music. I'm not sure if it was done by John Williams, though, since it was obviously not composed.All in all, I would not recommend A.I. It is too disappointing and too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might have worked as a two-hour "made-for-TV" special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a child of the '80s and somebody who grew up with Steven Spielberg's greatest stuff...and then was amazed by the more mature epics of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan...I tried very hard to watch A.I. with an open mind, and follow along with Steven as he attempted to combine the magic of E.T. with the melodrama and message of his more recent works. Alas, I merely kept falling asleep! What a tragic waste of celluloid considering the amazing talents at work here in William Hurt, Haley Joel Osment and the wizardry of ILM. It is far too long and convoluted...and appears that Spielberg couldn't decide whether he wanted to tell a schmaltzy love story or deliver a neo-political message about the potential dark future of humanity. I called this one "Pinnochio meets the Terminator" and it ended up making neither story line very exciting.There are some definite magical moments and well delivered emotional sequences, and the cinematography--particularly in the latter part of the movie (i.e. underwater Manhattan, Rouge City)--is incredible. But we still find ourselves yawning through most of the filler that makes this epic almost 2.5 hours long. Spielberg should have made this a "made-for-TV" special (which would have made it about 85 minutes long allowing for commercial breaks) and then he could have left in all the great parts without the multitude of boring, go-nowhere scenes that attempted to show humanity's attitude toward thinking machines.If you were a big fan of Teddy Ruxpin, rent this movie just to see the super version of him in the future. Sadly, the main character's sidekick in this movie (just called "Teddy") was probably the character with the best script and received the most human empathy despite being made of steel, wires &amp; fake fur. If you're a Spielberg fan and want to see a really great movie...leave this one on the shelf and spend a weekend with Jaws, Poltergeist, Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg Poured Through the Kubrick Filter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(spoilers) You know how if a 12-year-old boy were to make up a story for you, the story would combine an incredibly disjointed number of elements, and the story would paint itself into several corners and somehow squeek out of them, and you would patiently listen to the story, and when it finally ended you would ruffle the kid's hair and privately thank God that the story was over while politely cooing to his parents about how creative and imaginative the child was? Further, you know how you would never take that story and spend millions of dollars on translating it verbatim to film with no adult editorial input? You know what I mean?I really, really wanted to like "A.I.", and perhaps setting my expectations so high only contributed to the crushing disappointment I felt watching this film. I found the concept of robots becoming more integrated with society because they do not eat or require much in the way of living quarters (in the wake of over-population due to melting ice-caps) to be though provoking. However, my first danger signal came as David, an artificial boy who is introduced into the home of a couple who's biological son is in a coma (or dead, or whatever), is initially rejected by the wife who is horrified at this ersatz replacement of her own son.....and suddenly, for no real reason, not only accepts David but begins to love him. Indeed, this transformation is important to the story but it comes out of left field with no development whatsoever. David comes into the household as a cold, semi-vulcan like automaton, but the mother activates David's "love circuit" causing his cold stare to soften. He immediately starts calling this woman "Mommy"... and the woman just melts and accepts him. Uh, who's the robot here?Suddenly, ta-dah, the couple's biological son is restored to health and comes home, creating a sibling rivalry situation. The returned son has a mean streak in him and starts tormenting David. Through a series of misinterpreted fear responses in David, his "parents" deem him dangerous. Knowing that returning David to the company that made him will result in his destruction, the mother instead drives him into the woods and dumps him there at the mercy of a world in which robots are hated, feared, and destroyed for entertainment by the mass majority of people. Nice. Kinda like someone who would rather let thier pet die slowly instead of having them put to sleep at the vet.Anyhoo David, familiar with the "Pinochio" story, decides that his "mommy" would love him more and wouldn't have abandoned him if he were "a real boy". In order to achieve this, he must seek out The Blue Fairy. He does indeed find her at the long-submerged Coney Island amusement park, where his repeated requests to the Blue Fairy's statue go unheard. And so he sits at the bottom of the ocean for two thousand years until aliens dig though the ice and find him. And the aliens clone his "mommy" for him so he can spend one day of happiness with her. Yay.This would be a very emotionally involving tale if it were not for the lack of character building and progressively treacly story telling. Between the "mommy's" willingness to abondon her "child" to the cruel world and David's cold treatment at the hands of the very people who created him to feel emotions, the central message of this film seems to be that people suck. There is no real redemption for David, and no indication that the human characters in the movie are capable of the feelings that David has. This might be interpreted as a clever irony - that the robot has feelings and the people do not - except that there is no other atorytelling skill evident in the film to suggest that such an irony would have occurred to the filmmakers in the first place.Haley Joel Osmet turns in yet another convincing and impressive performance as the boy who feels nothing until his emotional circuits are activated. The other amusing, if not stand-out performance comes from Jude Law as Gigolo Joe - a comical sex-worker robot who befriends David. As a whole, the story is very cold-and-stark Kubrick while the film is wonder-and-ohh-ahh Speilberg, kinda like a banana split sundae with whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles served in your grandmother's skull....a grim story with a gooey-sweet coating. Yuck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I.?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I were to rate the first Act of A.I., I would have given it 4 stars. This act was the only place in A.I. that Stanley Kubrick had obviously influenced. If Kubrick had any influence on the rest of the movie then it doesn't show. The Prologue (where William Hurts character is proposing the new form of A.I.) is similar to such prologues from Paths of Glory and The Shining. A scene where no action occurs, but the ideas presented are what draws the viewer into the story line. I thought the first Act was amazing. Kubrick's adult content shows through Speilberg's childish method of filming and scriptwriting. Unfortunately, there wasn't any credibility or coherency for the rest of the film. When Davie reaches "The End of the World", where does Gigolo Joe, and Teddy go? Then William Hurts character arrives (for no good narrative reason) only to disappear for no reason. Then Gigolo Joe returns. Where the hell has he been? Was he off exploring for himself? More importantly what was Gigolo Joe's purpose for this film? What's the purpose of having a "love" bot in this film? Couldn't it have been any other type of robot? Speilberg's script offers no answers for these questions. Obviously, Stanley Kubrick wanted a robot that was programmed to love gets attached to a robot that programmed to "love". This use of the word "love" would create questions like "what is love, co-dependency, lust, and selfishness". A.I. starts these ideas, but it never finishes them. The end of Act three would have been a good place to end the movie. Instead we had to endure the forth Act. Most movies don't have a forth act. Coincidentally, 2001: A Space Odyssey does. Was Spielberg trying to achieve the same type of ending as 2001? They are similar in that both movies go on a journey only to come back to a familiar place. (This is also what Carl Sagan's Contact did) I suppose there is a possibility that a forth act could have worked, but this one didn't. Without going into too much detail, but the ending had no credibility, it dragged on, it was superficial, and it served no narrative purpose other than to give a happy ending. And why do these beings have the capability to bring back the mom for 24 hours, but not more time? Why just 24 hours? Does that make any sense to anyone out there? These super-beings also reminded me of Mr. DNA from Jurassic Park. Teddy says: "I have a piece of Mommy's hair" and the super-being should have said: "BINGO! Instant Mommy DNA!" Perhaps then they could have opened HUMAN PARK and then the movie could have truly dragged on forever torturing us all. Finally, If someone could bring Stanley Kubrick back for 24 hours, would he watch A.I. and be happy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The predominant thought in my mind while watching this movie was simply this: Not a lot of people are going to like this. It's not only the kind of movie that you either love or hate, but it's the kind of movie that you have to be of a certain mindset to understand. The most popular movies are the most vapid one because shallowness appeals to a general audience. The deeper you go, the more specific you get, the less people are going to understand (read: like) your movie.  That said... I loved this movie.Almost every review I've read or heard about this film has reflected the above thought. Many (on both sides) speak from ignorance about the subject and many others truly understand the limitations of such a specific film. Some people cited its "failure" as being due to Steven Spielberg taking over the project from Kubrick, but the truth is that the two of them had been working on it together for a long time before Stanley Kubrick's untimely death. You can't approach it thinking like a Kubrick fan, because it's Spielberg. You can't expect a Spielberg film because it's Kubrick. It takes the depth of a Kubrick film and the communicability of a Spielberg movie and creates a story that is a mixture of both, but not entirely either.There is an atmosphere to Artificial Intelligence that is transcendent. If you are lucky enough to catch it, then you'll be blown away. I left the theatre feeling like the earth had shifted beneath me, and I've talked to many who've felt the same way. It is a very personal and touching story about childhood, and relationships and motherhood and life and death and far more than I can fit here. But trust me, unlike many movies today, it holds the ability to take your breath away and knock you off your feet... if you'll let it.At the very least, it has some of the most amazing CG effect I've ever seen. At most, it was the best movie I'd seen in at least 5 years. But the point is that you can't tell if you'll like it or not until you've seen it, so don't let anyone color your experience. You might love it, you might hate it, but that's the only way to know for sure. For your own sake, watch this movie. It's a gamble, but it's got an amazing payoff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairy tale for the digital age.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a long time he didn't direct a movie, Spielberg comes back on da scene. I wondered what the result would be...and it seems that, at least for Spielberg, directing is like biking : once you know it, you can always do it. A.I. is the living proof of this.This movie is, as you might have guessed, an EXCELLENT one ! A movie that should embodies by itself the metaphoric power of major science-fiction works, and it makes no doubt to me this one will be a classic of the sci-fi genre.The movie starts quite slowly - a bit too slowly maybe, that's the only negative point to it - but, even if it never really speeds up (on this point, it can be compared to 2001 : a space odyssey) , it gets more and more intense, and the final half an hour is to me one of the best and most original endings in sci-fi history, and without any doubts one of the deepest in terms of meanings and emotional charge. Don't expect a thrilling action movies full of gunshots and explosion, this movie is very far from it, very calm, almost "Zen". This is far behind a simple sci-fi story. It's a philosophical fairy tale for grown ups, something that puts hopes in our hearts during those troubled times.The influence of Stanley Kubrick is clearly to be felt and the reference to 2001 obvious. Same theme (a computerized being's quest to become alive), same strange places especially at the end (the place - I'm referring to it in this very general term to avoid spoiling - where the end of the film takes place makes me think quite much of those white rooms in the end of 2001), Same rhythm.The cinematography is really awesome and gives much sense to the movie. The same goes to the very ethereous, ambient-alike music John Williams composed.Haley Joel Osment, who plays robot-child David, is to my opinion even better in this movie than in his previous masterpiece "The 6th sense" (This time, please give him the oscar!). Congrats, little big boy !A+ also for the special effects. It should get at least an oscar nomination, And I even bet on it for winning the price this year ! It's also very interesting to have such high-level FXs in such a movie...this can show the people who don't like FXs that they can be used in many various ways, and not only to depcit big explosions after that Schwartzenegger, Stallone or Willis has said something like "Eat this!".What else can be said about this true masterpiece ? Maybe that it is, with E.T. an Schindler's list, Spielberg's best work...I guess this says it all !!!/TNKNow some SPOILER (don't read it if you want to experience a total surprise) :* * *S P O I L E RS P A C E* * *I will only reveal the content of one shot - that is not decisive for the story itself but that had a big impact on the audience in the theater I was watching the movie in : When our heroes reach Manhattan, we discover a skyline where almost every buildings are destroyed...except for the twin towers ! A very emotional shot that for sure Spielberg didn't do intentionally...but that has a very strong impact on us nowadays !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a perfect blend of Kubrick and Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have spoken to quite a few people who have said they are not interested in A.I. because it is yet another movie with great robots and special effects. However, I believe it is a lot more than that. When you get a movie that blends in two of the greatest directors of their generations, you are not going to get any old special effects flick.I adored A.I. because it blended in Kubrick's philosophical vision of a cold, heartless future and Spielberg's sumptuous fairytale feelgood tendencies. You could see echoes of movies such as 2001, E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind throughout the duration of A.I. I thought Spielberg's use of the children's fairytale Pinocchio was both ingenious and certainly emotive as it reflected the young robot-boy's sad experiences.Kubrick's bleak vision of a functional, traumatised world is often realised with a cold, impersonal tone in so many of his movies. There is an empty feeling of desolation that haunts them throughout. You only have to see Clockwork Orange, Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket, to understand that. Large, unforgiving spaces that reek of corrupt, unfulfilled humanity.What is wonderful with Spielberg is that, unlike many contrived Hollywood movies these days, he can inject a warm, happy feelgood aspect into everything he does. He is never cliched or schmaltzy. He knows when to turn on the waterworks, he knows how to make an audience glow with happiness. There aren't many directors who know how to blend fantasy with feelgood joyousness like he does. There is a divine, idealistic, almost naive beauty to his magical view of the world. His enthusisam is certainly infectious and that is why his movies are so popular.The casting of Haley Joel Osment as the robot-boy was perfect. His sad, drooping eyes certainly came into their own when he was discarded by his mother in the woods. Their baleful desperation was just too much to bear for me and I started to weep. The ending (which I won't give away) was not sadness, just pure beauty and fulfilment. It was filled with dreams and everlasting happiness and I do not think I have wept with such intensity in a long, long time at the movies. In Haley Joel Osment's superb performance, there is such a feeling of idealistic yearning and a desperation for things to turn out right. That yearning should certainly transfer itself to the audience as well. Spielberg's sense of fantasy may stretch the bounds of reality but it is so heartfelt that you cannot help getting caught up in it.If Kubrick had done A.I. on his own it would have been far more sad and bleak and certainly more philosophical. Spielberg gives it a beautiful edge and really succeeds in tugging at the heartstrings of the audience. it is not as complex as Kubrick would have made it, but it is deeply satisfying nevertheless. Movie viewers these days have to learn to bring their imagination and sense of humanity and idealism to films such as this. They can't afford to be cynical, ironic, realistic, or too analytical about movies like A.I. You go in, glory in Spielberg's life affirming tendencies and go away feeling happy about life and the world we live in. Therein lies the success of A.I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Great Film of the 21st Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great films have a cornucopia of emotions, thoughts, and ideas which in turn provokes intense discussion amongst moviegoers. A.I. is one those films, and not surprisingly most people that have seen this film are divided in their opinions. Either they loved it, or hated it. But whatever the opinions may be, it has us talking. And for that, Steven Spielberg has done his job as a filmmaker.WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOLIER ALERT!A.I. is the first great film of the 21st Century. It is filled with ambition, ambiguity, joy, wonder, melancholy, and terror that's a result of the strange but refreshing mixture of the styles and sensibilities of two great filmmakers - Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Based on the short story "Supertoys Last All Summer Long" by Brian Aldiss, A.I. is about a robot boy named David (played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment) who longs to be a real boy. Inspired by the story "Pinocchio", David, with the help of a robot named Giggolo Joe (played by Jude Law, who is a hoot!) goes on a dangerous quest to find the Blue Fairy whom David believes can turn him into a real boy. David's quest leads him to places like the bawdy Rouge City and ultimately Manhattan which is completely underwater because the polar ice caps have melted. There in Manhattan is where the quest comes to a climax, leading to an Oedipal ending that is both sweet and sad. It's the main sequence of the film that's the most talked about.The film's photography, art direction (Rouge City and Manhattan looks awesome!), and special effects are first rate. This film should be a best picture nominee at next years Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick never connected with a wide audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A.I." is a very good film. Audiences going in expecting Spielberg's "E.T." will undoubtedly be disappointed. This is a Kubrick concept, and Stanley never connected with a broad audience. Look at how "Eyes Wide Shut" was perceived. I guarantee that ten years after the fact the same people who criticize both films will be the same jerks that will put it on their favorites of the decade. Look at "The Shining" and "Full Metal Jacket" These films were torn apart by critics at the time of release, and never gained an audience at theaters, but now through home video, everybody love them.Do yourself a favor and go see "A.I.", it's the only intellegent summer movie out there, and it deserves an audience now, not ten years from now.Mr. Spielberg deserves credit for making more adult films in recent years, with "Saving Private Ryan" "Amistad" and "Schindler's List", lets not have him go back to his days of "Hook" and "Always"....remember, he could have done "Harry Potter" instead of "A.I."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remarkable Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'A.I. Artificial Intelligence' is A Remarkable Film in all respects. A moving, spell-bindingly emotional film, that is worth a viewing, for it's brave story.'A.I. Artificial Intelligence' Synopsis: A highly advanced robotic boy longs to become "real" so that he can regain the love of his human mother.Development of A.I. originally began with director Stanley Kubrick in the early 1970s, but due to his belief that no child actor would believably portray it's protagonist David, he never made it, but in 1995, Kubrick handed A.I. to Steven Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. This film was dedicated to the memory of the Cinema Legend, whose films have left us stunned.'A.I. Artificial Intelligence' is one of the finest films of all-time, because of it's brave story, that is full of emotions. A story about a robot who can fall in love, firstly, is a remarkable thought &amp; the execution to the thought, is so well-done, that It actually left me in tears. The Power of this film is not it's astonishing visuals, but it's story, that holds you &amp; moves you.Spielberg &amp; Ian Watson's Screenplay deserves an ovation. Spielberg's direction is wonderful. He has handled this story with great understanding &amp; patience. Cinematography is picture-perfect. Editing is good. Special-Effects are absolutely stunning, while the Music by John Williams is in sync with the film's mood. Performance-Wise: Haley Joel Osment as David, is heart-breaking. The Oscar-Nominated Actor delivers one of the most challenging &amp; moving performances of all-times. A performance, that is above any compliment. As his mother, Frances O'Connor is first-rate. Jude Law supports well. William Hurt, in a brief role, is superb. Jake Thomas is passable. Brendan Gleeson is fair. Others lend support. On the whole, 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence' is amongst the finest films of it's time. A film that is sure to remain in the hearts of cinema lovers. Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faulty Intelligence about A.I.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stayed out of the debate on this film for years, at least at the film sites. But after seeing it described as a blend of 'Kubrick's starkness and Spielberg's sunny optimism', I decided to post my 2 cents.You can tell by my rating I loved it, but my reasons were personal and I admittedly did not have an objective viewpoint about it, and still do not to a large degree. Let's just say that while it has a special place in my heart, I would not necessarily recommend it to everyone. It's not for everyone. It's like a science fiction for shameless romantics. That considered, it is truly a science fiction and poses some serious philosophical questions for those undaunted by the site of cute little robots crying for 'Mommy'.I did notice that after the DVD came out the ratings started going up. This verified my theory that, while in theaters, AI was the victim of some harsh word-of-mouth from the unrelenting critics of all things Spielberg. I felt that when the DVD came out and people started seeing it for themselves it would fare better. That's proved to be the case.But to this day much of the faulty intelligence about A.I. remain. Spielberg did not write the sunny optimistic parts of AI. There were actually no optimistic parts of AI, but those touching bits that could be mistaken for optimistic were in the original screen story. One would think it would be pretty well known by now that Spielberg actually wrote the grim bits about the Flesh Fair and the dark segue that leads from the bottom of the ocean to 2000 years later when he meets up with his reanimated "mother" in a reunion scene that was in Ian Watson's original screen story; the one that Kubrick approved and Spielberg filmed almost note per note.This intelligence is not artificial and it comes from from the horses keyboard. My email conversations with Ian Watson revealed some other things about the story, some of which you can find by reading Watson's "Plumbing Stanley Kubrick", a tell all essay about working with the late great Kubrick, and some of which you can find in my own essay "Facts &amp; Fairy Tale: Setting The Record Straight On A.I." Google should find both if you are interested enough to seek them out.In conclusion, whether or not AI is a great film on an objective basis...? I will stay out of that argument. Largely because I just don't care. I like it and that's good enough for me. Anyway, it's standing on it's own merits now that most of the Spielberg bashing criticisms have been debunked.But I will say that if one is to criticize the film, at least get your facts straight. And the facts in this case suggest that if AI is not exactly as Kubrick desired, it's pretty damned close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A.I." is one of the better movies I have had the pleasure of seeing.The story told in the movie is very captivating, and it does raise some questions and issues. And it gives you something to think about, which I personally think is very good in a movie. It means that it has a deeper meaning than just shallow entertainment. The movie raises questions such as our own mortality, how do we deal with advanced robotic technology, and such. And of course, you have the aspect of intolerance to those different from ourselves (discrimination) - I am referring to the 'Flesh Fair' part of the movie.Haley Joel Osment puts on an amazing performance as David, and he does so with strong commitment and an amazing level of creditability. And you honestly do believe that he is an artificial creation. The performance of Jude Law as Joe was also amazing. He was so well cast for this role, and his appearance was so cool. He really had a very artificial look to him, and it was marvelous. Oh, and it is always nice to see William Hurt in a movie, despite his role was a mere supporting one.The scenery in the movie was great as well, having a believable future-like appearance to it, and it portrayed the difference between high-end living and the daily-run-of-the-mill lives by common people with less money. The rich environment was very sterile and neat, while the ordinary man was living in neon colored districts, and it was often grimy and rundown. That contrast between the two worked very well.Oh, and before I forget; TEDDY! That robotic teddy bear was so cool. Despite being only a minor side character, he was the one that stood out the most in my memory after the movie. He was simple awesome.Now, the only bad part of the movie was the last 30-45 minutes. The movie should have ended when David was trapped underwater, facing the Blue Fairy. I just didn't get the whole aspect of bringing aliens into the fray. At that point the movie became annoying to look at, and it took a turn for the worse, becoming a parody of itself. Had the movie ended when David was sitting trapped underwater staring at the Blue Fairy, the movie would have been 100% amazing. Why Spielberg chose to throw aliens into it is beyond me. But hey, that is what you get with artistic freedom, eh? I would have rated the movie higher, but this last part of the movie makes it a drag and thus pulls down the score. I usually end up stopping the movie at this point. I just can't take it serious.But all in all, "A.I." is an amazing movie that will stay with you for a long, long time once you have seen it. There is a lot of emotional scenes in the movie, lots of memorable scenes, and I think you will be returning to this movie again at a later time. It just have that 'repeated watch value' to it. If you haven't seen "A.I." yet, you definitely need to buy the movie and sit down and watch it. You will thank yourself for doing so. Trust me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Spielberg, why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll say this with a sigh and I don't want to say this, but I was really disappointed with this movie. But let me explain how this film got a high and an above average 7 out of ten.This is what I felt for the first say, 1hour 45 minutes. I felt this movie was one of the most thrilling, exciting, sad, brilliant movies of the decade. And I don't throw compliments like that around often. Hayley Joel Osmont played a stunning, captivating role that is Oscar worthy and Jude Law did a mighty fine job also. In fact, the acting all round was quite impressive. Visually, well, it was flawless. The directing, the lighting, the special effects, the robots, all perfect, the music was moving and atmospheric and intertwined with the movies disturbing and oddball theme and it never failed to offer heart-wrenching moments and tense, unnerving scenes. The movie went along at a fast enough pace, jumping quickly from one section to another perfectly and hit all the right emotions that made you actually feel for the robots. Very symbolic in places, especially the FLESH FAIR which was a direct hint towards the holocaust. The future was predicted well, quite possible in fact and it wasn't too ridiculous to be imaginable. The settings, scenery and ambiance was just advanced enough to have a futuristic tone, but restricted enough to be possible. In a nutshell, this film is pretty hard to criticize. Well, this is what I thought, until after the scene that changed everything.*spoiler warning* I remember the start of the movie had an introductory narrative, explaining the worlds conditions and such and how the story would begin. Much, much later in the movie the voice returned, whilst David is submerged under water and pleading with blue fairy statue to make him a real boy. The voice returned in a fashion that the movie would end. The voice explains how David kept pleading and how did so for over 2000 years. At this point I thought this movie was amazing and one of my favorites, the perfect ending to the movie and a really moving and exceptionally thought provoking ending to AI. But no, Spielberg had to give us more. And a really awful ending entails.In short, it shows David breaking out of the ice 2000 years later and meeting up with a group of badly designed, unimaginative aliens that would let him see his mother for one more day. At this point, all the humans have become extinct and therefore, of course, his mother has died. But somehow these aliens manage to use bits of people to recreate the humans perfectly for one more day. An over-sentimental, over-emotional and a particularly "Disney" scene follows, that is dragged out, embarrassing, out of context with the rest of the movie, sickeningly happy and downright awful. This movie was always disturbing and off-the-wall and this ending is just a complete contrast that just does not fit. It literally ruined a movie that had the full potential to be a classic, yet the last 15 minutes, Spielberg did a "fairy-tale ending on it" and ruined it. I can't explain how utterly crap it is and I actually felt angry and depressed that something as simple as a conclusion can ruin a spectacular experience. A dark ending to a dark movie was the way to go, was the way to create a masterpiece, but Stephen Spielberg obviously had his way and destroyed.I strongly urge people to watch this movie, but I also strongly suggest you stop it after the second narrative kicks in. Until then, I would've given it a perfect 10 out of ten, but nothing denies that Spielberg made a fatal mistake.What a pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Extinction of Mankind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not too many movies tackle the subject of the end of the world; this one does it with just the right amount of irony and pathos, whimsy, wrath, wonder and wry commentary that IMHO it will be on many "Best SF" lists forever under the genre: "End of the World". But to what could I compare "A.I."? As fantasy, it out-pinocchios Pinnocchio; as SF it out-kubricks Kubrick's "2001". The ending of "2001" is somewhat of a cop-out; we trust that the new suiper baby will herald a new super race of men who - perhaps - will not self-destruct this time? "A.I.", on the other hand, posits 'no return' to humanity; that last vestige of humanity goes to sleep as her DNA disintegrates, her baby boy-bot contentedly closing his eyes at her side. SAD! Almost unbearably sad! We blew it, and the A.I. will have to carry on without us.... thus we lovers of "A.I." join a very small coterie of apocalyptic-ally-challenged SF fans who bemoan the lack of good stories pondering the alternate realities of mankind's extinction....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick gets the Disney treatment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On many levels most Kubrick are basically black comedies, whether he consciously intended them to be or not. Speilberg is basically good at what he does, which is making commercial entertainment that can be watched and thrown away. His films are bubble-gum for the mind, where as Kubrick is an artist who makes films that can provoke thought and feelings.So what happens when a guy who makes commercial movies without depth directs a movie sketched out by one of the greats? Pretty much what you'd expect. A film that has that commercial sheen and is photographed adequately but lacks any shelf life. There is no innovation, no great performances milked from the actors, and nothing of interest happening on any level whatsoever. We get the trademark Speilberg brand of sentimentality by the bucketful though, which provokes nausea in any rational human being.Kubrick innovated in every film he made, and coaxed and bullied out great performances from his actors. Kubrick was edgy even in his latter years. That is why Kubrick is remembered and will continue to be, and why Speilberg is going to be a footnote.If you haven't seen the movie then don't bother. Watch Blade Runner instead. I give this movie 2 out of 10, and I'm in a generous mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The recipe for "A.I."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if "The Food Network" was "The Hollywood Network"? Follow me into the Twilight Zone... "Hi, folks. Stanley Kubrick here for ?Essence of Kubrick'. Today we're going to whip up a movie that I think you're going to like. I call it ?A.I.: Artificial Intelligence', and here's how we're going to make it. First of all, use a futuristic-looking bowl to set the movie in. I'm using a dark and cynical bowl, unlike the bright and positive bowl that is used on that other 'Hollywood Network' show, called ?Death By Star Trek'. But you know me, folks. This is ?Essence of Kubrick'. I don't go for that cloying, cheery stuff. Now take your dark and negative bowl; add one part ?Wizard of Oz' and one part ?Pinnocchio'. Make sure the two plots intertwine as best you can. Fold in one part "D.A.R.Y.L.". Add a dash of the war subplot from the ?Terminator' movies. Season to taste with creativity, but don't use too much. The stuff's too rare, and it's hard to get. Let it simmer on your oven until you find some good acting elements. The ones I have in mind are... ACK! ARRRGH!" He crumples to the floor clutching his chest, and the screen switches to a sign that says: "Experiencing Technical Difficulties: Please Stand By". The screen switches back after a while, and there's a bearded man looking into the camera. "Hi, there. I'm Steven Spielberg, but you can call me by my nickname, ?King Midas'. Apparently, Mr. Kubrick won't be able to complete his recipe for ?A.I.', so I'll just finish it up for him. I've been watching the taping of this show, and I have a basic understanding of what he was creating, even though the recipe has been sitting here on ?the back burner' for a while. I went down to the supermarket and picked up some actors that I think will make this movie sizzle. I got a package of ?Haley Joel Osment' for sweetness and innocence, and some ?Jude Law' as a smarmy counterpoint. This drama should be great. Now, we'll just mix all this together, then let it stand until the hype sets in. Remember, it serves six billion, and I hope you enjoy! See you next time on my 'Hollywood Network' show ?Spielberg!'" The camera pulls back as the audience applauds. A random audience member samples the recipe, who grimaces, then turns around and spits it out. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS "RECIPE", FOLKS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read the negative reviews on this and I tend to agree in part. Yes the movie was too sappy (I cry every time I watch it) yes there was no need for a gigolo robot and a giant city of sex. Yes there were plot holes.But overall, if you look at what was accomplished, this movie is a masterpiece, of technical work, imagination, and design, that is truly amazing. The story is also heavily ripped from Pinnocio and the Wizard of Oz too, but OK.I didn't find out until the third time watching this that the 'aliens' at the end are actually the evolutions of the robots. The dna nonsense was a bit stretched. It would have been nice to see more robots fighting back, aren't there any soldier robots? You bet we would build those first. According to Spielberg, this world is on the verge of civil war between robots and humans, yet we see no trace of the robots even thinking of fighting back. I'm thinking it will be armies of David's and Darlenes doing the fighting, so maybe show that. They are letting loose an assembly line of dangerous unstable robots at the end of the movie (as David's rage incident with one of his product line shows clearly) yet we do not see the outcome.I guess the depth and beauty and wonder of this new world Spielberg created for me drew me in so completely that I was left wanting it all, wanting to know all, and for the movie to never end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True love is eternal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's finest films that pulls at the emotions like no other. They say true love is eternal and in this case, it is. I won't go over the story because anyone reading this would have seen it already, instead, I'll just give my impressions of it as a celluloid story. Spielberg is a master storyteller and here he certainly pulled at my emotions. The loss of a child, the loss of a mother, all here and waiting to pierce through anyone watching it. The film covers many complex emotions, but it doesn't skim over them, it ensures you, the viewer, are forced to eventually accept that a robot is more human than the child he replaced. All he ever wanted was to be loved, unlike the real human child that was bought out of him coma. It was David that possessed the compassion and willingness to compromise, it was David that felt empathy for both human and robot alike. It therefore seemed just that in the end, robot's were the dominant 'life form' on the planet. I rate this film very highly and give it ***** of ***** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a neat premise this movie came up with at the beginning: show us what turns life can take if a machine becomes truly intelligent and able to bear emotions. But then the movie almost immediately starts to stomp on its own feet. Our hero, David, the first of the new robot generation able to handle emotions, is apparently not the first. Otherwise his predecessors would not be able to fear death, develop cynism beyond their limited programming or forget their programming at all. Best example here the lovebot "Gigolo Joe," who tries to go undercover when he finds a dead woman in his apartment and later befriends David - all this goes far beyond "programmed reactions" as explained in the movie (why would the manufacturer program these into a lovebot at all?). Oh, and if you wonder how much thicker the plotline became due to "Gigolo Joe" imagine his role being deleted and try to think hard if he delivered anything useful. (Ok, I will *not* argue about the question why David gets shortfused when he eats spinach but can fall into a pool and nothing happens or why with all the elaborate technology to mimic humans none of the bots blink.)Then we see David getting left by his mother (or the person he was programmed to love) and his endless quest to find the "Blue Fairy" from "Pinocchio" who he thinks can make him a real boy and win him the love of his mother. Did I say endless? Yes, because all of us past age 8 know that this quest will be futile. You may feel sorry for David, but you will also feel like watching an accident happen and you can do nothing about it.But then enter Mr. Spielberg. When you watch the last 30 minutes of the movie you will know what I mean. You can almost tell where Kubrick's notes ended for sure and where Spielberg took what he described as "his own intellectual freedom." At this point you will feel like watching "E.T." and "2001" at the same time - on an LSD trip. Spielberg tried so hard to reach the heights of Kubrick (and had Williams throw in some "2001"-like tunes for the final) it is almost pitiful how he ruins his own ambitions with his pink popcorn attitude to sooth the viewer. Spielberg just can't let us go without a pat on the shoulder and a reassuring "everything will be fine!"How swell would everything have been, if the movie ended right there with David staring and begging and Teddy eternally sitting with him. Audiences would have left the theaters wondering "are we aware of what a responsibility we are getting ourselves into there?" I would have even forgotten about the above mentioned implausibility of the emotional reactions the earlier robots had, which most likely were delivered to pull us onto the sides of the robots. Which brings me to the one character I liked the best and felt genuinely sorry for: patient, enduring and quiet Teddy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS A.I. is an unusual movie with a strange storyline, giving that it's set in the future and involves robots. The film starts out as a domestic drama involving a couple whose son is in an accident, and while he is in a coma thay get in a replacement son. There's only one problem, he's a robot. This first part is gripping and humane and overall, quite enjoyable.The second part sees the robot boy in glitzy Rouge City alongside Gigolo Joe and his talking teddy bear, on a quest to find the Blue Fairy. This happens after they escape from the flesh fair where robots are tortured and burned for sport. This part is a real treat for the eyes and by far, the best of the three parts.This leads to the very disappointing third part in which the robot boy lands in a flooded Manhattan, stares at a plastic statue for 2000+ years(you heard me)and is rescued by aliens. While watching this part, your jaw should drop to the ground and you should be left wondering why they would DESTROY a perfectly good movie by doing this.The acting is excellent, the directing is stylish (if not manipulative)but it's the final twenty minutes of the film that's the real problem. Only the most sentimental viewers would enjoy this without getting a strong sense that they are being cheated out of their money.But still, the first two parts are outstanding, so for that reason, A.I. gets a 7.5 out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is one of the most thought-provoking, visually stunning films to come along in a really long time, perhaps even since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (one of my favorite films -- this one often reminded me of it). This is very high praise, I know, but the film is a remarkable achievement in imaginative filmmaking. I haven't seen this many incredible visuals since STAR WARS I: THE PHANTOM MENACE, but the amazing thing is that the film is also consistently involving, absorbing, powerful, and fascinating. Spielberg's film, in its own unusual and unique manner, definitely lives up to the expectations -- and it exceeded mine.What made me skeptical in those expectations was that the man who made E.T. was going to take over a project from the man who made A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. I was afraid that Spielberg would turn Kubrick's icy intellect and brilliant cinematic technique into something shallow and tear-jerking. The surprise is that Spielberg puts his own personality only into the final 20 minutes which represent the film's third act. The rest really looks and feels like something Kubrick could have made with a 90 million dollar budget. The film has some truly awesome special effects. Sequences showing cities of the future, all kinds of robots, cities we know like Manhattan half-submerged in water will have your jaw dropped in amazement and wondering how they got it all on screen. It has the most astonishing effects ever seen even in a Spielberg film, and that's not saying little. But not only did he direct this film, he also was responsible for the carefully written screenplay. It's his first writing credit since 1982's POLTERGEIST, and he has written only one of his movies, which is 1977's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.In the film's first act we see the life of a robotic, or 'mecha', child called David, played very well by Haley Joel Osment. He is adopted by a mother (Frances O'Connor) and father (Sam Robards) whose child's survival is very uncertain, and he's cryogenically frozen. Initially David seems to be having a good time with these people. He has some weird attitudes, to be sure, but most of the time he seems to be acting like a real kid. Osment's performance is intelligent in the way that he doesn't give his character a typically robotic voice or attitude, but acts and reacts sort of mechanically to his surroundings. It's a unique and intelligent performance that blends the attitude of a real boy and a cold machine. I'm not sure if the Academy will see the goodness of this performance. Perhaps the scene where he shines brightest is the one where his mother, played by Frances O'Connor, leaves him in a forest to fend for his own; once he realises it, his immediate reaction is played to perfection by Osment. He bursts out in tears, and yet the little genius still manages to give hints that his character's emotions are not real, not human anyway.After this heart-wrenching scene the movie radically changes tone. The film's first 40 minutes or so are rather slow, shot with a blanket of haze by Oscar-winner Janusz Kaminski (who has photographed every Spielberg film since SCHINDLER'S LIST), played subtly and delicately, but after that the look and pace of the film become crisper as it assaults our senses with some big, confusing, fast action sequences as David is captured by a weird character, played briefly by Brendan Gleeson, who travels around the land in a balloon in the form of a huge moon in search of lost mechas so he can take them to his 'Flesh Fair', an ugly festival where all sorts of robots are tortured and killed as entertainment. David manages to win the audience's sympathy and escape certain death (or is it just destruction?). He makes a valuable friend at the Fairs, a 'love mecha' named Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law, with whom he will leave the Fairs and set out for Rouge City, a sleazy, glitzy, light-filled place with every kind of woman you could wish for, as Joe puts it. David wishes to find the Blue Fairy, since he's been listening carefully to the Pinocchio tale his mother told him and thinks that if he'll find the blue fairy she'll turn him into a real boy. Once they're in Rouge City they go and see a sort of digital Albert Einstein, a computer that answers every of your questions with an animated character called dr. Know, voiced by Robin Williams. This sequence is technically mervelous, but largely wears out its welcome. He's amusing to watch for a while but gets tiresome after a while, although he is important to the plot's development because he leads the two to Manhattan, which as I've said is shown almost completely submerged by water, and deserted, in this film. The effects in this sequence are incredible and scary in a way as well; to give you an idea, we only barely see the head of the Statue of Liberty and it all looks completely credible. I will not spoil the movie more for you by revealing what happens once David and Joe arrive there. Suffice it to say, the movie gets consistently weirder and more intriguing as it goes along after that point. In that way in reminded of 2001, as it takes the main character's journey to a climax in a place he doesn't know, but is shaped into something familiar to him (like Dave Bowman in the weird hotel room) by unknowns to make him comfortable.Many critics around me were disappointed by that ending, and although I must admit that I found the final 5 minutes a bit forced and sentimental, I was still enchanted, all the time wondering what would happen next. For those reading who have seen the film, you must agree with me it's the only way this film could've ended. It also raises arguments for discussion; for example, how can we be sure that a robot can't have real feelings? When a mechanical 'being' has such a burning desire for anything, in this case to find his 'mother', can we just coldly say that it can't be genuine emotion? What makes us more real than robots? We are also made out of organs, atoms, molecules, biological cells. We also react more or less logically to our surroundings, don't we? So do robots.In this unusually long review for me, I still have just scratched the surface of this film's richness, depth, and power. Its flaws and partly unsatisfactory conclusion keep me from giving it my highest rating. It is definitely a 'flawed masterpiece' if there ever was one. After I came out of the theater I was thinking so many different things, not being sure if I had seen a great film, thinking about the parts I loved, about the flaws, about those last 20 minutes... imperfect as I felt it was, I couldn't put it out of my head. That's definitely a higher compliment than you can give to most other movies. I think I could go on for a lot longer, but I will stop right now and tell you that if you like Kubrick movies, if you like to think about movies, this film won't disappoint you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg out of his depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been wondering why this film didn't make it to the top. It was destined to be the new landmark in film history. The voting in IMDb is bell shaped with a top about 7-8. That's the publics definition of a mediocre film. Why? Nothing was spared. The cards were dealt for a film history event. Why did it fail??Because Steven Spielberg was out of his depth mentally.He ventured into a realm he does not have the talent to handle. Spielberg is the master of children's stories, crowd pleasers, clich wallowing, tear jerking, emotional masturbating. He is the complete antithesis to Stanley Kubrick who is the master of intellect, innovation, originality. It is like expecting Santa Claus to master brain surgery. That does not make Santa Claus bad in his realm. It is just misguided.I have a dream. Before this decade is over ... that there will be a film maker of Kubrick's stature who will do a remake of A.I. - based on intellect, innovation, originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although the production value is wonderful, it's simply not a good film..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this film as it's been playing on HBO lately (7/30/2015) and I had some time to kill. As a big fan of science fiction and films in general, I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it that much either.It must be mentioned that "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" is well-made and has that very professional level of polish that you expect from big-budget Hollywood films. It also has some great supporting cast to the lead role of Haley Joel Osment as David, a "mech." who is essentially a humanoid robot / android. Haley's performance is overall just sufficient; at times he does a great job of channeling one of my favorite robot impersonators, Brent Spiner, who plays Data on Star Trek: T.N.G. However at other points in the film, Haley's performance seems forced and immature, especially considering his truly amazing role as Cole in 1999's "The Sixth Sense". The other characters ultimately do not get fleshed-out in story well enough (aside from Gigolo Joe), and it leaves you feeling a bit lost.On the subject of Jude Law's role as Gigolo Joe, he is what saves this film from being an utterly boring family film. A film doesn't need to involve sexual aspects to be good, but the Gigolo Joe character in "A.I." is what really brings the movie together. Jude Law seems to have a talent for making even a lousy film decent enough to sit through.Another problem with "A.I." is there are just too many scenes which could've been shortened or scrapped completely. Also, many scenes are there purely for aesthetic value, because at the time, this movie's CGI was cutting-edge. The wasted time with bad scenes could've been better utilized to make the other character's story arcs better and more complete.Overall this film just didn't do it for me. The story was too full of filler and scenes of Haley Joel Osment doing "cute" &amp; silly things (like smiling and daydreaming in awe of his surroundings), and it's unimportant to the film's story. Overall most of the film is good enough for the majority of folks who watch these kind of movies, but I would've liked to have seen a little more effort and adventure on the part of the actors, directors, and writers. My hat goes off once again to Jude Law though for always doing a great job in every movie I can recall seeing him in. I wouldn't recommend "A.I." unless you're feeling very adventurous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overlooked film, a borderline masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's ambitious undertaking of an idea by Stanley Kubrick, he threw himself headlong into the project after Kubrick's death. Almost a retelling of the "Pinocchio" fairy tale, the film is set in the future, after all coastal cities are destroyed by global warming, and strict limits are put on the human populace's ability to reproduce. A family who seemingly has lost their son to coma becomes the perfect test family for a cybernetic child who has been programmed with the ability to love and feel. When the couple's real child recovers, he becomes competitive with the robot for his mother's affections. He makes the robot seem hostile, and the couple decides to return the robot. However, a return means the robot's destruction, which the mother can't bear, so she sets him free in the woods. The child now goes on a lifelong search for the mother, as well as the "Blue Fairy" from "Pinocchio" to make him a real boy so she could love him. Excellent effects and cinematography highlight the film, whose only drawback might be its length. Kubrick's fingerprints are all over this movie, as Spielberg shot it in a style that his friend might have had he lived. The ending can be a tearjerker to some, and it's a great story which has gone overlooked in Spielberg's legacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film surprised me to say the least. For a film that has such powerful messages, great acting, and great production and costume design, I am stunned. My guess is that it's viewed as a lesser Spielberg film, and is overshadowed. Nonetheless, this film took me from curiosity, to despair, to wonderment, and to sadness. It encompasses a range of emotions as the A.I. goes on his journey in life and those emotions help you see his world in a way that transcends time. This film has cyberpunk, it has Metropolis-esque buildings, and most of all it has a robot that wants nothing else but to be loved. I rate this movie a 10 out of 10 because its a beautiful film with many nods to classic and modern sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about ten minutes too long and it truly should have finished with David at the bottom of the ocean. It has a tragic beauty up to that point, poignant like some of the sad fairy tales that made you cry as a child, and heart-wrenching with its portrayal of betrayed innocence and sad lingering fierce love of a child viewing as an adult.The happy ending really ruined this, and turned it into something that landed just slightly on the side of the ridiculous. Perhaps Spielberg just couldn't resist adding something cheering but it simply doesn't work well in this film. I hope he will in time learn that sad ending, while no doubt depressing to some, can also evoke strong emotional response that is thought-provoking, also ultimately up-lifting and cathartic to the viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you hear of a Spielberg-Kubrick co-production, the idea of it sounds brilliant. But sadly there's no way it could work right. A.I. is a 3-act movie that boasts the Spielberg touch of love and intrigue in the 1st act, and the tone abruptly changes to Kubrick's violent and dark 2 act, and by the 3rd act I was thinking the movie should have ended sooner. A.I. may have been almost perfect in the 1st act, but the whole movie would have been more satisfying if it had more coherence in the changing tones. What I did admire about A.I. was its stunning technical effects, from the superior visuals to the futuristic art direction. John Williams has a fantastic score similar to Vangelis' score from Blade Runner. Had the script been worked on some more, A.I. would be one of the new classic sci-fi epics, instead it confuses itself due to the conflict of creative production minds. Still, an above average movie. 1-10 Overall--6 Direction--6 Story--3 Acting--8 Music score--9 Visuals--9</fullReview>

When he tried to persuade the pitiful older woman that she deserved better and turned on the charm, that old song sounded scratchy and muted. Maybe he needed new hair gloss that cost a fortune and had to ditch the romantic music quality. However, he is the best looking robot to grace the silver screen to date. One Star! No robot GPS?? Perhaps Stanley was unable to think that far ahead or actually did, but getting lost in a scary forest would not allow Flesh Fair catchers being really mean and make me feel bad ala typical Spielberg.Clueless mother at a pool party? You would think the hostess of a special birthday party would be aware of potential alienation of her new son and choice meat for real boys. However, she just looks dazed while all the boys surround the robot, loudly taunt him and HUGE knives are readily available. I guess those cakes of the future have some pretty tough icing to slice.The Flesh Fair was the beginning of the end for my interest in this film. I imagine this was presented for NASCAR fans? Confusing to the plot of: we hate robots and desire improved standards.Alas, cannot even recommend for Jude Law fans or for computer scientists who have ANY experience with AI, expect many chuckles, this is truly dazzling drivel.</fullReview>

But unless you love to cry, or are getting it for free, i would not waste your time or money. All in all, the acting was great and so was the special effects but it was sad from just about the first 10 minutes on.

		<shortDescription>MOMMY........I AM CONFUSED</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*The movie confuses not only itself, but also the viewer in terms of what it is trying to achieve, where it actually wants to go, and how to go about it. Initially, it starts off as a typical sci-fi movie, which exemplifies what would be one of the zeniths of the future-man's creation: the creation of custom-made robots, which not only look and feel like humans, but are also designed to exhibit a certain types of behaviors, and feel certain kinds of emotions. Then, the movie tries to answer the question, `can humans offer the same kind of unconditional love, as offered by the custom-made 'mecha'?' by taking the example of David, and how he tries to get himself accepted by a 'human'-family. The movie goes on fine through the course, which shows the various problems faced by the 'mecha', and the 'human' family, in trying to accept each other.After the point at which David is deserted by his family, the movie, then goes through a labyrinth, trying to give a totally different meaning to it, and deviating from what it had actually started off with, until the end, which again tries to continue from where it had left off, about an hour ago. Though the movie ends well, (conceptually, though again, the execution is flawed by the introduction of aliens, (or futuristic robots of the ice-age, whichever it might be) who exhume David, and try to fulfill his wish) by the time the movie arrives at this point, it has passed through so many confusing and supererogatory paths in-between, that the charm of this otherwise 'touching' ending, and the movie, as a whole is completely lost.The beginning and the ending of the movie are coherent with the punch line, `can humans respond equally to the unconditional love, the 'mecha' bestows upon them?' However, in the middle, it tries to depict that the human is, and always will be evil, by showing that the future-man will not only create the 'perfect' robot, (or make his 'best creation ever') he will also mercilessly destroy his own creation, regardless of their feelings, and the viewers are supposed to feel sorry about this. In the midst of all this, the story takes the shape of a fairy-tale, in which the protagonist, (in this case David) is in a search for the 'blue-fairy', who he believes, will make him a 'real' boy, so that his 'mommy' will love him. These links, which try to build up the ending, are not only muddled and fatuous, but also are seriously ill directed, especially the parts concerning the merciless destruction of 'mechas', at the 'flesh-fair'.Spielberg is one of the best movie-directors of all time; not half as good as Kubrik, though (since this movie is supposed to be conceptually similar to `2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY') and the best, when it comes to creating fantasy-flicks. In this fantasy-movie, however, he has tried to introduce too many ideas, which not only make the movie too long and over-sentimental, but also out-of-focus, from what it actually wants to achieve.6* out of 10*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In A.I. there is a much better film trying to get out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although you wouldn't realise it without being told, you can see in hindsight that this is a former project of Stanley Kubrick: the first act is very stark and sterile, the second act is downright bizarre and the third act seems to have nothing to do with the rest of it. A.I. also inherits Kubrick's knack for taking simple (albeit sophisticated) ideas and filling the corresponding motion picture with irrelevant sequences that are victories of style over substance. This isn't a bad thing, and when you're a genius and an artist like Kubrick you can pull it off.Spielberg is a genius and an artist also, but only relative to the rest of Hollywood, so it doesn't get him as far.You can also tell that it's been tailored for American audiences: A.I. features long monologues by characters to explain what is happening, additional narration by Ben Kingsley for the *really* stupid people and even the title had to be "Artificial Intelligence", not "A.I." so nobody would (apparently) confuse it with A1 BBQ sauce.The explanation of everything is what spoils A.I., otherwise bordering on masterpiece. Going into the film we already know the boy is a robot so the first ten minutes of William Hurt explaining this is redundant. In fact the film might have been more compelling if this were not known to the audience for a while. Also unneeded is the narration about the world flooding and the limitation on children as these are shown later.The useless commentary continues. The bear explains in great detail how it came across the mother's hair (did we forget?), the aliens/machines describe how they can recreate people from DNA (duh) and the narrator explains that David finally gets to sleep, which we can see happening at the time it is being explained. And why go to the trouble of explaining the mother can only live for a day? Yada yada yada, blah blah blah, there is too much talk!!!!!Can you imagine 2001: A Space Odyssey if the creators of the Monolith explained everything to Dave Bowman at the end?In fact, William Hurt's entire role is totally unnecessary. You could remove it and the utterly bizarre Dr Know sequence (which leads our heroes to the flooded Manhattan and then waiting Doctor Hurt) and nobody would notice. Almost certainly the Meryl Streep bit could be trimmed if not excised altogether.Steven Spielberg has made more films than me and is regarded (rightly) as a genius by more people than me. But seriously, this film needs some edits. Paraphrasing Quentin Tarantino, film-making is knowing what to remove, no matter how cool it is or how much you might like it. Unfortunately we're not likely to get a revised version of A.I. because, to my knowledge, Spielberg is not taken to re-editing his films after the event with the exception of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and now that the DVD is out, the most logical time for a new edit is past.Ironically Spielberg's own Close Encounters was short on narrative and the overall motives of the aliens remains a mystery. Films like Blade Runner and 2001 (which A.I. borrow a lot from), present the world as it is and the audience can infer how it came to be so. The film-makers invite the audience to consider what is not shown on screen.What A.I. shows is that film producers still do not understand their audiences. Most of the really great or really profitable films were not contrived that way - they were expressions of the film-maker's vision and a large number of people enjoyed the experience. 2001, Star Wars and the original Star Trek TV series were made in spite of commercial considerations and they are now billion-dollar industries and/or shining lights of the artform. With A.I. I can imagine the producers asking Spielberg to add the opening and closing narrations because they felt the audience would not otherwise understand. Unfortunately, it's created a picture with no mystery and no wonder; everything is explained in detail so you can get to the end of the story and not think any further about it.</fullReview>

(By an hour into the film, I DARE you to like even one of these people.) Somewhere in the middle, it decides to be current social commentary thinly disguised as a future debate over people vs. machines. And don't even get me started on the end. By then it abandons any pretense of being just one story and tries to be at the least 4 different movies in one, failing on all. In the end, it is only some of its interesting and well-written details that stay with you as good, and those are too few, much too far between, and some could have been MUCH smaller and made a better point. Take it from a mom who regularly edits home video of the kids down to 10-minute tapes for friends and family, just because I shot 4 hours at Juniors birthday party doesn't mean anyone else needs to see it unedited. ***spoiler coming*** This movie could have been saved by much more vicious editing, say an hour or so less of A.I., and by a decisive ending (my recommendation is ending when he falls in the water. In fact, if you watch it again, turn it off right there, and see if I'm not right).</fullReview>

Well by this analogy, A.I. could easily have been called ?Steven Spielberg's Pinocchio', because that's what it is.Also note that as Carpenter's Thing was far more intense than the grade B budget 1952 science fiction, Spielberg's version of Pinocchio is also far, far more emotionally intense than the original children's fairy tale. A.I. is at times too riveting, at times too boring, and at times too confusing.Haley Joel Osment (David) and Jude Law (Gigolo Joe) performed their respective parts wonderfully! Spielberg uses his full bag of cinematic special effect tricks, and his vivid imagination to really bring the story to its emotion twisting life. However, unlike every other popular Spielberg science fiction production that I've ever seen, this one impressed me as overly depressing, morose and macabre. It is very, very unlike his usual uplifting, positive and heroic ending previous science fictions. I can best describe A.I. as a very good and reasonable intelligent science fiction, but unfortunately, it's just mediocre Spielberg.FM</fullReview>

		<fullReview>....unfortunately, Spielberg got his hands on it!One of the primary responsibilities of a director is to match the proper narrative to the theme of the story. The concept behind A.I. is deep and brilliant. Man's technological abilities have outpaced his wisdom. In response to his own frailties, he creates an artificial being designed to give him back what he craves. Yet, Man is totally unprepared to accept the responsibility that goes with this act of creation. Like God, he has created a new being in his own image. Like God, he is unable/unwilling to give His new creation the unconditional love that it needs, and instead, casts this creation from its home to the depths of darkness. At the end, however, this banished creature and others like it prove themselves more worthy inheritants of the future than Man himself.Wow! This movie has the potential to be the long-in-coming companion piece to 2001: A Space Odyssey, if only it were made by the same person. It is indeed a tragedy that Kubrick had to pass away prematurely, leaving this project in the capable but completely inappropriate hands of Steven Spielberg. I cringed and gagged in horror as I saw the blatant contamination of this noble idea with silly and outdated Spielbergisms. The presence of a teddy bear as a supporting character, the regurgitation of the lonely boy in the suburbs motif, and the ceaseless assault on the human potential by showing the world from the point of view of, not just a child, but a hopelessly dumb child! These cheap cinematic tricks were novel and cute at the time of E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial. But we now live in a different era and expect more from the Maestro than the tired recycled attempts at shameless tear-jerking.It is unfortunate that Spielberg has not yet grown up. He needed to do so if he had any hope of walking in the footsteps of the great Stanley Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I is the story of a robot that looks exactly like a young boy (Haley Joel Osment) and, in some respects, acts like (but rarely talks like) one. He goes to live with a human family who is as amazed as we are at such an amazing technical achievement.The boy-robot mustn't eat human food (and why would he need to?) but his resemblance to a real human is, it has to be said, really remarkable. He has an amazing, human-like capacity for learning, although he does have 2 major weaknesses in that respect. The first is that he doesn't seem to understand the difference between a story (such as a fairy story) and reality no matter how often its explained to him. The second is that once he believes in something that isn't real (such as a magic blue fairy) no amount of reasoning or setbacks or programmed common sense will stop him relentlessly seeking it out. This proves to be the crucial difference between a normal human boy and Spielberg's robot because, obviously, most kids would regard this sort of boy as a moron.Haley Joel Osment is very mature for his young years - his emotions are convincing, almost adult. He is obviously cute though and directors can't seem to help exploiting this. So this highly unusual actor is the dominant force in his films and sentiment is his strong point and so then the driving force of his movies. If you liked Sixth Sense and Pay it Forward then A.I may appeal to you for the same reasons.However in those films Osment's character was merely weird (i.e. motivated and driven by a force way outside the average 13-year-old's domain of thought). In A.I he is frankly creepy. His face melts when he eats spinach, which is a neat trick but not that endearing. He is programmed to "love" his mother which other reviewers have hinted is supposed to make us question what it is to be human. If a robot is so like a human that it loves its human mother does that make it human too? Frankly who cares when the film makers idea of love seems to be the same as a celebrity stalker's. You feel neither sympathy nor empathy for this creature any more than you would for a living brain, kept alive in a jar, programmed to cry "mummy mummy".My sympathies were with the mother though when she decided to dump this thing in the woods. This turned to admiration when she cleverly used it as an excuse to dump the "wise old teddy" too (who ain't so wise when it comes to providing the kid with basic advice on blue fairies). But she must surely have wished she'd used a little extra petrol and driven them both to the crusher when the kid robot started all that whining and pleading. "Creepy Kid" had turned into "Tiny Tears"I can only assume that this is what Kubrick intended. A young boy with all the attributes of a young boy except that he isn't remotely like one and so cannot engage our sympathies any more then the twin girls in "The Shining" did. This creature is to be feared and destroyed, as are others like him. But can this idea be fashioned into a story? Not by Kubrick who wisely handed it over to Spielberg because it is "closer to his sensibilities" (in other words Spielberg knows how to replace story with sentiment). I won't give away the ending because Spielberg doesn't have one, although he tries to compensate for this by trying 5 different ones (a sure sign of a film with no story)I would not recommend this film to kids because despite some showy special effects it's too slow with not much happening for long periods. And its not sophisticated enough for adults. I assume it was made strictly for robots and teddies only. And blue fairies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>film to artificially inseminate your mind!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my case, AI was the most eagerly awaited of projects. As far back as 1996 when Kubrick announced his attention to basically "bow out" with this production, my every instinct told me it would be a masterpiece, the "2001" of the new millennium...an expectation I have absolutely no doubt would have eventuated had God not required Kubrick's presence in a Director's chair of his own!It is my own personal theory that Kubrick was yet so emmeshed in the potential and development of this great work that he was functioning little above auto-pilot during the three years or so he spent completing the uniquely pointless EYES WIDE SHUT. That Spielberg, great director that he is, should inherit this project, was an accident waiting to happen. It is much akin to asking James Cameron (hand artist extraordinaire - for those who have the slightest idea what I am talking about!) to paint a new "Van Gough!" To his credit, I believe Spielberg did a pretty good job and has retained many Kubrickian images in his future world. Shots of a submerged New York - the result of the melting of the ice caps - is quite brilliant...the stonework holding up the bridges - great stuff! In the end though we are left with an impossible clash of visions. Kubricks melancholia, Spielberg's "happy american families."David, the young android however, is still for me, despite the futuristic setting, no more than D.A.R.Y.L. revisited which simply HAS to be the film-inspiration for AI.</fullReview>

There were several instances where the Bear who is also a Robot expressed emotion, cause and effect, concern and reason. Just to name two He says' to David, "David if I fall I will break" when he falls he even uses words associated with pain. (cause and effect). Next, He saves the lock of hair?? why?? he's a robot?? but he "thinks" he should save it and then later produces the hair AFTER it's explained david will need DNA from his mother if she is to be brought back. (Reasoning) There are several instances of his Intelligence throughout the movie as well as emotion. When the boys are arguing he chooses mama over the boys so as not to insight jealousy?? When the dare comes up watch the bear. etc... watch it again and focus primarily on the bear let me know what you think</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AI is a stultifyingly overblown fable comprising an uneasy blend of "2001 Space Odyssey", "Blade Runner," "Zardoz" and "Pinochio", to name a few. The first half hour of the film meticulously builds viewer interest but it becomes "ludicrouser and ludicrouser" as it lumbers into it's disjointed and long overdue close. The only memorable bit in the entire film is the Teddy bear toy with the ridiculously inappropriate voice better suited to Attilla the Hun. But the laughs, badly needed, were unintentional and coerced out of the rather inert surrounding mass of the film. At the (most welcome) end of the film, one feels no sympathy for the numbing repetitiveness of the Mekka boy's interminable needs. He has all the charm and fascination of a much cruder mechanism, the broken record with a needle repeating one phrase over and over.</fullReview>

Let's just say that I'm glad my DVD player has a fast forward button. It even goes op to 1500% speed. That did a lot of good for me. The first 10 minutes are, well, okay I guess. Then it gets boring... even more boring... irritating... painfully irritating... and in the end just painful. The story is thinner than the disc. Effects are adequate but nothing special. The acting is acceptable, in a way that sitting at home on a saturday night watching the raindrops slide down your window is acceptable. Anything worth mentioning?

		<shortDescription>A bad day at the office for Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One would think that a science fiction film produced and directed by Steven Spielberg (who also contributed to the screenplay) inspired by the vision of the late Stanley Kubrick would have to be a brilliant work of monumental significance. Think again.This story was a passion for Kubrick, who always wanted to film it. Spielberg picked it up as homage to Kubrick and attempted to imbue it with Kubrickian nuances. While the film is clearly infused with the sci-fi spirit of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it has neither the dramatic power nor the philosophical depth of that classic. Instead, we have an insignificant and disjointed human interest story, full of sentimental pap about a boy who isn't even human.To be sure, the visual effects are outstanding. With Spielberg at the helm, this was bound to be a given. Using the latest technology and a $90 Million budget, Spielberg cranks out another effects show that rivals his latest Jurassic Park episode (another dud of a screenplay with great visuals). However, the story never gets any traction and we are left hoping the characters would just shut up and get to the next computer generated image.The first hour of the movie is boring and tedious as we see robot boy David (Haley Joel Osment) attempt to adapt to his new human family and vice versa. Then suddenly Spielberg tries to shake thing up by throwing David into the standard futuristic anarchical society, a backdrop long ago rendered hackneyed in this genre. Shifting into third gear, we are then taken on a sci-fi junket to old New York, now semi-submerged from the effects of global warming, which have caused the oceans to rise at least 200 feet to cover all but the highest skyscrapers (we cannot possibly have a sci-fi film lately without some political hyperbole lurking in the subtext). Then fourth gear and we go on a journey far into future where David comes face to face with advanced beings in his quest to become a real boy, just like Pinocchio.Spielberg attempts to meld ET, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and 2001 A Space Odyssey, to create a mosaic of themes that does justice to none of them. The last segment is punctuated by the advanced beings driveling about how the human race is the one true link to the meaning of life. This is extremely ironic given the events of David's journey including vile children mocking him, parents who abandon him, a flesh fair and a futuristic red light district full of violence and debauchery.The film is also full of annoyingly unbelievable depictions, such as a love robot (Jude Law) who is a sophisticated piece of technology able to reason and operate at a very high level, who has to crick his neck to turn on his mood music.The acting is terrific, despite the vapid dialogue. Haley Joel Osment just keeps getting better and better. He presents just the right balance of robotic disconnection with his human counterparts and the sincere efforts of an emotional being attempting to emerge. Jude Law also gives another outstanding performance as Joe Gigolo, stealing just about every scene in which he appears.This was supposed to be one of the all time blockbusters, but despite putting up decent numbers, it failed to even match its budget at the box office. For once, I have to agree with the masses that this film just failed to distinguish itself beyond the special effects. I rated it a 6/10. Mark it up as a bad day at the office for Steven Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film has melted my brain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most amazingly confusing films i've ever seen. You can watch A.I on two levels; you can let spielberg take you on an epic emotional ride, or you can really look at the film and what it all means. This film is a manipulative masterpiece. It bends you and pulls you in all different directions so that by the end you don't know what's going on. When i saw this film first, i felt dazed, confused, and abused. I think spielberg crosses the line in trying to make the story touching (although he didn't really need to try), and ended up making it sadistic. When you try to make sense of ai emotionally, it;s all over the place, characters motivations don't really seem to be thought out. The story is bizarre in places and unbelievable, yet you almost don't see it because spielberg is so adept at manipulating the audience. While carried away on the emotion and the stirring music, it's difficult to look at what's going on objectively. Ai makes you feel incredibly emotionally involved, yet there is always a niggling doubt about how much sense the film actually makes. Underneath all the dripping emotion Spielberg has laid on, AI's story takes unbelievable twists and turns, it has THE worst voice over ever written, and the treatment of the boy by everyone in the film and fate itself is so cruel and sadistic when you actually think about it that it is incredible that this is supposed to be a kids film?! AI has to be seen to be believed, despite how cruel it is to its central character in order to make us cry. It's half the best film ive ever seen, half the worst, most bizzare film ive ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not one of Spielberg's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I'm being too harsh; this film was, after all, heavily hyped up as the first (and obviously last) Kubrick-Spielberg collaboration. From the directors of 2001: A Space Odyssey and E.T. (which Spielberg seems to be re-releasing to recover from this flop) respectively, it's got a lot of Sci-fi heritage to live up to. Although, he can annoy me, I can't deny that Hayley Joel Osment was great, as was, although I don't like him either, Jude Law. But they didn't strike up enough of a friendship in my opinion, although I DO suppose they WERE robots?- you couldn't imagine, say, the Terminator and Robocop buying each other beers down the pub. As for all those moral questions that were raised at the start, well, they seemed to be drowned out by the spectacle of the flesh fair, the special effects of which were pretty remarkable, and never brought up again.As for the last half hour-WHOA! Since when did Spielberg start taking psychedelic drugs?! They should've simply left it with David staring at the ?blue fairy'? All in all, not great but, has its moments. Then again, what can you say about a film in which your favourite character was a 2 foot talking teddy bear?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A short analysis with spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Artificial Intelligence" has to be classified as an extremely interesting failure. Interesting due to the ideas being presented and a failure because there are just too many of them causing the film to veer wildly in tone. Many have suggested that the reason for the film's weaknesses was due to the odd collaboration of Kubrick and Spielberg. However, the problems with the film have less to do with the different styles of these two famous directors and more with the ideas being considered.For example, the first third of the movie explores how a family reacts to a robot made and programmed to act like a boy (A similar theme was explored in the movie "DARYL"). The second part of the film deals with the conflicts between "orga" and "mecha", in addition to which we have David's quest for the Blue Fairy, someone he hopes will turn him into a real boy. Finally, in the last part (which everyone seems to hate), we have the interesting concept of a temporary resurrection (would one day be enough?) and the ambiguous ending. Stuck in between the rest is a small thread dealing with William Hurt's character who has created the prototype for his mecha boy in the image of his own (presumably dead) son. Any of these ideas have the potential for a movie of their own. Crammed into one movie, it just doesn't work. The William Hurt thread is shown so briefly I wonder why they bothered with it at all.In addition to the "idea" problems, there are major holes in the logic of the script which detract from the viewing experience. I found myself shaking my head at the screenplay's inconsistencies. For example, why does a robot manufacturing firm place its offices in a drowned city? If the company put so much effort into tracking and finding David in the first place, why did they just let him sit at the bottom of the ocean for so long? (It's an effective scene but I found myself asking that question again and again.) The reason for an individual lasting only one day seems pretty convoluted but I'll allow it as that is fairly typical of science fiction. Didn't Monica get in trouble for setting David adrift in the woods? He was a fairly expensive piece of machinery and her husband stresses the trust the company is putting in him by allowing David in their home. Why does David break down while eating but not while at the bottom of the pool? (So water is okay but spinach isn't?) In addition, it was pretty reassuring to see at the Flesh Festival that tacky T-shirts will never be out of fashion. Finally, the biggest plot hole of all, the one that made me roll my eyes: All companies exist for the bottom line (to make a profit). It stands to reason that some people would be unhappy with their mecha child and return it. If the robot isn't severely damaged, it could potentially be resold. SO....WHY ON EARTH WOULD THE IMPRINTING PROGRAM BE IRREVERSIBLE? They can make a robot love but they can't remove the programming? Seems a little hard to believe. Well, the real reason is that they wouldn't have a movie otherwise. When the entire point upon which a movie turns is so illogical, the movie itself will be weakened by it.But there were some very good things, too. The special effects were eye-popping and these effects alone almost made the movie worth viewing. There were many terrific scenes: the Flesh Festival, Rouge City (though Dr. Know was a little silly), Coney Island submerged and many more. The movie had stand-out performances. Frances O'Connor was very good as the conflicted mother and Jude Law very interesting as Gigolo Joe (though I did wonder why a sex robot would be able to wax so philosophical). The character of Teddy was interesting without being over"bear"ing (excuse the pun). But Haley Joel Osment really shines in his portray of David. With a lesser child actor in the role, the movie would have probably fallen apart for most viewers. The scene I remember most is the subtle but sublime change of expression that comes over his face when Monica concludes the imprinting program. Beautiful. I hope we see more of him in the future.In the end, Artificial Intelligence is a flawed film with some good performances and great special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stephen Spielberg is not a god after all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge Speilberg fan I went into this movie with high expectations, all of which were dashed in the first half hour. I watched this movie on video and I actually TURNED IT OFF partway through. My faith in Stephen Spielberg caused me to turn it back on and give it another chance. It never got any better.Never have I seen so much talent and so many wonderful visual effects so wasted! Haley Joel Osment was stunning and heart-wrenching as usual. An engaging performance was also given by Jude Law as a streetwise (and very sexy) "mecha" (mechanical person). In fact, all of the actors were wonderful- good and evil. The visual effects were stunning but so well integrated that you hardly noticed them. Perfectly seamless and inconspicuous. Instead of thinking "What lovely effects" you were thinking "Wow, those people are so COOL looking!".The problem was with the script. I have no idea what this film was trying to say. I don't think the writer had any idea what he/she was trying to say! Are we to think that mechanical people are a GOOD thing? A bad thing? Moral? Immoral? I walked away with no idea what I was supposed to think about what I'd seen. It had no purpose or meaning of any kind. It is good to toss around deep moral issues but this film seemed to be afraid to draw any conclusions so just meandered pointlessly on and on.The worst thing about this film was the pointless manipulation of the viewers emotions. It was deeply disturbing and had many scenes that were almost impossible to watch, particularly for a mother. The character of David (the main AI character) is portrayed with enormous humanity and sympathy both in the writing and in Haley Joel's portrayal of him. Then the film proceeds to spend the rest of the film putting him in the most pointless and heartbreaking situations. It was absolutely painful to watch and an insult to the talents of all involved.If I were Stephen Spielberg I would be ashamed to have my name associated with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And here we have "A.I.", which (if nothing else) has got the dubious distinction of being the most exasperating, ambiguous movie to be unleashed upon poor Joe Summer Movie-goer since...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, EVER.You can't imagine how excited I was to watch this movie; if only to find out how I'd react to it. I've become something of an Internet nerd over the past few years, and this movie polarized people more than any other I've ever encountered. (Well, unless you count "Patch Adams", and I don't.)This is a three-act movie. As a whole, "A.I." gets a lucky seven, but I felt differently about each of it's parts. So, here comes a three-part review.Part One: Definitely the best of the lot. In a strange way, it reminded me of when I saw "E.T." for the first time as a little kid. The whole thing, in both cases, is filmed from the main character's point of view. Both E.T. and David are well under five feet tall, so everything seems to loom over you, lending a sublimely frightening tone. Pair that with the fact that David is a very creepy little creature and you have the world's most subversive kid's movie for adults.Part Two: The second act is very good, introducing the seedier side of this particular fantasy universe and sending David off on his quest. I don't want to give too much away, but it's nearly a parody of the Disney fairy-tale movies, putting little David in some very real danger, giving him a sex fiend and a virtual pet for his Obligatory Scene-Stealing Sidekicks (actually, Gigalo Joe and Teddy are easily the best characters in the film), and then suggesting that his harrowing journey was futile. And, most importantly, there is a point in Act Two where I felt the movie was going to end (I'll only say angel, ferris wheel, and submarine, just so you know when). The way the story sets itself up, there's really no chance of a happy ending.But then we get Part Three.Part Three: What... the... hell...?Aside from the silly Deus ex machina (or, rather, machina ex machina, or something) in the final act, this is easily the best overlooked Science Fiction film since "GATTACA". Don't let its pedigree distract you and you'll like it just fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is an issue with this film I've not read in the reviews already posted. First let me tick off in point form some issues I had that you can read more about in the reviews of others.- too soft to be serious science fiction/thought - too many holes and inconsistencies to be serious science fiction/thought - gets rather dark and moody to be purely a family feel-good story - dialogue too dummied down to be serious science fiction/thought - "as close to a real boy as possible?" C'mon, gimme a break, this kid couldn't even eat, and had no social grace whatsoever - the whole "play god" thing was way to poorly developed to be seriously contemplated...which brings me to my main frustration...Which brings me to the real issue in this film. 2001/2010 gave me a somewhat more satisfying suggestion at how our existence resolves. This film leaves me empty, asking "is that it? Is that what we're about?"While 2001/2010 did not concede to a Judeo/Christian Bible explanation for who we are, why we're here and where we're going, its alternativesuggestion seems plausible, seemingly as "right" as any alternative could be. Response from people who've seen these movies (especially 2001) come away saying it gave them a new sense of spirituality and inner peace). Moreover, the manner in which 2001 went about suggesting this resolution did not take cheap shots to slap religion in the face.AI takes cheap shots, in the most immature of ways. Religion in this movie is trashed altogether. That within itself isn't the highest crime. What's even lower than the cheap shots is what is suggested as the alternative explanation - an explanation as dry and scientifically apologetic as could be. Resurrection is a matter of DNA sampling a la Jurassic Park. Sheesh. Spielberg sucks all the mystery out of existence and postures as though pure science can answer the sublime questions of life. This is the most dishonest insult. 2001 never even tried to explain "how" Dave (note even using the same name to identify the two "beings" - David in 2001 goes from human to beyond and David in AI goes from machine to human, somewhat, with the crying and the sleeping, and the love) became that newborn space child. It never tried to explain how that giant thing throughout history interacted to take earthly thought and human development to the "next level" - it admits that, currently, we just don't know. And the movie ends (even through 2010) never trying to explain how; it just presented the facts (the way existence actually has) and presses us to accept the facts and make whatever meaning we can.AI is pompous, displaying no humility before the awesome grandeur of existence and its mysteries. That would have been ok if AI aspired to offer something tangible to defend its stance as having the answers.It failed - and miserably, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love reading comments by people and wondering what they are looking at when they rate a movie. TO me A.I. is successful on many levels but fails on others. The acting in the film is wonderful. I'm not a big fan of Sixth Sense, in which everyone went crazy over Haley Joel, but his performance here has silenced me. It just seemed as though everyone was raving over him just because everyone else was. I've been a fan of Jude Law's work since Gattaca and he does a great job in the film as well. I've heard so many mixed reviews of this movie---it sucks (which is the worst comment because it has no reasoning), it was boring, made no sense, did not follow correct format...etc... i can understand most people's comments about the movie. I too grew a little bored the second time i saw it. But what makes this movie interesting to me is that i have a hard time figuring out if i enjoyed it or not. I thought about the themes and questions it raises...then i think about how the story had some loop holes,...then i remember back to those shots in the film that were beautiful. Well to get to the point...if you enjoy slow thought provoking films with great FX (other then blowing stuff up) and beautiful cinematography then see this film. If you prefer something with less thinking and more action do not see this film. There is a difference between not liking a film and thinking it is bad. Just because you did not like it does not mean it is bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take Blade Runner and Pinocchio. Stir for 2 1/2 hours. Get AI.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"AI" really consists of (at least) three parts, and each of these parts has enough material to fill a movie of its own. And each of the three parts leaves many open questions and/or contains inconsistencies that might have been resolved if more time had been devoted to them. But the way they have been put together, the result is a pretty long and pretty bizarre movie that, especially in its second half, makes little sense.The first part, which comes closest to being relatively well-rounded and consistent, bears few surprises for anyone who has read even a two-sentence summary of the movie. But even in this part one might have liked to see more about the way "David" was created or about the global climate changes that are summarized in a brief narration at the beginning of the movie and that seem somewhat gratuitously thrown in.The second part (the "Flesh Fair" and "Rouge City") gets a lot stranger already. "Blade Runner for Toddlers", as someone else wrote, isn't too far from the mark. The movie continues to build parts of a science-fiction world that are insufficiently motivated or explained: Where do all the "unlicensed" robots come from? Why are "Flesh Fairs" tolerated?But the third part (in New York City) is just outright bizarre. It certainly could have easily filled not just one, but two movies, but it's all condensed to about 45 minutes spanning, no less, 2000 years of events. Given this, details cannot possibly matter, so why not suggest (as the movie does) that Coney Island is at the Rockefeller Center?! (Ok, I guess it might have moved in the future...)It is hard and almost pointless to rate this movie. I can see why some critics thought it should get an Oscar for "best picture" while others awarded it their own "worst film of 2001" award. The points about parent-child relationships that the movie tries to make in its own manipulative kind of way simply do not warrant this elaborate setup (that isn't nearly elaborate enough to make any sense). There are simply too many things that are irrelevant to the movie's main message. One might say it's still worth seeing this movie because there isn't anything quite like it - but perhaps it's good that there isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dear Steven Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched your beautifully sad film for the second time, this time with my sons. My 12 year old cried like me at the end, and the 8 year old was confused. When I first saw this in the theater I was a bit confused, and I rejected the final ending. But I also rejected the ending of Schindler's List, balking at the emotion, seeking the experience of a documentary. Then, upon home viewing, I learned that Schindler's List was a great film. Not too long ago I watched Jaws with the kids, and I was impressed with how much more than a mere scare movie it was. I saw it when it came out in the theaters, with my father, no less.Artificial Intelligence is extraordinary in part because it is so personal, I think. Anyone familiar with enneagrams will see David for the four that he is. Being a four, by the end I was in accute pain, pain for David, pain for all loss, for those in this world who feel that they never quite arrive, never quite regain that lost golden love that haunts us all our days. This is a difficult topic and for this reason I think so many people were not swept away by this film. It is not Indiana Jones. I think the story of someone as unseen as David, set in the context of a big budget picture is truly jarring, and splendid all at once. And for all the sadness, and irony, there is humor in there, if you dig beneath the ice.There is a reckless integrity to the film, defying the odds of all accepted norms. I for one am grateful it was made, and I understand, I think, the reason it was made. To be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real name for movie "Bladerunner for toddlers".As a Kubrick fanatic, it bothers me that his name appears on this film. Spielberg has tendencies to wrap everything up sappy &amp; neat . AI is truly the worst example of this. How can you approach subjects such as robotic love vs. human love &amp; alien existence then end up turning it into a child's fairytale? The aliens were particularly absurd because he used them just to pull more emotional sap from the audience. Yeah, they've mastered the entire universe but we can only bring back Mommy for one day. Please Spielberg, grow a sack. This movie had potential but Kubrick died before the proper vision could be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor mixture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI was an odd movie. It contained some of Kubrick's cold intellect tempered with the Spielberg sweetness. The two did not mix well. I enjoyed the examination of human love and the story concerning the luddite view towards the mecas but the whole thing about the little boy pining for his mommy's love was way too ETish for an otherwise rather cold movie. If the movie would have gone closer toward one or the other aspects it may have been more successful. But to give the movie its due I must admit the special effects were very impressive. I stepped through a couple of scenes with DVD slowness to try and discern how a particular effect was accomplished and was impressed with the craft. The scene in the beginning where the meca's face is opened up was stunning. I gave the movie a higher rating for its craft but I doubt I will revisit the movie as I have revisited Kubrick's movies. Maybe that is the difference between Kubrick and Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's rolling over in his grave...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know who paid off the critics in Hollywood to give this film the rave reviews it got; but, it sure fooled a lot of us movie-goers, though apparently not enough since the film failed to make even $80 million despite a $100+ million budget and a huge marketing campaign to boot(let's not forget that Spielberg films routinely make $100 million or more). Thankfully, that says a lot about word-of-mouth. It's a shame, too, because Spielberg is a very gifted director, but the truth is that he missed the boat on this one.The story, which has been compared to 'Bicentennial Man' is really more akin to 'Pinocchio', except it's not nearly as well told. Spielberg (or maybe Kubrick) failed to see the point of a toy-wants-to-be-boy story. First of all, in 'Pinocchio', our sympathy lies with the parent, Gephetto, who cannot have a child and is presented with the opportunity through the puppet, a misguided toy who may never fulfill that need. In AI, that element is totally absent; the parents are not only capable of conceiving, they already have a spoiled child of their own (I know he's in a coma at first). The biggest point missed in the toy-to-boy story was that of human choice-making. In 'Pinocchio', the puppet must make some very real choices (concerning greed, selfishness, etc) on his way to gaining his humanity, and we feel sorry for him because of the consequences of those choices (which ultimately affect his father). In AI, however, the robot never makes any choices; he is just an isolated victim of circumstances with no "conscious" (even so much as a cricket) just rolling along with the plot... and rolling... and rolling... for an hour too long.Sure, the film looks good and feels big, but, like its hero, is nothing more than an expensive artificial creation that we, as audience members, can hardly get attached to - much less really ever come to like. 1.5/5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a fizzer, what stinker, about 1 hour too long...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one lesson I think Steven Spielberg needs to learn is that a lot of money does not make a good film. Granted this is maybe an overly simple view, but the truth of the matter is that A.I was over-hyped, under-made and at the end of the day a very ill-considered film. I recall a very apt quote from Orson Welles, he said something like "...I think it's possible to ruin a film by giving a director too much money...". Indeed this says it well and A.I. is a very flash production, the effects are very nice and the robot effects work visually well. However, as with other films of this kind, millions of dollars worth of sfx do not compensate for a badly written plot with lengthy arduous dialogue. All in all the movie is about an hour too long, it's the kind of pacing that Kubrick might well have been famous for but the this film lacks any of the character of films by either Kubrick or Spielberg. I should have listened to my friends and not wasted the $7.50 on this fizzer of a film. I often gauge the worth and immersion of a film by the amount of times I notice the incandescent "exit" signs at the front of the theater... In this case I noticed them so many times I lost count. Why oh why, do they not theatrically re-release "Duel" which in my opinion is one of Spielberg's greatest and most moving pictures to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice, cynical plot spoiled by crappy sentimental icing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To tell you the truth, I don't have any factual information about which parts of the movie were Kubric and which Spielberg, but I have a pretty good hunch.I suppose everybody knows the plot of the movie at least roughly by now. The beginning of the movie was good and it culminated to quite a touching and effective scene, which was followed by...Power rangers on motorcycles. Jar Jar Binks -caliber uncomfortable embarassment. Complete lack of feeling of faerytale. Plot that jumps here and there, almost raises interesting points and then races over and around them and headlong to some over-sentimental cliche.I don't know if the ending was originally Spielberg or Kubric, but the most irritating thing was that there was a point in there that would've made it work, but apparently Spielberg decided to turn it into "and everybody had cake and fun was had by all - cue the tears, please"-crap.Last time I felt like I had wasted money like this on a movie was Mission to Mars. So, if you want to see a nice plot being turned into a mishmash quilt of over-sentimental crap and watered-down good scenes, go see AI. If you happen to be a Kubric fan, stay out and save some adrenaline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Story Spoilers, Check Pinocchio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI. Artificial Intelligence. ET. Extra Terrestrial. That pretty much summed up my personal expectations of this movie. Expectations and reality frequently differ, and thank goodness for that.When it came to watching AI, the ET expectations fell away to a large extent, leaving only traces for the greater part of the movie: although when the fantastic moon-like craft rises over the horizon to chase down the rogue androids I half expected a boy on a bicycle to pass across its face in silhouette.But no, in AI, Eliot is ET. He is the alien here, the stranger in a strange land, and he doesn't want to phone home, he wants to be home. The boy, David, wants to be home with his mommy, and he wants to be loved like a real boy. He wants, in short, to be a real boy. From the moment the story of Pinocchio is read to him, that is what he dreams of.Of course, he may not realise such a dream, but all the while throughout the movie, given that this is Spielberg, you can't help wondering (and worrying!) that David's dream will come true. And why shouldnt it? Because that is what happens when you wish upon a star.Fortunately, Spielberg's wishes for this movie are built upon the young star of Haley Joel Osment, and around him he builds an impressive cast who apply such talent and gifts to the project that it is difficult not to be enchanted by the entire spell.Ultimately, it is magical, because this is a retelling of Pinocchio. Reinforced by such superb performances from Jude Law (the Fox) and William Hurt (Gipetto). There is even the quite brilliant Teddy Bear, a sort of Jiminy Cricket figure, but sadly, I felt, underused in terms of how he might have acted as the boy's conscience throughout his adventures. So for me the character represented a superbly realised missed opportunity.In addition to Pinocchio, the film draws heavily (perhaps inevitably these days) on Blade Runner, for its presentation and production, but the designers have enough flair and creativity to take those influences and reshape them and make them their own. But whatever other influences creep in here and there, Pinocchio, ultimately, rules throughout.Pinocchio has inspired Spielberg before, and perhaps here he is coming clean about a habit he first hinted at with Close Encounters, and its When You Wish Upon A Star theme. Where this particular fairy tale falls down, and unfortunately it falls down badly, is into the abyss of deepest sentiment, where Spielberg so often finds himself floundering.Don't go there, Steven! Stay away from there! Walk into the light! You know what happens if you fall in!Well, apparently, Mr Spielberg still needs to learn that particular lesson. We are not artificial, Steven, we are human: we can feel our own emotions, without the need for having them parcelled up in such huge candy-coated packages for subsequent ramming down our throats. Such huge lumps in our throats are liable to choke us.When I watched AI, somebody upped and left during the last 10% of the movie. I wouldn't go that far, but it was hard to bear. Such an over-egging of the sentimental pudding did not do this movie any favours, and in fact undid a great deal of the strengths it had demonstrated before. In short, the magic, for me, dissipated in what amounted to highly artificial tears. Whereas I had felt for and empathised with the boy, David, and his predicament before, by the time we reach the end, I found it all laid on too thickly for my taste. And all of this at a time (striving to be relatively spoiler-free here) the audience is being asked to suspend its disbelief one gigantic leap further.What you end up with, then, is a groundbreaking movie, with a very unsatisfactory finale - rather too akin to the original studio release of Blade Runner. More human than human, as they say at Tyrell...Well, I beg to differ Mr Tyrell, because in my book, we still call that artificial. Synthetic. And when it comes to emotions, a subtler hand is appreciated, because if the story is told well, those feelings for the central character will take their course. Naturally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Speilberg have a brain tumor?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's the only reason I can come up with to explain this movie's zigzagging story line. The Kubrick touches were there, but who cares? You either do it exactly the way Kubrick would have wanted it, or you do your own interpretation. You can't have it both ways and end up with a satisfying film. The biggest problem is that no one at Warner Brothers had the guts tell Lord Speilberg that he had a movie with a meandering plot. How can you tell God that He's doing something wrong? Speilberg must have been running around the Warner lot like Nigel Hawthorne in The Madness of King George spouting nonsensical plot points. All the executives must have been smiling and nodding politely. "Yeah, Mr. Speilberg, that's a good idea. Isn't that a good idea, fellas?"Another user said that if you leave after the ferris wheel drops, you'll be satisfied with the film. I must disagree. Even though I can handle a sad ending, it still wouldn't have fit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>true artifice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a summer of wearisome cookie-cutter action FX schlock, AI rises above the ashes by presenting a truly troubling future world wound around the story of a young robot that has been programmed to love, but is not loved in return. David is a mecha, a mechanical being created with a special ability to truly love his 'orga' (organic being) mother and father. He will be an answer to the many families that are not allowed children in a future of diminishing prosperity and possibility. A test subject, he is placed with a family where the mother is grief stricken over the loss of her son, who has been frozen while they seek a cure for his cancer. David enters the family, wins acceptance and love, and then is eventually rejected and thrown out into the world. The rejection is not one of cruelty - it is caused by several misunderstandings after the real son is cured. His quest to win the love of the 'Mommy' that rejected him is the core of his wanderings.Steven Spielberg, directing material prepared by the late Stanley Kubrick, is a master of manipulating audience emotion. Usually he is helped by the material, whether it be lost aliens on Earth, Indiana Jones, dinosaurs running amock, or something as serious as the holocaust. Kubrick is the opposite: a master at pointing out the farcicality of life and making us question our beliefs. The result of this melange of creators is troubling and thought-provoking, but emotionally unsatisfying. Spielberg produces moments of strong emotional impact, but is not allowed payoff (except in the most artificial way). He has saddled himself with a story that can have no happy ending, and because the character cannot learn from his yearnings, he has no 'arc'.A dramatic arc is what a character must pass through on the way to evolving into someone better, more mature. In a film about an ordinary child rejected by his mother, the arc would be that child's eventual understanding and acceptance about his own faults and those of his mother's that caused the rift, his forgiveness of his mother, and his getting on with his own life. In the case of David, you have emotionally a vehicle like the Terminator. He will not stop seeking a way to earn the love of his mother no matter what, even if she is dead, and he cannot or will not learn from what life is teaching him. In many ways this quest is hardwired into all of us - no one wants to be rejected by their mother - but his inability to transcend this dilemma makes him an empty vehicle for an audience to follow. The answer in the end for this film is an artificial one, although it is provided in a very thought-provoking and disturbing context regarding the future of humanity.The technical aspects of the film are extraordinary, and Spielberg has created an evocative and interesting future world with a drowned Manhattan and places like Rouge City. The only section that really did not work for me was the Flesh Faire, where blood-mad humans cheer the destruction of mechanical men. The acting is very good, especially Haley Joel Osment as David and Frances O'Connor as his 'mother' Monica, who have a wrenching scene of child abandonment in the woods. Jude Law is unsatisfying as Gigolo Joe - as a mecha he can only have so much volition, and it comes and goes in spurts. I thought he captured the role of the loverboy robot well, but it felt like that role had never really been formed in the context of David's quest. Joe can add neither true information or direction for David, just a road map to the next scene. Spielberg's ability to create delightful fairy-tale creations comes across in Teddy, an animatronic walking Teddy Bear who manages to add gravity and support to David's quest. Forever supportive, never intrusive and never dumb, he is the perfect sidekick. He even stitches himself back up if his fur has been damaged.I have several complaints about the technical aspects of the film's plot, however. In once scene David damages himself by eating spinach. Since we see him immersed in water several times, it is apparent that he is capable of ingesting that and not being damaged. Why would spinach hurt him? Furthermore, if you are going to make a mecha as much like a human as possible, wouldn't it make sense if his mouth is going to lead to his insides to create a place for food to go, should he ingest it, and a spigot out so he can expel it?The second major point is the motivations for the mechas. By now Asimov's laws of robotics are known and accepted (robots shall not hurt humans etc.) Are these mechas not programmed this way? Gigolo Joe is forced to go on the run after he is implicated in a murder where the murderer confesses the crime in front of him. Isn't his robot brain recording everything? Won't it become evidence in the trial of the true murderer? Isn't Joe hardwired to call the cops upon seeing a crime and standing by to give assistance in any way possible? Wouldn't that make more sense?I have seen AI once and will not see it again. A Spielberg film you see for bang and the emotional fulfillment. A Kubrick film you watch in order to ponder the implications and laugh in retrospect over the farce that is life. This film neither really delivers on either end, it is often static, and I felt unsatisfied watching it. But I do urge anyone to see it who has not, simply to support something with a brain and an effort to inform. Noble purposes deserve their support, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So promising, yet so bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Artificial Intelligence," Steven Spielberg teases us with the beginnings of possibly the greatest science-fiction story ever told but is unable to follow his (and Stanley Kubrick's) vision to its logical conclusion. The final half-hour, cheesy-sentimental enough to make one nostalgic for "Hook," completely undermines the bold questions and ideas set forth in the early stages of the story. A lot of print reviews have referred to "AI" as "frustrating," and I'm right there with them. It was sometimes invigorating to see Spielberg shed his typical cinematic inhibitions in "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan," but at the same time it seemed fairly obvious that the director was only willing to "play dirty" in the context of true-to-life stories about crimes against humanity. That theory is absolutely proven wrong in "AI," which presents us with easily some of the most disturbing imagery in all Spielberg's repetoir (including the aforementioned two films). It's a genuine thrill to see Spielberg revel in such dark and twisted material, which often evokes the best of Bradbury in its mixture of weirdness and plausibility. And then the story stops. Doesn't end, doesn't fade out; just stops. The movie goes on for another half-hour, but the story is over. There are scenes and characters that have nothing whatsoever to do with the prior two hours of the film, and then there is an ending that is at best a misguided attempt at closure and at worst a shameless pandering to studio execs and families with young children (who really shouldn't be at this movie in the first place).And, oh yeah, the acting. Well, what do you think? It's a Spielberg film. The performances are incredible across the board, from established stars like William Hurt and Jude Law to newer faces like Frances O'Connor, Sam Robards, and Jake Thomas (an excellent child actor well worth keeping an eye on). And Haley Joel Osment, not surprisingly, is outstanding. Even if we can never really understand what his robotic character feels, we can easily see that he has as much potential to be torn up inside as a human being does.The direction, acting, effects, and photography all represent Spielberg at the very top of his game. The problem, therefore, lies in the writing, where the film never delivers on what it promises in terms of either plot or emotion. It's putting it mildly to say that Spielberg has easy access to the most talented screenwriters in the world, and yet for some reason he decided to write the script himself. I can almost understand his rationale for doing so. Here is a story so large in scope, yet so intensely personal and human, that Spielberg probably couldn't stand the idea of trying to explain his specific vision to other writers, shepherding them through rewrite after rewrite. Alas, the director just isn't a strong enough writer to pull off this script on his own. He probably did a better job than most writers would have done, but this project really needed the absolute best of the best. This was the wrong time for Spielberg to indulge his fantasies of being a true 'auteur'. I recommend seeing "AI," but only if you are willing to walk out of the theater as soon as Ben Kingsley finishes narrating the underwater scene. (You'll know it when you see it.) Do this and you'll end up with a great cinematic experience. Otherwise, be prepared for a world of disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pinnochio re-imagined</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(www.plasticpals.com) Is the acronym "A.I." really so obscure that they felt they had to spell it out in the title? In any case, Stanley Kubrick's vision for the film, based loosely on Brian Aldiss' "Supertoys Last All Summer Long" would never reach the screen. I wonder what kind of movie it would have been had he directed it himself, but I suppose we'll have to make do with Steven Spielberg's take on it. Which is not to say that I dislike the film, or even Spielberg's work in general, though I will hold Jurassic Park 2: The Lost World against him.A.I. is one of the better sci-fi films concerning robots in the past decade. It focuses its lens on David, an extremely realistic robot child played to perfection by Haley Joel Osment, designed for infertile parents yearning for a child of their own. The first act explores the relationships that develop between the robot and his adoptive mother, as well as that with his real life, flesh and blood "brother" who unexpectedly returns home from the hospital. The complications that arise from this dynamic are wonderfully illustrated, ramping up to David's heart-breaking abandonment by his "mother".Beginning in the 2nd act, David's quest to become a real boy begins in earnest, borrowing unabashedly from the story of Pinocchio. David's desire to become real is however, so much more potent than that of Pinocchio, for it is driven by the longing to be loved by his mother. And it's here that I feel the film loses much of the impact it could have had had it stayed within the domestic setting. As a result of this shift it becomes more of an adventure movie, though it continues to examine the role of robots in the world: as victims in the mock-execution show Flesh Fair, and prostitutes in sinful cityscapes. David's partner through much of the film is expertly portrayed by Jude Law, who's Gigolo Joe seems to possess the innocence (and perhaps the intelligence) of a child.The film has a weird double ending, one where David is frozen under the sea wishing in front of a statue of his elusive Blue Fairy for centuries. Instead of rolling credits, we're taken on one final journey somehow reminiscent of the final episode in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The only remnants of life left in the frozen wasteland that was once New York City are robots so advanced that they appear alien, excavating the ruins of human civilization. Like the domestic setting in act one I feel that this final act could have been more fully explored at the expense of scenes like the Flesh Fair.A.I. is an intelligent and well crafted film, playing to Spielberg's strengths rather than his sometimes stupid sentimentality (as seen in, for example, War of the Worlds' ending). John Williams' score is typically brilliant. I think Kubrick would have been pleased with the final film, and I don't think I can give it a better recommendation than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artificial Intelligence- A True Classic 10 Years Later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Artificial Intelligence is one of the greatest science fiction films I have ever seen. It is just that good. It is like mixing E.T. with Blade Runner with maybe a little kid movie charm. It deals with a pretty basic concept in science fiction movies. Robots. However, it takes that concept and turns it into a near masterpiece.A.I. is about a machine named David. He is the first of his kind. Here were have a robot that can have emotions. He can feel. He can love. He can have envy. He can have fear. He is human in every way, but everything else makes him seem inhuman. David is played by Haley Joel Osment who is without a doubt, the best child actor ever. Period. He was amazing in The Sixth Sense, but he really steals the show here. Everything from the writing to his great performance makes you care about David from the very beginning. So basically, David is created by a company named Cybertronics whose goal is to advance the technology of Artificial Intelligence. They have finally reach their peak with David. David is given to a couple. They had a son named Martin, but Martin is very ill. At first, the mother disagrees with her husband and his actions of bringing David to their home as she finds no appeal in an attempt of replacing their son Martin. Then the movie goes off from there as you are swept on a visually wonderful, excellently paced, exciting adventure that will pull at your heart strings at every turn. I am being very vague with the plot as I do not want to spoil one bit of it. All the performances in this movie is top notch. Jude Law also gives a great, entertaining performance, but perhaps one of the best characters isn't really real. Who am I speaking of? I am speaking of Teddy. Teddy is a super-toy, one that I wish I had when I was a kid, that has emotions, can think, can talk, and create friendships. He ends up sticking with David throughout his adventure and certain parts of the movie where they get separated just gets a bit emotional. Teddy is David's only real friend in his alone world. But enough of that before I start accidentally spitting spoilers. Bottomline, Teddy is one of the greatest film characters ever! This movie is visually wonderful. They never seem to over-indulge with the CGI. Most of the effects are controlled machines and traditional effects. I love it. The scenery in this movie is not only artistic, but just breathe taking.But what is wrong with this so-called, masterpiece? I have little to complain about, but it is the same thing that may have turned off a few of you out there, but for me it has got to be the ending. The last scenes, while very emotional, drag on a bit and jump-the-shark with a certain twist that I am not going to spoil. To be fair, in hindsight, you should've seen it coming and it really isn't this bad, but I just can't help feel that they were so far in this engrossing adventure that they had no idea how to wrap up all the loose ends. The movie sort of succeeds by the end, but it just gets a bit too weird. It doesn't bother me as much as you would probably think, but it is very forgivable.I cannot recommend this movie enough. If you are a fan of science fiction, watch it. If you are a fan of heart warming movies, watch it. If you just like movies in general, watch it. Artificial Intelligence is one of the best science fiction movies ever and an adventure I plan to go on again with repeated viewings. 10 years later, A.I. is nothing but pure art. It is an amazing film and a classic. It shall stay in my heart forever. I cannot give this anything, but the highest praise. A 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First the good news: This movie has a lot going for it.It has Haley Joel Osment. He's the make-or-break actor in this movie, and I believe he did an incredible job in a very tough role, all the tougher when you consider that much of what he did involved acting on a "green screen" stage. He makes you love him while at the same time you want him to not be such a perfect loving child because you know he's going to get hurt-- even though that shouldn't be possible, and shouldn't matter since he's not human. Should it?It has Jude Law in a part that seems in some ways almost a throw-away to the plot of the movie, but that is done so well it stays with you. I find Jude Law an incredibly charismatic actor with great versatility and unexpected talents; as "Gigolo Joe" the adult entertainment "mecha", he's incredible, capering and literally dancing from appointment to appointment, both impersonal and incredibly personally intimate as the perfect love machine-- literally.It has some incredible special effects that create new and believable times and places that make you want to explore them further when the movie ends. To me, that's one of the tests of a movie's successfulness: does it take me to a place where I can immerse myself in an alternate reality that isn't awkward or jarring? This movie does that-- sometimes.It is visually in many ways a stunning movie in its concepts and their execution.That's the good stuff. The not-so-good stuff: it isn't cohesive enough in plot and story for the viewer to really understand what it's about.On one level, it's the "Pinocchio" story, updated and explored from a slightly different angle. You have the "puppet" who is made so real that ultimately he wants to be real, and cannot stand the pain of knowing he isn't a real boy. And he goes through his odyssey like Pinocchio, in a series of adventures like Pinocchio had, that carry lessons/information he needs to assimilate or to show how in his imperfection as a "puppet" trying to be a boy, he's in some ways more perfect than the real thing.On another level, it's an exploration of the pain and love of the parent/child relationship, and the power of that connection, particularly the connection between mother and child, and whether there can be, or should be, a surrogate for a real child when a real child isn't available.And on a very superficial level, it's something of a morality play about how imperfect humans behave savagely when confronted by the perfection of machines that are programmed to be people who are more perfect than people ever can be.And it's all interesting, in an episodic way, but it doesn't fit together. It's like riding in a car with a manual transmission and a driver who hasn't figured out how to coordinate the controls yet. It moves forwards in fits and starts and with much lurching and grinding of gears, and occasionally the engine is roaring at full throttle while the wheels aren't going anywhere.I enjoyed this movie while at the same time feeling great frustration. It didn't deliver me to the destination it seemed headed for and the ride there was occasionally very bumpy and unpleasant. But the scenery at times was astounding, and the actors delivered performances that made me willing to forgive a lot.But in the end, I think many people will find this movie too flawed for pure entertainment. If you want to sit down cold and watch a movie that takes you from beginning to end with a smooth flow of events and impetus that's always moving in the direction it promises, you are not going to feel this movie delivers. But you may, at the same time, feel glad you watched it anyway.I particularly enjoyed the ending, which is about wish-fulfillment and finally finding that perfect, unflawed, unconditional happiness and shared love, even if it took more than a thousand years of waiting and the end of mankind to get there, and it only lasted for a day. It was the realization that maybe a single day of perfection in love makes a thousand years or more of darkness and stasis and the collapse of everything around you into chaos worthwhile. Maybe if you have the faith to believe that that kind of love is possible, and you get it for a single day, it cancels out all the pain and unbearableness of what's come before it. Wouldn't it be nice to believe in a world that eventually makes everything right and wonderful and worthwhile in one day, one stunningly perfect day that meets your expectations unconditionally and flawlessly?It's a sweet thought and a sweet ending, but it's unsatisfying: because the way that Osment's "Pinocchio" achieves his single perfect day, we know it's really an illusion arranged for him out of pity and an abstract curiosity by literal alien entities that observe it all with a sense of detachment as a sort of laboratory experiment. In the end it isn't real even though it is, because it happened through deus ex machina. Does that count?I've watched this film several times now and there are parts of it that are so good that it frustrates me that in the end, the parts are better than the movie as a whole. So I say: if you're looking for a straightforward entertainment movie that takes a story and tells it well and smoothly, you aren't going to like "A. I. Artificial Intelligence." But if you're the kind of viewer who can forgive the picture's overall flaws because you're happy that there are some incredible parts, I think you'll be glad you spent the time with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not intelligent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if Stanley Kubrick wanted Spielberg to direct what was one of Kubrick's film projects that he never completed, but at any rate, the film Spielberg directed is terrible. Having neither the talent or intelligence of Kubrick, Spielberg took the idea, which was a good one, butchered it, smothered it in Hollywood syrup, and served up this nauseating mess. A.I. is a modern retelling of Pinnochio completely lacking in the fairytale charm. David is an artificial robot who wants to become a real boy. His mother abandons him in a forest. He gets trapped by a witch but escapes along with a gigolo robot named Gigolo Joe. Joe is annoyingly played by Jude Law with a ridiculous neck twitch to switch himself on and off. The go to see Dr. Know - how clever - played by none other than Robin Williams at which point the film seems to be Mork and Mindy and I just threw up my hands, and almost my lunch, and thought what a ridiculous mess this was. SPOILER FOLLOWSIn the end, after 2000 years, David becomes a real boy by the intervention of the Blue Fairy and the movie closes on a cloying note.A.I. is one of Spielberg's bad movies. It's not a complete failure like The Terminal but it certainly falls far short of Jaws or Raiders of the Lost Ark. And it ain't no Kubrick film, that's for damn sure. Since Jaws in 1975 up to Munich in 2005, Spielberg has made 29 movies; that's a movie per year. That's certainly prolific. But it doesn't equate to quality. It doesn't matter how talented a person is, there is a limit to how much good work they can produce. Some people just don't seem to know when to stop. Such is Spielberg. He's like Stephen King who seems to have every word he's ever written published. This results in a lot of low quality stuff that should remain in the desk drawer or, in Spielberg's case, on the story board.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>** Possible Spoilers ** Too long, but thought-Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review on IMDB after reading many written by others. AI does display classic Spielberg touches by having a "childlike" quality of wonder to it, as did ET. The director forces you to become fascinated with David, the main character, who is a robot build in the form of a small boy. I also liked the three act structure, the first, centered on David and his home life, the second showing his relationship with the older "father-figure" robot, and the last, his voyage of discovery.The film is well shot and acted and thought-provoking because it forces you to ask the questions, "What is life, really? Can a machine ever be termed 'alive?' Where is the human race going? When will it cease to exist?"Personally, I found the last third of the film to be the most interesting and less predictable. However, I did have some technical issues with this section of the film. First of all, it was unclear to me whether or not the "aliens" were living beings or machines. Secondly, as a 30 year professional in deep ocean operations, there is no way that structures such as the ones depicted (i.e., Cony Island ferris wheel, buildings, etc) are going to survive 2,000 years underwater. That stuff would be gone in less than 200 years, especially in shallow water. But I understand the need for film makers to "bend the truth" for story development.Also, if David was such an intelligent machine, how could he fantasize about being a human boy? Would he not know that he is a robot and therefore incapable of organic life? Why would he undertake a journey he knows will fail in the end? I also agree with one of the other posters in that the film would have been better if it had ended with the submarine and "Blue Fairy" shot showing David staring at the stature for eternity. Films don't HAVE to have happy endings to be good.Finally, I see a disturbing trend in films these days in that they have become far too long. Does it really take three hours to tell a story? Why have directors not figured out that longer is not necessarily better? If the film as shown was 180 minutes, I cannot imagine how much footage was left on the editing room floor.Overall, good, but not a masterpiece. I give it 7 out of 10.Curt N.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humanity Explored: Thought-Provoking Vs. Entertaining - *Spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STORY - OVERVIEW: In a world where advanced robots are a common convenience, David (Haley Joel Osment) is created to be the first robot boy to have the ability to love. Through David, A.I. explores the human identity, their self-proclaimed superiority over other beings, as well as the responsibility of humans to other beings. HUMAN IDENTITY: Humans treat robots as mindless machines. When Dr. Hobby (William Hurt) proposes to build David, he off-handedly compares his creating David to God's creating Adam, claiming it will be like when 'God created Adam to love him'. Hobby displays the arrogance of humanity through a willingness to irresponsibly manipulate 'lesser beings'. As an unlicensed runaway, David is captured and taken to the Flesh Fair to be destroyed to the amusement of its spectators. When David takes his fateful place on stage, he pleads that he is 'just a boy'. Having never seen this before, the crowd goes silent. Then the crowd sides with David, saving him from death. David's plea touches the crowd, forcing them to change their idea of what it means to be considered human.ARE ROBOTS SELF AWARE?: Self-awareness defines humanity, but it is also a device that enables humans to see themselves as superior to other creatures. At the Flesh Fair, we start to realize that robots are self-aware. One robot asks another robot to shut off his 'pain circuits' so that his death will be painless. Later, Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), when captured by the police and facing death, tells David, "I am. I was!? This parallels Descartes? "I think, therefore I am," and demonstrates Joe's self-awareness.RESPONSIBILITY TO OTHERS: Love is a dynamic, interconnectedness of two beings, not just a static, one-sided emotion. The responsibility of love, likewise, falls on both sides. In David's case, love is not a freely made choice. Instead, David's fate is to be irreversibly imprinted with someone whom he must love. Monica imprints David, but has to reject him because he doesn't fit in. Later, David decides that if he could become a real, live boy, it would enable Monica to love him. In an effort to realize his dream, David pleads to a statue for it to turn him into a real boy, a plea that spans 2000 years. David cannot simply decide that this desire for Monica's love is not worth his pain. David's single-minded goal of love was irreversibly programmed into him and he is at the mercy of his unchangeable feelings.DAVID'S PURPOSE: The ending reveals David's ultimate purpose: he delivers information about what humans were like with the advanced race, helping to fulfill their goal of learning more about what humankind were like. By design, David fails to realize his contribution, being concerned only with Monica's love.FAULTS: When an advanced race of beings appears near the end, I first thought they were aliens from another planet. Through the DVD extras, I learned the 'aliens' are instead extremely advanced descendants of robots like David and Joe. To not make this story point clear was a major flub, as there is nothing to be gained by keeping the audience in the dark. When Monica is reconstructed from her DNA, it is explained that she can only be reconstructed exactly one time. Unfortunately, the explanation is too abstract for us to understand what's going on. The ending had several different interpretations, but only because it was unintentionally vague. See the IMDB.com A.I. message boards for some of the various interpretations.CINEMATOGRAPHY/EFFECT: I wish I had seen A.I. in the theater, as there were many scenes that didn't translate well to DVD. Panoramic cities and wide landscapes that were beautiful on DVD surely would have been spectacular and haunting on the big screen. LIGHTING: Much of the lighting was excellent, and followed the feeling of the story well. The first third of the story was clean and sterile. The second third was dark, harsh, and moody. The last third was emotive with lots of contrast. Sometimes the lighting effects came off as a bit gimmicky. Near the end, when David and Monica are in her bedroom, there is a glint of sunlight that transforms the scene from looking at Monica to looking at David. While the effect is inspirational, it also feels played up. Overall, the lighting added to the story in a simple yet expressive way.CONCLUSIONS: The issues dealt with in A.I. are so broad in their scope that the story must necessarily fail to achieve any large measure of focus, even considering its near 2-1/2 hour running time. The nicest part of the story is that it is told so that the audience gets to draw their own conclusions, as opposed to the popular practice of spoon-feeding answers at the end. With A.I., the viewer can draw different conclusions throughout the movie as we see how things progress. A.I. ended up being more thought provoking than entertaining. I enjoyed this tradeoff, and will watch this movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. is so much more than a mere vision of the future or a commentary on how humanity takes to its creations and caretaking. It is a movie that explores the core of love. Unless you are a parent, A.I. might lose something on you because its strength lies in how it portrays the love between mother and child. Sadly, today's audiences are so cynical and falsely sophisticated that any film that dares explore this area is taking a huge risk. A.I. is brilliant and bold. Those who don't get it could probably stand to have their hearts thawed out in a volcano.But it's not a perfect film. The acting, visual effects, and story are amazing. The rhythm between haunted and sentimental is not always too even. But you must see the film and think about it afterwards. It's truly haunting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for the literal-minded viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I walked into the theater I expected a schmaltzy flick like E.T. Was I ever wrong. This movie tells me Steven Spielberg is still willing to take chances. If he wanted to, he could just keep cranking out the populist fare (JURASSIC PARK, INDIANA JONES etc.) that most viewers associate with him.I saw A.I. three times this week. It has been a long time since a movie has held me in its grip like this. The first time I just hung on for the kaleidoscopic, futuristic Bros. Grimm fairy tale that the movie is on the surface. I went back for a second time to try to piece together some of the things I didn't understand the first time; I also thought the ending was tacked on the first time -- a second viewing showed me that the ending was actually perfect -- David's journey would not be complete without it. The third I appreciated the highly imaginative image composition (the New York scenes are a spectacular example of using FX in service of the story).That A.I. has been received in a lukewarm fashion by mainstream audiences ("too boring", "bleak and depressing -- what's the point?", "enough with the Pinnochio references!" etc.) belies the fact that most people take movies too literally now. Someone on alt.movies.kubrick posted that the story symbollically follows Dante's "The Divine Comedy" -- I wouldn't be surprised if Kubrick had this secondary level of meaning in mind when he was developing it. Perhaps in 10 or 20 years time, people will see what a masterpiece this movie is. A.I. reminded me of what I felt like at different times in my life when I was forced to face the big ugly world on my own. There's also an almost Oedipal undercurrent to David's need to be loved my his mother, which hints at a large part of many men's relationships with their own mothers -- or just the simple need to be accepted by them (A.I. will no doubt bring out the sadness in people with unhappy relationships with their own parents). So you see, A.I. is much more complex underneath than what people are making it out to be. It's my favorite film of 2001 thus far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's two bedrooms and two Daves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "2001: A Space Odyssey" man conquers himself and his machines, transcending the physical and becoming God. God is dead, Nietzsche says, and we shall take his place. "2001" ended in a bedroom. In that film, God-like beings created a simulated cage for us to shed our old bodies and become something greater than ourselves. Kubrick's second scifi epic likewise ends in a bedroom. In this film, God-like begins create a simulated cage for us to cling to our comfortable delusions."AI" is a fairy tale told by Mechas to Mechas. It is an allegory in which the humans are the divine beings and the robots are the humans. While "2001" dealt with the death of God, "AI" deals with the destruction of heaven, that place of happiness and illusion (ie a programmed simulation). To paraphrase Professor Hobby, "man's fundamental flaw is his insistence on hoping for things that don't exist." With "AI", we have two stories, a science fiction story, and a fairytale story. While "Full Metal Jacket" dealt in twos, and "Eyes Wide Shut" with reflections, "AI's" narrative is staggered. That is, the scifi story begins and ends one act before the fairytale story."2001" incorporated much mythic symbolism, using Homer's Odyssey and Nietzsche's Zarathustra as a backbone. With "AI", Kubrick draws from the Adam and Eve myth, and Dante's Inferno. The film begins with God creating man. When David meets Professor Hobby (God), Hobby says: "My son was one of a kind. You are the first of a kind." The line is a nod to Biblical lore, where God's "only begotten son" was "one of a kind" and his first creation, was "the first of a kind". Thus David is symbolic of both Jesus and Adam. First God and first man. The first act of the film takes place in the Garden of Eden, with Monica becoming symbolic of Paradise and eternal happiness. David is ejected from heaven because he disobeys God's programming and eats the forbidden fruit (spinach). When David is cast out of Eden, he finds himself first in the Dark Wood and then in Rouge City (earthly sin). After sinning, he is cast into the Flesh Fair, which represents hell and eternal punishment. After his punishment he is cast into the Atlantic Ocean, where, after 2000 years of being "washed" and cleansed of sin (Dante's Purgatory), he is set free and permitted to enter heaven (eternal life with Monica). Unfortunately, this promise of paradise is an illusion. He learns from the SuperMecha that he can only have Monica for one day. His first lines to her ("Would you like some coffee?") highlights his fears that she will die and go to sleep forever. He wants her to stay awake. He wants her to be real.The death of God is symbolised when humanity dies and the earth becomes frozen over. The reign of man has ended. With it, goes his beliefs, morals and customs. SuperMecha, themselves nothing more than evolved humans, are now the rulers of the land. After the singularity, they are the next stage in intelligent evolution. In a sense, they are the Star Children of "2001".Significantly, while the Mecha reject God (see how Joe humours David's irrational beliefs during the Dr Know scenes), David continues in his "programmed irrationality". In the scifi story, this leads to David's wish (the blue fairy) dissolving before his eyes. In the fairytale story, David's wish (Mommy) also perishes, but he chooses to remain deluded. He chooses to become human and enter that place where (false) dreams are made.Thus, to be human, David - whom Kubrick likens to the "artificial intelligence" of Spielberg/modern cinema - has to regress to an infantile state. He has to shut his eyes to believe in his simulational (ie cinema projection) paradise and the storybook fables his Mommy once read to him. David is a machine in a SuperMecha (ie Kubrickean) simulation, cradling his simulated mother in his metal arms. It's an entire bedroom full of unreality, yet it makes David happy. This, sadly, is humanity, Kubrick says.Thematically and aesthetically, there are lots of problems with the film. Firstly, Spielberg puts the silly Flesh Fair before Rogue City. You cannot have Hell precede sin. Secondly, the dialogue is constantly spoon-feeding the audience. Thirdly, the film is poorly cast and acted (Chris Rock, Robin Williams etc). Fourthly, all the designs not made by Kubrick (the flesh fair, the motorcycles) are stupid. Fifthly, the Blue Fairy/Monica mirroring is not made apparent. Kubrick's drafts had the fairy dissolve into dust and Monica, a hologram, dissolve into pixels when touched. Both David's fairy tale (religion) and SuperMecha's fairytale (cinematic fable) were implicitly linked. In Spielberg's film, both women and narrative layers are not. The sixth and biggest problem is that the AI are portrayed as being inferior to humans. Spielberg treats them as battered ethnic minorities, instead of exponentially advancing beings who quickly take God's place.The ending of "AI", though hated by critics, is the most interesting thing about the film. Kubrick is affirming "2001's" bedroom sequence, saying effectively that to become human is to die. It's no surprise that David and Dave Bowman both share the same first name. To remain Dave Bowman is to never become the StarChild. David wants to become a human. In Kubrick's eyes, this means he is fundamentally flawed. To the SuperMecha and the StarChildren, David is a quaint object. They shall continue progressing, continue evolving, while he sits there, pretending to sleep, remaining blissfully deluded. Thus, while "2001" had man fight machine and become God, "AI" presents the flip-side. HAL wins. In the war between machine logic and human superstition, machine becomes God and humanity fades away, nothing but a memory.5/10- Shot like a big budget TV movie, Spielberg ruined what could have been the greatest scifi film since "2001: A Space Odyssey".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hard film to judge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick made a career out of directing brilliant but unpleasant movies. The ultimate example is "A Clockwork Orange," which I saw for the first time just a few months ago. I found it astonishing, thought-provoking, and visually brilliant. But my experience watching the film was not in any way a pleasant one. The film chronicles the hideous crimes of a charmless psychopath, and ultimately how he is captured and subjected to an almost unimaginable series of tortures. I suppose some moviegoers might find those kinds of scenes entertaining, but I do not. Nevertheless, I consider it a great film, and a tremendously important one."A.I." is harder for me to justify. While not technically a Kubrick film, it is a Kubrick project that was finally directed by Steven Spielberg, following Kubrick's death. The result is a film that manages to combine the worst qualities of these two great filmmakers: it has Kubrick's obtuseness as well as Spielberg's sentimentality. The ending is deliberately designed to frustrate, to remove itself from any possible human reference point that we can easily relate to. At the same time, it's the sort of film that wants to be loved. There is even a teddy bear character that evokes mystery and awe more than cuteness. This awkward fusion of purposes left me feeling distinctly uncomfortable.I feel unjustified for giving the film as low a rating as 6/10. I just so intensely disliked the film that I have great difficulty rating it any higher, despite its clever and thoughtful handling of the concept of artificial intelligence. No doubt Kubrick has covered this territory before, in "2001" with the character of Hal. But he seems to expand on it in this film, which features two android characters, a child robot played by Haley Joel Osment, and a robot gigolo (don't ask) played by Jude Law. The behavior of these characters is so subtle and complex that I was often left wondering what they were thinking and feeling, what the experience of being a robot was like, if such an experience is possible. I personally believe that there is something special about human subjective experience that cannot be duplicated by computer technology. But this movie presents the opposite view very compellingly, and without taking the standard route of making the androids seem human.In this regard, Osment is spectacular: his performance in my opinion surpasses his Oscar-nominated one in "The Sixth Sense." There were moments when I looked at his eyes, his facial expressions, and I sensed an adult level of understanding and depth. Perhaps no child actor is better than Osment at acting creepy without being cute, as in one early scene when he startles his family with oddly forced laughter that doesn't seem to come with the appropriate emotions. He is playing a character who's supposed to pass for a child while not really being a child, and we slowly realize that he is in fact an alien intelligence with his own perspective and goals. Unlike a real child, he is not in the process of forming an identity. He already has one, and his only task is to fulfill his set desires and instincts, including his unbreakable attachment to his "mother" (Frances O'Connor) whom he is preprogrammed to love.This setup is not very conducive to melodrama, yet that's much of what we get throughout the film, which tries to cast itself as a modern reinterpretation of "Pinocchio." Since Osment's character is not a real boy, we can never relate to him as one. His emotions are as artificial as his intelligence, and no enchantment or anything else will turn him into a real boy, because he simply isn't one. Yet the movie tries to manipulate our emotions so that we do see him as more human than he actually is. This approach leads the film to lose its focus in the second half and put forth one of the more perplexing and unsatisfying endings I've seen in a long time. I don't mind whether a film ends happily or sadly, but it should not try to force a weak solution to a hopeless situation, just to gain a few moments of cheap sentiment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It isn't that bad, it's just that you know that it could have been so much better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was sure that this would be a great movie. I'm convinced that Spielberg is one of the best of today's directors so a project like this should certainly turn into gold in his hands. But apparently I was wrong. It's not the way everything is shown. From the beginning until the end it all looks very good, even breath taking from time to time. The surroundings (especially at the end of the movie), the gadgets, the robots,... it all has been done in a way that can't be disapproved. But I need more in a movie than just some good special effects and cool gadgets. I want a breath taking story, I want to see real emotions and feelings,... and that's where this movie went wrong. It all looked fine, but when you try to dig a bit deeper, you'll notice that this is actually a 'sterile' movie. It never felt real to me.If you ask me to describe the movie than I would say that this is a mixture of fairy tales like Pinokkio (it literally refers to it several times during the movie), The Terminator (it's futuristic, has robots in it and shows how people react to those robots) and Tron (because of some costumes). The story is about a robot-boy that has been created to act and feel like a human. First his 'parents' love him, but than their real son awakes from a coma and they no longer want him. The robot-boy is convinced that he has to become a real human and that then his mommy will love him again. Because he has heard the story of Pinnochio, he goes after 'The Blue Fairy' who will transform him and make a human boy out of him, just like in the fairy tale.Overall this isn't such a bad movie, it's a bit slow from time to time and it never really seems real, but the special effects make sure this is still a movie that will be remembered. The only problem with it is that you know that it could have been so much better. That's why I give it a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wisdom of minimum age ratings for films is debatable, but some films would be well advised to attach a maximum age rating. You guessed it, this is one of them. Kids might like it, but I would find it difficult to believe that anyone with an eye for good movies could find anything to praise in this over-long, sentimental story of a little robot-boy (ever so cute) with the obligatory bit for a dog (here in the shape of a mechanised teddy bear that walks and talks and never runs out of power, even after 2000 years ... those were some Duracells!) who was dumped in the woods by his loving mummy and spent the next two millennia searching for Pinocchio's Blue Faery and his adopted mother. The story sucks, and this is aggravated by the dreadful music; the camera work also fails to add lustre to this duller-than-dishwater "adventure". It goes without saying that advertised exploration of the thin boundaries between the human and the other is no more than that: advertising. The special effects are good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney meets Mad Max, and I mean the worst of both in that combination. With all due respect to Steven Spielberg and all those involved in this film, I left the theatre feeling dejected, depressed, and just plain down. It paints a horribly bleak future for humanity, both in the short and long term, and the end of the film, which I'm assuming is supposed to be this warm-and-fuzzy-feeling ending actually feels like a sad whimper. Not a direct comparison to events in this film, but imagine if all the good guys died at the end of Return of the Jedi or the entire cast of Star Trek goes down with the Enterprise in the last film. That's kind of what it feels like. The film leaves you with a bad taste and the need to watch some really heavy comedies just to bring your mood back up to the watermark.This film is one case where a Disneyized-happy-ending modification to the original would've done the film loads of good. As it is, don't watch this movie if you're prone to depression. It'll just make it a lot worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate good ideas gone terribly awry. When movies try to tackle moral dilemmas of the future I am usually intrigued, but this movie fell flat on its face in trying to do so. This could have been another Gattaca, which dealt with the potential discrimination issues involved with genetic profiling. Considering that this next century will likely be the century of gene, Gattaca's importance will be seen in a clear light within the next 20 years. In AI, however, Spielberg decided to throw some pathetic Pinocchio fairy tale in the mix. This could have been a fascinating moral study with amazing characters, but... oh forget it.I would be very interested to know what parts were Kubrick's and what parts were Spielberg's. I bet it was Spielberg that threw the fairy tale in the middle OR Kubrick realized the inherent failure in the story and never finished it. Considering Kubrick's prowess, there is likely a reason he tinkered with it for so long. I am very glad he didn't live to see this and I wish his name wouldn't be associated with this catastrophic flop. Someone needs to do another movie like this, someone serious and not as commercially driven as Spielberg. Kubrick and Spielberg prove to be oil and water. Worst Spielberg movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

I often wonder if the master, Stanley Kubrick really could have pulled this film off. I don't think so. In fact, that is why he dropped it in Steven Spielberg's lap, a sort of going away joke.

		<fullReview>i came to imdb and went through the registration process SPECIFICALLY to give this movie the lowest rating possible.where to begin? this movie was about twice as long as was tolerable based on quality of character development and believability of plot. about halfway through the movie myself and the others watching the film with me 'woke up', and began to look around with that uncomfortable *why the hell don't we just leave* feeling. no one walked out, but as the credits rolled, it was evident that critical mass for the entire theater was there, and had one person got up, it likely would have been mass exodus. i was not rewarded for my politeness or tolerance, and i actually would have liked the film better had i acted on my instinct and left, as the second half only got worse.to be fair, i should go into more detail about specific aspects of the film i disliked, but a thought just occurred to me, this movie is again wasting my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As my wife said, Spielberg poops, and the critics love it.The first half-hour is a commercial for environmentalism. The next two hours of the movie are predictably Pinnochio, until, jeepers, David becomes obsessive. Mommy deals harshly with David. The next two hours are David on a quest. When the movie finally ends, you discover that the test audiences didn't like the ending, so you get another hour tacked on to make you feel warm and fuzzy. This also gave Spielberg a chance for an "inside joke" about another movie he directed. No, the movie isn't five and a half hours long, it just seems like it. The actors did the best they could with what they had to work with, so no discredit to them.Rent/buy Geppetto, or read Pinnochio instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind Numbingly Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoiler Alert**A.I. is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever had the experience of watching. I saw this movie in theatres when I was about 11, and remember coming out of the theatre? more than disappointed. A few years ago I saw the movie again in a film class, and found it just as horrible.A.I. explores the topic every movie about a robot explores?what if they had feelings? A topic, I might add, that I never understood because the point of making a robot is it can do lots of hard work without getting physically or emotionally hurt. Anyway, I digress. A.I. takes place at some unnamed year in the future, and a robot manufacturer is talking about a new proto-type, a child robot that can feel love for its "parents". They decide to try out this proto-type "David" on an employee and his wife whose young son has died and is cryogenically frozen. David is played by Haley Joel Osment. It must be said that the only reason this movie is ever tolerable is Osment's performance. He manages to portray a robotic yet loving child, something that can't be easy to do. However, even a brilliant actor cannot save a horrible script.After a short adjustment period David develops a "cute", loving, bordering on creepy relationship with "Mommy". Things are going great until couple's "organic" son Martin is defrosted and brought home. Despite the fact her real child is alive again, Mommy can't bear to part with David. However, Martin is a cruel little SOB who makes it his mission to get rid of David. At Martin's birthday party he and his friends are preoccupied with stabbing David and checking if he is anatomically correct, so David clings to Martin for protection. They both fall into the swimming pool and David is accused of?attempted murder (?). The father then says that he must go. Mommy cannot deal with her "mecha" child being disassembled, so she does the most humane thing she can think of?abandoning him in the woods with the knowledge that the only person who loves him is gone forever! With only a vamped up Teddy Rupskin for company, David gets picked up by a robot-hating redneck group. He is put in a sort of monster truck rally where the goal is to destroy robots in the most creative ways possible. While there David meets Gigolo Joe played by Jude law, who is no more than a walking, talking sex toy. Because of David's unique programming he begs for his life, making everyone believe he is a real child. They release him and Gigolo Joe together, and David's new mission is to find the blue fairy from Pinocchio in hopes she will turn him into a real boy and Mommy will want him again. Joe then tells David they must go on a lengthy trip to a computer "professor". After a lengthy trip to the online professor (which David has to pay for), it tells him the location of the blue fairy. It gives him the location of a blue fairy statue in NYC, which is now under water. Joe and David take the trip to a very damp NY. While in NY there are a few scenes that feel like they are supposed to be meaningful and insightful into the mind, but are just wildly confusing. They are so confusing I can't even explain them properly. Anyway, David and his talking teddy go down in a submarine and sit in front of the statue for TWO THOUSAND YEARS! Then, aliens come! Through more confusing plot points they recreate David's "Mommy" in some strange attempt to understand humans, which have since gone extinct. It is then to be believed that David turned into a real boy and died happily with Mommy. This movie makes no sense, has so many plot holes it's ridiculous, gets indescribably confusing at the end, and is PAINFULLY long and boring. First of all, the fact that a child robot created for sad, childless adults being an 11-12 year old boy is ridiculous. If this ever happened, David would be much younger. In fact, in the short story this movie is based on David is three years old, but much more mature. Oddly enough, in the movie David is on the cusp of puberty but behaves like a pre-schooler, giving him the air of someone mentally challenged. There is NO point in the role of Gigolo Joe. He brings next to nothing to the plot, aside from a few bad sex jokes. And for some reason, NO ONE in this movie tells David that the blue fairy is MAKE BELIEVE. Despite the fact he has a computer chip for a brain, Joe is does not tell him this or any other useful information. The concept of the trip to this computer professor wastes so much time and makes very little sense. If this movie were made in the 70's, 80's or even early 90's it might. BUT, this movie was made in 2001. There were already several search engines like Yahoo! up and running. Surely they could predict this futuristic society would have something much more advanced, free, and accessible at any location. As for the aliens?whoever wrote this script must have given up or handed it off to someone else at the last minute. It is absolutely Godawful. There is nothing good or entertaining about this movie, and the only slightly redeeming quality is that it stars Haley Joel in his prime.</fullReview>

Take your pick.) Then the selfish swine went and died. Spielberg took charge, and ended the movie instead in one of the most tedious, schmaltzy ways imaginable.

		<shortDescription>Fails to deliver a coherent narrative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drawing inspiration from the Pinocchio story, this film is about a robotic child who yearns to be human. He is given to a family who are mourning the loss of their son, but soon their natural son re-appears, causing the robotic child to be sidelined.The film is clearly delineated into separate acts, which fail to come together in a coherent narrative whole. The early scenes in which the boy attempts to enjoy a normal family life could have been the basis for an interesting morality tale, but all this good work is wasted in the 2nd half, as the plot veers violently out of control.This lack of discipline is typified by Jude Law's character. He plays a 'love droid' who lives in some kind of pseudo-Blade-Runner city, but is almost totally redundant. His early section of the plot is extremely underdeveloped, and his only connection to the rest of the film is that he tags along with the robotic child for a while.The film's disjointed plot is understandable to some degree given that both Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg were involved in directing. The end of the film is very reminiscent of Kubrick's earlier work on 2001: A Space Odyssey, but the twists that are required to get to this point often strain credibility to breaking point.Hampered by a lunatic plot, the film still earns points for sheer audacity. However, in striving for both entertainment and profundity it only succeeds in falling flat on its face. Spectacular both in its ambitions and the extent to which it fails to live up to them, A.I. is a major disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good...until they go "off to see the Wizard"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years into the future when robots are commonplace in society, a couple mourning their ill child get a replacement: the first robotic boy! Steven Spielberg works peculiar magic with this story (initially conceptualized by his friend, the late Stanley Kubrick), setting up the pieces very carefully and then surging forth with dark adventure. The Flesh Fair sequence is masterful, as are some of the shots of Haley Joel Osment (doing fabulous work in the lead). I felt Spielberg stumble early on however, in the birthday party sequence which reveals the parents to be a little cruel and stupid. Another cringe-worthy moment occurs much later, when the kid and his traveling companion (a robot stud, who is wanted by the cops in a murky, unnecessary sub-plot) ask questions of an animated wizard with the voice of Robin Williams! No, say it isn't so! Just when you feel Spielberg has finally grown up and taken stock of his strengthens, he throws in a wobbly curve-ball (perhaps to placate the "E.T." crowds). "A.I." is ultimately unsuccessful in its story-telling--particularly with an epilogue that takes place 2000 years LATER--but much of the acting is fine and the art-direction is incredible. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg Takes Over Where Kubrick Left But He Doesn't Quite Get There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is quite a known fact that the late Stanley Kubrick wanted to make 'A.I.'. Either he was to produce the film and have Spielberg direct it, or he was to make it himself. But we know that Spielberg ended up making it. Not to put down Spielberg in any way, I think if Kubrick were to make it, 'A.I.' would have been a different film (perhaps better). Spielberg seems to have aimed more on entertaining the audience rather than tell a coherent story.Here are some flaws: The narration in the beginning and towards the end was not really necessary. The opening narration should have been left out. I do not think there was the need to stress on the time period as it was obvious that the film is way in the future and the time-gap mentioned did not sound convincing enough to begin with. The appearance of the aliens is a little awkward and looks out of place This is further followed by the cloning of the mother (perhaps Spielberg wanted to give it a happy ending) who is only able to live for 17 hours. Perhaps, this whole segment of the last 15 or so minutes could have been re-written to make it less explanatory and more suggestive.'A.I.' tells the story of a modern, well, post-post modern Pinocchio. I liked Spielberg's effort to make it Kubrick style. The special effects, visuals, cinematography, score and sound effects are brilliant. The cast is quite good. Osment fits the title role quite well. O'Connor and Law do a fine job. Gleeson is quite hateful and Hurt is quite sympathetic. The futuristic world is quite spectacular and horrifying (especially flesh fair). Yet, Spielberg's own influence is quite obvious. That is not necessarily a bad thing but like his other science fiction work, much of 'A.I.' is not factually correct. This can be overlooked in films like 'Jurassic Park' and 'E.T.' where the director's main goal was for the audience to enjoy. However, 'A.I.' demands more than that. I liked the way Spielberg portrays the characters David, Gigolo Joe and Monica Swinton. His portrayal of the mother-son bond and David's strong attachment to his mother is both endearing and heartbreaking.Perhaps, if Kubrick were alive, the two of them could have made a fantastic film out of 'A.I.' but I still liked and enjoyed the film very much for what it is. I appreciate Spielberg's effort and Kubrick must have seen something in him that he wanted him to make the film. It greatly entertains and in the end one feels a sad joy that David finally got to be with his mother for one last time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comparisons to Kubrick are a joke - form over substance yet again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick would have NEVER made a movie like this because it's way too slow, and far too dumb, sappy, tedious and schmaltzy. Having said that, in Hollywood terms, this is quite a risky movie because the essential message is quite unromantic and depressing. For once humans are not portrayed in an ultimately angelic way. When they are gone nothing is really missing. But I doubt Spielberg or his audience would notice that.Unfortunately Spielberg simply knows no better than putting a thick layer of sugar on everything. The guy can't help himself - he can be the most powerful producer/director and yet he just will not (allow himself to) make any intellectually challenging movies. Maybe he just can't.The principal mistake in this is all the overbearing simplistic emotion that drowns out anything interesting that could have very easily been said. Rather than just once really concentrating on that very interesting robot-human question the entire movie revolves around this boys affection for his supposed Mother. In other words: rather than finally producing something in the vein of Stanislaw Lem or Isaac Asimov, millions are spent on yet another version of Pinocchio... Terry Gilliam should have learnt from this - never do version number 1.393 of some fairy-tale (Quixote, Mnchhausen, etc.) but do a thinly-veiled adaptation that fits an existing film clich, add a kid or a dog and you can hope to cash in. Every twist and turn is another setup for another disgustingly schmaltzy scene which goes on forever and ever. Which is another difference to Kubrick - his lengths had reasons and were filled with information which you might use for something far out as "thinking" whereas every puny idea here is prolonged ad infinitum &amp; nauseam until you don't care and just want the scene to finally be over. Rather than witnessing this self-pitying kid for 3 hours I'd have a little more information on those aliens or future beings. But this would have overstrained the authors. They were only only capable of dreadfully clichd plot devices: Like resurrecting his Mum for a single day only. What, not 48 hours or 72? Alas who cares. It's all ultimately pointless and as long as it amateurishly helps the film to go on and END some time it's OK.Form over substance - special effects substitute ideas once again. Special effects cretins once again are having a field day with a 1.000 robots. How many of those robots do you have to see until they bore you? I'd say around three.I'm quite sick of today's SciFi which is really just a lame excuse for soap-opera quality melodrama and fake emotions. "Sunshine", "Bicentennial Man", the list is endless.In fact this is "Bicentennial Man" - just for a bigger audience because it doesn't feature an eternally 45-year-old but a (very supposedly) cute kid with no discernible eyes and his Teddy Bear. This had better been a TV movie with the weak mono-dimensional plot (artificial boy wants his mummy) it has. A condensed 30-minute Twilight Zone-type summary would have been more than enough.It's movies like this that only idiotize people through simplifying, lessening the need to think and cementing the dumbing down of society. But hopefully not before we've come up with a self-designing robot generation that will wipe out our increasing inability to be creative and retain any amount of dignity. At least this movie reinforces this belief of salvation. If we remain smart enough long enough, remains to be seen.</fullReview>

There were some redeeming factors - some of the special effects were interesting and some of the shots were beautiful but what a waste of money. The movie tried to say something interesting about cloning, cryogenics, our fear of technology, love, competition between siblings but in trying to be all embracing it merely glossed over these and tackled none.

Boring and ridiculous are the words that spring to mind on viewing this piece of clap-trap.I am an enormous fan of Spielberg's work (with the following exceptions: The Lost World, 1942, Amistad and his segment of Twilight Zone The Movie). Equally, I love most of the films directed by Kubrick until his dull Eyes Wide Shut (the last word of the title just a spelling mistake away from accuracy). Add to that the obvious talent of Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, William Hurt and Brendan Gleeson (to say nothing of John Williams) and someone needs to explain how these people came up with a convoluted, soulless, implausible, over-long movie.Open minded as I am, every time I read a positive review of this film I find myself condescending to the review's author. Who can like this movie? Why?

		<fullReview>There was nothing intelligent about this artificial movie. One point most movie critics and I agree on with this movie, "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" is unlike any other Steven Spielberg because he has not directed a film this awful in a very long time.I was shocked to see such a wonderful concept and premise wasted with a story I saw just a few years ago with the release of "Bicentennial Man." Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Sam Robards and William Hurt give their best effort in their respective roles; however, nobody could save the movie from the disastrous script the cast was given by the writers.I have always maintained that bigger is not always better. In the movie that Spielberg inherited following the death of Stanley Kubrick, this statement seems to be true. There has been a tremendous amount of hype surrounding "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" because it was supposed to be directed by Kubrick. "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" have taught me two very important lessons: never believe the hype of a film and always go with your instincts when deciding whether the movie was good or bad.Spielberg has a knack for turning movies into magic when directing films, so it came as a shock to me when I realized "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" is a film without emotion, structure and intelligence. It took me 20 minutes to tell myself this was a disappointment because all of the excitement and joy drained the life out of the movie leaving Spielberg to rely on the special effects to save the rest of "A.I. Artificial Intelligence."Osment follows his breakthrough role in "The Sixth Sense" as David, an eleven-year old android who takes an emotional journey to see if the love he gives his family is returned. Under the direction of Professor Hobby, played by Hurt, David is part of an experiment to create android children for families to love. Robards and O'Connor play parents who take David. Osment will become a huge superstar in Hollywood, but with his role as David, he won't accomplish this achievement.Hurt, Robards and O'Connor were among the only bright spots in "A.I. Artificial Intelligence." Their roles were the light I was looking for in the dark world of this movie. These three actors were responsible for bringing integrity, honesty and genuine emotion. It is refreshing to see actors bring characteristics like this to a role because it truly shows the range of talent they possess; however, "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" was the wrong decision for them to make as well intentioned the movie planned to be.The biggest problem I had with "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" was the urgency to care about David or any of the other characters in the film. For example, Gigolo Joe, played by Law, had no reason to be placed in a film like this because he didn't fit in with the storyline.Furthermore, there was no pizzazz or flash that stood out and made a statement that this is the film to see. One thing I have noticed with awful films was the endings were always better than the previous 120 minutes."A.I. Artificial Intelligence" never seemed to get on track with one major theme. For example, it jumped from storyline to storyline without clear and complete explanation. I reached my tolerance limit early on in the movie, so when the movie was over; I was relieved and couldn't wait to get home.Despite my hatred for "A.I. Artificial Intelligence," I must give Spielberg credit for bringing some enjoyment to the film. For example, Hurt's role as Professor Hobby stood out because he was the only actor that seemed to be genuine to the role, roles as mother and father put Robards and O'Connor on my favorites list, promising premise surrounding the film as well as the start and finish of the film were the only aspects of the movie that stood out from the rest of the movie."A.I. Artificial Intelligence" contains heart and spirit and I can understand how people may enjoy this movie; however, Spielberg failed to capitalize on the golden opportunity handed to him by Kubrick."A.I. Artificial Intelligence" is a shallow and empty movie, which was made several years ago with Robin Williams. With their heart and spirit misplaced, my only advice regarding is to watch "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" at your own risk.</fullReview>

Sorry, folks- you don't have some higher intellectual ability or deep inner knowledge just because you liked this waste.I agree with everybody who thinks that this film would have been better served by having it end with Mecha-boy underwater; I'd have done a fade-out with the kid pleading to the Blue Fairy statue. If the ending we were handed was part of Kubrick's original design, he of the dark view of the human condition, he badly compromised himself. THAT ending is what I'd expect from a sentimentalist like Spielberg, not Kubrick. Apparently the audience members who laughed at it and booed and jeered at the end agreed with me.Incidentally, don't try to claim that because I despised the ending, I must WANT Spielberg to fail. That's the sort of simplistic thinking and lack of understanding of PERSONAL motivation I'd expect from some hack Hollywood screenwriter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a strange genesis. It seems that it was originally to be directed by Stanley Kubrick who had been intrigued by a Brian Aldiss short story. Unfortunately Kubrick died before he could begin filming and his "good" friend (aren't they all) Steven Spielberg took over the directing job. The film, probably as a result of this, breaks into 3 sections. The first, which feels very 'Spielbergy', deals with the burgeoning relationship between a mother and her new robot child. The second shoots off into very Kubrick territory as it tells of the young child's escape from what is the equivalent of a racist redneck gathering where robots are blown up in a variety of ways. He is then joined by a robot gigolo whose activities, this being a Spielberg film, are not gone into with too much detail. Then it's off to 'robot' city which is full of digital imagery of a sexual nature al la 'Clockwork Orange', but again is decidedly sanitised.This mixture leads to a flawed but intriguing film with some vivid scenes that are filmed with the artistry one expects from Spielberg. And then..They set off on an odyssey to find the 'Blue Fairy' so that the robot child can become a real boy..umm?Not only is this saccharine coated to the level where I thought my teeth were going to rot away, but it goes on and on and on and on and on?you get the idea. In the accompanying short featurette Spielberg states that this film is his homage to the late Kubrick. Yea, it contains the most drawn out and schmaltzy conclusion in the history of cinema. I'm not quite sure this is what Spielberg had in mind.</fullReview>

To see what I mean, it is enough to compare this movie with a vastly superior one: Blade Runner. In that movie, replicants are not programmed to feel love, pity, sorrow or rage about injustice, but they develop these feelings spontaneously and mysteriously. As a matter of fact, these human feelings render the replicants not only unusable but dangerous, and hence, they have to be eliminated. Blade Runner is about what makes humans human: if androids can have feelings that are real and not planned, if they have memories, if they can appreciate beauty, if they have a will of their own, aren't they human? Isn't destroying them murder? In A.I., there is never a question of David being human: he is nothing but a machine that smartly apes a real loving boy. The boy robot has a chip or whatever it is that programs him to feel `love,' being such `love,' if correctly interpreted (something the movie does not do), not real love, but an unhealthy fixation. A real boy who developed such an obsession with his own mother would be a Norman Bates in the making. Unlike Blade Runner, where we empathize naturally with the replicants, it is impossible to feel anything but irritation, at best, and horror, at worst, for David, and, indeed, it is easier to pity the bad mother: who wouldn't be unnerved by such unblinking adoration? (and unblinking it is; Spielberg erased Osment's blinking, apparently not realizing that a blinking robot would have been more lifelike and therefore, more useful to its purpose, to replace a real boy. Apparently, it was Osment who suggested the unblinking thing. Now, this is what happens when you listen to child actors instead of your own judgment). That's not the way the movie thinks, however. It assumes that this pre-packaged, superficial feeling is the real deal, which is rather disturbing.As a matter of fact, just like David, A.I. is a movie that wants to be what it is not. It wants to be profound and philosophical (we know that because from time to time some character, or the voiceover narration, says something sententious). Spielberg's unquestioning admiration for Disney has already landed him in trouble in some of his other movies, but never as devastatingly as in this one. Any hope to take the movie seriously is dashed by cartoonish stuff like the Dr. Know or the Blue Fairy, and by the sickening sentimentality that clogs the whole movie and reaches its peak in the completely stupid ending. I spent the last half-hour or so gaping at the screen, and I mean that literally. I felt (and probably looked) like the audience watching the Hitler musical in the movie `The Producers.' I was so nonplussed at the nerve of someone ending a movie in such a ridiculous fashion, I could not even feel rightfully angry as I should.All things spoken, I did like Teddy. I wish I had one of these. But then, of course, when the only thing in a movie that keeps you minimally interested is a talking teddy bear, the movie in question is really in deep trouble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High hopes ... crash out stunningly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&gt; SPOILERS ALERT &lt;The good: 1. The first third of the movie; the premise is quite believable in the not-so-distant future, considering the way robot technology is accelerating; the scenario seems plausible. 2. The young actor who plays a near-human 13-year-old boy-robot is excellent; a hands-down first-rate performance. 3. Special effects. As you might have guessed with a big-budget Spielberg film, they are mind- boggling excellent.The bad: 1. The movie, which runs - or crawls - in at about 140 minutes, is way too long. I mean, way, way, too long. It actually consists of three separate movies linked by the slenderest of stupefying threads. My 13-year- old son, who I hoped would relate with the boy-robot, walked out on it (we recently rented it on DVD) at the 55-minute mark. 2. The last 2/3 of the movie is unbearably saccharine and 'goo-goo' cutesy to no end. With Spielberg - post Jaws (which I actually love and think is his best movie - an American classic) - we come to expect this, but it just gets drowned in the maple syrup. I like a good heartfelt sci-fi movie, but this was way too much. 3. The E.T. ending. I saw it coming, and hoped that I would be wrong, but, oh, no ... nope, no chance. When I saw the alien finger, I knew that I had watched/invested too much time into it. My son had made the right choice. 4. As others have pointed out, technically, there are some glaring errors regarding physics. See how many you can count. 5. Do people not evolve at all? In the future, won't humans have become much more like robots as it will be a much more efficient - and safer (much reduced chance of disease and accidental deaths) - form of existence? Nope, we will still want to stay in our sacrosanct homo sapiens mode forever. Nah, don't think so.</fullReview>

It lacked a hook or I didn't have any desire to know what happened next. Plus I didn't really like any of the characters whatsoever, apart from the cute bear!

		<fullReview>AI is inspired by British science fiction writer, Brian Aldiss short story 'Supertoys Last All Summer Long.' It was a project initiated by Stanley Kubrick and then taken over by Steven Spielberg who directs as well as write the screenplay. It is a mixture of Spielberg's wide eyed childlike wonder from his ET era with Kubrick's cold gaze of adulthood. It is a modern version of Pinocchio.The film is set in a future where the ice caps have melted and eradicated the coastline. Robots of increasing sophistication have become part of the fabric of society. Professor Hobby (William Hurt) has created an android with programme to love and be more human like.Monica and Henry Swinton (Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards) have a terminally ill son and take in David (Haley Joel Osment) almost as a substitute son to love. David as he is programmed is fixated on his mother and projects his love.When their son Martin (Jake Thomas) miraculously recovers and returns home, the new family of four becomes fractious. Martin is mean to David who cannot interact with other kids. It is not in his programming. An incident means that like a dangerous pet, he could be dangerous in the house. However Monica is not willing to send him back to the corporation where he would be presumably terminated.Monica cares enough for David to abandon him in the woods with a Teddy Bear who is also an AI robot for companionship and wisdom (his Jiminy Cricket.) From there David befriends other robots such as Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a sex-bot on the run after being framed for murder. They evade resentful humans and journey to find the Blue Fairy whom David believes can turn him into a real boy so his mother can love him.David is a boy who becomes accepted quickly by becoming part of a family only to find that he is not afforded their protection when he is gauded and provoked by Martin. Once in he wilds with Gigolo Joe he is living in fear in a society where robots have no rights.Spielberg creates two sound stages for the middle of his film. Flesh Fair a gaudy, sleazy place where robots are destroyed in front of cheering humans but David pleads for his life and swings the crowd his way. Then there is Rouge City, A Vegas type place where the holographic Dr Know points them to the top of Rockefeller Center in the flood hit of Manhattan where he meets his creator, Professor Hobby.The final act set in the submerged Coney Island which is then frozen over in an oncoming ice age until David is rescued by advanced beings.I have to confess. I liked the ending. It bought an emotional crescendo to a flawed film. It moved me as it allows David to find he is the recipient of love and can finally grow and become human even if it is all a projection from the beings that rescued him. Without this ending, I would had found this to be a dull, uninvolving and grim experience. Humans treating robots like pets who are soon discarded once they are no longer fulfil a useful function.I understand that this ending was part of the Kubrick draft and not added by Spielberg. Kubrick finally showed his sentimental side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern Pinocchio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the not too distant future global warming has caused the ice caps to melt flooding coastal cities and necessitating strict rules on the number of children people can have. Human looking robots have taken over many tasks and now a robotics engineer has come up with a new idea; to create a robotic child that will love the person it is imprinted on. The prototype, David, is given to a company employee whose wife Monica can't get over the fact that their child is in a coma. They are warned that once imprinting has taken place it can't be undone; if they decide they no longer want David he will have to be scrapped. All goes well until their son wakes from his coma; he sees David as a rival for his mother's love and it isn't long before an accident happens and they can no longer keep David. Unable to have him scrapped Monica leaves him in a remote location. David, remembering the story of Pinocchio that Monica read to him, he decides that he must find the Blue Fairy from that story so she can make him into a real boy and he can go home. He meets up with Gigolo Joe, a robot on the run, and together they try to find Blue Fairy although it won't be easy; on the way they will have to face people who revel in the destruction of robots and David will have to confront the fact that he is not unique.This is a fine film with a real emotional pull. Young Haley Joel Osment is great as David; he manages to make him not quite human without slipping into uncanny valley. Jude Law is equally good as Gigolo Joe; the robot who knows just how to please a woman. Both characters are sympathetic as are the other robots? the scenes where some are destroyed at the 'Flesh Fair' is both tragic and rather shocking. The special effects are top notch and even now, fifteen years after the film's release, they don't look dated. Given that the story is clearly both inspired by 'Pinocchio' and also directly references it things could get too self-referential but thankfully it works very well. Some people won't like the ending but I found it both effective and emotional. Overall I'd certainly recommend this even though I know it won't be to everybody's taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. is a total must watch by Vicente Eduardo Garcia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I.: Artificial Intelligence is majestically crafted. Despite some flaws are blatantly seen in the film, the core of the film is heartwarming and truly genuine. The story is a true fantasy for kids and young at hearts. But unlike the premise that it is catered for all, it seems that this movie felt short to accept it in a wider scope of audience. Beyond all of that, it is still a must see. Spielberg proved once again that he has a trademark in directing sci-fi films. The movie conveys a tragic yet a wonderful experience.Jude Law is marvelous as ever. He deserves an Oscar nod for that year, he truly is. His portrayal of a sex robot gigolo was amazing. Law still puts some innocence and vulnerability to Gigolo Joe that reflected throughout the film. In terms of directing, you can see what parts are from Kubrick's and what parts of the movie are from Spielberg's. Kubrick passed away in 1999 and the movie was passed on to Spielberg's. Kubrick's dark comedy and cynical reasoning reflected to it while Spielberg's optimistic and idealistic scenes (especially the ending) gave a poignant feel in the film.A.I. is a total must watch. Although it has failed some premises of the planned execution still it can be topped as a classic sci-fi to be watched by all generations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly Enjoyable, Despite an Uneven Plot,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. Artificial Intelligence is a good movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a stellar cast. It's an enjoyable movie that is impressively directed by the great Steven Spielberg, bringing a world where robots reign supreme to life, its certainly intriguing as, nowadays, this future no longer seems too distant. Haley Joel Osment shines in another role that shows he had genuine acting talent at a young age, however, Jude Law steals the show, as he has clearly put in an immense amount of work to portray an animatronic who is very human, Teddy is also a very lovable character and great addition to the story. I did feel the film did not know who its audience was, it was too intense to be a family movie, but not thrilling enough to be a delight for adults, this made the story feel bland, as it was neither joyful nor terrifying. The biggest issue is that the plot was developed by Stanley Kubrick, but then directed by Spielberg in the end after the directors passing, their outlook is simply too different, Kubrick is bleak and Spielberg is optimistic, which makes their style entirely different, as a result of that, the story simply feels uneven. Not without its flaws, A.I. Artificial Intelligence is still a well acted, enjoyable Sci-Fi, worth the watch if you ever stumble upon it on television or some other medium. A robotic boy aims to become human in order to win the love of his mother. Best Performance: Jude Law</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film shows robots' pathetic destiny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a boy who is a robot and has artificial intelligence. In the film, first, a married couple receives the robot as their son. Second, they abandon him because their real son who falls into a coma wakes up. Finally, the robot has an adventure to meet his "mommy" and become a real human boy. I like the story of this film, but I get sad when I watch the scene which shows the robot is abandoned. This is because such a scene shows robots' pathetic destiny. They are created to satisfy humans' desire and are abandoned when their role is finished. In the modern world, robots are developed and used in various places. As a person who lives in such a world, I feel I should think about the relationship between humans and robots. Although I get sad when I watch this film due to robots' pathetic destiny, I think this film is a good science fiction because it gives us an opportunity to think about the relationship between humans and robots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Sam Robards, Frances O'Connor, William Hurt: Best scene regards a robot witnessing the destruction of his kind for the love of violence. Unlike "E.T." it is not given why "A.I." is initialed. Haley Joel Osment stars as a robot adopted into a family when their own son is frozen with a terminal illness. Through a series of events Osment is abandoned and eventually companioned with another robot named Gigolo Joe. Joe is framed for murder but he will assist Osment in his search for the Blue Fairy. He is familiar with Pinocchio, which is where his ambition initiates. Steven Spielberg creates a fantastic futuristic world but it lacks the warmth of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial. Osment is strong as the lead pulling off a sympathetic performance but the ending is depressing. Jude Law as Gigolo Joe steals scenes but the role is totally unnecessary and could have been demolished long before his arrest. Frances O'Connor is strong as Osment's mother who cannot emotionally accept the artificial replacement. Sam Robards as his father sees him as a mend for loss. William Hurt plays Osment's creator and he is exactly what was needed for a screenwriter because that element is sadly lacking here. Outstanding visual wonder about being human but the ending is lackluster and totally artificial. Score: 5 ? / 10</fullReview>

I don't know why Roger Ebert called this is "Great Movie" although he gave 3 out of 4 stars before. The characters is not strong enough. Did Monica, his mother try to find him again until she is dead? And I think the appearance of Joe isn't necessary. He is a terrible male prostitute Mecha. In the separation between Joe and David: "David: Goodbye Joe! Joe: Goobye David! I am... I was... !" And he is and was what? I can't understand. Stupid character. I don't know why he was nominated for the Golden Globe for his acting.Overall, A.I. is the weakest movie of Steven Spielberg that I've ever seen!

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Most Underrated and Under Appreciated</shortDescription>

Spielberg Took Over the Project but Did Not Cheat on Kubrick's More Cynical and Pessimistic Persona.The Result is This Great Film that is an Emotionally Exhausting, Visually Exciting Fairy-Tale. It is Disturbing and Delightful. Basically it is Pinocchio, Made Obvious in the Film, Restyled and Revisioned in a Sci-Fi-Horror-Cautionary-Allegory of Modern Times.Not for Everyone, it May be Too Unsettling at Times for Very Young Viewers. It is Heartwarming and Heart-Wrenching and Deeply Depressing. The Futuristic Visual Template is Amazing.Only the Most Hardened of Hearts Could be Unmoved by its Sentimentality Seen Through the Eyes of a Robot Child. The Parallels and Direct Links to Real Children are Painful to Watch as the Artificial Boy Must Go Through Parental Rejection and Real-Life's Horrifying Realities.A Good Cast All Deliver Searing Performances in Difficult Roles. Overall the Movie is Not a Very Pleasing Entertainment for Those Wishing for the Usual Spielberg Scrubbed Suburbanism. Although the Movie Does Have an Abundance of Heart. The Viewer will Find His/Her Heart Warmed and then Frozen, Filled with Love then Broken and Drained, Only to Have it Filled Again.For Some it May be Just too Much of an Emotional Roller-Coaster Ride, but For Others Willing to be Shaken and Stirred, Caressed and Cuddled, Shocked and Stunned, All at the Same Time, This is Just the Thing.An Under Appreciated Masterpiece of Manical Manipulation, with No Pull Back Along the Road Trip Search for Enlightenment. The A.I. Child, Prays to and Searches for, the Blue Fairy His Whole "Life". Organic Types Frequently do the Same Thing. Orga = Mecha = Orga</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick's Brainchild, Brought To Life By Steven Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Envisioned by Stanley Kubrick &amp; brought to life by Steven Spielberg with intimacy, respect &amp; composure, A.I. Artificial Intelligence is a unique feature film that carries the aesthetics of both of these filmmaking legends yet turns out to be quite an underwhelming experience in the end, considering the big names attached to the project.Set in the future, A.I. Artificial Intelligence tells the story of David; a highly advanced robot created as the first of its kind for it is uniquely programmed with the ability to love. The plot follows him as he's adopted by a married couple as a substitute for their real son who is in suspended animation. David's life changes dramatically when the real son returns home.Written, produced &amp; directed by Steven Spielberg, A.I. Artificial Intelligence finds him paying tribute to cinema's greatest filmmaker by completing the project the latter himself began a long time ago. The film shares many similarities with Kubrick's works yet isn't completely devoid of Spielberg's own inputs but the jumble between the two styles is also its downfall.Production Design team comes up with set pieces that have many things in common with Kubrick's films. Cinematography maintains a steady control over the camera movements &amp; the surreal imagery plus bleak use of colours do work in its favour for a while. Editing is a mixed bag for the film changes gear multiple times as plot progresses and John Williams' score has a muted presence here.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Brendan Gleeson &amp; William Hurt, and is being narrated by Ben Kingsley who also has a role to play. Yet it's Osment who single-handedly makes the film his own by delivering a mesmerising &amp; heartbreaking performance as David who genuinely longs for his mother's affection and goes to great lengths to achieve that.Yet in the end, the drawbacks are too many for the story is plagued with a number of issues that's associated with the works of both Spielberg &amp; Kubrick. The film in itself is overlong &amp; over-sentimental plus the narration wasn't required at all. There was a point where the story could've ended on a fitting, if bleak, note but actually decides to go for a more positive conclusion. And the significant shift in tones is also off-putting.On an overall scale, A.I. Artificial Intelligence is an intriguing but convoluted motion picture that is an incompatible hybrid of two different styles and feels like a cinema that Spielberg brought to completion only to honour his friendship with Kubrick. The sense of wonder &amp; passion usually found in Spielberg's works is sorely missing here, like his heart wasn't fully invested in it, yet A.I. Artificial Intelligence has its moments that makes it worth a shot, at least once.</fullReview>

(Data Analyzing Robot Youth Lifeform) - see http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088979/ - right down to kindly scientists seeking to preserve the robotic boys when they were supposed to be destroyed.This movie's David got to fly a helicopter-submarine, but, D.A.R.Y.L. got to fly a Stealth Fighter which provided me with a greater thrill factor. I felt the actors in D.A.R.Y.L. were of higher quality as well.I think the best character was the brief role of the young Nanny "mecha" who was cruelly melted at the "Flesh Fest".There were many characters in this movie and you never really get to know any of them very well, not even David.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think Even Steven Spielberg missed the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Contains spoilers* Way too many 'blue fairies' in this film.At some point, someone says the blue fairy represents wishful thinking - and that is what this film felt like, to me. Spielberg's wishful thinking in this movie was that he was creating some great emotional masterpiece, but I honestly think he missed the whole point of the story.I saw the movie on TNT, during one of their 'play it to death' weekends. I actually saw the end first, and thought that it looked interesting enough to watch it when it aired again.Throughout the film, there is an undercurrent focusing on the desires of people and what they will do to get what they want - no matter the cost. The actions, prompted by the wishful thinking of what could be, motivate pretty much every human in the movie. Martin, Monica's son, is ill and in cryo, waiting for a treatment - for five years she waits, and waits, and waits, putting her life and her husband's life on 'hold.' Then she gets David - and even though she hasn't let go of her other son, she 'embraces' David - only to 'unembrace' him when he becomes inconvenient. Martin's wishful thinking is to manipulate David so his mother hates him, and Martin can get rid of the competition. The mother's wishful thinking is that it is somehow 'better' for David to be dropped off in the middle of nowhere, terrified and afraid, give him a few sentences worth of guidance - and that this is better for him than to be deprogrammed and have his memory erased.Throughout the rest of the story, there are several incidences where people use the robots to get what they want for themselves- without taking into consideration what their complete narcissistic and selfish actions say about their own lack of humanity. Throughout the film, the desires of David the A.I. is to become human - and yet, throughout this film, the humans are shown to be either selfish, or violent, or hateful and narrow. Even his creator, Professor Hobby, only ever saw David as a tool to produce revenue - even though he suggests to his staff in the very beginning of the film that creating robots who can truly love is some kind of philanthropic gesture for people who can't have children.Spielberg wants the story to be about an A.I. who loves, and is eventually loved in return, and this make him 'real'. But throughout the movie, David was the only person who was real - everyone else was two-dimensional and self-focused. The Great Spielberg missed the entire point of the movie he was making - love does, in fact, define the truest most noble aspects of humanity - and the humanity in the film was utterly lacking in it.And please - hyper smart aliens who can clone a person, w/ selective memories, and they can't make their OWN robot for the kid to live with??? It would have been a better end - instead of him becoming a real boy, he gets an A.I. who becomes a real, loving mother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting to watch, but hard to accept...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Artificial Intelligence is a great example of a filmmaker taking a believing audience for granted. A whole lot of the movie was very far-reaching, and though produced well and real-looking it was still hard to believe and/or grasp sometimes.This is the story of planet Earth after the polar ice caps have melted. Many cities on the edges of continents have been forever lost. In this day and age of failing natural resources, humans have begun to use robots- for just about everything. Robot servants, robot nannies, robot cleaners, and now... robot children. A young couple is given the opportunity to be the first couple to ever own a robot child who can experience love- David. And as the movie goes to show, he loves hard. The real question is though, can a human ever really love a robot back? First of all, let's talk about performances. Haley Joel Osment turns another very nice performance in this film, and he even makes a character go from complete opposite to opposite throughout the film in the audiences mind; at first he is creepy and off, but by the end you love him. The only other real standout for me was Frances O'Connor as the mother torn between her love of her family and her love David, a robot. We see and feel her grief. Jude Law to me just felt like he was playing himself- easy going, womanizing, smooth talker. The other thing to watch for is cameos by several famous actors. I won't tell you just where.The other main performance of the film is the effects. They seem to take on a role themselves. If so, they're probably the best part of the film. Truly, the effects are stunning, even if the move is somewhat less than so.The main problem with AI is that it takes too much for granted. It takes us into a world and expects us to instantly believe all that we see. At times, this works quite well, bringing about elements of surprise and shock. Others, you're shaking your head in disbelief. The ending especially almost killed the movie with it's far-reaching ideas and thoughts. It destroyed a lot of the meaning for me. Not to mention that the film is very heartbreaking. It borders on depressing.However, the movie is still definitely worth watching. If you're a fan of science fiction, then this movie is definitely for you. If you're not a fan of science fiction, then I would suggest one-time viewing. Artificial Intelligence is, at heart, a story of love, and in my opinion, that's what holds the film together. We can all relate to that desperate want of love that David feels. Love is one thing we all want. 6/10 stars.Jay Addison</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent film, somewhat poor execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to warn the reader, that I was pre-disposed not to like this film. That's because I had heard about this film initially in the early 90s, when I was in high school and was just discovering the timeless joys of Stanley Kubrick films. I heard at that time he was working on "A.I." as well as "Eyes Wide Shut." Then I heard the news a few years later that he was going to do "EWS" first and then do "AI". When I heard the news of Mr. Kubrick's death just prior to the release of "EWS", I was standing in the lobby of the now-defunct Berkeley UC Landmark Theater about to watch a double feature of "Persona" and "Wild Strawberries". Very fitting I suppose. One of the first thoughts that came to my mind was a kind of profound sadness "I'll never get to see AI. Nobody will ever get to see AI." So why has it taken me so long to see it? Why was I not the first in line? I don't really like Steven Spielberg's films. And I think it was disingenuous of him to imply in interviews that he and Kubrick had planned to make the movie all along, while in actual fact Spielberg had abandoned the project in favor of "Jurassic Park 2" many years ago. I see Spielberg as a vulture, basically, trying to get some of Kubrick's reflected glory.But every time I talked about Spielberg and the film, people here would rightly tell me that I should see the film before I talk trash about it. I agree, but it's against my aesthetic philosophy to watch a movie intentionally to dissect or criticize it. So I tended to stay away, especially after seeing the horrible "Minority Report" which kind of ruined Phil Dick's story.This one is a Phil Dick imitation also. It bears very little resemblance ot the Aldiss story as far as I can recall it. But it's an excellent idea in many ways, a sci-fi Pinoccio, and the execution is uneven but more or less emotionally sound. It's torturous almost in an existential way to imagine this poor boy has been programmed to love a woman who turns out to be such a flaming B**$!!@. I enjoyed the story element with his jealousy of "Teddy" and his growing affection for him throughout the story. It was painful to see teddy sitting at the table and to realize that the family really saw David as nothing but a sophisticated toy, while for David the family was the ultimate meaning of the world. It forms a strong plea for empathy.The scenes at the giant robot killing rally were also very impressively done, except in the sense that the crowd changed sides much too fast, and then we didn't even really see how they rescued David and his friend. Brendan Gleeson was very impressive, but I didn't believe that the crowd would turn from supporting him 100% to hating him 100% in a few seconds. In terms of the performances in general, they were solid. Osment should be singled out for praise because he manages to effect the character transitions required by the role. Jude Law was the only one I thought was kind of weak, he really did not make me care for his character the way I think we were supposed to.My main problem with the movie comes in the finale. I actually think possibly it would have been a better film if it had ended with him underwater watching the blue fairy. Spielberg made the same mistake he always makes, to explain and show too much. It wasn't quite as happy as the usual Spielberg movie ending though. I think it could have been fine if they had skipped the whole part with the aliens explaining to David about the whole "she can only come back for one day" thing. First of all, it doesn't make sense. Second of all, the audience does not need that much information. And certainly to give it in dialog exposition was a show of weakness and Spielberg's tendency to underestimate the audience. I think it would have been more powerful if we had never actually seen David talk to the aliens, or if they had disguised themselves as the blue fairy and given him a lot less information. If you think about the ending Kubrick probably envisioned, it was probably a lot more along the lines of the ending of "2001" where you do not have any dialog and you let the audience connect the dots and draw conclusions for themselves. Spielberg is afraid to do this.All in all though, a successful film that combines Spielberg's talents as an emotive director who elicits empathy with a more adult story than usual from him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rather like this film. It's almost a guilty pleasure since it is so unrecognized. It is a true journey, the viewer follows 'young' David as he encounters struggles that any human being would be baffled by. There is a certain naivete that is both entertaining and endearing among the mechas. It creates a compassion for the various machines we meet, that one would usually reserve for a child or animal. This also explains the beautiful friendship between Joe and David. They are much like two children experimenting in the world, and they treasure each other, though the unity is very tenuous; we can assume that since a machine cannot love the friendship cannot be enduring. So the fact that they seek other people, and acceptance, allows us to see ourselves, and our own wants in the characters.Some people might say that the ending is contrived or anticlimactic, but I really enjoy it. Kubrick is the antithesis of Shyamalan; his endings are understated rather than exaggerated. When David sits in the submarine for 2000 years he is acting out what William Hurt's character described to the viewer before: hope. It is the everlasting motivation for life. The fact that he can hold this wish for 2000 years as he wastes away under water reminds us that he is not human. We must keep this in mind, the fact that Joe and David are not 'real' brings questions to the viewer's mind and forces us to confront the question of 'what is real?'. To any viewer that has not seen the film I suggest finding a comfortable couch, on a Sunday afternoon, and sitting down to experience it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>unlike what most of the "haters" think, the movie ending is not some diffuse aliens. the 2000 years after, actually shows the evolved form of robots, after humanity had perished. you can speculate how humanity perished, maybe the magnetic field of earth seized to exist, and the atmosphere was taken by the solar winds, thereby freezing down earth. and whoever survived, was made sterile by solar radiation. or maybe the machines rioted, and killed every last human being. and after this event, machines continued to improve themselves towards a point where they received a higher intellect, and a curiosity for their creators. the ending has a very weird feeling to it. there you have the creations looking back and taking care of its creators, and David being a symbol of their past.it might also be a sort of reflective lookback for the robots, seeing their past that they destroyed, and now are capable of containing, searching it with intimate curiosity.but there are bad parts that really were unnecessary. the chase in the woods was downright tacky. i was first confused, and wondered why a large corporation would employ tron meets mad max designs, until i discovered they were part of some sort of religious robot crushing circus. racism at work, fear of whats different.well, i'm too tired to write up a proper reviews, but those are some of the thoughts that this movie provoked from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Robot-boy who would be a Boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The saga of a robot, built in the year...waitaminnit. Didn't I type this before? Yes, yes...for my comment on "Bicentennial Man"(99). Yes, the robot which yearns to be human. Hm, yes, not a very original thought by this time. Spielberg rushed out this concept based on plans Stanley Kubrick made before he died. Kubrick would have taken at least a couple of years longer and it would have showed. Right as the film's narration begins, we're rushed into an explanation of how the icecaps have melted in the near future, flooding all coastal cities (shades of "Waterworld"). The resulting displacement of huge amounts of people caused some birth control measures, thereby jumpstarting a robot industry (usually referred to as 'mechas' here). I guess it makes some sense, so far. What follows is another variation on Spielberg's fascination with fairy tales - in this case a reworking of Pinnochio (which is spelled out more than once during the film, ad nauseum). Subtleties are not present; instead of gradually working in the premise, Spielberg has scientist Hurt clumsily spell it out in the beginning - let's build a robot who can love. Gee whiz, really? OK, let's. And let's make it a boy robot, because maybe - uh oh - the scientist has some personal stake in this deceptively high-end concept to advance the scope of human knowledge and science. The film's strong points are its ambition. The future landscape presented here also reminded me a bit of "Blade Runner"(82) - a fantastical, alien and truly futuristic feel (except for the tacky future cars on rural roads and a suburban pool straight out of the eighties). It's uneven, though all the big city visuals and scenes with the mechas succeed. But this is the 3rd film I've so far mentioned AI reminded me of, which points to a weakness - it's definitely derivative - probably because it was rushed, as mentioned. And though the story is surprisingly hard-edged and even adult for the most part, Spielberg reverts to a very saccharine climax, intended, it seems, for science fiction fans in the 7-year-old age group. Heavy and deep concepts having to do with the nature of being human, of the supposedly special nature of humanity, are brushed over rather than tackled, in favor of the fairy tale aspect. What the hell was Hurt really intending or planning in the end? We'll never know - probably because the filmmakers didn't either. I didn't mind the sudden new time era in the final 15 minutes since at least it was a genuine surprise and innovative by today's standards. But the last minute was a bit of a cheat - nowhere to go but the big sleep. Picture Spielberg tucking in the audience after feeling guilty for traumatizing them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Loving Tribute to Kubrick and Spielberg Movie Themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Artificial Intelligence" is a love story about the movies, about the love of something artificial by something artificial. Don't we seem to love our movie characters more than real people? "AI" intentionally combines the iconic images of both Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg, sometimes working together, sometimes conflicting, sometimes taking turns, with Spielberg the survivor as the victor.There are almost as many references to other movies as in "Shrek," but here done with love and longing, not satire. The primary reference is to "Wizard of Oz" from a tarted up Emerald City ("Rouge City"), a search to get back home, asking a Wizard ("Dr. Know") to lead them there. References fly by to movies such as "Rosemary's Baby" (with the ineffectual husband agreeing to bring a diabolical child into the family) to "Mad Max at Thunderdome" (with a post-apocalyptic violent cathartic entertainment) to finding a key remembrance in a pocket like Zuzu's petals. The mood music the Gigolo "mecha" plays are all soundtracks from movies (from Busby Berkeley movies to "Guys and Dolls").But as with "Shrek" there's also extended digs at Disney. While there's references to the scary flight in the woods from "Snow White" and the abandonment by Mom in "Dumbo" -- two of the scariest scenes in my childhood movie memories -- the two central tent poles are the source material for Disney animated classics, but challenging and combining them with different interpretations, "Pinocchio" (with readings from the original book - about another artificial boy who wants to be real) and yet another Spielberg re-visiting of "Peter Pan" (with an extended quote from the lyrics to "Never Never Land" about a boy who desperately wants a mother and doesn't want to grow up). Unlike "Toy Story," these Super Toys stay alive when humans are around.The movie is also a tour through the careers of both Spielberg and Kubrick. The challenge that Spielberg explicitly lays down to Disney is that he wants to "combine flat fact with fairy tale" (i.e. a career statement from the guy who did "E.T." and "Hook" as well as "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan"). There goes a spooky image from "A Clockwork Orange," here comes "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" (including the music theme), here comes HAL, there goes "E.T.". Spielberg takes the ending of" 2001: A Space Odyssey" and puts his own stamp on what the Star Child was all about.While movies like "Princess Bride" posit True Love as the strongest power in the universe, Spielberg instead sees it as the love of a child -- even an artificial child -- for its mother -- even though that love is programmed and the child finds (and rejects) the actual father who created him and loves him. (Sibling rivalry seems to be the second most powerful force, per Cain and Abel).While my husband was in tears at the conclusion, I found that by the time that ending came around after 2 1/2 hours of several false endings, I was feeling uncomfortable with the Oedipal thrust. My kids hated it.(originally written 6/30/2001)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, a great movie. It's both Haley's de-luxe performance in one of his most demanding roles and the visual artwork applied by Steven Spielberg. The mother-son aspect is really emotional. I also liked Jake Thomas' appearance, which was short but very smart and straight. Again, there aren't many young actors around who would have succeeded in playing Haley's character in here as sophisticated as he did. Wonderful movie. It's not one of my favorites though, as there's too much emphasis on special and visual effects to my mind that detracts the viewers' attention from the storyline. It generally features a nice cast. Still I think it's overdone with visual effects. A bit less of visual input would have added more authenticity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film and have difficulty comprehending how some people can dismiss it as "stupid" or "dumb".Yes, it was sentimental and yes, at times the science seems to be lacking. (My main concern was how David's power source kept him running for thousands of years). However, it was visually stunning and surely - to most intelligent viewers - would provoke all kinds of questions about the nature of life, consciousness and being human. If David's love for his mother is artificial, does that make it any less valid? Does being created by humans make him less of a "person" than a human being, although he can think and feel? Do any of the mechas deserve the treatment they get, or should we not extend to them the compassion that "living" creatures (including most animals) usually get? Finally, isn't it a strength in a film if it provokes these kind of questions but doesn't attempt simple answers, leaving the audience to work out their own feelings about them?I felt there were no bad performances, with Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law as accomplished as ever. The ending was perhaps a little oversentimental, but I found it uplifting. It's certainly likely that Stanley Kubrick's version would have been more downbeat, but I've always considered him overrated: his cold and cynical view ruined at least one film for me and made another of his "masterpieces" unsatisfying. Heresy as it may be, I would describe AI as Kubrick's greatest film - ironic that it was one he didn't direct.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, the main thing that struck me about this film was; Human beings are bad and evil and selfish plus; If you are good looking sweet faced and appealing you deserve to live, but if you are odd looking, then it's the acid wash or dismemberment for you! The little lad David was an obnoxious little snot and part of me wished he would go under the acid in the 'Flesh Fair' scene but no - the mob decided that because he was appealing looking he could live, when all those other odd looking machines prior to him, the poor dustbin with a face and the machine with the woman's face plus the others were rounded up and torn apart! I did like the Gigolo Joe character, the way he moved and spoke, and how he changed his hair colour with a twitch and switched on romantic music by jerking his head. What he said, about how human beings could never love AI's, they could use them, but could never really love them because they weren't really alive said it all for me. But I wish some not so photogenic creature had more of a starring role. (Teddy not included, he was sweet therefore fitted in with what was right!) I'll probably get into trouble for writing this, now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one part Bladerunner, two part Pinocchio, and a dash Bicentennial man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To make one A.I. take one part Bladerunner, two parts Pinocchio, and a dash of Bicentennial man then bake. The story deals with the journey of a small android boy that travels a path(very similar to Pinocchio's) who is looking for love(similarly to Bicentennial man). This movie revolves around questions, mostly the same questions asked in Bladerunner. Questions like, just because androids were created by humans, does that mean that their emotions are not real? And if they are not technically 'alive' do they still have a right to live? In the movie they answer few of the questions asked but not many, leaving it up to the viewer to think about them and answer them on their own. And indeed, finding the answers can prove quite thought provoking.Another plus is this movie has a very tangible feel to it. When watching this movie I was able to easily imagine this was the world in a couple centuries. I think the ending was a bit obvious and possibly unoriginal, but it did fit the storyline. Other than the ending, it's not hard to see why this movie won awards. The acting was quite good and Spielberg's had a tremendous eye for what he was doing, especially since a good portion of this movie was blue-screened.If you need there to be explosions to for you to sit through a sci-fi movie, this ain't for you. With plenty of well written dialogue and good special effects there's lots to look at, but no real tense action sequences. If you slept through sci-fi classics like 2001 then you may find yourself sleepy by the end. But overall I say this movie is definitely worth a rent, from science fiction buffs to students of philosophy, AI will at very least make you think.</fullReview>

Had it been directed by the late great Stanley Kubrick as it was intended to, This movie could've been a controversial masterpiece and a cinematic classic! Judging by what Kubrick's other films our like, i am sure that the original draft or idea for this movie was much darker, crude and possibly much funnier and the biggest disappointment is that Spielberg made this movie to light, too much of a fairy tale and he shot a number of scenes in this movie horribly as he tried to be much like Kubrick filming this movie, which is impossible. Mr. Kubrick left this earth too soon and it makes me sad too think of how great he could've made this movie! Nice try Spielberg but no one can replace Kubrick. 3/5 rating</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I could really care less about how the movie evolved into the end result. If, in the final analysis, it was a work of art and storytelling, or if it was total puppy poop, the result affects *me*, the audience member. So to all who are making comparisons and voicing expectations in their reviews, I say that you are better showing off how marketing has controlled (and may still *be* controlling) your perspectives.To the people comparing 21st Century Spielberg to 20th Century Spielberg, I say that you need to broaden your range of storytelling styles. You'll be a lot less disappointed and better able to nail what makes a film work or not work.A.I. poses --- no, *demands consideration of* a morality question. Is it ethical to create a robot who can love? In fact, when do we know when we've crossed the line ethically in our invention of machines to appease our desire for convenience and gratification? The movie is terrifying and surreal. Visually, it breaks ground in going past spectacular. The film, in a word, is a success.For those who somehow think Spielberg equals feel-good, light hearted fare, and that he should not tell such tales as this, or "Saving Private Ryan" or "Schindler's List", all I can say is that you are inadvertently pigeonholing a brilliant director. The kinder ending of A.I. annoyed quite a few people who thought the film should have ended twenty minutes earlier. I disagree. The ending gave the movie symmetry.See this film, but use your brain when watching. Otherwise, you can always rent "The Musketeer" or "Freddy Got Fingered".</fullReview>

She does the cruelest thing possible to him under the guise of love. David-along with Teddy and the script-is left in the woods to fend for himself.The ensuing quest for the Blue Fairy, and silhouettes against giant "E.T." full moons left me wondering if David would be able to phone home. The story really started spiraling downward at the Flesh Fair. But when "Lil' Penny" showed up, it hit rock bottom. That was ridiculous.The ultimate irony of David's existence, the reasoning behind the Flesh Fairs and the ending was not lost on me. I was able to appreciate it. But ultimately, I only felt empathy for Teddy. I had long since lost interest in David's plight.</fullReview>

(It was worth seeing the movie simply to watch this kid act.)While the plot was an intriguing twist on the Pinocchio theme, it seemed to pander to it a little too much, and yet at the same time, it went out of its way, in a contrived manner, to be tragic. A recurring theme, it would seem, in the young Osment's career as of late (c.f., "Pay it Forward").But then again, I'll admit, I'm a sucker for a happy ending.

The kid is a four-foot emotional Terminator, as one-dimensional in his single-minded pursuit of motherly love as Schwarzenegger was in his pursuit of mindless destruction.But it's Spielberg's film, and his characteristic touches really botch the tone in several places. The cozy, Babe-like narration at the beginning and end comes off as simply odd. And Spielberg obviously tries to sell the ending--in actuality as creepy and unsettling as the rest of the film--as a happy one. You can tell he wants you to walk away with the warm fuzzies, and it makes you wonder how he can be so clueless as a director.Other parts of the film actually benefit from the combination of childlike wonder and erie coolness. There's a breathtaking scene in which the boy's body is dragged through the streets of submerged Manhattan by a silver school of fish. And the world of our robotic inheritors, in a snowy future 2,000 years away, is just astonishing.A remarkable mess, worth several viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epic moral issue of Love and Our Ability to be loved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take away the SC-FI images, the 2000 years of history, strip away the aliens, and the script is reduced to one single heart ripping thought; humans must love and be loved to be real. I am. Love me.As I am more of a Speilberg fan than Kubrick, I am on the same level as the director therefore I allowed and trusted him to navigate me through his and Stanley's storyline. I do not cry at movies. I want action, explosions, aliens, Indiana Jones and nothing else, and truthfully I avoided this movie when it first came out. Most of my friends were split down the middle on whether they liked it or not. As such they either hated it with passion or loved it unconditionally.I have mother/son issues that were recently explored and happily resolved, so A.I. spoke very clearly to me. I cried when she left him alone in the woods. I understood his desire to be loved and his confusion on how to satisfy that very human yearning. Steven makes us painfully aware that real children are somehow inhuman and inhumane. A chilling scene where the boy robot turns to his human brother for protection ironically seals 'David's fate', and begins his journey down the road of redemption. His version of redemption lays in his desire to become real - thus receiving his mother's love uncoditionally. As the genre of Sc-Fi supplies the writer/director a timeless canvas to convey the lengths in which real people go to -- to get that base love, and we the audience are treated to a revealing peek at our world's fate in the future. Love me. I am. I love you. Like Steven did with "Hook", on the issues of growing up, here his eye swepts through the well known fable of Pinnoccio (check spelling) never missing a chance to incorporate subtle references along the way. He doesn't try to hide that fact, instead he embraces it. We know the story. We know why the puppet wants to be real. It is something we all want -- to be real, to be heard, respected. In David's world these are things only achievable through love returned. From the underwater grave of Coney Island(Pleasure Island),and the tail of the whale, David being trapped in the belly of a beast to the Blue Fairy, and a moment in time with the one we are imprinted upon from birth Steven Speilberg and the late Stanley K carve out a momument to the importance of being loved, and the power that comes with it, apower that can move mountains, heal wounds and console us in times when the world itself does not appear to be real. Thank you Steven -- yet again for another journey within the human condition. Odd how it took a non human to tell it. In conclusion I am mystified as to why Jude Law was not nominated for an Oscar in the Best Supporting Actor category, or why Haley Joel was not, or why the picture wasn't nominated. I will never understand the Hollywood machine but I certainly understood this movie from the first frame to the last bitter sweet drop of human love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I didnt like it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I was quite excited the first time I saw the trailer for AI at the movies. I thought this looks like a good film.When I finally watched it I almost had to leave it half way through because it was so depressing and dull and very very boring.I stayed until the end but I could not wait for it to be over or at least get better..It started well with a good build up and nice effects but the scenes were all very stiff and stale. Even when it "hotted up" a little and David goes on his adventure it becomes more morbid as you watch humans gathered around an arena watching humanoid and non-humanoid robots being destroyed for fun... all from the point of view of a *little boy* robot who is also up for the chop... It was all so dark and dreary.Then came the sci-fi ending with all the effects but no substance...I was utterly disapointed with this film and would rate it the worst film I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant story about human irresponsibility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick was such a force in the film making world. When I knew he was involved with Artificial Intelligence, I was expecting and wanted just 1 thing - a Stanley Kubrick film. When I finally saw AI, I saw far too many of Spielberg's trademarks; an annoying offspring (Martin), a dysfunctional Caucasian family, fun music during the action scenes, mommies, and so on.It took 6 years and about 5 viewings for me to finally 'get it', to see through the Spielbergyness, and to just watch it without picking it apart or wishing Kubrick had directed it. This isn't a movie about mommies and sons. Its not really much of a fairy tale. Artificial Intelligence is a brilliant and complex film about human irresponsibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry to say that AI fails to carry on the tradition of great story-telling by Spielberg. The film starts out as a somewhat compelling story but quickly dissipates into a ridiculous plot involving a robotic male prostitute and robots being shot out of cannons. When the film concentrates on the boy's quest for an organic nature, it's fine, and the ending actually is very good. But the majority of the film is stupid, silly, carnival-like and a waste of time. The sad thing is that there are great ideas that could have been woven here, but unfortunately Spielberg has put together a dog.</fullReview>

Instead, we have a last half hour which is some of the most nauseating sentimental slop I've ever seen in a movie, ruining the, in any case, no better than average work we've had up to then. Garish photography, unsympathetic characters, and poor music complete the movie's demise. Don't bother with this one unless you enjoy going to the dentist with cavities. Rating: 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. is enjoyable, admirable, aesthetically pleasing, and just a great movie. As I watched the movie, I kept thinking that something was wrong, although I could not realize what it was right away. Suddenly it struck me; this was not just a Spielberg movie. In fact, this was not a Spielberg film at all. It was just Spielberg imitating the late Stanley Kubrick. The idea for the story had been something that Stanley Kubrick had been working on, but after Kubrick's passing Spielberg took on the project. It seemed to me as if he had tried to bring the story to life like Kubrick would have done, but it ended up being just a Kubrickist presentation, and not the real thing.Although, I wish that Kubrick was the one who saw this project to completion, it is more regrettable that Steven Spielberg did not create his own vision, rather than building upon the foundation that his late friend had lain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the knowledge that this movie was originally Kubrick's idea, I start thinking back to his "Clockwork Orange" and how wonderful it was. When I first started watching the movie I hoped to see the brilliant storytelling of Kubrick and a little of the mainstream of Spielberg. Much to my disappointment, the movie seemed to gloss over most of the moments Kubrick would have milked and instead went for the 'oh, Haley, isn't that so sad-' moments. There was too much theatricalness in the movie and not enough gritty thought provoking film. It'll make you think, but I don't think it makes you think about what Kubrick would've intended. I enjoyed, yes, I thought it was a great film, and very well done.. BUT I wish it had been more true to a Kubrick style film - edgy, gritty, dark, nearly absurd in the best sense of the word. Check it out definitely, but don't expect Kubrick. :-(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreaking fable about unrequited love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A.I." rests heavily upon the central character and Haley Joel Osment's extraordinary performance carries it. David is not real, but Osment makes you *feel* for him. Osment nails his part and breaks your heart. It's his best performance to date and worthy of Oscar. Jude Law gives a flashy performance that is perfect for his part. Since his mecha is just a machine, Law has few emotional notes to play.The movie resonates deeply as a story about unrequited love. The experience of loving someone deeply who is incapable or unwilling of returning our love is universal.*POSSIBLE SPOILER*The ending that so many people want to attribute to Steven Spielberg is the one intended by Stanley Kubrick. The ending is not clearly a happy one. Rather it ends ambiguously. David is redeemed and finds happiness, but it doesn't last. When he awakes from his rest - if he awakes - all he will be left with are memories.(9/10) One of the ten best of 2001</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very interesting to read the wide range of opinions on this movie. Some people seem to really, really hate it, and others seem to really love it. I must say that I fall somewhere in between.***Minor Spoilers***The first thing that made it turn bad for me is the choice of couples that the robot boy is going to be given to. Granted, the son is in a coma at the beginning, but a third-grader could have guessed that he would come out of it and that the robot and the real kid would have to compete for the parent's affection. The robot was given to these people simply to set up the drama for the rest of the movie.Next...The mother is horrified at the idea of the robot boy being disassembled, but she has no problem with leaving him alone in the woods? Either she cares or she doesn't, which is it? I know the kid was "only" a robot, but the premise of the story is that he can experience love and other empotions. I actually felt bad for the kid when he gets left in the woods. How could it NOT have been better to have him disassembled?The last complaint of have is the length of the movie and the numerous "endings." To me, there is nothing worse than a movie that makes you think it's over but, surprise! it's not. You can definitely see the Speilberg touch when you finally get to the "happy" ending.Overall, the movie is OK. I was so looking forward to it and I walked out very disappointed. I would give it 5 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. was the best movie of 2001. Thought provoking and intelligent, well acted and a true visual feast. Seeing it on opening night I can recall walking out of the theater puzzled and intensely moved. 2 days later I saw it again, it held up for me and I am eagerly anticipating the March 5th dvd release of the film. While it's not Spielberg's best, it is certainly his most unique work. I would rank it as his seventh finest film, the top six being 1.Schindler's List 2.Raiders of the Lost Ark 3.E.T. 4.Saving Private Ryan 5. Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and Jaws at number six. At the same time it's my current personal favorite because it's fresh in my mind and new. I wanted that adrenaline rush, that sweeping magical feeling of seeing a new Spielberg film, that same feeling E.T. provided when I was seven. It's never the same as when your a kid, but I wasn't disappointed. ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** It's the images that will haunt your dreams. Most great films stand out from their signature shots or lines, A.I. is no exception. Haley Joel Osment, face pressed to a counter top giving off a reflection of wonder at the world he now inhabits. The moon balloon rising up over a vista to hunt down wayward mechas. David wandering the aisles of the robot factory in horror over the assembly line nature of his being, a shot that smacks of sheer Twilight Zone classics. Gigolo Joe clicking his mechanical body into a frenzy while preaching to David about Rouge City. TEDDY is a godsend, an animatronic creation so seamless and savvy he lives and breathes in this film. Haley Joel plunging into the waters from a submerged Manhattan skyscraper. The underwater journey past sunken landmarks like Coney Island and Radio City Music Hall. Discarded Mechas sorting through a trash heap for broken parts. All in all fantastic. Just to rant and rave, let's face it 98-99% of movies released are pretty bad. Example: A friend of mine I used to work with last year went to the movies quite a bit and saw these movies-3,000 miles to graceland,saving silverman,american pie 2, exit wounds,the fast and the furious, the mummy returns,pearl harbor (3 or 4 times) i'm sure he saw other movies, but you get the point. I asked him "What about A.I." he said that his friends mom had seen it and it was a futuristic Pinocchio and she didn't like it, therefore that's all he needed to hear. Not that I was surprised by his reply, it just further cemented my belief that great films scare away the mainstream. It doesn't matter that A.i. didn't rake in gobs of cash(although worldwide it did just fine) it dared to do something much more than that, to stimulate ones mind and make people look inside themselves, to question their existence and the existence of the future itself. In 20 years this may be the only movie remembered from such a dismal movie year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be called "Superficial Intelligence"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've come a long way from Jaws and ET, and that's not a compliment. Here the slick commercial hollowness of most of Spielberg's work finally ruptures releasing a long, drawn out stream of hot air. Whew, open a window. Really, the only question you need to ask yourself is how much would you pay to see the special effects, because both the philosophical underpinnings and the storyline fall completely flat.Well, perhaps not completely. In the beginning there are some good scenes where the robot boy's limitations are examined. Then later there is a somewhat disturbing scene where futuristic Luddites take revenge on the humanoid "mechas" (robots) -- quite well done. Also the robot gigolo, played to the hilt by Jude Law, is almost believable even in close up, and certainly likeable. Unrobotically illogical, but heck, fun.Anyway, a movie is not made from great scenes or individual characters, it has to pull together. This movie lacks an overall concept. Instead of moving forward, it phase shifts into a series of alternate realities. In the end you wonder ... where is the end? Are we there yet? It would be interesting to know how this project was greenlighted when the story was so poorly conceived. That's why I say it's a far cry from Jaws or ET. Hey, in ET the alien went home, in Jaws they killed the giant shark. That's how you end a movie. Here the little robot boy just keeps going and going -- somebody pull out his energizers, *thank you*!(Brian Aldiss, a true artistic visionary amoung sci-fi writers, should be embarrassed to have his name even indirectly associated with this work.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the other reviewer of this film, I did not look forward to it's release. I was held captive on a 13 hour flight to China and was shown this film as a distraction. I'm more than happy to watch a film with an open mind. The idea of this film was familiar to me as I had recalled seeing a preview for it way back before it's release. However, I was aware of it's quiet bombing effect on the box office. Both my boyfriend and myself sat quietly on the plane watching and just couldn't believe it when the film failed to end. It seems to happen more frequently lately that films continue on when they should end the story, they feel compelled to drag the story out to a certain length. Maybe they feel people will be disappointed by a film that is too short. I'd rather hear a great story than one that goes on for 30-60 extra minutes beyond it's expected closure. Look at "La Jette" the 20 minute film that completely tells a story with total satisfaction. (I may have the title slightly incorrect).Anyway, I just didn't care about this fake little boy. I didn't care or understand why they kept a robot around after their healthy child returned home. It was a ROBOT, who cares about a ROBOT? He didn't have feelings, they never proved to me that he cared, I more or less felt it was a computer program gone wrong. Then, when it failed to end, when this strange journey took place, under water, through a strange immersed New York City. It just got dumber and dumber - what were you thinking?????Sorry, I hate to be such a downer but I really disliked this movie, and I was not alone, I could tell by the murmurs on the plane it was generally disliked. Please make shorter and more compelling stories. This one was a horrible failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Behind the lines a prime example of what makes Humans Human and Machines mechanical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the film looked fantastic and the story was interesting but in making a film about a machine that could love all I saw was how there is still such a huge gaping chasm between humans and robots. David, although purportedly more human than any other robot still acts tragically like a robot throughout the film. His inability to accept any other idea or 'programming' even when it was patently obvious his quest was futile just served to remind us of how inflexible and mechanical his decision making processes were. If a person falls out of a relationship they generally accept it and look for something else. David was unable to do this, and it just showed us how inhuman he really was. What makes humans human is their ability to CHANGE their priorities; change their 'programming' in a sense, Something David was unable to do. And where the film fell down was the bizarre contrast of this with the actions of Gigolo Jo, who abandons his original programming to follow David off on his pointless jaunt in search of his 'mother', a much more 'human' decision than ever David managed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've yet to see all of the top rated films of the year, but i must conclude that out of what i've seen so far this year, AI ranks among the best. The critics loved it, while most moviegoers seemed to hate it. There were many parts where the film dragged and I got a little bored, but the overall film is very good. The score by John Williams was great. The dark, icy "Tim Burton/Stanley Kubricky" feeling was chilling (there were some parts that gave me Close Encounters of the Third Kind flashbacks). The storyline was a bit unoriginal but Haley Joel Osment gave a great performance as did the always charming Jude Law; the photography was also inspiring. "Teddy" is a toy that i'm sure you'll put on your x-mas list after you see this movie. This is my favorite film by the acclaimed director so far (I have not seen Schindler's List), but it's not going to entertain moviegoers who aren't as patient or moviegoers who do not like the surrealistic type of film-making. Rent this film at your own risk. I loved it, the critics loved it, but most moviegoers couldn't tolerate it... Hopefully your opinion of this movie will be somewhere in the brighter part of the wide spectrum of opinions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual, thought provoking, visually stunning, entertaining and well made movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Positive aspects: A.I. is an unusual movie with an original story, it is not a typical Hollywood movie even though it is made by Spielberg, the Hollywood icon (and that is why it was not a boxoffice success, it is too intelligent and too tragic). A.I. is also visually stunning with excellent performances from the actors, especially Haley Joel Osment (who was so brilliant in the Sixth Sense) but also Jude Law are very good. It is a movie for adults and it contains disturbing scenes. (I.e. the scenes were humans are making a show out of destroying humanoid robots reminded me of Romeros' Dawn of the Dead and Savinis' remake of Night of the Living Dead.) There are also some scenes that are absurdly humoristic (I was laughing at the teddybear). You will see New York like you have never seen it before (very impressive) and hopefully never will in real life.The plot is well made and thought provoking. I know that some reviewers on IMDB do not share my opinion on this (or pretend that they don't) but I think most of them are real snobs who are comparing A.I. with how they think the movie would have been if Stanley Kubrick would have made it, the kind of people who say that they don't like the excellent Saving Private Ryan and who thinks that The Duel is Spielbergs best movie (Because it was low budget, not so commercial etc. Sure it was good, but it was not logical as far as I can remember and it was not an important movie, just a good thriller). The sheer number of people who has written reviews of A.I. is also an indication of the importance of this movie, it has emotional impact, you will not forget this movie soon after you have seen it.The movie is very good from the beginning (the scenes involving William Hurt are impressive) and the pacing is good through most of the movie (but not towards the end). It is also possible to make a comparison between the humans treatment of the robots with the nazi Holocaust (and Spielberg is jewish I believe).Negative aspects: I felt it was about half an hour too long. The ending felt tucked on and was unnecessary. Sometimes Spielberg tends to be too sentimental and he has a weakness for the supernatural which shows during the ending of the movie (thankfully only in the ending).Final comment: The ending is the weakest point, but I felt that there are two earlier moments in the movie were it could have ended and if it had the movie would have been better so I just pretend that it did. I think the ending was tucked on as a crowd pleaser but it is not a total disaster since it is not without tragic. It could have been worse. This is a must see, some love it some hate it, no one is indifferent. Rating: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the moral?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly, this movie did not live up to all the hype nor to Spielberg's well-deserved reputation. The story takes place sometime in the future after the polar caps have melted and water is virtually everywhere, having wiped out most of the world's population. Thirteen-year-old Haley Joel Osment (of "Sixth Sense" and "Forrest Gump") plays a "mecha," a robot so sophisticated that it can imprint on its owners (or parents) and will love them forever. He really owned the show; was in virtually every frame, and he is a wonderful young actor. Jude Law, a very gifted actor of considerable range and excellent physical skills, plays Gigolo Joe, a mecha designed for, well, you can guess. The production is elaborate, imaginative, and very high-tech.But aside from these three high points, unfortunately, the story (part fairy tale/part science fiction/part morality play) is helter-skelter, the movie is overlong, and we came away from it saying, "And just what is the moral?" I won't detain you with the plot except to say that the boy mecha is designed to love its parent but the question remains as to whether the parent can return that love, and David (Osment) spends most of the movie desperate to find out.It's evident that the movie was a merger of two directors' efforts. Stanley Kubrick worked on the idea for seven or eight years before his sudden death in 1999, and Spielberg took over the project, completed the screenplay, and shot the movie.As an avid Spielberg fan, I was really excited about this movie, and my eighteen-year-old couldn't wait to see Jude Law (who IS an incredible hottie), but we all agreed that "E.T." it ain't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Contains Spoilers** This is a bad movie. Bad in every sense of the word. It insults the intelligence of the audience. It is badly-made. It is bland and inane. It is poorly-plotted. It is pretentious in the extreme. It is bad. It tells the oh-so-heart-warming story of the robot child David who is adopted by a family... with hilarious consequences. Early on in this trash, William Hurt's character comments that the chosen family for David is perfect. Clearly not. For one, they already have a son. Surely childless families would be more appropriate? For another, the aforementioned son is in a coma somewhere. The possibility is that he may wake up at any time, though clearly the family have given up on this. But guess what? Now, if you had created a robot child, it would make sense, would it not, to do some serious research into exactly the kind of family that could benefit from his presence, and from whom he could benefit. But no, in the interests of inane drama, the doltish scientists place him with these idiots, whose child duly wakes up. So then the kid gets dumped in the woods by his "mother". Gee, she sure was an appropriate parent, right? But she does this to protect him because he has to go back to the factory. So that's okay. Because she loves him like a mother loves a son. Sniff. It would perhaps have been more interesting if the two of them had run off together, encountering anti-robot and anti-human aggression on their adventures. That could have made for a decent ninety minute movie. Perhaps. But Sir Steve and his mentor, Sir Stanley, have other ideas. So there's a surprisingly bland and low-budget-looking sequence involving a "flesh fair" and the unnecessary but at least interesting "Gigolo Joe" character and some guys on bikes that look like they strayed into the film from the set of "Mad Max Rip-Off 3: The Bottom of the Barrel". Christ, you think, this garbage must be over soon. Wrong. David finds William Hurt, who promptly disappears, leaving the kid in a room full of replicas of him/itself, all set to be distributed to other appropriate families - no doubt ones with loads of children, or dead children, or otherwise traumatised ones, rather than ones with no children at all. Then there's some patronising and stupefying stuff about "Pinocchio". Holy SH*T you're thinking, this can't get any worse. And is this Spielberg guy serious? Oh, you bet. Just to prove how serious he is, there's Ben Kingsley on the soundtrack, explaining everything to us. Which is nice. Cut to three thousand years later (or thereabouts) and David is on the bottom of the ocean, and aliens/robots/future humans (who cares what they are) are examining him and granting him his last wish. Or something. After the shameful, disgraceful, "Saving Private Ryan" and the embarrassing "One after Saving Private Ryan that no-one went to see" this is surely the final nail in the coffin of Saint Steven's career. Apparently not. Instead of being relegated to second unit on the sequel to "Freddy Got Fingered", this obviously worn-out and inspiration-less hack is about to give us "Minority Report" with Tom Cruise and no doubt loads of great computer-generated effects. Can't wait. Can you? "A.I" is abysmal. It is sad and foolish and nonsensical and patronising and inane and deadly dull and uninspired and just plain awful. Oh, and if you want a laugh, check out Alex Walker's hilarious review of it in London's Evening Standard last year. Far more entertaining than this cretinous waste of celluloid.</fullReview>

In fact, I was so overcome with emotion by the end of the movie, I was literally choking back sobs. Why did this movie affect me? I honestly don't know. It might have to do with the fact that I'm fascinated by anything that has to do with the future. I worry about it sometimes, like what will happen. What if the polar ice caps melt? What will we do? When and how far will artificiality go? And how real will they be considered? or what are the moral implications of A.I.? Compared to most viewers and my worries about the future (I'm not paranoid about it though), I think I had an unusually strong emotional reaction. Maybe it was Haley Joel Osment's amazing performance. One thing I noticed is that like a true robot, he never blinked. He was actually kind of creepy at first, but by the end I actually felt extremely sorry for David, even though he was, essentially, a machine. That kid deserves another Oscar nomination.Jude Law's performance was also very good, his character Gigolo Joe was entertaining and lightened up the somber mood cast by David's obsession with finding the Blue Fairy and reuniting with his mother (played wonderfully by Frances O'Connor). I would have liked to see more of his character interacting with his "clients". The concept of an artificial lover was intriguing. With his perfectly made up features, he looked artificial but strikingly beautiful. He was all style, all prancing, preening attitude.On a technical aspect, A.I. is phenomenal. Spielberg's directing is topnotch, turning the movie from a sterile quietness in the beginning to a warm solitude at the end. The visual effects are astounding, but subtle. They are not the reason for seeing it, nor do they think they are. They are used to help tell the story, not be the story like in most summer popcorn flicks. Spielberg's effects are reminiscent of past work, especially with the use of the ultra-advanced robots at the end, and the scenes of a drowned and abandoned New York City are both beautiful and haunting.It's easy to see why critics and movie-goers are half and half on the film. Some may find the pace too slow, for one. And it's certainly not a check-your-brains-at-the-door summer popcorn flick. Maybe it's too intelligent? I was stunned over and over again by its ability to raise important philosophical and social issues.It is a journey into the mind and into the soul of humanity; searching for questions and answers concerning our existence and the meaning of our presence. It is very good that the film doesn't provide any real answers to the questions it raises. If it would have tried to, A.I. would have been just another unrealistic Hollywood, sci-fi blockbuster. It was very brave of Steven Spielberg to avoid pleasing the crowd with easy answers and a normally developing story.There are lots of questions you'll be asking yourself at the end and lots of people hate when a films meaning isn't handed to them on a silver platter. But I think if you are reasonably mature, intelligent and can appreciate a movie that forces you to think, it is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen lots of bad reviews of this movie. I don't care that Spielburg didn't make it cute and fuzzy like his usual film, something that seems to bother many. I was amazed that he made a nihilistic statement about humanity, that we are killing our species and can be replaced by better beings of our own creation. Our most "human' attributes, love and compassion, can exist and apparently can exist more perfectly, in manufactured beings. The route to this disturbing concept was visually striking, the story original. The trailers looked like those for a kiddie flick. This certainly was not. It was well done, powerful tragedy. (Well, maybe the fairy princess in the ice could have had less screen time.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film both technically and thematically.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thought that came to my mind, after seeing "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" was, "When can I see it again?" I was fortunate enough to see Steven Spielberg's ("Jaws", "Jurassic Park", "Schindler's List") on opening night, before critical and public reviews were circulated, so as not to jade my objectivity. What I found was a highly schizophrenic film with an even higher schizophrenic reception. While the film's elements of Stanley Kubrick ("2001: A Space Odyssey", "A Clockwork Orange"), who work on the film for fifteen years, and Steven Spielberg clashed, so did the critics and the "Joe Moviegoer." Yet the best of films, are those that cause such polarities. "A.I" while not a perfect film, is a flawed masterpiece that restored my faith in an increasingly mindless industry of sex, explosions and mediocrity.In the distant future, global warming has caused the polar icecaps to melt, killing millions, and destroying natural resources. Because of this, the more "civilized nations" enacted pregnancy restrictions, which created a need and a market for artificial intelligence. One scientist sets out to create a child mecha with real human emotion and feelings or couples who are unable to obtain a pregnancy license. Twenty months later, David (Haley Joel Osment) is created and given to a trial family (Henry and Monica Swinton), whose son is cryogenically frozen due to an incurable disease. The child comes with an "imprinting code" that "hardwires him to love" the person or couple that imprints. It is irreversible and if the couple decides they do not want to keep the mecha, they must return it to the manufacture for destruction. David is not received automatically into the family, but gradually steals Monica's needy heart. She imprints herself upon him, and the two of them form a disturbing attachment, much in the spirit of Oedipus Rex. However, the Swinton's son is miraculously cured, and returns home catalyzing a sibling rivalry for the love of Mommy. Consequently, an unfortunate situation occurs, leaving Monica to leave David in the middle of a forest. It is here that David sets out on a quest to find the "Blue Fairy" (from Pinocchio), who will make him into a real boy.With this surface storyline, Kubrick and Spielberg undertake the primary objective of the film. That is, to comment on human nature in all of its complexities and frailties. The irony of the picture, is that the character most human, is David, actually inhuman. Let's say that David is, at first, a clean slate to be graced and marred by his human counterpoints. With brilliant cinematic imagery, we repeatedly see David as a "reflection" from mirrors, chimes, coffee lids and the like. Continuing this imagery, the usage of the moon, also suggests the reflective nature of the boy mecha. As David imitates the emotions he sees, he becomes more and more humanlike, and is able to show all extremes of human nature. The broad spectrum of human nature is encapsulated in a creation of hardwires and chips. From David's obsessive desire to be loved, to his jealous fit of "murderous" self-preservation (destroying another "David"), he is the essence of human nature: a series of actions that reduce to love and hate. But these actions originated at the beginning of mankind. The first demonstration of love is God's creation of man, and the first demonstration of hate is Cain's murder of Abel. In the film, Dr. Hobby's creation of David is an act of love; bringing to "life" a being to share mutual happiness. In response to this, when David destroys his predecessor, he "falls from grace" and commits his first act of hate; murder (interestingly, David committed murder the same way as Cain did).In the same way as David and Cain, our current human state is that of mixed emotions: we have both passionate love and hate. And as David was eternally searching for meaning so, too, are we. Where will we find it?Overall, the film addresses these questions with accuracy, while never pretending to have the answers. It has definitely proven to be the most thought-provoking film of the summer 2001, and its theme is probably one of the most proactive of mankind.Rating: 4/5 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this is the essentially the same premise as Bicentennial Man, but where that film failed, A.I. succeeds. With the warmth and human touch only Spielberg can give to a film, A.I. offers such a feast for the eyes and mind in a way Spielberg alone can't provide. It's remarkable to see the near dichotomy of the Spielberg-Kubrick styles of filmmaking working symbiotically. Outstanding performances also from several key actors (Jude Law, William Hurt and at times Haley Joel Osment) make A.I. a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg/Kubrick concoction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" is a movie that came from the mind of the late Stanley Kubrick and put together by the great Steven Spielberg. The result: a mostly excellent piece of work. It has terrific performances by two 1999 Best Supporting Actor nominees in Haley Joel Osment ("The Sixth Sense") and Jude Law ("The Talented Mr. Ripley"); its got great technical aspects (special effects, cinematography, art direction, etc.); a well written story (dreamed up by Kubrick); and good direction by Spielberg. I'm still in shock that it didn't do well at the box office this past summer. I thought for sure this was going to be a monster hit. I can't understand why people didn't like this movie. I've always been a big Spielberg fan, and "A.I." for the most part did not disappoint me. The only thing that disappointed me about this movie was the ending which was kind of weak. Aside from that, "A.I." in my mind is a pretty good movie.***1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

The movie could have easily ended twice... but it just didn't... it kept going and going and going...The end really sucked asses... you can really catch the moment where Kubrick left the project, and where Spielberg made all the changes.so, watch half of the movie if you want to have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie that Doesn't Quite Meet its Lofty Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. tries to be many things all at once. It succeeds at this, althoughit is a hindrance throughout the film, weighing it down into murkydepths of obscurity. Did I like the movie? Well, yes, indeed I did. Is it a good movie?Yes, too, it is this. However, is it a movie that everyone must seeand will love? Definitely not. Only a certain kind of person can enjoythis movie. A person who likes both Spielberg and Kubrick, whichis no easy feat. Both moviemakers are talented visionaries, buttheir visions are wildly different. Spielberg is very introspective, focusing on emotions as the keysto his stories. Kubrick's approach is more plot-oriented. He seeshis characters as parts of the background, the scenery, the biggerpicture. Spielberg, on the other hand, goes to painstaking lengthsto focus his camera not on the large external picture, but deepinside the characters inhabiting his story, their very souls for all tosee. He films from the inside-out, while Kubrick does the opposite.And that's what A.I. is: a movie opposite of itself, a conundrum, acomplete and utter mystery.But it works. It is brave and austere, but tender and innocent at thesame time. It reaches for many levels, but as it does, it alsoreaches many plateaus. It tries for so much, but it has set itsexpectations too high. Nonetheless, the film achieves manythings, even if greatness isn't one of them. The movie is divided into three segments (which I call): `Mommy',`Gigolo Joe', and `Submerged'. `Mommy' is sentimental Spielberg, pushing emotion and tugging heartstrings to the verylimit. It was touching, to a certain extent, but not everyone will find itpleasing. Sentimentalists will adore it; mothers will cherish it; menwho are insecure about their sexuality will abhor it (as they abhormany complex things). The plot focuses mainly on the `mecha,'David, programmed to love and struggling to fit into a normalhuman family, yearning for the love his gives out to be returned tohim by `Mommy'. It is Haley Joel Osment's shining moment. It ishis best work to date (a pretty large statement for an adolescent).`Gigolo Joe' is Kubrick, although I am not sure to the extent of hisinvolvement in the production. I have read that he penned theoriginal script, however credit is not given, and I don't know howmuch of his original concept is salvaged by Spielberg in thisproduction. `Gigolo Joe' screams Kubrick to me, simply throughit's madness, it's chaos, and most importantly it's magnetism.The main character, besides Osment's David, is a love-makingmodel mecha, Gigolo Joe, played charmingly and deliciously byJude Law. For a robot who was programmed without emotions, heevokes emotion from those he makes contact with: the women hepleasures, David, and the audience. Joe, strangely enough, hascharacters of human emotion even when he logically shouldn't,which could be considered a flaw in the film, but how could it beany other way? The movie places itself in a tight corner by makingartificial human beings with artificial emotions as its leadcharacters, because how is a human audience supposed to relateto such artificiality? To get around this problem, Spielberg and Co.simply avoid the fact that the emotions, like the intelligence, areartificial. Mechas are given distinct personalities, and with thesepersonalities inevitably come emotions, and I accept it, as willmost. This portion of the movie is definitely my favorite. The FleshFair alone is worth the trip to the video rental store, and a cameoby Chris Rock is one of the highlights of the film (fifteen secondsout of 2 hours and 26 minutes).The third and final segment, `Submerged', places David inManhattan, his birthplace. This part of the movie could have been alot shorter, and the ending could have been a little less sappy, formy particular tastes. It is too clean, and doesn't seem to fit in withthe rest of the film. Whereas the rest is choppy and chaotic (verybefitting of the subject at hand), the final scenes of the film seemto come from a fairy tale where happy endings are guaranteed. Idisapprove of the tidiness of the ending, but not of the sentimentbehind it. Spielberg wants to dearly give his hero the one thing inthe world he yearns for, and he has found a way to do that withoutbeing corny or manipulative. That is truly appreciated by theviewing audience, but the easiness to which the ending comes, tohow David earns his prize does not mesh with the rest of the film.It is at it's core a heroic quest, and the epiphany that the hero mustencounter by the end of the tale is not evident, which sadly takesaway from the rest of the film.When the ending is less than perfect, it tarnishes everything thatcame before it. Where it should be poignant and thought- provoking, the final scenes of A.I. seem to be instead targeted to achild who needs everything explained to him. A movie that tacklesa subject as deep and ambiguous as artificial intelligence shouldhave an ending just as esoteric and cryptic.Although I might sound disappointed, I am giving this movie agood review. It is worth seeing, and Spielberg once again createsa visual, sometimes disturbing, accomplishment. Despite a fewflaws, both minor and major, Artificial Intelligence is still a moviethat imprints unforgettable images into the mind and asksundeniably important questions. It tries desperately to answerthose questions, but it is in search of those alluding answers thatthe film ultimately finds fault. Sometimes the answers are betterleft unsaid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning I didn't quite know what to expect. Some of the characters were too "cute". I was afraid of the movie turning into Stephen King. :)During the movie I thought at two points: "this is it. Now would be a good time to end the movie and leave the audience satisfied but still pondering." Twice, I was pleasantly surprised that the movie did continue after those points.The movie answered to a lot of questions, at least to me it did. Every human wonders sometimes what is the purpose of life. Is there a purpose for the entire human race? And how big is the universe?A.I. can be viewed in so many different ways. My advice is, forget about Kubrick. Forget about Spielberg. Just see the movie and then go see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie, I don't care what anybody says</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had very high hopes that this movie would be great. I went into the the theater expecting great things. Spielburg directs it. Kubrick thought of it. The story itself, the short story it was based on, seemed interesting. With expectations this high, one can only expect that a movie isn't going to meet them. But that wasn't the case. I loved the movie walking out of the theater. I still look back fondly on the movie. Osment was amazing in his role. O'Conner was great as well. The graphics were amazing. Seeing New York City under those conditions was very startling and just fun to watch. The storyline was good, I don't care what anybody else thinks, Act 1 especially. The subtle acting between Osment and O'Conner was very well done. And Spielburg's usual direction was great of course too. Act 2's resemblence to the gathering up of Jewish people during the Holocaust was also great. I do agree on one point most people make. The movie did let me down a bit. It was too much like Bicentennial man. And the obsession of the blue fairy was a little over the top. But I believe that everything else in the movie was great enough to make it a worth-while film. If you haven't seen it, don't let other people's opinions keep you from seeing it. You know, Kubrik's 2001 wasn't recieved well at first either. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hype about A.I. was hard to ignore and difficult to swallow- there was a new film by a most conventional and predictable director trying to emulate the style of another unpredictable, but often boring director- what could be so great about it? I have never liked Steven Spielberg. He has always been a director for the masses- be it Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones or Schindler's List- staple cinematic tricks, high drama, but a little substance.I was definately not wasting time or money on Mr. Spielberg's bid for great storytelling.So, anyway, a friend of mine- not particularly sharp in thought, but I Sci-fi fan nevertheless, came over for coffee one day and told me how disappointed he was at the film- it was really bad, really boring and it went on forever. And as I felt good that I was right about this and he went over the movie scene by scene to prove how much it sucked, I was absolutely amazed to slowly realise that this might be a magnificent film. I must have been absolutely wrong!So I saw it. And it was one of the best films of the last few years- thoughtful, poetic, mystical, cinematically opulent- with every aspect of it perfectly fitting in a whole of an amazing beauty and rhytm.For anyone that has never seen it- do so and watch with your heart. And do ignore the Philistines- they are clueless!</fullReview>

It was very much modeled after a fairy tale (namely, Pinocchio) set in the future, and it was really designed for adults. Be prepared for a slow paced movie, and you should like it.And for the record, those were robots, not aliens.

		<fullReview>Yes I think that 2,5 hours are not enough of this film, and NO I am not crazy. First off all let me say that this was an awful movie.It has to be possibly the worst movie i have seen in the last 2 years. Let's start with the pros of this movie: AMAZING realistic visuals.Unbelievebly realistic. Good perormances. Thats about it The cons are many but IMHO they all come from two sources: The duration of the film , and the script. The script could have been ALLOT better. During the movie you can't really understand why the mother loved him, why the father hated him etc.But that brings us directly to the major flaw of this film:The duration. This movie should have been a trilogy. 3 movies each 2 hours long. A story ( at least an idea like this) can't be told in 2,5 hours.WHat I mostly hated about this film was that it seem to "jump" ahead in time. In one scene the mother hates him , in the next she cries because she looses him? There realationship between the kid and his family are not excplained. Or the way he met Gigolo Joe ( the best character in this film). What was gigolo Joe doing there? In one scene he is in a city , and in the next he is together with the trash robots. And the Meat Feat was also to unexplained. It would have been interesting to take a deeper look in this..THough not as cheese as it looked.. If the movie didn't jump so much it would have been way better.. 1 movie for the kids life in the familie, 1 movie for the life with Gigolo Joe , and 1 movie for the ending. That would be great. Ow but with different visual for the future robots please..</fullReview>

Moreover, it makes the notion of artificial intelligence non-sensical and scalds the cynical adult world for its many follies.

		<shortDescription>a review by Danilo Pochini:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can anyone really be blamed of holding high expectations for a film that joins together two of the most famous, influential, and utterly different filmmakers of the last 40 years? Almost everyone knows the story: A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE was a dream-on-the-shelf project for Stanley Kubrick, who waited many years for the technology to be perfect for his super-ambitious project (some rumors say he ran into the Brian Aldiss short story in the 60's), and planned to finally make the film after 1999's EYES WIDE SHUT. For the first time, though, Kubrick was going to produce and not direct a movie -- Steven Spielberg was going to take that job, since Kubrick thought he wouldn't be able to convey to emotion required by the story, and Spielberg would. Now, two years after Kubrick's death, Spielberg has written, produced, and directed the film that his dead mentor/friend had dreamed of making for decades. Expectations are tremendous for this film. Would Spielberg be able to make a film worthy of Kubrick's mastery? Would it be the film Kubrick would have made?If little else, A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is the kind of film that has you confused and dazed after you've seen it. It's presented with so many different styles that you almost don't know what to think of it. It opens with a Ben Kingsley narration telling us the story is set in the future, where cities near the sea are partially drowned. We meet one professor Hobby (William Hurt), who's at a meeting discussing the incredible advances in technology that robots have made, now called 'mechas'. The pinnacle in mecha technology is represented by David (played by Haley Joel Osment), a robot who can have life-like emotions, like sadness and love. David's 'emotions' will be tested as he is adopted by a family whose young son's life is in danger and has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for him. The mother (Frances O'Connor) is initially skeptical and reluctant, but eventually she will look at him as her son. And obviously, David becomes very affectionate of her and seems to show the love only a son can have for his mother. Trouble arises when her real son comes back to the family. He manipulates David and makes him do things to make him look bad to mommy. She will then leave him behind in the forest to fend for himself. After this, the movie turns, practically, into another. David is captured by the owner (Brendan Gleeson) of an event called the Flesh Fairs, where robots are destroyed as entertainment. The images are now thrown fast and furiously at the audience. It is here that David will meet the 'love mecha' Gigolo Joe (a strange role for Jude Law) and begin his journey to find his 'mother'. The audience will get to sink their eyes into wonderful sights like Rouge City, a sleazy, light-filled future town which is like Las Vegas ten times worse, and a Manhattan half-drowned in water.There is a sense of exhilarating discovery in almost every frame of this film. The impact of some of A.I.'s images will remain with me for quite a while; this is the most stunning visualization of the future, I have EVER seen, and thank God the trailers didn't ruin it. This is one of those films that is undeniably great to look at, and it's worth seeing just for that. Not that the film's first, calmer act isn't effective; it's here that Osment really gets to shine in this role, especially in the scene where he's left behind in the woods. He doesn't give his character a typical robotic attitude, but doesn't give in to a kind of little-boy cuteness either; the story's main theme is the mystery of whether robots deserve to be loved and have emotions, and Osment really gives an impression that there's a beating heart of a boy beneath the machine. Law, however, doesn't come off as more than annoying in his character, which is a big mystery in itself. He seems to represent the Jiminy Cricket of the story, which contains several references to the Pinocchio tale (David goes to Rouge City to find the Blue Fairy hoping she will turn him into a real boy), but he seemed like an ineffectual and superfluous character to me.Not that he is so superfluous as to be annoying or a hindrance to the film; I was enchanted and enthralled through every single scene of it, particularly in the much-discussed epilogue to the story, which I won't reveal, and seems to be a typical Spielberg touch. There will be plenty of people hating that ending, simply because it contains sentimentality, but on further thought that ending is the one plausible or logical one, and it isn't as sugar-coated as it seems first-handedly. There's more than meets the eye there. What really keeps A.I. from being the masterpiece that some may be expecting, is that it's more pretentious and less important than it seems to think it is: it doesn't really give us new insights into the way machines work. Ultimately, it's a pretty straightforward story about a robot and his impossible love for a human, but Spielberg drenches the film with murkiness and pretty pointless mystery once David arrives at Manhattan for the film's ending.Some of A.I.'s missteps in its denouement, which also goes on too long, still can't diminish the power that this film has to hypnotise and transport the audience into another world. I haven't been so intrigued and engrossed by a film in quite a while, and for that I'm sure it will turn up as one of the year's better films. You might think I'm going to say that all things considered this film is a disappointment, but it isn't because I actually expected to be disappointed by such a highly-anticipated film, and A.I. always surprised me and never bored me. It is an intelligent film, with moments of pure brilliance and moments of slight miscalculation, and asks a series of intriguing questions. It falls short of being a masterpiece for being uncertain what to do with those ideas. But perhaps it is useless to ask for answers when the questions are so purely philosophical; we should just philosophize for ourselves to find our own. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*May Contain Spoilers* *May Contain Spoilers*There are no 2 directors who are so different from one another than the late Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Kubrick made films that were essentially essays. He worked more with his head than with his heart and his films, therefore, were somewhat of cold. Spielberg works from his heart. He wants to move us. His films are full with sentiments and when you go to a movie made by of one of them you have some expectations. A.I. is the collaboration (or sort of collaboration) of these very different directors and the first thing I asked myself before I went to see this film was: What should I expect? Will I get a cold,theoretical film as I would from Kubrick or a one full of sentiments like I always get from Spielberg?What we got here is a combination of both. For the film itself is a sort of an essay about the human existence. It raise the question what differ us human from the machines, what make us complex and unique(very Kubrick). It also deal with the questions of knowledge and the fact that we humans want always to meet our creator. However there are enough sentiment to make it a Spielberg's film.The story revolve around David (an excellent Haley Joel Osment), a robot-boy who can have feelings and his quest for humanity because he believes that if he become a real person, he has the chance to get his mother back.We meet David in 4 stages:- 1)His first encounter with his mother and him building a bond with her. It should be notice that this part has been filmed in warm colors. Mostly yellow and brown in order to convey a warm, loving and safe feeling.2)David been expelled from his family and meet the outside world. This part is been portrayed in contrast to the first one. It has been filmed in shades of blue or black.3)David's journey to Man-haten in order to find there the Blue Fairy, where he meets his creator.This part is filmed in grey.4) David's encounter with the aliens. This part combine some of the colors from previous parts but not all of them.David is a symbolic figure. He is naive,un-aware of things much like we would like to be, however his naivete is in contrast to the real peoples who are sometime cruel and brutal(and the scene in Flesh Fair manage to convey both the cruelty of people and their intolerance toward things which are different from them or that they fear because they can not understand them).Through the first 3 stages, where we see David. Spielberg has managed to be Kubrick. He managed to make a cold and theoretical film, much like Kubrick and although he inserted now and than emotions, he let the story lead him and he made me forget that I watch a film directed by Spielberg. Come the 4th part and Spielberg been Spielberg could not be so cold hearted and he inserted so much sentiment that the balance that was well held earlier in the film, has almost vanished. Strange enough the last part deal with how fragile the human existence and the human memory are, and that their chance of survival lie in machines like David. But that message vanish in an over-sentimentally that do not correspond well with the rest of the film.I found the film good and that is surprising if you consider how much bad reviews it had. Its 143 minutes passed so fast that I didn't notice the time and suddenly the movie finished. For me that a sign for a good movie. I can only advise to anyone who see the movie to ignore what they read(including this review) and judge the movie for itself. The only thing they should be prepare is that this is not a typical Spielberg film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreakingly beautiful (spoilers!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie today and was genuinely moved. I'll tell you why.We have a sentient being, a young boy by the name of David, artificially created, whose sole purpose in existence is to love whoever recites several key words to him. He is entrusted to a neurotic suburbanite couple. His fate is sealed when the wife, practically on a whim, activates the love programming, thus irrevocably attaching him to herself. All the while she's not sure whether she really wants this or not. It all goes from bad to worse when the couple's son wakes from a five-year cryogenic slumber in which he was placed to cure some unspecified disease. He subjects his new robotic sibling to a series of cruel or nearly fatal pranks. After a serious accident at their organic son's birthday pool party, mom and dad decide this is not working out. Because of the irrevocable programming, all models sent back to the manufacturer have to be destroyed, so the following day, Monica (that's Mommy Dearest) takes the young robot to the woods and leaves him to fend for himself.At this point the movie explodes into a wide-eyed, Pinnochio-inspired adventure of self-fulfilment. A boy, his high-tech teddy and an artificial gigolo. Sounds almost stupid, but it works famously.At the beginning of the movie, professor Hobby, played by the always remarkable William Hurt, states that the purpose of creation of Adam was for him to love God. The difference is, even biblically speaking, the human race has choices in their love. We can turn away, forget, get over the pain of loss, move on. And in Genesis, Adam had a clear knowledge of God, an almighty giver of everything good and plentiful. In A.I., David isn't given the luxury. Forces beyond his control mercilessly attach him to a despicable woman, blinded by her own loss, completely self-involved, utterly incapable of loving him back. She's accompanied by her emotionally castrated husband and their sadistic, atrophied cracker-spawn. Equating this situation with a movie like Bicentennial Man is, well, stupid. The android in Bicentennial Man is surrounded by a fairly nurturing environment. Through prosthetics, assembled for him by Oliver Platt's character, and his own excellent mind, he is completely in control of his self-determination. David in A.I. is determined the second he hears the key-phrase. His entire existence is governed by the fact that he loves this one person. His belief in the Blue Fairy, the moment praised by professor Hobby as unique in terms of artificial sentience, is merely a function of his attachment to Monica. His magical thinking is subservient to the primary directive of love he feels for his mother. He has no choice but to seek out the Blue Fairy to 'make him real' so his Mommy will love him and take him back. In this he is gut-wrenchingly alone. While Robin Williams' character in Bicentennial Man has all the help in the world, David is left with a talking teddy-bear and an oversexed Ken doll. The image of David and Teddy ensconced in ice for 2000 years hammers in this sense of loneliness quite efficiently. Apparently some people didn't like the final part of the movie with aliens and what not. If David indeed developed the ability to dream, it could all have been just his final fantasy at the bottom of the ocean.In short, what fascinated me about A.I. is the powerful depiction of David's basic existential dilemma. In this light, all the grandeur and even the considerable length of this motion picture are justified.Attacking this movie with tirades about Spielberg or Kubrick just seems like so much movie-buff/hipster intellectual laziness, if you ask me. Regardless of the productional trivia, if after seeing a film like this, all you can rant about is the discrepancy between the media-hype and the final product, it's a sure sign that people are just too preoccupied with themselves to really open their eyes and ears to anything else.I'd give it 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***** SPOILERS WITHIN ********Let me start my review with a question: are those "beings" at the very end of the movie supposed to be aliens or advanced AIs? From things I've read and people I've talked to, the second answer appears to be the consensus - but I'll be damned if I thought the point was driven home in any meaningful way. I bring this issue up first because I find the confusion symptomatic of the entire movie: "driving home a point in any meaningful way" is not something this film is particularly good at.To start with the positives, though: the visuals, I thought, were quite trippy and memorable - and Spielberg did a fine job of balancing his own style with Kubrickian trademarks, and thereby achieving a kind of third type of thing in the end. At least, he did in the first section (David and the parents at home) and the incredible last section (New York submerged under the melted ice caps). But I thought the middle section - the punk apocalypse of the Flesh Fair and Rouge City - was actually pretty tawdry and underwhelming. It tried to beat "Blade Runner" and "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome" at their own game and it just looked shoddy and derivative.That whole middle section of the movie, anyway, was pretty much a waste. . .. . . . And I say that because, for me at least, whatever interest to be found in the film is either in that first section (i.e. the psychology of a human family learning to live with, and eventually love, an AI) or in the very last - with the notion of a world which has been completely taken over by automatons (or, as they're called in the film, "mechas"). Focusing the story on either one of those two tangents would have been worthwhile. What the film *did* choose to focus on - David's search for the Blue Fairy and his desire to become "a real, live boy" - was remarkably simple-minded and reductionist. Ultimately, I just didn't CARE about David, because his quest was stupid and ill-fated from the very beginning. Nor did I think it was smart to set up a "mecha" as our tragic hero: since I am after all a human being, I am much more interested in the reaction of human beings in an increasingly mechanized and roboticized society. Leave it to cold as ice Stanley, though, to prefer following a robot around than a human being. But then leave it to the sentimental Spielberg to try to humanize that robot, leaving him as an annoying hybrid. What I mean to say is that, if Kubrick had lived to direct the film, while it may not necessarily have been any better, I think he would have had the good sense to keep David eerily "robotic" at all times - whereas Spielberg couldn't resist the temptation to make Haley Joel Osment emote and carry on like a real live boy. And thereby muddling the theme ("ya see, Steven, he *wants* to be a real boy, he's not supposed to already *be* one").In those moments - mainly early on - when little Haley is permitted to fully be an android, he is dead on and extremely chilling. What he was called upon to do was quite subtle and complex - to totally subsume his humanity, and yet to inhabit a being which longs for and apes that very humanity. This kid is not just a great "child actor" - he's a great actor, period. (As for Jude Law, the other major actor here - he was great and hugely entertaining in his role as a "gigolo" AI, but his character seemed more of a contrivance and an afterthought than anything else.)As to that ending, with the mechas/aliens: I must admit, I didn't even so much as *entertain* the notion that they were AIs until I read a comment someone made about the movie online. The fact is, if they're supposed to be "mechas", that really raises a lot more questions than it answers. Such as, well what happened to all the humans, then? Also, when did AIs become sophisticated enough to be able to run an entire society without input or instructions from their makers? Surely, none of the AIs we see during the course of the movie is anywhere near that self-reliant (both David and Gigolo Joe are dependent upon, and serve at the whims of, others). Finally, why would these advanced robots be so interested in finding out about mankind? Presumably, they're far more perfect and efficient than we could ever be, and anyway they're only running at all because they already have human programming built into them somehow. My point here is this: if the movie is indeed positing an eventual all-mecha society, then it is being lazy and disingenuous in the extreme to only mention it as an afterthought, a footnote to its otherwise "Pinnochio"-lite movie (by the way, didn't all that direct quoting of "Pinnochio" get on your nerves - it's like Stanley and Steve were worried that we wouldn't get the reference or something). If an all-AI world is in the cards - then, dammit, that's a WHOLE *OTHER* MOVIE!! (and one I'd prefer to see)Obviously, any way you slice it, that ending opens things up for much more speculation than the filmmakers allowed themselves to engage in. Certainly, you can make the valid point that one can't criticize a movie simply because it wasn't the one YOU would have made. But, really, I'm puzzled as to what Stan and Steve thought the point was of their movie as they conceived it. What - that robots are people, too? Umm. . . they're not, guys. Whether they're something *more* or something *less* is a question worth examining, and a good subject for a rigorous and inquisitive film. "A.I." isn't it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can Haley Joel Osment give 'bad' performance ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The answer apparently is 'no', because Osment applies that innocent type of desperation to this role perfectly. There is a scene in this movie (I won't give away anything here) that takes place in a forest with his 'mother' that, I admit, made me cry. His performance here ranks up there with his "The Sixth Sense", and "Pay It Forward" performances. He is definitely something special.With that said, I have to say that this movie disapointed me as a whole. This is the best way to illustrate why : when you have a movie that has names like Stanley Kubrick, Stephen Spielberg, and Haley Joel Osment involved, and the one that seems to be holding up his end of the deal the best is the child actor something is wrong.Of course, it's hard to knock Kubrick, since he had passed on before this movie. So that leaves Spielberg. What is wrong with this movie ? The performances are great (Jude Law puts in a solid performance). The plot is interesting. I think the answer is in the direction that it starts to take towards the end (again not giving anything away here). It seems as though Spielberg is kind of caught in an uncomfortable position here. He seems to be trying to make a Spielberg-Kubrick movie - one that has that warm-central theme (E.T.) and one that has that has all the Kubrick-ish elements of surrealism (2001). I'm not claiming to be the first person to make such an observation, but it's true. It makes for an awkward ending - one that should be about twenty minutes shorter, or at least different.Final word : I have heard many people put this movie down for many reasons. However, I think in the future, people will become a little more softer towards it and come to like the good aspects of it. Again, in this case that would be Haley Joel Osment. I gave it a 7 based on his performance, and the intriguing plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading through all the reviews here demonstrates how people either love this film or hate it... Rather like several of Kubrick's films, eh?Kubrick's influence pervades every corner of this film. Think how 2001 or Full Metal Jacket have specific "sections" within themselves. "A.I." is presented similarly, with 3 main sections in it. This is a very complex film with a refreshingly intelligent storyline. It will be too challenging for your average "dumb'n'dumber" viewer to understand. Period.The quality of acting is truly superb across the board. Special credit is due to Osment, who demonstrates remarkable acting finesse in a difficult role. There are a few flaws, but, to quote the old master himself, it is probably best to let this film speak for itself.I strongly recommend you to watch this film.Just m'tup'nyworth...</fullReview>

But after that Hollywood came in and forced a very long and happy ending. I'm surprised they didn't let the mother live at the end.So it was a good start and a bad ending.

		<fullReview>Ugh, what a waste of time. This film "ended" 4 times, there were literally 4 times that the audience got up to leave, only to be called back by a cheesy lines like "2000 years later..." What the hell? There were so many bad scenes in the movie, I don't know where to begin.Not to mention all the terrible characters and devices. To name a few; Blue Fairy, Dr. Know, the Future Robot Archaeologists, the Chris Rock robot, the Annoying nanny Robot, The Dad (what a spineless wimp), The flakey Mother, the Stupid son and all his stupid friends.I think the problem with this film was that they had a MAJOR ego (Speilberg) trying to work a film that was originally supposed to be done by another serious ego (Kubrick). A film that was never really had a central idea other than a robot Pinnochio. It was a story that didnt need to be told, but evidently, the felt it should be because "Stanley would have wanted it that way" Never mind that Kubrick was no King Midas, and quite able to produce bad cinema. "Eyes wide Shut" was terrible.Couple all that with the fact that no one who wants to keep their job would say no to a Speilburg script. So where is the quality control? Im sure for "Close Encounters" must have had at least one guy saying "You know Steve, this script needs something here.." Or "Take out this part, it doesn't make sense." No such luck for A.I.Too many "Yes-men" in Hollywood, and the proof is a very long boring film that leaves you thinking, "Gee, there is 3 hours and several dollars I will never have back."Not only that, but why does the Future have so much Neon? And why does the world's most advanced Robot maker choose a flooded Ruin as its base of operations?Doh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>flawed masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. is the movie where Steven Spielberg attempts to channel Stanley Kubrick and succeeds to a stunning degree. Neither filmmaker could have made this spooky, moving film alone. If, for instance, Robert Zemeckis had made this movie, it would have been a big bowl of corn syrup, but Spielberg didn't wimp out - not for the most part, anyway.The two main flaws: 1) The sequence where the machines get tortured could have been more imaginatively conceived. It felt a little too much like something we've all seen before. 2) The last act. Spielberg brings the story of his boy's quest to a beautiful fairytale peak; if the film had ended at the bottom of the ocean with that endless prayer, it would have been a masterpiece. But then there is a jump to the future that's so jarring it took me out of the movie. This is followed by a coda wherein he hands the hero his wish in a way that feels contrived.Still, it is heartening to see that someone so late and secure in his career is still taking chances. I have a lot of affection for this movie, because of everything it gets right. There are many moments of brilliance, none of which I want to ruin here. Haley Joel Osment proves his performance in The Sixth Sense was no fluke with his accomplished work here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Artificial?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haley Joel Osment plays a child-like robot whose sole goal in life is to get his 'mother' to love him. After being abandoned by his 'owners' when their real son wakes from a coma, Osment falls into more robotic company in the form of Jude Law, a 'Lover Robot'. The two follow an arduous journey, avoiding the humans who both fear and despise their kind. The finale of his conquest being his meeting with the Blue Fairy from whom he believes he can gain mortality and become a 'real' boy. There are several references to 'Pinocchio' which is understandable if a little simplistic.'Don't believe the hype' would be a suitable adage here, I feel. Not living up to its press is something that is all too apparent. Originally a Stanley Kubrick idea, this movie was still in embryonic form at the time of his death. Steven Spielberg decided to let this idea blossom. Come away from this feeling vaguely empty and you could be forgiven. Osment, as usual, provides an excellent performance for his age and this shows that 'The Sixth Sense' was not an act of luck. A better supporting cast in the aforementioned work may explain this sense of disappointment. Entertaining enough in the short term but has little lasting value to mark it out for particular merit. On the whole, little more than average, which is unfortunate, as I was expecting a good deal more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>belgium has been one of the latest countries where this film has been released. So I could read quite a lot about this film before I went to see it. This certainly helped me watching this film, i knew less or more what to expect. I'm not a big fan of spielberg, and i'm not a big fan of kubrick. But thinking they were kind of directing this story together, maked me believe it could be a very, very good film. Well, it isn't a very very good film. It is a very very strange film. When I was watching the film I never got completly lost in the story. But it has been 5 days I have seen the movie, and I'm still thinking about it. Heck, I'm even writing some comments about the film.Because he is a robot, it is not easy to sympathise with david, but at the other hand, it is not easy not to sympathise whit the "cute little boy". I don't know what the most difficult scene is in the movie, the scene where his mother leaves her mecha-child in the woods, or the scene where that mecha-child sits at the table and is watching how his parents eat. You are scared of the person you want to identify with. This is what makes this film so strange and difficult to love. But this is also what makes this film so much better than all the other movies playing in the same theatre.The discussions about what is kubrick and what is Spielberg, they are useless. When I watched the film I never wonderd which of the scenes were created by spielberg or which by Kubrick. The second ending where so much is written about is not as melodramatic as everybody seems to agree. It is this latest twist that makes you want forget the film so easy.Did I liked the film? I like him more and more. I like this film more than i like ET and i like this film more than i like 2001. So, this film may have a lot of things I dont like, the movie it self is quite OK. It may not be a very very good film, but as it is a very very strange film, you have to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first impression this is definitely a masterwork of the director. In overall - presentation, light, scenery and camera are genuinely well versed. Whether this is Kubriks' influence or experimentation, the film reminds me of Solaris by Tarkovsky. The hazy atmosphere in some scenes, especially. It looks like you have to love children to understand it. or think about family sometimes. There are some poor moments but very few. For instance, the fact that robot cannot eat but withstands water without a problem.Or the scene with releasing David from the mecho-lynch mob is not sufficiently worked out. It's hard to believe in changing mind of the crowd, so unrealistically rapid it happens. The dialogs with the love robot are felt a bit clumsy. Also the come back of the sick son after years in coma could have been staged and played better. But in general acting is outstanding. The boy can apply for another nomination. Well, after Billy Eliot this is the second best movie I've seen this year so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a Spielberg fan. But I like Spielberg pictures, and A.I. is not a Spielberg film bur a Stanley Kubrick film, which is something altogether different. Spielberg inherited the project from Kubrick and that explains the failure, because he tried to make a mixture of E.T. and 2001.The first part of the film is charming, in the same way that E.T. was charming, and the second part tried not to be cryptic, as Kubrick would have made it, and it ended in confusion. The character of the "mecha" child is charming, and so is the boy actor who plays it, But what the devil was that Teddy bear?. Perhaps Spielberg needed it, but the film did not. The gaudy "Flesh Fair" of the second part is too long, too noisy and not very credible. The mecha gigolo that escorts the boy through that part is definitely repugnant, the introduction of fairy tale elements is an act of desperation on the part of a filmaker who doesn't know what to do next with his characters. And the boy... Will he be destroyed? Is he condemned to live forever in a state of loneliness? Steven Spielberg found a magnificent climax for his first creature in need of love: E.T. But poor David is doomed. He is immortal, learned to love, but won't be loved. The end of the movie is literally a dead end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been very good, thank you Mr. Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure I can ever again watch a Steven Spielberg movie after this. What is up with his need to have these sappy, weepy, hyper-melodramatic moments in his movies. It's getting worse and worse in recent years. I noticed it in Schindler's List, then it got worse in Saving Private Ryan, where the shameless tear-jerking scenes of the old man nearly ruined an otherwise fine movie. But A.I. takes the cake.First let it be said that the kid is the real deal. A fine performance, much more impressive than in the overrated Sixth Sense. Jude Law is very good as well. There are moments of great beauty, great special effects, moments of genuine poignancy...then there's the ending. I literally stared at the screen in disbelief with my mouth hanging open during the movie's closing moments. Disbelief that Steven Spielberg could do this to what could have been a fine if flawed movie. Stanley Kubrick must be rolling over in his grave. Heaven forbid we have a movie that doesn't end on a sappy weepy feel-good-through-your-tears note. With the clout that he has, and the obvious talent (that's apparent sometimes at least), you'd think maybe Steven could go for the thoughtful ending for once. But no, reach for your hankies, you must, you have been programmed to do so by the master manipulator of melodrama. I left the theater feeling thoroughly disgusted with Spielberg and angry as well. If it was just a bad movie, I could have accepted it much easier. But it shows such potential...only to have it all flushed away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. ranks as one of the most infuriating films ever made. On the one hand, the first half of the film is stylish, sinister, thought-provoking - Kubrickian cinema at its awe-inspiring best. Spielberg managed to avoid his usual trick of laying sentimentality on with a trowel, and I was genuinely believing I was witnessing a masterpiece. However, when the motorbikes and taccy Running Man-esque lights appeared, it became apparent that this was not going to be the case. And then it just got worse, and worse, and worse. What on earth possessed the man to morph an eerie psychological drama into an ultimately boring and far-fetched yarn? The film is painfully long. The storyline meanders from mildly unbelievable to utterly incoherent. In the main, the acting was not as convincing as expected, Jude Law began to grate me, and also David's 'father', Sam Robards, flattered to deceive. I began to question my sanity when the film moved into a post-apocalyptic New York. How I wish Spielberg had questioned his.There are a few positives to be taken from A.I. Haley John Osment's performance brings guile, empathy and intelligence beyond his thirteen years, to a film which (apart from Teddy) is devoid of characters with any depth. His portrayal his character, David, ranks as one of the finest and most haunting performances I have seen. It is such a shame that the ridiculous storyline had me rooting for the conclusion of the film, not for the main character. Aesthetically, A.I is impressive, but with such a large budget, that is only to be expected. David's companion on his ludicrous quest, Teddy, also brought out the child in me and I found myself genuinely concerned for his wellbeing. As unbelievable as his recovery was, the introduction of David's 'brother' was a welcome addition to the film. The relationship between the two is something that was not handled badly, but could have definitely been handled better.Thus, A.I. left me wanting more. Why couldn't the film have reached a logical conclusion? Why was such a nonsensical and bastardised version of such a stimulating subject matter allowed to have been made? Has Spielberg finally lost the plot? If I were Kubrick, I would be turning in my grave, cursing the time I ever told my 'chum' Steve about a continuation of the HAL concept. I resent the fact that A.I. was made, as this is surely not the conclusion that Kubrick would have reached. If you have not seen A.I., then please go and see it, just to see how good it could have been. But brace yourself for an overtly long, frustrating film of epic proportions that tries to say too much, but ends saying little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>flawed masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is one of the most thought-provoking, visually stunning films to come along in a really long time, perhaps even since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (one of my favorite films -- this one often reminded me of it). This is very high praise, I know, but the film is a remarkable achievement in imaginative filmmaking. I haven't seen this many incredible visuals since STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE, but the amazing thing is that the film is also consistently involving, absorbing, powerful, and fascinating. Spielberg's film, in its own unusual and unique manner, definitely lives up to the expectations -- and it exceeded mine.What made me skeptical in those expectations was that the man who made E.T. was going to take over a project from the man who made A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. I was afraid that Spielberg would turn Kubrick's icy intellect and brilliant cinematic technique into something shallow and tear-jerking. The surprise is that Spielberg puts his own personality only into the final 20 minutes which represent the film's third act. The rest really looks and feels like something Kubrick could have made with a 90 million dollar budget. The film has some truly incredible special effects. Sequences showing cities of the future, all kinds of robots, cities we know like Manhattan half-submerged in water will have your jaw dropped in amazement and wondering how they got it all on screen. It has the most astonishing effects ever seen even in a Spielberg film, and that's not saying little. But not only did he direct this film, he also was responsible for the carefully written screenplay. It's his first writing credit since 1982's POLTERGEIST, and he has written only one of his movies, which is 1977's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.In the film's first act we see the life of a robotic, or 'mecha', child called David, played very well by Haley Joel Osment. He is adopted by a mother (Frances O'Connor) and father (Sam Robards) whose child's survival is very uncertain, and he's cryogenically frozen. Initially David seems to be having a good time with these people. He has some weird attitudes, to be sure, but most of the time he seems to be acting like a real kid. Osment's performance is intelligent in the way that he doesn't give his character a typically robotic voice or attitude, but acts and reacts sort of mechanically to his surroundings. It's a unique and intelligent performance that blends the attitude of a real boy and a cold machine. I'm not sure if the Academy will see the goodness of this performance. Perhaps the scene where he shines brightest is the one where his mother, played by Frances O'Connor, leaves him in a forest to fend for his own; once he realises it, his immediate reaction is played to perfection by Osment. He bursts out in tears, and yet the little genius still manages to give hints that his character's emotions are not real, not human anyway.After this heart-wrenching scene the movie radically changes tone. The film's first 40 minutes or so are rather slow, shot with a blanket of haze by Oscar-winner Janusz Kaminski (who has photographed every Spielberg film since SCHINDLER'S LIST), played subtly and delicately, but after that the look and pace of the film become crisper as it assaults our senses with some big, confusing, fast action sequences as David is captured by a weird character, played briefly by Brendan Gleeson, who travels above the land in a balloon in the form of a huge moon in search of lost mechas so he can take them to his 'Flesh Fair', an ugly festival where all sorts of robots are tortured and killed as entertainment. David manages to win the audience's sympathy and escape certain death (or is it just destruction?). He makes a valuable friend at the Fairs, a 'love mecha' named Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law, with whom he will leave the Fairs and set out for Rouge City, a sleazy, glitzy, light-filled place with every kind of woman you could wish for, as Joe puts it. David wishes to find the Blue Fairy, since he's been listening carefully to the Pinocchio tale his mother told him and thinks that if he'll find the blue fairy she'll turn him into a real boy. Once they're in Rouge City they go and see a sort of digital Albert Einstein, a computer that answers every of your questions with an animated character called dr. Know, voiced by Robin Williams. This sequence is technically mervelous, but largely wears out its welcome. He's amusing to watch for a while but gets tiresome after a while, although he is important to the plot's development because he leads the two to Manhattan, which as I've said is shown almost completely submerged by water, and deserted, in this film. The effects in this sequence are incredible and scary in a way as well; to give you an idea, we only barely see the head of the Statue of Liberty and it all looks completely credible. I will not spoil the movie more for you by revealing what happens once David and Joe arrive there. Suffice it to say, the movie gets consistently weirder and more intriguing as it goes along after that point. In that way in reminded of 2001, as it takes the main character's journey to a climax in a place he doesn't know, but is shaped into something familiar to him (like Dave Bowman in the weird hotel room) by unknowns to make him comfortable.Many critics around me were disappointed by that ending, and although I must admit that I found the final 5 minutes a bit forced and sentimental, I was still enchanted, all the time wondering what would happen next. For those reading who have seen the film, you must agree with me it's the only way this film could've ended. It also raises arguments for discussion; for example, how can we be sure that a robot can't have real feelings? When a mechanical 'being' has such a burning desire for anything, in this case to find his 'mother', can we just coldly say that it can't be genuine emotion? What makes us more real than robots? We are also made out of organs, atoms, molecules, biological cells. We also react more or less logically to our surroundings, don't we? So do robots.In this unusually long review for me, I still have just scratched the surface of this film's richness, depth, and power. Its flaws and partly unsatisfactory conclusion keep me from giving it my highest rating. It is definitely a 'flawed masterpiece' if there ever was one. After I came out of the theater I was thinking so many different things, not being sure if I had seen a great film, thinking about the parts I loved, about the flaws, about those last 20 minutes... imperfect as I felt it was, I couldn't put it out of my head. That's definitely a higher compliment than you can give to most other movies. I think I could go on for a lot longer, but I will stop right now and tell you that if you like Kubrick movies, if you like to think about movies, this film won't disappoint you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Spielberg has done it again. Not only has he created one the best films of the year, but also of the decade and of his career. With help from the late Stanley Kubrick (who worked on the project years before he died)Spielberg has made a masterpiece. The story of the central character who feels out of place in the world is not unfamiliar to the director, but here he adds a sting to the tale. It's a robot boy, David,who has been made for one reason and that is to love those who look after him. This being his 'parents' who adopt him after their own son is being kept frozen after an accident. The film beautifully portrays the adventures of this strange boy using trademark Spielberg lighting, the heartwrenching music by John Williams and the performances of the lead actors. It's a bold movie with so much to take from it. And as Davids journey progresses, so do our hearts and in the end, they might aswell explode. Fantastic in every sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. is a movie many people will never understand. This movie is not sci fi, it's a fairy tale, told in a modern time. Many viewers will think this movie is totally overly sentimental and mawkishly. But thats because many persons will never understand the symbols and metaphors used in the story - links to religion and emotions, very heartily and warmly mixed. Many people will get bored, because they will only watch the movie to see the computer graphics or a good sci fi movie but thats wrong. You can watch the movie over and over again and explore another detail and yet another one.Only a few movies have such a high density of detail, as "Run Lola Run", "Pleasantville" and "Trumanshow".Outstanding 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie made by two directors: one living, one dead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty impressive movie, pretty disturbing sometimes, but also pretty sentimental. As I expected, the disturbing things reminded me of Kubrick, the sentimental elements are Spielberg's trademark. But this in favour of Spielberg: all the emotional moments are well founded in the script and never have that manipulative touch that make some Spielberg films so utterly indigestable. Of course it would have been a better movie of Kubrick himself had made it, but Spielberg did a great job and he managed to give you the uncanny feeling at moments that you're watching a movie made by two directors: one living, one dead. The story is divided into three parts: the intimate scenes with David and his "parents", the bombastic central part with Jude Law as the pimp-bot, and the mystical final part with the visitors from outer space. The first and last parts are the best. David's relationship to his "mother" is portrayed in a touching way. The scenes in which David is programmed to love his "mother" and the one in which he's abandoned show Spielberg at the top of his craft, enhanced by powerful acting. Then, unfortunately, the movie bogs down in an orgy of expensive sets and effects. The screenplay suddenly becomes garbled, with a dumb escape sequence, worthy of a B-movie. Then David meets his creator (a scene with reminds me of the one in "The Truman Show", with Ed Harris). This bombastic middle part isn't completely without purpose, because its noise paves the way for the wonderful and silent third part, David's mystical encounter with the aliens. In this part, Spielberg's "Close Encounters" and Kubrick's "2001" meet. The resemblance to "2001" in particulary striking. It's as if we witness Dave Bowman's (yep, another David - coincidence???) rebirthing again. But the "Mecha" David doesn't become a Star-Child, Spielberg's approach is too much down-to-earth for that kind of mysticism. If Kubrick had directed this sequence, he wouldn't explain as much as Spielberg, he would leave the magic untouched. But as I said before, Spielberg didn't fail. It's one of his best movies, almost as good as "ET" and "Schindler's List".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mix a fairy tale and a cynical story, and you find a total disaster... not before Steven Spielberg decided to do Stanley Kubrick's unfinished work.As the story unveil, we are introduced to the absolute modernism against traditional living. A professor trying to justify the reason to play with humanism. A solid concept, continued with creating David, an artificial intelligent (just plain robot with a human heart, not a brand new concept), learning so hard to be human. After sometimes, comes a human bad seeds, envy, i prefer not to uncover the basic story here, but the result: David, the robot child is forced to flee by his mother. Leaving him with an obsession: an obsession to be human, an obsession to be a loving child. His path crossed with Gigolo Joe, an android also, which was being setup and hunted for murder he didn't commit. Both later gone through a journey of hate, of knowledge, and in the end the final path of David's obsession.This modern pinocchio story should ends the moment David meet his creator or when he meets his fairy god-mother, even better Spielberg should end this story by his 'E.T.'-style home warming or family conflicts. but instead, he decided to extend the story into the somehow fulfilling of David's obsession. In the end, we see the storyline fools ourselves, just as the creator of the Mecca (Mechanics, Robots, Androids) fools with the humanity... such a waste of story.The story itself falls very far from similar concepts such as blade runner or even short circuit, the conclusion falls ever worse, with a guest star from 'mission to mars', the finale of this story is definitely worth skipped. in the frame of creator-creations, we have seen many empathy being focused towards the creations, and how the creators just create and won't cherish those they have created. bladerunner, short circuit, space oddisey, up to frankenstein... compared to them, a.i. have nothing fresh to offer and furthermore have a tendency to surpress more with the cynical facts that those who can see how humanity heart is so beautiful come from those not human; the android and the characters in the last part of the movie.Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law might have a memorable experience directed by Spielberg, but this definitely not their best picture, at least not compared to the sixth sense and enemy at the gates. But for Teddy, this definitely his best movie. He indeed steals the show. (the cute teddy bear with ewok style, c3po clumsiness and hannibal lechter's voice-so does mad wrote....) Not a recommended movie for fun, but an excellent movie to be criticized and discussed among moviegoers...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seemed to promise much. When I entered the cinema I wasn't expecting much because many recent movies disappointed me whenever I expected anything.So let's get down to it- - This movie is a fairytale. Don't expect anything such as a consistent story or reasons for events that happen.The first part (David with the family) is great. I really wanted to see how the relation between the real boy and David will develop and how will the aging parents handle the forever-young perfect child, but, heck, NO! the storywriting took the wrong turn :((- And we suddenly realize we are in the middle of Pinnochio, with the tramp Cat, whatever his name was, and Mr. Stromboli and all the bad donkey children and whatever. Just awful, but I still hoped for better.There is even a Deus-ex-Machina in the final 20 minutes or so, for the director/writer obviously wandered too far in the wrong direction and there was no way he could put the story together again. So out of nowhere he pulled some guys who finally resolve the mess... ... and leave you wondering "Was this really what we were heading to at the beginning?"Conclusion:-If you are a sensitive, feeling person, go see the movie. Turn off your cell phone and logic reasoning when entering the theatre, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The True Final Film in the Kubrick Canon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film about which everyone disagrees. Those who like it like it for different reasons. Those who hate it also do it for different reasons. Those who find it mediocre... well you get the point.Tellingly, this is a movie that provokes argument. No one can walk away from the theatre without strong opinions and if you see it with someone else, you're bound to debate certain features for at least as long as the film's running time had been. Any movie that does that has done its job admirably, regardless of its weaknesses. And that, my friends, is the true Kubrick tradition.Sure, this film was ultimately directed by Spielberg and it bears his signature (especially in the very beginning with its slightly strained political consciousness). But Kubrick's signature is also to be found throughout, right to the very end.Speaking of the end, everyone who insists that Kubrick would have left the film with a downbeat ending is almost undoubtedly wrong. Kubrick's sense of bleakness is invariably a reference to the past and the present but never the future. Of his thirteen other movies, twelve of them (count 'em!) end on a hopeful note. Sure, Spartacus dies but his son will be free. Alex finally learns to think for himself. HAL is turned off. Ironically, the one downbeat ending in the whole canon is in the comedy, DR. STRANGELOVE!No question about it. If you do your homework, you will find that Kubrick was every bit as much of a humanist as Spielberg and would surely have kept the hopeful ending had he lived to shoot this film, himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the theater with a serious hangover and the less than impressive reviews in mind. Still my trust in Steven Spielberg (I chose to write off The Lost World as a slip) prompted me to expect solid entertainment if nothing more. In fact my attitude was so positive that it took more than half of this overlong film for me to realize that I'd been had. It was about that time that my companions wanted to leave the building, but I was foolish enough to want to see how it all turned out. Let me make one thing clear: A.I. does not explain the things you don't understand - it just throws in some more inexplicable elements. It goes on like this throughout, culminating with one of the silliest and unsatisfying endings in movie history. I am not exaggerating when I say that this one is in serious competition with The Lost World and Battlefield Earth for the prize of worst big time Hollywood production in recent history. What can you say about a movie whose most convincing character is a talking teddy bear? The only thing that keeps me from giving A.I. a 1 is the stunning fx - they really are incredible. Who would have thought that Steven Spielberg could be responsible for two of the three dumbest movies ever. I still regard him as one of the greats, and I look forward to Minority Report with Tom Cruise; my only hope is that it won't turn out to be as foolish as sitting through all of A.I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. (Artistical Incompetence)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. (Artificial Intelligence): a promising title seems a justified statement; But as becomes apparent from the above remark, the film does not meet most expectations.It should have been a movie by two of the most remarkable directors from the world of cinema. Kubrick wrote the screenplay, but he found to be lacking experience in some respects (special effects). That was the reason for him contacting Steven Spielberg, who with movies like ET and Jurassic Park clearly had shown what he was capable of. Unfortunately Kubrick died while the movie was a mere concept. Spielberg seemed to be the obvious person to finish the job, with the book Super Toys Last All Summer Long, by Brian Aldiss, and Kubricks notes for the screenplay (based on this book) at hand.* those who want to see the movie unopiniated are discouraged to read any further *The movie starts with an introduction of A.I.: mechas (robots) are the solution mankind found in the near future to the problem of scarce resources. The voiceover who announces these facts annoys from the start but can be justified as the easiest was of telling about the origins of A.I.Then the viewer gets to know an enthusiastic scientist, who has come up with the idea of creating robots that are able to love. Mechas up to this point were able to function independantly and learn, but were not able to love: their world consisted of mere definitions. The question imposes itself wether emotionless, but self-learning and ?acting robots are actually feasible. Via a time leap we are then introduced to a family who's only son is in a coma. Due to this fact they are selected as a test-case for the first love-capable robot, a boy called David. Though somewhat predictable the mother gets attached to David (though she despises the idea at first) and after a while she even decides to activate the love-routine. This massively interferes with the concept of love, because it makes it seem like love is only a matter of programming. The dramatic point in this part of the movie is when the son awakes from his coma and returns home. The parents are confronted with David, who is suddenly regarded redundant by the father, though the mother still has feeling for the robot. Legitimate points are made regarding the ethical issues concerning A.I. and the responsibility of ?creators' and ?parents'. It is decided to leave David in a gloomy forest, to prevent him from being destructed (since love-activited robots cannot be reprogrammed they have to be destructed once redundant). Kubricks influence is ever so clear: he had a dark view of mankind (consider movies like Eyes Wide Shot, and A Clockwork Orange), and in this phase of the movie he rattles the cage of your conscience. Spielberg is a much more optimistic director: consider movies like ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, even Schindler's List. During the movie this difference remains painfully clear.The theme detachment is further developed in the second part of the movie: a spectacular, though slightly overdone, flesh fair (in which robots are executed as a celebration of real life and out of fear for A.I.) causes a increase in the pass of the movie. Although the idea might very well have originted in Kubricks mind, the cinematographical realisation is clearly Jurassic Park. The story changes to a modern Pinokkio (which also had temporarily been the working title of Kubrick's screenplay), in which David goes on a quest for the Blue Fairy, who will be able to turn him into a real boy. He is convinced that this will make his ?mother' love him again. Again a brilliant idea: a robot pursuing a dream. But the pass of the movie steeply drops, and scenes are annoyingly slow. A nice part for Gigolo Joe and Teddy the Bear (clearly a cuddly family film character introduced by Spielberg) are few of the only things that make the movie worthwile in this part. A glimpse of Kubrick surfaces in the moment where David meets the scientist who created him, during his quest for the Blue Fairy. This scene is situated at ?the end of the world', which ironically is situated in Manhattan (flooded by the smelting of the icecaps), with the skyline-dominating Twin Towers of the former WTC. Some people will undoubtedly appreciate the fact that this hasn't been removed from the film, but I think nevertheless that scenes in which planes crash into buildings and David tries to commit suicide by jumping of skyscrapers, must be painfull for many people involved in the New York tragedy. In a submerged themepark David subsequently finds a Blue Fairy statue, to whom he indefinitely keeps repeating his prair for becoming human. For some reason Spielberg saw it fit to trap Davids vehicle beneath a collapsing Wheel. The necessity for this is completely absent, and I think the scene would only have made a stronger impact if David had decided out of his own free will to stay there. Spielberg seems to be entangled in the (otherwise very well constructed) special effects.In the Aldiss book and Kubrick screenplay, the story continues after thousands of years. David is discovered by very advanced mechas who ? after they have revived him ? learn about their human ancestors, who are now long extinct. This concept has been completely abolished in the movie. Spielberg makes the mechas look like aliens reminiscent of Close Encounters; he seems to be unable to let go of the friendly-alien-fetish. The film gets trapped in cliches and the epoch it could have been (and of which glimpses can every now and then be seen) is in long epilogue definitely wrecked. Besides that there are all kinds of errors in this third and final part of the movie. For instance, huge amounts of water were frozen, but there has been not apparent change of volume. Most of the buildings would have been wrecked by the expanding water, and the skyline would have changed dramatically. Then there are the mecha/aliens who at first speak a language of their own, but later on they speak English (even in the absence of David, which could have given an explanation). Furthermore there are the scientific inaccuracies: David's dream seems to come through when the aliens tell him they can revive a person from the past on the bases of their DNA. This is highly unlikely, since many things like memories, are not stored in the genetic code, but it becomes really improbably when they say they only can do so for a single day because of a twist in spacetime. A needlessly long and forced ending, in perfect Hollywood cliches, in which David gets the chance to spend a final day with his mother; after that he can finally go to sleep, the light are turned of one by one, and the voiceover spawns its last needless remarks. There seems to be only one suitable reactions to this: laugh away the embarrasment of such an ending.The movie obviously owes a great deal to Spielberg, regarding the specials effects, but lacks the influence of a more cynical director. The impact is much less than an average Kubrick movie. It makes you wonder who could have completed the daunting task (with or without the cooperation of Steven Spielberg). Roman Polanski comes to mind, or perhaps David Lynch or Spike Lee. It would definitely have made the movie more challenging.Considering everything, Spielberg made a movie which makes you swim in shallow water: good for some fun. But I can't repress the thought that when Kubrick would have completed the movie he would have made you dive, would have shown you disturbing visions, and would have made you surface again gasping for air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had reasonable expectations of this film. A fine cast and excellent directorial pedigree should make for an enjoyable night at the multiplex. I was wrong. The film started off promisingly enough. The premise was well set out and plausible enough(if slightly unoriginal).Haley Joel Osment was indeed very believable in a difficult role, however I found the scenes with Jude Law very annoying.My main problem was with the ending. I thought the film was going to finish at least 30 minutes before it actually did. The film up until that point had been rather slow, resulting in much uncomfortable shuffling around my chair. The ending that was presented however was laughable. SPOILER - Not so much in its portrayal of what a future earth might look like, but just by the unbelievable sentimentality and schmaltz. By the end I was praying for the credits so that I could attend to my painful pressure sores.Although I hated the film at first viewing, I have to say that some of the images have left a lasting impression with me which has surprised me somewhat. Judging by the other reviews, opinion seems to be divided. This is one film that people will probably have to see for themselves. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that I was caught out by the trailer for this film, in that the trailer gave me the false impression that this film was going to be the business! Did the trailer really give out the impression of Pinocchio with robots? In my opinion the true reality is that it was a very good film drained by the fact that it had been stretched out for far too long ... if this 2h25m film was crammed into the more typical 1h30m, the action and effects would have been coming thick and fast...All in all ... I think that this film, based on content, rather than paced may be worthy of a 5/10. But there's an extra 1/10 for the "supertoy" bear!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow! I was overwhelmed by the sheer visual impact of this film. I agree with some that the ending is too drawn out, but the final sentence still rings a very ironic bell, if you think about it... and some of the images of the future are tremendously powerful. The plot has its share of weaknesses, but visually the film is a pure triumph. Many scenes are exciting and unpredictable, although the part with dr. Know went on too long. I could probably name seven or eight other main flaws, but I won't, because the film is a masterpiece of imagination and special effects. Perhaps the story itself isn't Oscar-worthy nor is the screenplay masterpiece material, but I was so impressed by the film in some of its sequences that I forgot about any problems I had with the story. It can be compared to Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY in the way it is a pure visual feast without having an especially busy story. I highly recommend this film. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is no classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen this movie and it has inspired me to warn others to stay away. Some people are saying it is a classic and ahead of its time. Well to be a classic, a film needs to get the audience thinking about significant philosophical issues. Although the premise of this movie, 'What happens when we create a machine with emotions?' could have given plenty of scope for exploring a range of interesting questions, this film doesn't raise any questions other than, 'Why was this movie made?' and 'How did it get released?'Also, the film never actually deals with Artificial Intelligence in any intelligent way. It requires a huge suspension of disbelief and the plot has many gaping holes. It is the most superficial view of human relations that I have ever seen and it makes me wonder if Spielberg has any understanding of how people might interact with each other, let alone robots. Most unforgiveably, it is an hour too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Urmm....classic for future, could be its only saving grace.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, I watched this film yesterday. It was bad, really bad. I'm a huge Kubrick fan and I apreciate Spielberg material, but it all honestly I was dying for the credits to appear, so I could leave. Even the title, made the film sound tacky - the abbreviation of phrase, which is anticipated to become common place in the future. BUT FILMS ABOUT A.I. HAVE BEEN DONE BEFORE, THERE IS NOTHING NEW HERE.If the film (SPOILER) had ended when David was begging the Blue fairy to be 'real' this film could be satisfied with being below average. But the 15 or 20minutes which followed were cringeworthy. When it said '12' at the beginning of the film, I always thought that meant you were supposed to be 12 or over to watch- but surely only little kids could appreciate this awful ending. If this film had been revolutionary in terms of ideas or special effects -it might have been able to pull it off. But there were no new ideas here really, the idea of rising sea levels (Waterworld), artificial intelligence (Terminator), flying cars etc - have been the worked of sci-fi films for 20 years or more. This film seemed to just drag little bits of other noted sci-fi/futuristic films and lamely put them together.The story was dull and uninteresting, (despite some excellent acting by the 'I see dead people' boy) - and the whole way the Mother fell for the freaky, weird mecca boy was totally unrealistic. Underground lost (American) cities, which is obviously the centre of the universe - because other countries never exist in the future - were so lame and thoughless. I could criticise this film all day, and more constructively if I want to put my mind through the ordeal again - but mistifies me is the involved of Kubrick (you except soppy Disney style garbage now and then from Spielberg). After a near faultless career - where my only criticism would be he didn't make more films -- how did Kubrick get involved in this - or perhaps his involvement was minimal and name used for Marketing. But anyway, there was some reasonable acting at times (especially David) and some pretty good cinematography - but thats not really enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece or a B movie gone wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Contains some minor and one major spoiler**After I first watched Pulp Fiction (before all the hype) I left the cinema unsure if I'd just seen a masterpiece or a seriously bad B film. The second time I saw it I knew it was a classic piece of work. The same applied to 2001 although I needed three screenings to really see the underlying genius of what appeared at first to be a very simple A to B to C movie.Maybe a truly great film does this as A.I. had the same effect on me. If a film pushes the boundaries and is sufficiently different then the first viewing can to many be an unsettling, even boring experience. In many ways, like 2001, the events on screen are only half the story allowing you time to think and reflect on themes and issues that are being raised. Am I hardwired to love my mother until I die? How will I deal with the loss of my mother? Am I any different to David in the way I would react? What extra programming do I have that would allow me to deal with such an event?Not simply because of the Kubrick connection I see A.I. as a companion to 2001. It explores who we are through the eyes and emotions of a machine, reflecting back to us a disturbing image that on further analysis is not as far from who we are as we would like to think.**Major Spoiler**I can remember thinking the ending of 2001 was a real sharp turn but realised on repeated viewings that the starchild was the only ending that could exist given the rest of the movie. It wasn't about aliens or the monolith. It was about where we came from and where we are going. Similarly A.I. has an ending that at first seems very leftfield but really is the only way it can go. Quite simply we are fundamentally unable to judge ourselves and given that we judge a fallen civilisation by its greatest creations it is our destiny to be judged in this way as well.**Major Spoiler End**Whether or not A.I. will be seen as a classic is something that is and will be debated but, in my view, it certainly has the elements. A handful of unforgettable 'to die for' scenes and images for starters.David's first, blurred appearance in the lift. David looking through the empty eyes of a half finished face. David stood with Teddy as he asks if 50 years is a long time. The nanny about to be destroyed telling David that it is going to alright.It has scenes that offer, thanks to the phenomenal talents of Haley Joel Osment and the hopefully soon to be more popular Frances O'Connor, rarely seen emotional impact. When David's face changes after he is activated. When David is first parted from his mother. When David exhibits violence that even causes Joe to retreat despite the fact that Joe has seen some of the worst things that man can do. The 'classic' scenes are almost countless.Also despite the deadly serious nature of the subject there is also abundant humour, some conventional, some very dark. The rivalry of David and Martin is both comedy and tragedy as they fight over Teddy whilst Jude Law's Gigolo Joe reminds us of the many 'uses' of technology. I once read that no technology is more quickly accepted than when pornography is a major use for it (16mm, videotape, satellite TV, DVD and the Internet). I'm not sure how true this is but Joe was a very funny example of how the base desires of humans can be satisfied through our ingenuity.On top of all this the film tackles a subject that whilst obvious and part of all our lives has never been fully explored with anything like the detail and care that it has here and if nothing else it deserves great praise for this alone.After all my ramblings though I do believe that the other reviews here point to A.I. being a masterpiece. People do seem to love or hate the film and great art should create emotion, discussion and debate, be it positive or negative. Love and hate are inseparable.Quite simply A.I. is a film that is really about something and should be seen for this alone. You may hate it with a passion but you might just love it with a passion as well and love is always worth the risk.I just hope it made enough money so that someone else will get the budget to make such an interesting movie and that Steven Spielberg feels that making a movie like A.I. is reward enough if it fails to ignite the Oscars as its failed to ignite the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An opportunity missed....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see AI yesterday with an open mind - very mixed reviews (thankfully I missed all the spoilers) made me a bit apprehensive...with due cause. My biggest problem with the film is that it tries too hard to tip its hat to Kubrick, but misses the mark completely. And then to rub salt in the wound the ending is tacked on like a post-it note at the end of an average sci-fi novel.There was a fantastic opportunity to really explore the story in a way not seen since Blade Runner. fair enough, it would be hard to surpass that film, but you would think that Spielberg would be able to come close. Someone should tell him that there is nothing wrong with an ending that leaves people hanging. It would have made more sense to leave it at the 'fake' ending, a disjointed conclusion to an equally disjointed film.If you are going to take on as complex a story as this, you should be certain that you can answer more questions than you create. Rebadging pinnocchio and then changing the end doesn't live up to expectations.I have seen a few reviews which are confident that this film will see renewed support in future years. I am not so sure - is there really anything in this film that will stand up like Blade Runner?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. is a film built on such an ambitious scale, and carried out with such care and structure, that it is virtually impossible to place it in its purest context after just one single viewing.Conceived years ago by Stanley Kubrick - who realized his limitations in creating the film and turned its care over to collaborator Steven Spielberg - A.I. is a film that seems as though it has been patiently waiting for us to be ready to see it, rather than waiting to finally be made. Presented as a drama in three acts, this is a complexly rendered landscape of not-so-distant futuristic possibility, where a grieving family can turn to technology to replace a lost son, and where robots are just part of the everyday environment.As with most of Kubrick's science fiction projects, A.I. evokes a harsh, dystopian future where the surface of the world is clean and sheer and shiny with newness and perfection, but just beneath that veneer is a darkness that seemingly is inevitable with evolution. The sexual android (Jude Law), and the Flesh Fair are perfectly Kubrickian inventions.But this is not a Kubrick film - Spielberg's touch is evident in the emotional care he sets up for the replacement boy David (superbly played by the uncannily talented Haley Joel Osment), and the deft touch he has in showing the boy more and more of a world he was never supposed to know existed.Again, however, this is not simply a Spielberg film - the story is far too wide-ranging to be labeled so simply. The false first ending - a stark, wrenching finale to David's quest - addresses the transient nature of the world, while focusing on the permanence of the 'soul', even as you are wholly convinced this machine does indeed have such a thing. And finally, as the film winds its way patiently to it's quasi-mystical, near-religious ending - a far more rewarding and uplifting finale - the entire journey is given a focus and a power that a lesser filmmaker (or two lesser filmmakers), would never have dared conceive.So watch A.I. and marvel at the techniques and storytelling prowess of two of the medium's masters at their finest influence. Then wait awhile, and give it a second look. And a third. And watch as it evolves before your eyes, showing more and more of an incredibly engaging story.</fullReview>

The acting is awful, especially from Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law just about escape for this awful mess. William Hurt is practically comatose. The plot is just lots of sections bolted together with no consistent path. The special effects seem to have been taken from a bad episode of Outer Limits. The Teddy bear is however not bad. But the worse part of the film is the truly awful ending. Once again a happy ending is added to a film, like Planet of the Apes. This one however, is at least thirty minutes long. The aliens look like bad rejects from the X-Files.If you want to see really good science fiction watch Farscape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a modern times Pinocchio history. This movie is divided in two very distinct parts: the first one an ordinary sci-fi movie using all the computer special effects we are already used to and sometimes almost fed up with and the second, which raises the value of the movie, where the director's philosophical and metaphysical worries are put in. The story itself has got a lot of loose ends resulting of too many good intentions which don't end up in logical conclusions. There is one thing however that Spielberg seems to have forgotten: man will probably be able to produce artificial intelligence; what he cannot produce and most probably never will, are artificial feelings like love, friendship or hate. These are inherent to the human soul and only to the human soul and no machine can experience them even in a foreseeable future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[***Some possible spoilers - not crippling to the story though***]I'm not sure about the trailers in other countries, but the UK TV trailers have hyped this as something it most DEFINATELY is not. There is no mention of the actual story at all. No mention of little David and his quest to become 'real'. No mention of loving robots. Nothing. It _looks_ like a thrilling action film depicting a conflict between the 'orga' and the 'mecha', showing mainly scenes from 'Rouge City' and the Flesh-Fair (which just happen to be the most action-packed scenes in the film). Also, as others have said, the last half-hour could have been left out and made the film that little bit more believable. Is the film gripping? Yes, within reason. Is the film satisfying? Not in my opinion. However, the special effects are more than stunning, and impressed me on more than one occasion. I'm not saying the film was bad, but I am saying that your expectations are possibly higher than you will encounter when watching the film.</fullReview>

First of all let me say all of the perfomances were 1st class Hayley Joel is defienatley a contender for an oscar next year. What i was supprised at was the movie only being a (12) cert in the uk, as it had a very eery feeling thru-out the entire film, the burst of laughter at the dinner table at the start of the movie from David gave the whole audience a jump!! In some instances i wasnt sure what direction the movie was gonna go next, but i think that was the directors intentions. Many people in the audience were gettin restless at the lengh of the movie some even given up on the last half hour, maybe they had had enough, or maybe they wanted to leave on a high where i think the movie should have ended with David staring at the blue fairy! This is a film that in 20 years we will probally look back on as a classic. Way ahead of it's time, in what will be a movie that is debated in years to come just as 2001 a space odessy is, i continue to try and make sense of this movie, i know i have witnessed something very special and cant wait a second viewing, although i dont know how soon i want that to be. Roll on the DVD, 1st Speilberg commentary perhaps? Over all 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basically a bad movie (Warning - Spoiler!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning! the next few lines contain a spoiler for some parts of the movie.It would seem that Dear misters Kubrick and Spielberg both lost their touch with movie-making. The Visual affects are as wonderful as ever, with use of cutting-edge technology animation and everything. But the story sucks! (and here comes the spoiler...). The plot goes on just fine and actually deep in meaning, until the part David sinks down under manhatten inside the vehicle, gets trapped, and asks the blue fairy to turn him to a real boy. Had they finished the movie there, with him just staying there forever until he moved no more, the movie would have been a success. Finally, a movie with a sad ending but true meaning and purpose. But NO! they had to continue with a charade of stupid 2000 year later nonsense. Ok, the Aliens are well drawn, but they are totally irrelevant to the plot and serve as nothing more than a "forced" happy ending (not VERY happy, but more optimistic than being stuck in ice forever). Its like Spielberg had extra budget and nothing to do with it, so he decided "well, a future with no Aliens is not interesting enough" or he wanted to please those audiences that dont really care for meanings in movies, but just feed on special affects. Anyway, If you read this far, you either saw the movie or pre-decided not to see it at all, so recommending that you dont waste 2 and a half hours on it is useless. but you can be a missionary. Perhaps a silent protest of minimal movie viewers, will cause Spielberg to get back on track.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[This comment SPOILERS!]A.I. has received mixed reviews here in Sweden, therefore I wasn't expecting anything at all when I went to the cinema today. As far as I was concerned it could be a great film or it could be a bad film. What I got though, was something good _and_ bad. A.I. started off quite brilliant and ended up as pretentious pseudo-intelligent cr*p. Now, as I said, A.I. starts off great and the first 90 minutes are engaging, interesting, and heart-breaking. The introduction of Jude Law's character (Gigolo Joe) is great. Then something happens... Oh my. I don't even want to think about those last thirty minutes. Everyone started laughing... If the film had ended with David praying to the Blue Fairy for eternity I would have left the cinema feeling quite different about the film than I do now. Why did there have to be aliens? It's just such a horrible idea. But... Nevertheless, it's a 6 out of 10. Haley Joel Osment is fantastic, Law is great, the special and visual effects are also good... And the first 90 minutes are wonderful.Oh, and of course, Teddy gets a 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A HUGE disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had big expectations as I went to see "A.I." with my friends. I was disappointed. Quite disappointed.Steven Spielberg, who normally is a great director, has created a confused (but not confusing) film. So much could have been done of this movie, but it never went to the interesting places we wanted it to go.The acting wasnt bad, but the characters were. How can a filmmaker expect an audience to actually care about a robot? Even though he looks like a boy and has dreams, he is still a robot, and it's hard for us to care about something with programmed emotions.Sorry, Steven.</fullReview>

Good ideas and very well examined.As said elsewhere, Teddy was wonderful.After seeing the skyline of Manhattan under water, and the effect that had on the audience for obvious reasons, the last act brought fits of laughter from the audience. I couldn't laugh, it was far beyond that. Why did Speilberg think that the film needed an upbeat ending?A very difficult movie to rate, as the first part is probably worth 8 or 9, but is dragged down by the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the average Joe and Jane are not crazy about this film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just jump to the point (I assume you have seen the film, else, the write up is probably not for you). This is a film made with too much of involvement (more so from Kubrick). When that happens, either it hits the bull's eye or leaves out some important bases uncovered.The problem that casts it shadow over the entire film is that we, the humans, are supposed to root for a machine, who looks for love. Now how the hell that is gonna happen? Do you want me to overlook what differentiates me from the machines? - well, over my dead body, since THEN I will be lifeless, too, and would not mind including them in my group. I am a pretty liberal guy, but at the same time, I am not a human if I cannot apprecite what makes me human in the first place. Yes, I did root for a machine (i terminator 2), but then, that machine was aginst another evil machine, and was for the humans.I think this is a case of a BIG tree missed for the entire forest. And that is why this is a movie that, if ever it becomes a classic, will be so only in the darkest alleys of someone's mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film has three quite different parts. The first part would almost have been a film on its own. A disturbing look at the possible future of robotics. Haley Joel Osment is really an excellent actor, very convincing. I found the second part too full of gratuitous violence, and honestly felt that it added nothing at all to the film. The third part initially seemed very far fetched, but when I looked back on the film I felt it had in fact been necessary and it made me ask myself questions as to what purpose we serve on this planet. One of those films that you get more from as you think about it afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What must be considered about this film is that Kubrick saw it as another version of Pinocchio, a future fairy tale. If the film is treated as such it does become emotional viewing. There are some difficult shifts of style and tone throughout the film, but AI feels unique and special. In the future it will probably be looked upon with reverence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNING:Can I just tell the other reviewers for this film that the "Aliens" at the end are not extraterrestrials they are highly evolved MACHINES.Gigolo Joe mentioned in the end only machines would be left, the machines themselves describe David and Teddy as "originals" and it is a common sci-fi idea that machines will replicate and evolve themselves.With this in mind the ending is not so hard to swallow. No foreshadowing gives an indication that these beings are aliens as it would make no sense. I hope this helps an understanding of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg &amp; Kubrick...does it work? Hell yes! *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie blew me away. Amazing acting all round, Haley Joel Osment, I am in awe over this kid's talent. Jude Law, excellent as Gigolo Joe, good to have a bit of comic relief. Frances O'Connor was also amazing with her portrayal of Monica.It is a shame then that people haven't given this movie the chance that it fully deserves. People seem to have gone to see it expecting a full on Stanley Kubrick movie. Well sorry folks but Mr Kubrick has passed on and there will never be another director who can make movies the way he did. And if you can think of another director that could have taken A.I. and made it better, please feel free to email me and let me know. Spielberg has done a fantastic job with this movie considering what he was up against. The pressure of taking Stanley Kubrick's screenplay and making into a movie must have been immense, while maintaining the Kubrick tradition of keeping the plot secret. Also I have always thought that creating a futuristic movie would be one of the hardest things to do, but Spielberg, along with Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) has done an awesome job.The movie itself really affected me; there are some unbelievably emotional scenes, especially in the forest when Monica leaves David. And when David reaches "The Place Where Lions Weep". There aren't really words to express the level of emotional intensity I felt while watching. Next time I will be sure to have more tissues.And here is the one thing that REALLY irritated me *POSSIBLE SPOILER* People, some of you seem to think that at the end of the movie aliens landed. Wrong answer. They were not aliens, they were robots. Yes, mechas. Far superior to the mechas we saw throughout most of the movie, but when 2000 years has passed I think it is safe to say that technology would have advanced somewhat.So definitely one of the best movies I have seen this year, despite the fact it was a bit long.Kudos to the late Mr Kubrick, for his vision. And kudos to Mr Spielberg for the courage to bring that vision to the big screen. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AI is a good movie, maybe a 7 or an 8, till near the end when everything goes sucky. I don't want to spoil the movie too much but theres a bit when David is underwater that would be a PERFECT place to end it but no Speilberg has to have a typical horrifically cliched "happy ending". Its down right awful and does a good job of ruining the movie. Kubrick must be turning in his grave. There is no reason for the rubbish ending to be in there apart from Speilbergs own desire to have everything end happily, well sorry Steve-O but thats not the way things work. If it had been a younger director doing this then he/she wouldn't have been so arrogant as to entirely rewrite things.Still, apart from the terrible conclusion the rest of the movie is good, especially Jude Law and to a slightly lesser extent Haley Joel Osment. Overall I give it 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Kubrick, please come back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. is a good film. It's long but it's not boring. Haley Joel Osment is simply incredible, doing the best android performance of all time. I wish he will get this time the Oscar he missed with The Sixth Sense.But some parts in A.I. are a bit too long for my taste. I'm a big fan of Stanley Kubrick and I can say with no doubt that this film has very little from Stanley and very much from Spielberg. Kubrick wanted Spielberg to direct this film for him. Well, I'm sure that it would have been a wonderful masterpiece if Kubrick would have been in the team (and with us, too). He likes total control over his films, as he used to state, so I can't imagine him letting Spielberg to be in charge. What I really think is that he possibly would have let Spielberg be a sort of assistant director although they would have appeared as producer and director, respectively, in the credits. In my opinion, they would have discussed a lot (due to their strong personalities), and I even imagine the film having serious problems during filming. At the end, it would have been a blood-forged film, something as wild as Casablanca is. But it's not. The fact is that Spielberg is in charge, and what we have is another E.T.-like film, something to make you drop your tears, but without the originality, sharpness and power of Kubrick. Kubrick's power goes beyond the limits of the screen and reaches our minds forever. His images, color and use of music are unique, and that's something we probably we won't see again in our lives. Spielberg is a genius director, but he's not the master. Kubrick is the master of cinema. It's a shame he's not with us any more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I went to see this film having skimmed a couple of reviews; my knowledge of the film was limited to who wrote and directed it and a couple of the big names starring in it. I had heard from a friend that act 1 was slow to get moving but act 2 was good,whilst the ending was quite, um, Spielbergesque(is that a word?it is now).I thus went not quite knowing what to expect but found he was not wrong. Act 1 did raise some interesting questions but failed to answer them convincingly, either within the act or later on in the film. I was unsatisfied with the mother's taking to the kid so quickly although,fair enough, the film would have been even more gratingly slow-paced had more events been included which influenced her decision.Act 2 was my favourite and its ending could in my opinion quite easily have been used to end the film. It was much darker than the other two acts, andin my opinion the best portion of the film. Jude Law was excellent and I almost wish he had been the central character, it would certainly have been a different film (AI 2 - Artificial Insemination anyone?). However,I didn't feel that the enmity of the humans towards the mechas (eg in the arena scene where they are being torn apart melted with acid etc) was explained at all- this could have been explored more.Act 3 raised guffaws among probably half the audience including myself,mainly at its cloying sentimentality,but also in disbelief at the lameness of the ending. It was as if the film up to end of Act 2 had come in under the CGI budget, so a weak alien/weepy plot was tacked on.In summary, I don't feel that it was a complete waste of time, but it could have been a far better film. The walking/talking teddy was brilliant, none of the players' performances could be described as sub par and visually the film was gorgeous. The idea of a replacement android child trapped at the age of 8 or whatever was a very interesting one,as were some of the other visions of the future. So many good ideas but ruined by commercialism to the point it could not be described even as a flawed masterpiece.Three things that irritated me 1-no reset switch on the mecha child if loyalties needed to be overridden 2-easily stolen police aquacopter 3-why was the kid allowed to get outside and jump into the water off the manhattan hq?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** There is an old fashioned saying which goes "Don't over egg the pudding". If ever there was a pudding over-egged it is A.I.This film could have been spectacular and to give it its due, it did start fairly promisingly. Haley-Joel Osment is really an amazing little actor and his portrayal of the 'mecha' child David is as disturbing as it is brilliant. (He never blinks once throughout the whole film) The scene where is 'Mother' abandons him in the woods after her 'real' child (who is a manipulative little s***e) wakes from his cryogenic sleep is very moving as are his awkward robotic attempts to make her love him.Another great, yet sadly underdeveloped, character is Gigolo Joe David's companion on his journey (played by the almost too lovely to be real Jude Law.) His tap dancing gait is a thrill to watch and he also has a couple of cool lines like "You service your Mother like I service my women!" (I'm guessing Mr Spielberg has been reading Freud ;o)Unfortunately, these fine performances can't really save the film from the sickeningly sentimental dirge that it becomes. To cut a long story short David is on a quest to find the blue Fairy from the Pinocchio fairy tale. Fine, but Spielberg misses the how 'ironic' this is. After narrowly escaping mecha-death at the flesher fair he and Joe journey to Rouge City, a kind of Las Vegas for mecha. At this point the film is visually spectacular with apocalyptic backdrops reminiscent of H.R Giger's set design for Aliens.Eventually, David finds his creator Dr Hobby in the eerie sunken Manhattan and this is where the film really should have ended. He realises he is now just a part of a production line of mecha children and isn't 'special' and decides to end it all. Fine. Mediocre end to an O.K film. But no. From now on Spielberg is in control.&lt;I feel I need to reveal a fair bit of the plot here so don't read on if you want to experience the surprise/disappointment yourself&gt;Whilst in the water he 'finds' the blue fairy (a plaster doll in the remains of the Colney Island fair) and spends the next 2000 years appealing to the blue fairy to make him a real boy. But wait. All is not lost. The earth is having another ice age but it is O.K for David (who must run on one hell of a battery) because the aliens have landed! Hurray!! And they are familiar. The last time we saw them they were compelling humans to make mountains out of mashed potato and mud.All these aliens want is for David to be happy (as Spielberg's aliens always do) as he is the last memory of the 'great'(??) human race and all he wants is his mother. Unfortunately genetics hasn't advanced too far and they can clone her, but she will only live a day (apparently a person can only live the once in a space time continuum. It's Star Trek physics again!) David is willing to take that chance for a perfect day (I kept expecting Lou Reed to start singing) and despite the protestations of Richard Burton's alien brother, he gets it. The End. (Thank God)I found it hard to believe that a film could go this wrong with two such acclaimed directors but it did. The first hour or so is promising and clearly has the mark of the great Kubrick in its avoidance of sentimentality. However, Spielberg's influence is unavoidable and the second half of the film is real straight-to-video material. Very disappointing ;o(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me the interesting question about AI is not 'to what extent it is a sentimental or bleak retellin gof the Pinocchio' story but rather... ...'what does this film say about mankinds capoacity to love'The film falls farily neatly into 3 acts...act 1 where HJO (the boy robot) is programmed to love (and develop deepening love) his mother beautifully juxtaposes the simple on/off nature of his emotion with the compexity of human feeling...ultimately breaking Spielberg's sentimental tendency when the boy is abandoned by his mother (more of this later).Act 2 at the flesh fair seems unworthy of the complexity of the remainder of the film...it starts of with a polarised view of humankind as a hateful mob but again Spielberg reverts to type by providing us with an obvious sentimental device of the crowd rebelling when the boy is about to be harmed. I;ve seen this act described as Spielberg's attempt to inject a holocaust theme into the movie...perhaps this is so but I believe that would be to undermine what to me is a more important perpsective on man's inability to be humane compared to the synthetic humanity of the mechas...for me this is a central motif of the movie and is brought to a neat conclusion by the future jump in act 3 where we see the natural superiority of the mechas brought to fruition by the 'darwinian' evolutionary process.Act 3 is a schizophrenic piece of work...melding Kubricks's tendency for a bleak and somehow vague termination with no neat ends with Spielberg's tendency for the feelgood ending. Ultimately the thematic elements of the movie discussed above are let down by Spielberg's need to reconcile the son/mother relationship, in particular the use of the evolved robots who now rule the earth as a substitute for humanity by endowing them with human sentimentality.So...my conclusion...a movie on two levels...lots of themes entered into and not resolved hark to the Kubrick influence but with some tightening of the plot/narrative and a neat ending by Spielberg. Altogether I would say that what Spielberg adds is 'accessability' to a movie that I'm sure will develop with subsequent viewings... ...and for this Mr Spielberg...well done !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic case of tall poppy syndrome.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick was a genius film-maker and a man of very nice judgement. It is because of his amazing ability to judge what is needed and what isn't needed in a film that he is (even in death) one of the most revered directors of all time.I'd like to say that Stanley's judgement of Steven being the most capable director to bring A.I. to the screen (apart from himself of course) what right on the money. Although I admit that Steven has made a lot of crap over the years (i.e. The Lost World), no-one can deny that the man has talent. This film is a demonstration of his talent and ability. It is with absolute resolve that I say (this is just personal opinion here) that Steven did an excellent job with the task that Stanley asked him to perform in the event that for some reason he could not bring A.I. to the screen himself.People say that the film wasn't menacing enough. That couldn't be further from the truth. The sheer humanity of the film, how human the mechans really were despite the fact that they were machienes, and how cruelly organic humans regarded them was sinster enough in itself. The gift of A.I. (as the type of A.I. represented in this film) was selfishly used and abused by humanity who were too blind to see that they were not just simple machienes. Rather that the machienes themselves, like humans (although comical in their attempts or their programming to mimic human behaviour or fulfil a specified task), had their own feelings and thoughts and could be considered 'human' by virtue of this basic human trait. The film was sinister in it's exposition of the ignorance and cruelty of human nature. The inherent abuse and disregard that mechans experience at the hands of humans was more than adequate in adding a sinster edge to the film.The acting in this film was nothing short of sensational. I cannot heap enough praise upon Haley Joel Osmont for his show stopping performance as David. If he keeps this standard going (lets hope he will) he'll end up right up there with respected actors like Edward Norton and Robert De Niro. Eventhough he is still a child, he is a first class actor which is very rare considering what the public regard as talented in Hollywood these days. Haley is half their age and has more talent in his earlobe compared to some of the actors/actresses in Hollywood today. Jude Law was excellent and Giggolo Joe and the special effects....... man Im going to be here all day at this rate.Anyway.... to get to the point. The people who said that this film was bad were probably hardcore Kubrick fans (not that I'm any exception, I absolutely adore Kubrick's work). But it should be acknowledged that there was no way that Steven could have emulated what Kubrick had in mind for this film, he was right in adding his own spin on things (hell Stan himself is guilty of doing the same thing i.e. Clockwork Orange). But the criteria upon which a film should be judged is not simply the tiny little details, but the big picture. It should be a question as to whether or not the work can stand on its own, whether or not it has substance, whether or not it is good cinema or bad cinema. You can be a Kubrick devotee, but that being said you can't simply stick your nose in the air and be blind to the great things that this beautiful film has to offer. As a cardinal rule of lovers of the film meduim, credit must be given where credit is due.As it is well known, it is very fashionable these days to bag out Steven Speilberg. And most Kubrick fans could barely stand the idea of Steven taking on Stanley's unfinished project, thinking that he might ruin everything (I should know I was one of them). There are also those who would bag Steven for other reasons such as being too commercial, being incompetent as well as choosing crappy films to direct to draw the masses (I'll admit to believeing some of this too, but I never doubted the man was talented). But all of this preconcieved baggage was heaped upon A.I., the fact that Steven is a tall poppy and people these days just look for an excuse to bag him out, hindered the ability of many people to see film for what it really was as opposed to it being simply another Steven Speilberg production.I'll grant leaverage to people who admitted the film was good but decided that it wasn't their thing because of personal taste and personal taste alone.But Stanley would be smiling from wherever he is because I'm sure that he would be quite happy with the way Steven's work turned out. It was a wonderful film and I don't care what people say, it needed a happy ending because David deserved one damnit!!! This work can stand on it's own despite the bad reviews it got, and in terms of people thinking that Stan would have made it more sinister all I've got to say is that Stan never made the same film twice, so there is no way you could ever really know for sure what he would have done provided he was alive to do it himself. If you have any doubts just think of Eyes Wide Shut (which is a great film by the way) and don't forget the wonderful reviews that it got.Despite the baggage and the bad reviews because of it, do not be fooled! The critics don't always get it right. A.I., if anything (provided it is watched with an open mind) is proof of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the audience realizes that David, this new Pinocchio, will take advantage of his robotic powers (durability, endurance, memory) on his quest for his mother's love, a sense of doom spreads around. Then we transit from the luminous/dark world of Kubrick to the warmer and human colors of Spielberg as David tries anguished to scape his fate, as we saw in Columbus' Bicentennial Man. The story builds up in a slow pace so it does everything in the movie, acting, photography, special effects, music, to a final emotional climax intense as rarely seen. Far more ambitious than E.T., the journey of this new alien mind looking for a heart will rank among the best sci-fi movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great idea done appallingly badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The frustrating thing about this film is that I wanted to like it, honestly I did. There were glimpses throughout the first hour or so which showed what a good film it could have been and the deep questions that it wanted to try and answer. Sadly though overall it falls down badly and appears clumsily handled. The acting is variable, Joel Haley Osmont is excellent and Jude Law is pretty good but I thought the parents were just average, though not helped by a script/direction that seemed to want to rush through the opening scenes. The last half an hour or so is just unspeakably bad, Kubrick must be spinning in his grave, the very worst of Spielberg dross fantasy and a sickly sweet saccharine ending. I came very close to walking out, it's that bad, one of the worst film endings I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of sci-fi, myths and faerie tales, but this was just cr*p.A nice idea, but disappointing at best and truly awful at its worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As per usual, the over hype, and excellent trail editing, left me eagerly awaiting the latest runner from the Speilberg stables. It is so often the case these days with the big releases, that they fail to deliver. This film has been slowed to walking pace, in the hope that it would make it seem more deep and ponderous than it actually is. I'd have edited 1/2 an hour out of it, with out much of a plot change! Ok this film has excellent visual moments, but the over acting of the "humans" is tedious - the drama school expressions of love, now fear, "come on darling show me some angst" got boring- too many meaningful moments,that meant nothing. There was no real message to deliver, except "lookout, or the robots will outlast us", hardly an everyday worry. I guess it'll gross record amounts, and a mystique will grow round it, (I've already spotted one "cult movie" tag!) sadly it illustrates what an emotionally empty world we live in. Give me Pinocchio any day !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of cinema?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Could this be the end of cinema? It could be the ultimate triumph of style over substance. There's no doubting Spielberg's lofty filmic ambitions and his ability to pull off the big setpiece scenes, but the emptiness and shallowness of this film leaves the viewer wondering what the point of it all is. Add to this A.I.'s ponderous sense of its own importance over 2.5 hours, and this film just about vanishes up its own backside.SPOILERS AHEADThe signs were not good right from the start as the deadly serious narrator intones "Many years from now once the polar icecaps have melted as a result of greenhouse gases ..." or somesuch - talk about heavy handed. Another example is in the final sequence where in all seriousness one of the thin androids (why is it that in films like this the extra terrestrials are always in humanoid form?)advises the robotic boy in the same serious movie-trailer voice that "It is possible for a space/time pathway to be occupied only once ..." Talk about making it up as you go along.The problem with Spielberg is that he's always leading up to a big climactic scene - all very well, but he sacrifices everything - script, plot, character to get there. Take the final scene - contrived in every way so that we could get the robotic chap his mother's love and then lose it. And so we get some stuff about "we can recreate her but only for one day .." without any explanation. Also, if his mother didn't love him before, why should she love him in one day 2000 years after she's died. Frankly it's an insult to the viewer's intelligence.Look at the difference in the way Hitchcock (who shared Spielberg's fondness for the big scene) builds up to the big final setpiece. The characters, story and tension develop gradually but inexorably; then the big climax and it's all worthwhile. With Spielberg it's all just a big letdown because the build up has no substance to it.I couldn't see the point of the "robotic love machine" guy either- why was he in the film at all? And I have to say that the young boy tried as hard as he could but good grief did he overdo the "Love me mommy" bit. After a while it becomes like stating the bleedin' obvious. And when Spielberg applies the soft sugary stuff, you can hardly watch the screen for embarrassment - when 2000 year-old Teddy produces the lock of Mommy's hair from the recesses of his fur, the entire audience cringed.The problem is Spielberg takes it all so seriously. I reckon he needs a co-director who can take Spielberg's genius for the big scene and apply some quality control and lightness of touch to the rest.As a final thought a few days ago "Duel" was on. What a difference - taut storyline, no superfluous material, great acting from Dennis Weaver, brilliant tension, no sugary sentimentality,interpretation possible on a number of levels, and a great climax. What has happened to Spielberg since then?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely a story of 3 parts. Part one is regulation SF in the Kubrikian vein - cold, clinical, and probably the most satisfying.About a third of the way through, the movie makes a rather clunky change of gears and now we have horror fantasy, reminiscent of Stephen King. (Though he had nothing to do with this movie.)The segue into part three is also rather contrived, and we are now into pure schmaltzy Speilberg, complete with benevolent aliens and swelling musical score. I found the movie extremely interesting, all the more so because of its imperfections. Had I been there purely for the entertainment to wash over me, I would have found it less satisfying.

		<shortDescription>Ambitious, yet flawed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously ambitious in both style and content, A.I. suffers from a distinct lack of direction. Spielberg appears to have been torn between Kubrick's original vision and his own distinctly different one. So we have a movie that looks fantastic, but one which is overtly sentimental and ultimately shallow. The sheer scope of the story seems to have run away from Spielberg, who manages to get all things in there, but is unable to keep all the strands under control. At it's heart it is a very simple retelling of the 'Pinocchio' story, which, in itself is what drives the tale along. As sci-fi it is too light on depth and lacks humanity...which is all the more remarkable considering the director's previous work. The only well rounded character in the whole piece is David, with everyone else woefully disregarded and underwritten. But perhaps that's the point, David becoming, ultimately more human(e) than any real person could possibly become. His love is, after all, for eternity, and unwavering, and who among us can promise that much. This is David's story, and everyone else is merely periphery to embellish that story.There are certainly great things to be enjoyed here, most notably Janus Kaminski's glorious photography, and Haley Joel Osment's mesmerising performance. It spends too long wallowing at the start, and then tries to cram too much in at the end...in which case it is either too long, and should be trimmed, or it is too short, and needs more time to develop it's ideas. Whichever is correct, it's still a fascinating experiment, and certainly the most uncommercial film from the world's most commercially successful director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late Stanley Kubrick spent a long time developing this project, but it was Steven Spielberg who brought it to the screen as both writer and director. These mixed antecedents probably explain the uneven nature of this over-long and very disappointing work. The first and third segments are sickly sentimental and clearly come straight from the creator of `E.T.', while the middle third represents a much more violent and dystopian world that owes more to the director of `Clockwork Orange'. Young Haley Joel Osment (`The Sixth Sense') is perfectly cast as David, the latter-day Pinocchio ? a super-sophisticated robot who just wants to be a real boy ? and Jude Law looks good as a robotic gigolo. There is even an mechanical teddy bear that will delight young viewers, but irritate others who will think that a miniature Ewok has wandered in off the set of `Return Of The Jedi'. Certainly I would have liked more science and less schmaltz. Also I saw the movie just five days after the destruction of New York's World Trade Center and my enjoyment of the film was not helped by an unsettling shot where the tops of the towers appear above the flood waters caused by melted ice caps.</fullReview>

It also makes you think. In fact, the first hour of this film is very deep - very thought provoking. But then it gradually loses its way. Instead of staying on firm scientific and ethical ground it wanders into mythology and sentimentality - and goes on and on and on.

		<fullReview>As the film ends, we all wonder who we really are...Are we capable to love endlessly like David did? Isn't that to be even more human than we all are? The thing is, these times we are living lack of fairy tales that bring up the best we can be as persons and human beings, until now. The journey of David is a journey that will not be forgotten in a long time, even if it didn't raised as much as it was expected.But, Who's David, is he real, is he a mecha (mechanical person), is he a combination of both, and the most important question is...How can a fairy tale turn a meca into a real person?...As in all good fairy tales, or films, you have to see it to believe it. Although, this might not be the most original story ever told, since there are thousands of books and films dealing with the morals of living with robots, or how should a human person interact with artificial persons, this is a new focus on the subject. A modern Pinocchio that shows that no matter what age are you living in, the struggle for a different person against the whole world will always be the same one, the search for happiness and most of all, love. Love makes the impossible possible, and for the unbelievers, here's David to show us that. You will never believe this; you will even hate yourself for being a real person and not a mecha like David.There are many allegories and metaphors regarding how real are humans, and how unreal are robot, but if I would talk about everyone of those I would probably never end. Also, the film can't be denied of the genius of Stanley Kubrick and the imagination and power of Steven Spielberg, none of them could have done something like this without the other.The result of all this work and concepts I have been writing about is, a stylish, witty, superb fantastic adventure that dives deep into the soul reaching powerful nerves. It is almost impossible not to be touched by it, as it is impossible not wanting to cry. So live it, and become real watching David and his journey throughout the heart.</fullReview>

Even before this unendurable end, there were many scenes which were plain boring. Some strong moments, especially in the mother-Haley interaction, were cut short in favor of brutal Android destruction mayhem.All in all, this movies seems like it is made out of at least four Short Films, "Mommy Daddy Child", "Flesh Fair", "The hunt for the blue fairy" and "Aliens from Inner space talking rubbish".

		<fullReview>This film is basically a cross inbetween Pinochio and "Bicentenial Man". The special effects were great and the characters were interesting but it was merely a more modern and visual fable with a simplistic plot, the main character seeking to become a real boy.Like "Data" of the Star Trek TNG films, David was built with an emotion chip that could be turned on but unfortunately for the poor David, his couldn't be turned off resulting in the defensive "I am a real boy", or variations of this phrase, and the occasional aggresive response when his individuality was questioned. I believe the character failed to progress and therefore could not gain empathy from most viewers, this character's emotional reactions being as programmable as Teddy's, who objected to his abuse and mishandling. To quote the Borg Queen, David was "An imperfect being made by an imperfect being" ; A android created to fill a void that is disposible when conflicts arise.I'd give this film a eight on ten, additional point having been given for the visuals and entertaining characters. And no, i'm not that big a Star Trek fan. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Utterly Artificial Masterpiece: Nothing to Rave About</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~*~ First and foremost, I must say that a day after viewing, I found A.I. Artificial Intelligence to be what I can only call a disappointment. I've heard that a day or so after seeing it, it will get you thinking and you are more impressed with it, but thus far, I don't see that in my future. I was expecting a really good classic Spielberg goodie, not even a tearjerker, but t least something that really gets your mind working. This film sure gave my brain a workout, but not in a good way. Basically, I was trying just to keep up with the plot, which plods along for the most part before quantities of "thought-provoking" material and "emotion" is generously slathered on. I was not given mental exercise in the sense that I was inspired or enlightened with some great message. It was a thick plot type of movie, not reflecting movie, in my view. Furthermore, the film is incoherent and choppy, and it can be easily divided into excruciatingly simple sections that are seemingly signature products of different minds at work. ~*~ Part I, a quick-paced but serviceable beginning: The early scenes of David the robot child's gradual assimilation into the Swinton household are tinged with an ominous emotional hue. Osment has a genuinely creepy presence here - the most chilling and Kubrickian moment in the film may be the hollow approximation of childlike laughter he unleashes at dinner one night. His interactions with Monica, who is at first terrified of him, before transferring her motherly needs onto him, form one of the most unsettling takes on the parent/child relationship since The Shining. For the first time, Spielberg seems fully engaged in exploring the darker, thornier corners of his domestic suburbia. I found by the end of the first half hour or so that the acting was a little more than decent, but I must say I was greatly impressed with the young Haley Joel Osment, but who wasn't? The rest of the acting presented here was mediocre at best. ~*~ Part II, the mainly Kubrick section: I thought the remainder took the form of an average classic fairy tale quest, one that draws inspiration from fantasias as diverse as Blade Runner and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The visuals were wondrous to behold, especially in that Rouge City segment that pleasantly reeks of Kubrick's cool, classical style mixed with Spielberg's pop instincts. Everything was grand, bright, and mostly all in good fun, and who can possibly resist the charm of Jude Law as Gigolo Joe? This part is probably the lightest and most pleasant to watch, even as it included the Flesh Fair, a carnival where scrap robots are viciously destroyed. ~*~ Part III, the mainly Spielberg section: As soon as we're out of Rouge City and in (oh-no!) Manhattan - now the end of the Earth - Spielberg discharges occasional trickles of sap, including some cutesy business with Teddy (who I adored anyway, but I think I'll shoot myself if he's the next Tickle Me Elmo at the next holiday season) before finally and ultimately bursting under the weight of a tidal wave of ponderous schmaltz in the final half-hour. It's a dumbfounding sequence of events - a sort of children's book take on the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey, as maudlin and shameless as anything Spielberg has ever done. And of course there's also the theme of, "Let's just get some aliens in here to explain everything," that is oddly reminiscent of E.T. I guess we can thank Spielberg for that act of "realism" in depicting the aliens for such elongated periods of time and even having them speak in perfect English to little David and granting him wishes like a genie. (go figure!) A subtler approach might have suited it better, but I am extremely far from worthy of giving helpful hints to the Great Spielberg, of whom I AM an admirer, though one probably couldn't tell from this review. By the way, if you can't catch the little dose of symbolism at the very end, it's quite alright; it wasn't the best batch of symbolism I've ever seen and wasn't executed particularly well. To wrap up the third segment, I quote a section of Scott von Doviak's review on the CultureVulture: "As John Williams' usual brand of treacle swells up over the end credits, you'll be forgiven for thinking the music is only there to drown out the sound of Stanley Kubrick rolling in his grave." ~*~ Anyway, I can't recall ever feeling so embarrassed and sympathetic for a major, highly-admired filmmaker like Spielberg. The box office gross income proves that word has, indeed, gotten out that A.I. Artificial Intelligence was an over-hyped, not outstanding movie. I can't even tell if it will be nominated for an Oscar (if it is, you can be sure it will be mainly because the holy name of Spielberg has been imprinted on it), but I am afraid to say I certainly wouldn't vote for it if I were so lucky as to be a member of the Academy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Implications</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film explores the great dilemma that future generations will clearly confront. How we deal with manufactured intelligence and and its moral implications. If our manufacturers cannot yet create a flawless tire for cars some 80 plus years into production, what type of mistakes will we make once we begin developing intelligent machines.My favorites scenes of this movie included the dialog between the boys (David the "mecha" and Martin the real son) in the domestic setting. It was fascinatingly uncomfortable to see the way Martin tempted the limits of David into mischief through his jealousy. And later the mean spirited taunting David endured during the pool scene. If I were God (ie Spielberg) I would have been happy to have explored David's acclimatization into a domestic family setting to a much greater degree without all of the fantasy and sci-fi that would fill the better part of the 2nd half of this film.

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, unique, deeply philosophical, disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is outstanding on all fronts .. screenplay, acting, effects, sets, etc. It is philosophically profound, and doesn't take the easy way out .. no happy endings, no easy answers. It is harrowing to watch, and I would definitely keep the kiddies away, but if you enjoy "good" science fiction, which is to say, science fiction which is about ideas instead of gore, slime and/or explosions (as most seem to be), this film is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I am one of the few people who actually enjoyed the ending to this movie. I don't think this is a typical Spielberg ending at all. I have taken just a couple of philosophy classes but in each of them we have talked about what it means to be human. The ending in A.I. also asked this question. Is David human or not? Or am i just way off, and the only person who is thinking this way. But as I see it, David, is the last link to organic humainty... making him more "human" than anything elso on the planet. So evolutions turn is that man involves into machine... but I think thats still just me. However this is definately the best movie I have seen this year (though I have not seen either Momento or With a Friend Like Harry) and it will definately get a lot of playing timein my dvd player in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get over it. Kubrick wasn't that good a director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just because someone was a perfectionist doesn't mean that his movies are good. Kubrick always found some way to make his movies extra stupid near the end. And so, continuing the tradition, Steven Speilberg does the same. A.I. was Best Picture material until the last 25 minutes. Then, in true Kubrickian style, he manages to absolutely destroy his film by turning it from a dark, scary pic into an infinitely stupid fairy tale piece of crap. Don't get me wrong, the movie is still a B, but it could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Implications</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film explores the great dilemma that future generations will clearly confront. How we deal with manufactured intelligence and and its moral implications. If our manufacturers cannot yet create a flawless tire for cars some 80 plus years into production, what type of mistakes will we make once we begin developing intelligent machines.My favorites scenes of this movie included the dialog between the boys (David the "mecha" and Martin the real son) in the domestic setting. It was fascinatingly uncomfortable to see the way Martin tempted the limits of David into mischief through his jealousy. And later the mean spirited taunting David endured during the pool scene. If I were God (ie Spielberg) I would have been happy to have explored David's acclimatization into a domestic family setting to a much greater degree without all of the fantasy and sci-fi that would fill the better part of the 2nd half of this film. David was programmed to want nothing more than the love of his Mother and family. His naivete and want for love is something that the other characters have a hard time understanding and regardless of how real David seems at times, those around him never let go of the fact that he is a Mecha/Android.My take is that the point from which David falls to the bottom of the pool the audience enters the mind and dreams from the perspective of the artificially intelligent protagonist as the scientists perform adjustments and treatments.

		<shortDescription>Be prepared to drown in shallow water</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a common element found in romance novels which causes most readers to disregard them immediately and that is "sentimentality for sentimentality's sake". The characters act passionately and are full of emotion for not apparent reason. Perhaps if the reader knew why the characters acted so wantonly it would be more believable. But instead of providing any true emotion, it's easier to label critics as "unromanitc".Speilberg's latest "masterpiece" puffs itself up to be full of depth and meaning. Unfortunately it's not there. Watch for the scene that features a mural of the Emperor with no clothes. A.I. more closely parallels that fairy tale than Pinnochio. The metaphysical understanding expressed in this film is insulting. Perhaps if the movie would have ended 20 minutes earlier I wouldn't have hated it so much. Hollywood's answer for a Godless salvation is getting very trite.A.I. is beautifully made and the acting is tremendous, too bad such skill is wasted on invisible thread.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat interesting but derivative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is basically a cross inbetween Pinochio and "Bicentenial Man". The special effects were great and the characters were interesting but it was merely a more modern and visual fable with a simplistic plot, the main character seeking to become a real boy.Like "Data" of the Star Trek TNG films, David was built with an emotion chip that could be turned on but unfortunately for the poor David, his couldn't be turned off resulting in the defensive "I am a real boy", or variations of this phrase, and the occasional aggresive response when his individuality was questioned. I believe the character failed to progress and therefore could not gain empathy from most viewers, this character's emotional reactions being as programmable as Teddy's, who objected to his abuse and mishandling. To quote the Borg Queen, David was "An imperfect being made by an imperfect being" ; A android created to fill a void that is disposible when conflicts arise.I'd give this film a eight on ten, additional point having been given for the visuals and entertaining characters. And no, i'm not that big a Star Trek fan. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawed Masterpiece, But Great All the Same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****A FEW SPOILERS*******Clearly a Masterpiece Until Spielberg Stepped in at the End, But Works All the SameBy the first 20 minutes, I was mesmerized and enthralled by A.I. or `Artificial Intelligence'. And my interests continued all the way through despite the Spielbergian sentimentalism and heavy-handedness.While no one can deny that both Kubrick and Spielberg are supreme masters at their craft, the two are inherently at opposite ends of the artistic spectrum; thus the overall consistency of purpose and vision of A.I. is somewhat mixed. Nevertheless, the end result is still one of the most spellbinding and innovative movies of the summer.The main problem: Spielberg's undying need to inject emotionalism and optimism at the end, killed the relentless, cold logic of a distinctly Kubrickian first act. (Hey, `2001: A Space Odyssey' is one of the greatest films of all time in my mind.) A similar problem is that A.I. isn't one film, but a gigantic sprawling film of at least three to four highly charged issues that were only superficially explored by the film. There were also a few technical and scientific fluffs (Physics 101 mistakes), but I won't get into that here.The Ben Kingsley narration, the roaring dog-like motorcycles, the blue fairy stuff, shafts of light, menacing men of authority in silhouette, and other small things are clearly Spielberg. It seemed as though, Spielberg reached into the vault of the past and tried to combine elements of E.T., Close Encounters (third act), and the fairy tale quotient of Hook with some clearly Blade Runner-ish stuff by Kubrick all in an effort to call off questions about A.I. being his film in the final analysis. Still, the film has a lot going for it. The haunting modern score of Williams is on target; the casting of Frances O'Connor as the mother, Jude Law as the gigolo mecha, and Hurt as the paternal god-complex scientist was without question flawless; and the production values were top-notch as well as the special effects of course (this being a Spielberg film).Clearly, A.I. was a labor of love for both directors. Stanley Kubrick is many a director's director and it is well known that Kubrick is one of Spielberg's favorites, yet Spielberg couldn't help but be Spielberg and completely take A.I. in a zany direction that Kubrick most certainly would not have. For example, David could have somehow self-destructed or de-activated, once he painfully realized that he was not unique, but a mere commodity, an automaton that would never have been accepted by Monica, or most humans for that matter. The point at which he falls off the building would have been perfect for wrapping up the story. Instead, the film CONTINUED with more blue fairy stuff, which wasn't all that bad in of itself, just totally incongruous with the preceding story.Even so, A.I. is still a wonderful serio-fantasy. I highly recommend it to any Kubrick, Blade Runner, or hard-core sci-fi/fantasy fan. I promise that you will not be disappointed with A.I.'s parts and that you will certainly have a lot to discuss.And if you don't mind me, I think that I'll go see it again next week.Rating: 97/100 3.25 stars out of four</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A schizophrenic mix of camp and CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt Spielberg was "attempting" to capture the flare of Kubrick in this film. All in all, he fails. The silken patchwork of a few good ideas, a few great effects, and an the occasional good performance, is haphazardly bolted together with the most campy scenes since Judge Dread.There are moments when I want to embrace this film as a modern faerie tale, but I keep slipping out of the experience, as my belief is suspended as from a noose, with the horrible explanatory voice overs at the end, and the contrived jumping from one storyline to the next.If you want a decent contemplation where advanced artificial intelligence meets sentience, check out the Voyager episode, where the holographic doctor seeks vindication of his rights.As far as AI goes, flush and watch it spin thankfully into the distance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a disappointment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... and PLEASE don't accuse me of having "no imagination." I have alot of imagination. I worship Kubrick, ALL of Kubrick, and have studied "2001" almost frame by frame. I was a HUGE champion of "Blade Runner" when it was getting terrible reviews upon original release. But I know a bad movie when I see one - and this one is quite bad.There is a fine line between "imaginative" and "silly." The ending of "Mission to Mars" was silly (I laughed) and A.I. has an ending ten times longer and three times worse. Actually there are THREE distinct endings to A.I. and only one (the first) would've worked. I'd like to think that Kubrick would've known to stop it there.AND WHAT IS UP with the Spielberg/Lucas "Every Movie Must Have an Adorable Something Or Another In It" school of thought!? That damn Teddy - why not just put a freakin' Ewok in the movie? And the Robin Williams-voiced Dr. Know was UNFORGIVABLE, as awful as the two headed announcer in "Phantom Menace" ever was.The performances by Osment and Law were excellent. The art direction was stunning, especially Rouge City, the Moon Balloon, and the flooded NYC. I commend the movie on those elements.Had it ended sooner (and better), "A.I." might have been a deeply flawed masterpiece a la "Blade Runner". But unfortunately, it's just not there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spielberg Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What led me to think this movie would be a different kind of Spielberg film? Perhaps it was marketing (like attaching Stanley Kubrick's name to it) or that I hoped the theme would justify an intelligent and thought-provoking treatment; or maybe because I thought he had another trick up his sleeve.However, he ruined it by relying on all his old stunts* to try pulling at our heartstrings while insulting our intelligence. The movie is one lapse in logic after another. Teddy is a good example. If you've seen the movie, you'de know he was an extremely devoted and intelligent robot, and possessed seemingly human-like emotions. If engineers could build a "Teddy", what was the challenge in building a "David"? I thought David was some revolutionary robot?! Oh, I know- Teddy was there in the cute Disney-esqe sidekick role. And did Teddy really fit in this story anyway? Only in the cliche-flooded world of Hollywood superstar director S.S.The movie was also very dull and confused, going (as others here have mentioned) in a variety of directions for almost three hours (I don't mind long movies if they are good). I really am sorry that a script that Kubrick supposedly worked on for years was given such an apparent rush job by Steven Spielberg. I just hope the Kubrick version of the script finds it's way to publication. I gave the film 3/10 for some of the visual effects.*the sentimental good characters and the shallow evil-characters for stereotyping the audience into exaggerated identification; huge, awesome visual and audio effects to overwhelm our senses, including the obligatory sweeping John Williams scores; cutesy characters to charm us and to relieve tension, etc.</fullReview>

But did anyone else happen to notice the bow to the Wizard of OZ? Not a complete parallel, mind you, but David as Dorothy, Teddy as Toto, and Jack as the Tin man. Together they journey to a rather sleazy version of Emerald City and consult a holographic version of the Wizard (even looked and acted like the wizard).Anyway, I intend to add this movie to my video collection when it's available and intend to enjoy it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misunderstood Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I saw this movie last week I have actively been reading the comments posted on this board. I don't know if I have ever seen a movie generate such a contrast of reactions. I think that the people who are calling it absolute crap are people, like me, who have never really experienced a movie with such depth. It's different. Often things that are different are misunderstood, and ultimately rejected as awful. In twenty years though, once people have become more accepting of this brilliant film, it will be labeled a classic. Hopefully I can hurry along the accepting process by clearing up some misguided notions held by those critical of this film. I feel the robot not alien issue has been cleared many times over. (Don't feel too bad if you did think that though, for the first few seconds I thought they were too.) The ending is really getting a lot of people's panties in a whirl. Sure they could have ended it with David staring at the statue forever. That would have made it mythical and people would have walked away going "Oh, how profound!". But to end it that way would have been too obvious, and in my opinion a copout. Stanley Kubrick was never about following traditions in film, and it definitely shows in AI. To me, this movie was much more profound by adding the next chapter. If it hadn't, this film's message would have been lost. What is that message? Whatever you want it too be. I've read many complaints about this as well. "What exactly was this movie trying to say?" I think those who ask that need to realize that a theme doesn't always have to be written in ink. Sometimes, as with this film, it's left open for the audience to decide. I personally think it's great when a movie lets you take what you want from it. It makes the film seem that much more personal to the viewer. Well, I think I'll stop here, not because I don't have tons more to say about this film, but because I know it probably won't matter what I say. This is just another review in an endless machine. I do hope though that if you didn't like the film you will give it another chance. You can't understand how monumentally frustrating it is to feel so good about a film, just to see others dismiss it as Hollywood tripe. (Sigh) Oh well, perhaps in twenty years.....</fullReview>

A.I.-Artificial Intelligence is the only movie next to Contact that has a reality to the future ahead of us. It has a true real life love story in which a young boy wonts is mother to love him so he goes on a journey to find the blue farry so he can became a real life boy so is mother can say "I Love You" and in the end his mother love him know matter if he was real or will Artificial. it is brilliant,excellent, and paints a beautiful picture of the future.

		<shortDescription>This movie made me flinch and cringe for 3 hours straight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read a lot of glowing reviews about this film, most of which beg the viewer to not dissect, or over-think, its many faults. Yet the fact remains that this is a BAD movie. It was a BAD idea. It seems like everyone involved tried their damndest to transform this fiasco into something profound, but fell way way short. The result was something exhaustive, painful, and embarassing to watch. Haley Joel Osment's performance would've seemed oscar worthy, had it not consisted of the same canned emotional outbursts he's been playing upon since the Sixth Sense. He's seeming less like a gifted young actor and more like a dog performing tricks for the camera in each successive role. Elsewhere on the acting front was the movies ONLY shining star Jude Law. His performance was so good in fact, it actually made everyone elses seem that much more wooden in comparison.This is the part where I should say "I don't want to give away the ending, but..." Unfortunately in the case of this movie there's nothing to give away. This movies meanders from start to finish and NEVER offers anything concrete. Every scene is delivered with little regard to a cohesive story and to ultimately embarassing results. The most astounding of which would have to be where the young artificial boy David is captured by the Flesh Fair. As robot after robot is destroyed for the viewing pleasure of the living, a "Black" robot voiced by Chris Rock, of all things, is thrown in to provide a quick dose of comic relief. Amazingly at a point where the audience is supposed to be sympathizing with these machines.Normally I avoid picking apart movies for inconsistencies. However, this moving offered up something so incredibly dumbfounding it boggles the mind. 1. A human was cloned.. 2. Physical features, personality, memories, and all.. 3. From a small lock of CUT hair.. 4. Hair that didn't decompose for 2000 years.. 5. In the hands of a robotic teddy bear.. And this was by all accounts the pivotal point in the movie?!?To surmise, BAD MOVIE. BAD BAD BAD BAD MOVIE. Anyone who says otherwise has ulterior motives. Or wants you to think they know something you don't in an attempt to manipulate you. Or is just crazy. HORRIBLY BAD MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though there are a few obvious plot holes one can pick out of the story (they should be obvious) and even though there are some flaws (the last 30 minutes to some, although I think to think it's easy to seperate the final act from the rest if you hate it)... certain scenes in this movie are off-the-page brillance.The constrast between the Kubrick and Spielberg moments, in my opinion, doesn't turn the movie into a conjointed mess but rather strengthens each element. Jude Law and Osmond are amazing, the scene where Gigolo Joe and David meet has some real bizarre magic. Let's not forget the famous movies Joe homages through his dance steps.Great SFX and this may be John Williams' best score in a long time.There's a few elements that were vastly out of place... especially Chris Rock's voice cameo as a robot during a scene that should have been more shocking, and certainly some areas of the movie aren't as well developed or thought out as they could have been considering how amazing certain scenes are.There are a few plot points that people might not "get" so be aware... my friend was confused and missed one of them. There's definately several different themes running through the films and ironies and to describe them all would be spoiling the film... but rest assured they are there.Despite the flaws, still a great movie and by far the best of the summer (not like there's been much competition).9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mistaken Identity? (MINOR SPOILER)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't go into a lengthy review or critique here, a lot has already been said. (MINOR SPOILER COMING AT THE END OF THIS COMMENT) You either like it, don't like it, or both. I fall into the later category. It was brilliant in some respects, visually stunning, wonderfully acted (for the most part) and fundamentally flawed. If you are saying it 'sucked', then you are no better at reviewing than you are implying Spielberg is at filmmaking. It's monumentally difficult to bring such a vast idea to fruition and please everyone. It doesn't present a new vision of the future, in fact it borrows from many other post apocalyptic films. If it was trying to make us care about David, it failed. Or did it? Was it trying to make us care about David, or just presenting us with an idea, caring only how we react? If you cared, are you simple? Were you fooled? Did you miss his obvious flaws, flaws we would call creepy in a person? If I told you I loved you, would you buy that too? If you didn't care, are you insecure? You can care about C-3PO, but he's a cartoon, for all intents and purposes. But we cared about Data. Of course, we were exposed to Data over a course of years. You can love your car, a house, even your remote, but they don't threaten to look like you, cry like you, be mistaken for your kind . . .or replace you. So, all the elements were there; the boy-robot being provoked, misunderstood, abandoned and treated in'humanely'. But we don't cry when he so expertly does. Hmmm. Too long an ending, off on a tangent? That's a matter of taste. Not sure how you feel about it, still talking about it? Were I a film maker, I'd be happy with that. By the way, (SPOILER) why does everyone believe the beings near the end are aliens, when they are so obviously the advancement of robots after men have outlived their existence? This, though not in-your-face, is obvious from bits of dialog, and the mechanical sound attached to the captioned voices. Plus it's deducible from the very point of the story. Well, time to sit back and wait for Fellowship of the Ring.</fullReview>

I felt it would have benefitted greatly had the filmmakers not pulled their punches, and instead delved into the darkness and angst that they only flirted with. The 'Joe' character, especially, could have been much stronger had they been willing to portray him more fully than merely a cute, non-threatening foil for 'David.'It also bears mentioning that the film simply shouldn't be seen by young children -- in the theatre where I saw it, many children started to cry in several places, and some of their parents wisely carried them out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A.I" is set in the plausibly distant future, one we seem to be headed for. If you go see this for nothing else, check out the world Spielberg creates and how he makes you believe it. The visual effects are the best I've seen. This is likewise the most accurate rendering of the future I've seen. It isn't based on flights of fancy, but is honest about the direction the human race (well, at least here in the U.S.) is heading in. What's one of the first functions these robots that can think for themselves, created by humans to fulfill human needs, would be used for? Of course. There can be no denying that the Gigolo Joes and their female counterparts would be the first ones off the assembly line.In this story, many kinds of robots have been created and discarded for a newer model, just like today's computers. These robots serve humans, but are also self-reliant. These robots have will. They want to survive. This creates a paranoia about them, which leads to the dreaded Flesh Fair. Old junked robots are captured and destroyed in all kinds of creative ways before a cheering crowd--the future equivalent of BattleBots, WWF or Monster Trucks. The Fair and the scavenger robots it victimizes is but one of many great ideas "A.I." offers. When the Flesh Fair crowd finds out scientists have created a child, no one can believe it. Why make a child robot? What purpose could it possibly have? Before too long someone in the crowd figures it out: somewhere out there, there's a mama who lost her child or a man and woman unable to concieve.David is programmed to love his mother forever if he is read seven certainwords in a certain order. Once his love is turned ?on', love in this case being a program that begins running, it cannot be turned off. This is very profound and meaningful, so I appreciate that the film doesn't konk you over the head with this: once you love someone--really love someone, not like puppy love, twitterpation, infatuation, even the love behind most marriages--but REALLY love, like the way a mother loves her child, it cannot be turned off. We often love people who don't love us back because that's just the way it is. We even love people who are mean to us. That's why it's love. It's not a decision, but a condition. Love can make you crazy, drive you to make weird choices--like abandoning your robot son in the woods to fend for himself because he's a danger to your real son. Yes, Monica does the compassionate thing, the right thing, and that's why it's so sad.Now David is lost and alone, without the one person that matters to him, also knowing that person can't love him because he's not a ?real boy.' David believes he can become real with the help of the Blue Fairy from ?Pinnochio,' which he doesn't understand is just a fairy tale. Aiding him on his quest: the aforementioned Gigolo Joe, who'd just like to turn that ?blue' into something else. Hey, it's what he does (thank goodness Spielberg refrains from showing Joe teaching David how to dance and walk the way he does--not that there weren't a couple of threatening moments).I want to talk about the ending but I don't want to say ?spoilers!' because then people won't read on. So I'll be as vague as possible and just say (gasp!), it worked for me. Many have said that one ending was enough. True, the Manhattan/Coney Island scene would've been a great ending for any film: a satisfying, open-ended, fitting (but very sad) close to the story. This was the only point where I wondered why it kept going. But as I watched on, it started to make sense. The film becomes very somber and visual (the Kubrick portion of the story if you will) or what others would call ?slow.' Well, I'm a patient moviegoer so I'll sit through almost anything. This ending, however out of place it may feel, does tie up the story nicely. There are some parallels with the beginning and I like stories that end that way. Whether the film is better with or without this last half-hour I couldn't say. Maybe I'll go see it again and run away right when that moment comes.As for whether it's good or bad, which I haven't really expressed one way or the other--well, I have concerns. There's a whole lot of story here and it feels like too much even for a 2 and-a-half hour film. The first half is very good, but feels like merely the set-up for a bigger, bolder story to come. This bigger story never quite materializes. That there appears to be a lot more story available to tell makes me think this would have made a much better novel. Of course, they'd just try making it into a movie anyway.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was Spielberg thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD...As a Spielberg and Kubrick fan, I was really psyched to see A.I. but left the theater (the Ziegfield in NYC) totally disappointed. I really hate this film. As the parent of an adopted child, I found its main themes to be very offensive. Spielberg really has some warped ideas about motherhood and fatherhood. The ending is so stupid that it defies belief that this film was made by one of the most noted directors of our time. What was he thinking? A.I. is a total mess which should have died along with the great Kubrick because this is obviously not the film he intended to make. I'm sure Stanley is spinning in his grave. Please, don't bring your kids to see this film, especially if you have adopted or foster children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now don't get me wrong i did enjoy this movie but i thought that some parts were not that great and all in all people were making to big of a deal out of something that is not that great. The start is kind of bad and all it shows is that movies have to start some where it only gets good when martin comes home then the movie could be one of the best films and then the ending is bad which means that if you show up late and leave early you will have more fun. The story is about a robot named david who thinks that if he was a real boy he can win the love of the women he calls mommy Monica. After hearing the story of Pinocchio he goes to find the blue fairy and on the way goes through a lot this movie is worth the money but it could have been made better all in all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why, oh why??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why, oh why Spielberg! What have you done!!!Many of the people who know well of the films of Stanley Kubrick would say this: Why oh, Spielberg, what did you do!! Well, this was my reaction to the ending of Spielberg's new film A.I.The idea for A.I. first began with the Brian Aldiss' story "Supertoys Last All Summer Long." Stanley Kubrick took it, and developed a script with Spielberg since 1982. It was their secret project where they sent the scripts back and forth between each other. Kubrick was supposed to produce, and Spielberg would direct. It seems that Spielberg didn't fully realize what he was doing and what the intention of Stanley Kubrick was when he began the production of this film.The film tells the story of a mecha that is programmed to love, David, played accurrately and precisely by Haley Joel Osment. It has provoking questions and ideas spread all over the place, but the problem is this: It poses the questions but in a wrongful way. The idea of what love is and if machines can indeed love truly is contradicted in the film in a way that I will not state in this comment. It is almost as if Stanley Kubrick's ideas and Spielberg's sensitive direction are fighting for the frame of the film. The film seems to be driven with an idea, but in the end, the film loses the focus of that idea and goes on to the next phase of the idea as if the question that the film posed in the beginning was already answered. But it wasn't. The film loses focus, almost as if Spielberg's heart was to soft to direct the film in a certain direction.The ending is horrible. I will not say what it is, but I absolutely hated it. There was a plausible place to end the film about 20 min or so before it actually ended, but it almost seems that Spielberg had to put his view into the film in order to end in a certain manner he felt comfortable with, not the idea. This is exactly what he did in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN as well. Rather than provoking the audience and leaving the audience to wonder upon the idea, he tells us what it is supposed to be, almost as if he doesn't trust the audience. It would have been actually better if he did indeed answer something in the ending, but he didn't. He was answering a totally different question than the one that the film originally asked.Technically, A.I. is flawless. The colorfully lighted photography of Januz Kaminski is finger-licking good. The score by John Williams is beautifully done, even though it shouldn't have been. The special effects are very much believable. The film itself is directed to be very much so watchable. The film A.I. is a triumph of Spielberg in technical achievement, but is a failure in its artistic form. It is also a tragedy because of its failure to be what could have been indeed a true tribute to one of the most ingenious mind the world of film ever had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misunderstood Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I saw this movie last week I have actively been reading the comments posted on this board. I don't know if I have ever seen a movie generate such a contrast of reactions. I think that the people who are calling it absolute crap are people, like me, who have never really experienced a movie with such depth. It's different. Often things that are different are misunderstood, and ultimately rejected as awful. In twenty years though, once people have become more accepting of this brilliant film, it will be labeled a classic. Hopefully I can hurry along the accepting process by clearing up some misguided notions held by those critical of this film. I feel the robot not alien issue has been cleared many times over. (Don't feel too bad if you did think that though, for the first few seconds I thought they were too.) The ending is really getting a lot of people's panties in a whirl. Sure they could have ended it with David staring at the statue forever. That would have made it mythical and people would have walked away going "Oh, how profound!". But to end it that way would have been too obvious, and in my opinion a copout. Stanley Kubrick was never about following traditions in film, and it definitely shows in AI. To me, this movie was much more profound by adding the next chapter. If it hadn't, this film's message would have been lost. What is that message? Whatever you want it too be. I've read many complaints about this as well. "What exactly was this movie trying to say?" I think those who ask that need to realize that a theme doesn't always have to be written in ink. Sometimes, as with this film, it's left open for the audience to decide. I personally think it's great when a movie lets you take what you want from it. It makes the film seem that much more personal to the viewer. Well, I think I'll stop here, not because I don't have tons more to say about this film, but because I know it probably won't matter what I say. This is just another review in an endless machine. I do hope though that if you didn't like the film you will give it another chance. You can't understand how monumentally frustrating it is to feel so good about a film, just to see others dismiss it as Hollywood tripe. (Sigh) Oh well, perhaps in twenty years.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairy tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My comments on the movie itself are brief...it's a beautiful, strange movie with the spirit of a fairy tale and the pacing of a dream. It is definitely more in the line of a Spielberg sort of film than a Kubrick...but there is still a vague sense of darkness underlying it all that Kubrick perhaps would have appreciated. I listened to comments by other viewers as I was leaving the theater and have read many of the negative comments here...and have come to the conclusion that most people do not have much in the imagination department. Those who just want to be passively entertained in between oversized gulps of popcorn and chatterings with friends probably will not enjoy this movie. If you drop your cynicism and let yourself just go along for the ride, it's really a beautiful and sad movie. Yes, it is derivative of fairy tales...so what. It's meant to be. Yes, some of the dialogue is cheesy...so what. It's meant to be. Yes, the movie moves slowly...so what. It wouldn't be what it is any other way. If you're looking for the typical summer movie where cleavage, explosions and adrenaline abound, don't come looking here. If you're willing to watch and imagine and leave your Leonard Maltin "How to Dissect a Movie in 12 Easy Steps" manual at home...see the movie for what it is and is meant to be...you will not be sorry. I give it a 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie made me flinch and cringe for 3 hours straight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read a lot of glowing reviews about this film, most of which beg the viewer to not dissect, or over-think, its many faults. Yet the fact remains that this is a BAD movie. It was a BAD idea. It seems like everyone involved tried their damndest to transform this fiasco into something profound, but fell way way short. The result was something exhaustive, painful, and embarassing to watch. Haley Joel Osment's performance would've seemed oscar worthy, had it not consisted of the same canned emotional outbursts he's been playing upon since the Sixth Sense. He's seeming less like a gifted young actor and more like a dog performing tricks for the camera in each successive role. Elsewhere on the acting front was the movies ONLY shining star Jude Law. His performance was so good in fact, it actually made everyone elses seem that much more wooden in comparison.This is the part where I should say "I don't want to give away the ending, but..." Unfortunately in the case of this movie there's nothing to give away. This movies meanders from start to finish and NEVER offers anything concrete. Every scene is delivered with little regard to a cohesive story and to ultimately embarassing results. The most astounding of which would have to be where the young artificial boy David is captured by the Flesh Fair. As robot after robot is destroyed for the viewing pleasure of the living, a "Black" robot voiced by Chris Rock, of all things, is thrown in to provide a quick dose of comic relief. Amazingly at a point where the audience is supposed to be sympathizing with these machines.Normally I avoid picking apart movies for inconsistencies. However, this moving offered up something so incredibly dumbfounding it boggles the mind. 1. A human was cloned.. 2. Physical features, personality, memories, and all.. 3. From a small lock of CUT hair.. 4. Hair that didn't decompose for 2000 years.. 5. In the hands of a robotic teddy bear.. And this was by all accounts the pivotal point in the movie?!?To surmise, BAD MOVIE. BAD BAD BAD BAD MOVIE. Anyone who says otherwise has ulterior motives. Or wants you to think they know something you don't in an attempt to manipulate you. Or is just crazy. HORRIBLY BAD MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*WARNING MINOR SPOILERS* "Artificial Intelligence" was a masterpiece, plain and simple. I left the theater not knowing what to think of it: whether to condemn the last scenes as contrived, Hollywood, superfluous, sappy. I was almost positive that they had ruined the movie for me. However, subjectively, Spielberg left in his artistry the right amount of evidentiary textual elements in the last scenes to prompt more in depth thought about the film itself. Assure yourself, as the credits roll across the screen: the film is NOT an allegory for Pinnochio. To claim such suggests that you did not watch the movie! The use of Pinnochio serves two purposes: to provide common ground with the audience, and to satire the notion of humanity as benevolent. It is the aspiration of all creation to become its creator. In this attempt, creation will forgo all benevolence, and create something in its own likeness which will aspire to be it. However, imperfection reciprocates. Both sides of human nature are present: the crass, base primality of destruction and sexual eroticism(read: Gigolo Joe and Flesh Fair) and the ability for the created to love its creator, and to love in general(read: David wishing to be a BOY, but his only role model for boyhood is Martin, a perverse, unhappy boy whose attitude towards David is competitively, haughtily condescending at best. It makes the revival of his marred, half-dead corpus seem all the more reprehensible.) Thus it can be seen, the two main artificially intelligent characters in this movie are manifestations of both sides of human nature, even though neither being is wholly perfect or wholly imperfect(Gigolo Joe is capable of benevolence, just as David is capable of hatred and destruction). Spielburg also suggests that the capacity for love inspires creation. This optimism resides in David's attempt to fulfill his own dream of being a "real boy." The abstraction remains in his mind, unreal, unrealized, until he completes his odyssey, his journey, whose end hails the realization of his idea. He has created a dream, and he has aspired to reach that dream. In his confrontations with the evolved MECHA at the end of the movie, the incarnation of his long-dead mother IS that realization. Thus, at the end only the higher part of human nature is present: love. However, David extends himself beyond that. Humanity, after all, has not been shown to LOVE its creation. David CAN: He can love both his creator and his creation. David, like the other MECHA, has evolved.</fullReview>

It was poorly written with so many unresolved plots that it was horribly flat. And what was with the aliens at the end? It felt like Speilberg just wanted to say " I believe in UFO's nah nah na boo boo". The concept of the movie was great but why did they screw it up so bad? I have sat through some horrible movies and this one easily took the cake. I was ready to walk out after the first hour but I stayed hoping, no praying, that it would get better. I was not expecting another ET but I was hoping to at least be entertained for the duration of this agonizing 2.5 hours. Instead a good kick in the head would have been more pleasant.

		<fullReview>In an amazing show of utter incompetence, Spielberg has taken a Kubrick masterpiece inspired by "Super-Toys Last All Summer Long (1969)," the short story by British author Brian Aldiss, and TOTALLY MESSED IT UP!! The filmography was absolutely stunning and delightful, but you can actually notice the exact instant Kubrick's influence left and Spielberg stumbled on alone. In an ironic twist, Spielberg's method to the madness ran like this:The first 45 min was pure Brian Aldiss - the wonder and sadness found in a living robot created to love. The next 75 min was pure Kubrick - the pain and consequences of having created a loving robot that man could not love. The next 30 min was pure Spielberg - aliens flyin around, super powers, and maaaaagic. Guess which segment sucked? The only true compliment I can give Spielberg for this movie was the casting: Haley Osment, Jude Law, Brendan Gleeson, Robin Williams.. and Ben Kingsley narrating. Absolutely fantastic! Haley is so incredibly talented the boy almost frightens me. He reminds me of a young Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", when DiCaprio showed unimaginable talent playing a retarded child. I just hope Haley doesn't mess up his career later the same way :)I recommend everyone go see this movie, just make sure you leave 30 min early before it starts to SUCK!</fullReview>

The end stunk and the film should have been 30 minutes shorter, there were a few things in the last half that could have been cut out. The story was a little contrived, too obvious parallels between pinochio and the wizard of oz. A strong film that makes you think, it just takes too long to do it.

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** A.I. is maybe the most interesting, ambiguous, lyrical, beautiful, emotional, haunting and innovative film ever made. I don't know if I will ever be able to fully understand its genius. I saw this film with about six other people last night in NY, and I was literally the only one who liked it. I felt alienated, like David, that I was the only one who was able to fully receive the remarkable buzz of the film. I just still can't believe how emotionally satisfying the film was. While watching A.I., I experienced new emotions that I had never felt before, a familiarity I hadn't encountered from a film since last years Crouching Tiger. I was completely pulled in from minute one.For me, the first act was the strongest, because the way the story was told, during this point, was the most unconventional and indescribable to me. Every scene between Osment and O'Connor are just so rich and believable. They have an incredibly internal chemistry which I haven't scene in a while. The one scene where O'Connor first programs David with the seven-digit code is just so tense and touching. The moment where David `comes to life,' and says mommy, and then camera cuts to a CU of O'Connor's reaction, just totally killed me, like so many other moments in the film. The scene which ends the first act, where Osment is abandoned in the woods by his mother, is also another scene which completely effected me. Haley during this scene is simply fantastic, but the real gem in the scene is O'Connor as we watch her unfold and collapse as she tries to abandon her child. You can completely feel her internal struggle and the audience experiences every emotion which she does. The second act kicks in with a strong change in mood as Spielberg takes us to the inside of a hotel as Jude Law tries to seduce a woman for one of the funniest scenes in the picture. This again shows Spielberg's incredible range. I have to say that from here on the story is a lot more conventional, up until the end, and you can kind of feel where Spielberg's inner style comes in. The film continues to enthrall, but it does it in a more typical way.The final 20 minutes is where the film kind of derails, and becomes a bit too sentimental, but nevertheless maintains its impact. I have spoken with many people who think that the film should have ended with David staring at the Blue Fairy, and that is probably where Kubrick would have ended it if he had directed, but Spielberg does not like to leave his audiences dangling, so he threw in the end. This didn't bother me as much as it did other people, but I can understand where they come from. The final scene between David ad his mother is just so incredible that Spielberg knew it had to remain in the film, but the way which he got to that scene just didn't really work. The fifteen minute gap between where David looks at the angel and the final scene is sort of relentless and lacks texture, but nevertheless it is still visually interesting. I am glad that this sequence with the aliens was included though, because it was so haunting and eerie that it also inspired new emotions. It reminded me of the final scene in 2001, where the pod lands in the old man's house. Both scenes are just utterly creepy, and unfathomable.Apart from the plot and its elements, the rest of the stuff is just golden. The acting is unbelievable. This is one of the few films where practically every performance is great. Osment is simply unbelievable. It is one of the best performances I've seen in recent years. The performance is completely believable and the believability comes from Osment's range of body-language, facial expressions and the way he delivered his lines. He makes it look so easy, and he does a great job of making the audience feel sympathetic towards him. The supporting performances are also quite extraordinary. Frances O'Connor was just terrific and the audience feels her struggles throughout the whole film. Jude Law was impressive and fun, but he's done better.The film also works visually on so many levels. Most of this can be attributed to Kaminski's sheer talent. This is definitely some of his best work. The lighting is so diverse and moody, and it contrasts so well. During the first act it was quite amazing to watch the lighting styles change scene after scene. I loved the golden tones and hues during the warm scene's with David and his mother. These contrasted well with the brilliant colors that occupied the rest of the film, especially during the flesh fair and the trip to Rogue city. The art direction and futuristic sets also added a great deal to the haunting pull of the film. On top of these key elements and the rest of the film lies John Williams' score. He has never gone this far before. It is definitely his most restrained and daring score ever. I am only scratching the surface of this film. A.I. is a film that everyone should see at least once. It is certainly Spielberg's most interesting and different piece ever, but it is also his most off beat.</fullReview>

In this attempt, creation will forgo all benevolence, and create something in its own likeness which will aspire to be it. However, imperfection reciprocates. Both sides of human nature are present: the crass, base primality of destruction and sexual eroticism(read: Gigolo Joe and Flesh Fair) and the ability for the created to love its creator, and to love in general(read: David wishing to be a BOY, but his only role model for boyhood is Martin, a perverse, unhappy boy whose attitude towards David is competitively, haughtily condescending at best. It makes the revival of his marred, half-dead corpus seem all the more reprehensible.) Thus it can be seen, the two main artificially intelligent characters in this movie are manifestations of both sides of human nature, even though neither being is wholly perfect or wholly imperfect(Gigolo Joe is capable of benevolence, just as David is capable of hatred and destruction). Spielburg also suggests that the capacity for love inspires creation. This optimism resides in David's attempt to fulfill his own dream of being a "real boy." The abstraction remains in his mind, unreal, unrealized, until he completes his odyssey, his journey, whose end hails the realization of his idea. He has created a dream, and he has aspired to reach that dream. In his confrontations with the evolved MECHA at the end of the movie, the incarnation of his long-dead mother IS that realization. Thus, at the end only the higher part of human nature is present: love. However, David extends himself beyond that. Humanity, after all, has not been shown to LOVE its creation. David CAN: He can love both his creator and his creation. David, like the other MECHA, has evolved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great potential squandered (mild spoilers).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where can I start... It was like seventeen directors and screenwriters submitted rough cuts, and Spielberg (typically a great director) took two minutes of a random, slick looking parts in rotation and assembled - well - THIS.  For three minutes at a time - the movie works - then changes tone, back story, mood, internal sense, etc... I was at times wondering if they swapped reels from several different cuts. The story would have made three great movies. One film about a family coming to grips with the inevitable AI that will seep into our lives in the future. Alas, Bicentennial Man or any of the Star Trek episodes featuring "Data" were more satisfying. One film about David's quest to become a real boy - the strand of which was sloppily interwoven with the rest of this movie - the Pinocchio motif was jammed down our throats at every turn. It could have done with a much lighter hand. The second act was also much too shallow, there must have been hours of potential backstory that were cut here - to its own detriment. A third would be the more epic conclusion to David's quest, elegant use of the Pinocchio imagery and all.  But this? A stilted first act (why can the mecha move smoothly when in a complex scene, but like an addled Furby when fetching his pajamas? For that matter - why do the people go from understandable characters to B-movie victims at the drop of a hat?) - best first-act performance - Martin, another botched opportunity for development. Second act - way underdeveloped. Best character - Joe - but wasted on a skimming treatment of everything else. Third act - the comparisons to 2001's ending are at best rationalizations. (Why do the AI first use subtitles and then speak explicitly? And with Eton accents? For that matter, if they're so advanced, why take the form of dime-novel aliens? Please, if the Roswell incident becomes our Rosetta stone for future intelligences...) Dave Bowman's transformation made sense in the original story.  Jarring problems - There seems to be a trend in quick advances - Castaway's "Four Years Later" becomes "2000 Years Later" - what's next?! Teddy might have provided a great foil - version 1 AI interacting with version X - but he was far too knowing for his meager use, and if he were that advanced... Lots of dropped opportunities - Dr. Hobby, the potential army of Davids, all hinted at and left hanging. Sorry to add these mild spoilers - but the internal consistency was so lacking - it was truly like watching a rough cut. I would have given all of Frances O'Connor's artful mugging for more scenes of honest interaction between her and David - maybe it's her single status - but several people have said that anyone who has been a mother would not have let some of those scenes thru.  In summary, this viewed like a rough cut, and I can't imagine that this was ultimately directed by Spielberg and not some assistants. Tone was all over the place - in contrast to most of his work - from Duel thru ET thru anything else... hardly his best work, but deserving of so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a world of horrible devices of mass destruction with depleting resources, there is massive famine in third world countries, millions dying, melting ice caps. The human race builds a robot that was intended to work for us, due to the lack of people. So, now that robots are a household word, though being called "mecha" (mechanical) in the movie, having to manage population, licenses are needed to have a child of your own, but, the "orga" (organic) have the idea of building the perfect child, one that doesn't need anything, but love of his mother.I won't go on to the movies details, see it for yourself, you'll get a better kick out of it. Instead I will talk about how i felt.This is no ordinary film at all, it combines the two of the greatest film makers, one to captivate you and make you cry your heart out, the other to make you think in a way that you never would have in any other movie. By thinking, it is already unique, it's not mindless shooting of weapons and gore splattering all over the floor, and walls, there is nothing to think about, you have no message to decipher, no thought involved. But in this movie, sadly, the last of the Kubrick collection, you are taken into humanity and shown if and how love can be possible for a "mecha" and "orga", other then sexually. You are shot out into the strangest places, to find an understanding, but it's not quite there.I have read many reviews till I wrote mine, but none of the negative reviews brought up a point on to why they disliked it, many just say that it would have been perfect, but the last 30 minutes ruined it. They are watching too much b******t movies that clotted their mind with non-sense thought. The last 30 minutes was pure Kubrick, and as such, needed to be thought out, before you displace it. Spielberg, with programmed tears and amazing camera work. Acting being the greatest I have seen in a long time.They molded two great minds into a classic. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep movie shallowly interpreted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**AI contains many level of meanings and unfortunately much of the audience focuses only the shallow level, and misses the really worthy part.On the surface, this is sci-fi movie with quite a bit of emotional contents. The futuristic settings, the quest of a child robot to become a human and to receive his mother's love, the violent action of humans against future robots.Certainly the story is interesting, though contains a few flaws especially at the end where the story sometimes feel contrived and not-so-scientific.However, the real meat of this movie is on a deeper level. It talks about humanity and the meaning of life. It presents a wide range of human beliefs, emotions, and thoughts.Part I--Attachment: love, companionship (mother to child, child to mother, robots to robots);Part II--Detachment: jealousy, hate, violence, fear; andPart III--Ignorance: belief in self, pride, desire, faith, attachment, detachment.Many other reviews have talked about Attachment and Detachment, but not so much was discussed about Ignorance presented in the film.**You may not want to read further if you haven't seen the movie. Spoiler ahead.**In the part III, David found another robot like himself and he became truly disappointed; in fact, fear--so much that he destroyed the robot. This is the first time that he used violence himself. He always believed that he was unique; he is proud of himself at least for this. The fact that there are other robots identical to him destroyed this pride and attacked his deepest existential belief.I believe a major reason that he committed suicide was this.Then another type of ignorance--faith--started, he prayed and continued to pray for thousands of years until he was waken up by the revealing experience that what he believed in was just as fragile as any other thing is.Then, the movie moves on to desire, which is related to attachment. His need of maternal love is more than pure love. It is based on deep desire to be cared, to be loved back. Although the desire was fulfilled, it was only temporary. The real fact of life is that everything is temporary. Although David may live very long, but everything else changes. In fact, nothing stays constant, even David himself.That's the only fact of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very disturbing movie?I also think it is a great movie, with 5 powerful themes all dealt with in highly emotionally charged metaphor:?Truth doesn't matter, only perception... ("protect me, brother", Gigolo Joe's sudden change of status)?The bond between a Mother and child (and vice versa) is very very very strong and loss of it is a cataclysmic event.?People can be mean and selfish. (Mecas are only made to fulfill their (Orgas) needs/pleasure)?Life isn't fair. ("Why didn't I tell you about the world")?Sometimes we need a dream (true or not) just to survive (the fairy tale)?None of us are really all that special... (the assembly line)Flaws:Parents sure were pretty stupid taking everything at face value even when they knew they were dealing with a first... not very believable...The ending gets lost a bit, Kubrick often seemed to have trouble figuring out the ending eg.2001.SCREEN GEMS:Loved the child-like naivete of the robotsLoved the ending, anyway, especially the very last scene!Loved Jude Law's performanceAwed at the talent of Haley Joe OsmentGood job over all, I can't stop thinking about this movie, nor can anyone I know who has seen it. I did not find the movie schizoid at all, I think the hand of both directors worked well together. Let's face it who cannot relate to David's situation?View with Kleenex but not little kids, it really is a PG-13 movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>His love is real, the story line is not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an amazing show of utter incompetence, Spielberg has taken a Kubrick masterpiece inspired by "Super-Toys Last All Summer Long (1969)," the short story by British author Brian Aldiss, and TOTALLY MESSED IT UP!! The filmography was absolutely stunning and delightful, but you can actually notice the exact instant Kubrick's influence left and Spielberg stumbled on alone. In an ironic twist, Spielberg's method to the madness ran like this:The first 45 min was pure Brian Aldiss - the wonder and sadness found in a living robot created to love. The next 75 min was pure Kubrick - the pain and consequences of having created a loving robot that man could not love. The next 30 min was pure Spielberg - aliens flyin around, super powers, and maaaaagic. Guess which segment sucked? The only true compliment I can give Spielberg for this movie was the casting: Haley Osment, Jude Law, Brendan Gleeson, Robin Williams.. and Ben Kingsley narrating. Absolutely fantastic! Haley is so incredibly talented the boy almost frightens me. He reminds me of a young Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", when DiCaprio showed unimaginable talent playing a retarded child. I just hope Haley doesn't mess up his career later the same way :)I recommend everyone go see this movie, just make sure you leave 30 min early before it starts to SUCK!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's real love? ***spoilers***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most disturbing thing I found about the movie was the fact that almost none of the reviewers (only one of the hundred or so reviews I read) seemed to question that the robot boy was exhibiting "real" love. It sure didn't look like love to me. I saw absolutely no concern for the object of his "affection", but instead unending neediness and a ceaseless demand for her attention. As examples of his "love" he follows her around doggedly, almost blinds her, and almost drowns someone she obviously cares for (don't you think his programming would include some injuction against harming humans and the fact that people can't breathe water?).After being abandoned by her, he still longs only for her "love" to justify his existence. Although he has exhibited jealousy and anger in other contexts there seems to be none toward her. After a quixotic search for the Blue Fairy (reasoning that only by changing completely will he be lovable), meeting with his makers, going into despair, and waiting tirelessly for two thousand years focused obsessively on this "love", he finds the object of his desire at last. He is told that with the current state of technology, if he brings her back now, she will live for only one day and they can never try again. In his final act of "love", to make HIM happy, he insists that they bring her back immediately so she can validate him and tell him he is lovable, thus insuring her death forever. There is never any question of waiting to see if the technology can mature and they can give her a more permanent existence, one possibly where SHE might benefit from the experience, as well. There is never any thought for HER happiness...what SHE would like or benefit from. Where is the love in this?On a related note, why is it that the robot once imprinted can only love the one person? Why having loved once can the robot not love another? Is this supposed to be another aspect of "real love"? Does "real love" mean loving only one...only once?To me this movie seems like a cautionary tale, showing what horrors can be generated when your definition of love is severely limited and bounded by need and insecurity rather than concern for your loved ones. It does not seem at all like a paen to love and the human spirit, "happy" ending notwithstanding. In fact the whole movie seems to resonate with an extremely dark view of humanity (it gave me a chill when I read one reviewer's certainty that this is what the future holds for mankind). The only one who displayed any concern for anyone else's feelings was Teddy. He seems much more evolved than the boy to me...perhaps they had already achieved their objective with him and should have quit while they were ahead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's all the griping about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I must ask moviegoers, what's all the griping about? If you can accept a movie for what it is, and not for what you want it to be, then you should like this movie. I was enthralled by the cinematography, set design, and special effects that enriched the film without deterring from the story. I made a comparison to these attributes to the ones in Star Wars: Phantom Menace. The George Lucas production didn't know how to use their technology to effectively tell the story. This one did. I was blown away, hands down. When I go to a movie, I don't try to dissect it, I just try to experience the story and feel the heart of the characters. Oh sure, watching SCary Movie is a totally different experience altogether, but as a small time actor, I tend to appreciate a terrific performance, which this film was not short of. Haley Joel Osment, Frances O'Connor, and Jude Law were exemplary. In fact, everything was fantastic except for one thing, and it's what everybody's crying about. WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD No one likes the ending, and yeah I thought it was kinda weird, but you have to understand that you've watched David's journey for, in the time span of the film, a very long time and I felt he deserved to see his quest through to the end. I cared too much about his character and that poor little bear to leave them where they were when you thought the movie was ending. It simply was unsatisfying to watch a characters odyssey for an entire film and not see it completed, and I believe that if it HAD ended there, everyone would be complaining about that, too. I know I would have. This film may not be for the filmgoer looking for a laugh and a good time, but it nevertheless is phenomenal and is worth seeing. I fully believe that the many successes that make up this film outweigh the flaws and that it will be remembered as a masterpiece in years to come. And for the actors involved, if any of you are reading this, I deeply appreciate the fine work you have done, and I hope you are proud of yourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I.: Artificial and Irritating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it seems that the negative reviews are overwhelmingly numerous here. What does this means? You bet, A.I. is not that good.Hey, Steven, you, the genius behind E.T., the Indy Jones saga, Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, Always and counting, have you lost your mind? Whatever is your answer, A.I. will remain as a somehow flawed, uninspired, cold and pointless motion picture. Yes, pointless, because movies are full stories with sometimes tough endings, ripe with true emotion; movies are life, movies are art, and you failed in giving a point to all of these feelings.This picture kind of reminds me of Bicentennial Man, about a robot that desperatly wants to become human, hostage of a crual futuristic world where humans have gone ballistic for nothing. As BM, AI looks great but suffers from a very static and "frozen" vision of the future. On the other hand, Janus Kaminski's photography is great as usual (still, Janus, could you use a bit less smoke effect for your interior settings? it kind of dates and gives a cheap look to your otherwise admirable work). The main characters are amazing, I have to concede that, and Joel Haley Osment is purely phenomenal (his separation anxiety burst in the forest is a real Oscar moment). But Gigolo Joe? Come on, what acting is that? That's what professionals call overacting. Period.Eventually, A.I. is a pop corn movie made for adults, with too few good moments, mixed with inconsistencies and flawed situations, despite the good direction, the great sets and the photography. But that ridiculous, sugar-coated ending is just too much. I yawned at it and could care less about Joel's attitude and the cheap-looking new mechas. Imagine A.I. would have ended with a fade to black as Joel's characters dives in the deep waters of Manhattan, and you have an open ending, leading to an array of numerous questions that make you reflect on many topics well after leaving the theater. Here, that annoying ersatz of a fairy tale is nothing less that insulting.I can't wait to see Minority Report and find back the great Steven. Oh, and by the way, to those of you who "loooved" A.I. or "weeped at each instant", grow up, get a life and never become film critics, because you obviously missed the point here.</fullReview>

The story would have made three great movies. One film about a family coming to grips with the inevitable AI that will seep into our lives in the future. Alas, Bicentennial Man or any of the Star Trek episodes featuring "Data" were more satisfying. One film about David's quest to become a real boy - the strand of which was sloppily interwoven with the rest of this movie - the Pinocchio motif was jammed down our throats at every turn. It could have done with a much lighter hand. The second act was also much too shallow, there must have been hours of potential backstory that were cut here - to its own detriment. A third would be the more epic conclusion to David's quest, elegant use of the Pinocchio imagery and all.  But this? A stilted first act (why can the mecha move smoothly when in a complex scene, but like an addled Furby when fetching his pajamas? For that matter - why do the people go from understandable characters to B-movie victims at the drop of a hat?) - best first-act performance - Martin, another botched opportunity for development. Second act - way underdeveloped. Best character - Joe - but wasted on a skimming treatment of everything else. Third act - the comparisons to 2001's ending are at best rationalizations. (Why do the AI first use subtitles and then speak explicitly? And with Eton accents? For that matter, if they're so advanced, why take the form of dime-novel aliens? Please, if the Roswell incident becomes our Rosetta stone for future intelligences...) Dave Bowman's transformation made sense in the original story.  Jarring problems - There seems to be a trend in quick advances - Castaway's "Four Years Later" becomes "2000 Years Later" - what's next?! Teddy might have provided a great foil - version 1 AI interacting with version X - but he was far too knowing for his meager use, and if he were that advanced... Lots of dropped opportunities - Dr. Hobby, the potential army of Davids, all hinted at and left hanging. Sorry to add these mild spoilers - but the internal consistency was so lacking - it was truly like watching a rough cut. I would have given all of Frances O'Connor's artful mugging for more scenes of honest interaction between her and David - maybe it's her single status - but several people have said that anyone who has been a mother would not have let some of those scenes thru.  In summary, this viewed like a rough cut, and I can't imagine that this was ultimately directed by Spielberg and not some assistants. Tone was all over the place - in contrast to most of his work - from Duel thru ET thru anything else... hardly his best work, but deserving of so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Encounter of A different Kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a great fan of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, I've waited in anticipation for this post-Kubrick event. Will it show machine finally surrender human life? Surely, the movie elaborates around this issue, but as in a true science fiction movie, it doesn't give you any straight answers. As for Kubrick, there are scenes and elements that can be associated with 2001, but the one movie that strikes me is Spielberg's "Close Encounter of The Third Kind." And in the end, I am left with the feeling that this is a Spielberg production, but with Kubrick's spirit present.In an overall perspective, this could have been three short movies with all different endings. It borrows themes and elements from Star Wars, (orphanage-parents theme) fantasy movies (The Wizard of Oz) fairy tales and Spielberg's earlier sf-productions (E.T., Close Encounter) The first part is very promising, with a typical science fiction setting, where the facinating but cold, and sometimes disturbing vision associated with Kubricks movies, is present. Here Haley Joel Osmont (as David the robot) shows his emotional register, which doesn't change much after the first part. Frances O'Connor (Davids mother) is left with a conflict between her feelings and her distance that could have been explored more in debth. She is after all, the only human who is truly attached to David. The second part seems to me to be too "compromised" both in content and length between the first and the third. The scenes are changing rapidly, as the movie changes from science fiction (with Jude Law as an excellent gigolo robot by the way) to that of a fairy tale.In the third and shortest part, which is the strongest part, we're again back to the science fiction setting. But here, both the audience and the characters have changed their view upon what appears to be real and what appears to be fantasy. In the end, we're no longer sure, but as in any Spielberg movie, we feel sympathy for the "child" David and his too-much-longing for his mother. Kubrick of course would have made a different ending, leaving the sometimes overwhelming emotionally scenes behind; but then again, he would also have created a different David, and a different development in the story.In the end, I am left with the question: Is A.I. showing technology surviving human life, or is it showing human life master technology to the point where technology becomes more human than human itself? I think both Kubrick and Spielberg were fascinated by this dilemma, and in the most masterful scenes in A.I., I discovered an encounter of Kubrick's spirit and Spielberg's vision. It is not a close encounter, but that of a different kind. As a result, it is something you have never seen before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Haley Joel Osment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw A.I. on the Fourth of July. How appropriate that Steen Spielberg's darkest and most depressing film since "Schindler's List" would have its biggest weekend on a national holiday.A.I. works on a number of levels, and fails a number of others. At its core is a reworking of Pinocchio's fairy tale quest to become a real boy, around which are layered a "lover" robot's adventures on the lam when he is framed for a murder, a passionate scientist (William Hurt) who creates the robot David (Haley Joel Osment), the unsuspecting family that is chosen for David's first home, and finally the world at large.It is first and foremost a dark and depressing world. In much the same premise as "Waterworld", the oceans have risen and drowned most the Earth's coastline, including New York City. The surviving humans have strict rules against reproducing too excessively and depend on intelligent robots, or "Mechas" (a term borrowed from Anime), to do most of their work for them. Naturally, the human capacities for both creative genius and monstrous destruction are spotlighted here, in the "Flesh Fair" sequence halfway through and in "Hobby's Laboratory" later on in the film.In addition to this, a dark and depressing pall is cast over the entire fate of the human race. It is quite clear from the opening sequences, which are very choppy, that humans are rapidly progressing to their own destruction. This dark foreboding is one of the levels on which the film works. As David travels through a world not unlike that of "Blade Runner", he encounters humans at their most monstrous tendencies and befriends the wonderfully ironic Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a role for which Law is perfectly suited. Joe is a "lover Mecha" who is programmed to be the superior gigolo, thus making human version of such obsolete. His jaunty ways and tendency to dance around at a moment's notice are both artificial, and yet better than real.This summary manages to encompass only the first half or so of the film. To go further would be to ruin the final (long) sequences that take place first in the partially submerged ruins of Manhattan Island and later some 2,000 years in the future. I will only say that the final sequences are very long and excessively drawn out and could have benefited from a faster pacing. The ending is a complete letdown, leaving virtually every question posed by the final "2,000 years in the future" sequence unanswered.The core of the film is a dark, depressing certainty that humans are on the way to their destruction. They have no chance to survive, make their time. This core is exemplified in David's ironic and quixotic quest to find the Blue Fairy so he can become real. (Read, or watch, Pinocchio again to remember what's going on.) This sort of thing is almost a director's trademark of the late Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick is virtually incapable of making a happy film, and A.I. is no exception to that rule. Director Steven Spielberg wrote A.I.'s screenplay and filmed it based mostly on notes and storyboard Kubrick left behind when he passed on, and the result is unmistakably Kubrickian in both the irony and the depression.What is more dark and depressing is how impossible it is to care about any of the characters in the film. Whether they be human, like David's uncomfortable parents or his cruel human brother Martin, or robot, like the perpetually happy yet cynical Joe, no character in the film reaches out for the audience to actually give a crap whether they live or die. When Joe nearly escapes death not one, not twice, but three times the audience feels nary a twinge. When David, who is masterfully played by Osment, is crying out for his mom, we feel no sympathy for his dilemma. And why not? After all, as the preview tagline notes, "His love is real, but he is not."In the end, the film is both visionary and unsatisfying. It evokes much the same emotion as "2001: A Space Odyssey" combined with "A Clockwork Orange"; it is both grindingly boring yet superbly staged, it is both horrible and wonderful in the same instant, it is ironic and cynical, and sometimes it is funny. A.I. has been characterized as a dark fable, when in fact it is nothing of the sort. Rather, it is a "real" Grimm's fairy tale. Grimm's original fairy tales were both brutal and depressing, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to the sanitized Disney versions most people are used to. In that vein, A.I. is a genuine fairy tale, sad and dark, portending of doom, and frankly, about as fun as a root canal to watch.Steven Spielberg did an excellent job of evoking his friend Stanley Kubrick. The film bear's Kubrick's unmistakable stamp, and the cinematography is first rate, using all kinds of reflected images in mirrors, light effects of motion and images repeated infinitely in glass doors, and the eerie lights of flashlights. The film itself is visually arresting. It's too bad that what's being filmed is so depressing and exhausting to watch. A.I. is the kind of film where after you leave the theater and are driving home you just want to ram your car into a tree and end it. That's how dark and depressing it really is. And in the end, though the end sequence attempts to catapult the film from fairy tale to cautionary tale, it does little more than drag the film out and try to set up and ending that makes us cry. Too bad we are not at all emotionally invested in David, even at the end.Rating: * * 1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another Spielbergian example of great special effects but a horrible plot. Had the movie ended with David jumping into the water, it would have been complete. Depressing, but complete. Because I think the point of the film was that the robot child turned out to be more loving and devoted than the humans, which is a profound idea. Instead of ending it there, though, the filmmakers spent way too much time pounding the audience with the message that David was sad, and then finished with one of the cheesiest "happy" endings I've ever seen on film. Ugh. I can suspend my disbelief far enough to handle loving robots, but not far enough for an omnipotent alien race that could bring humans back to life -- for only one day! Give me a break. Plus, they gave David the capacity to reason but not enough sense to realize that the mother didn't deserve his devotion. I also felt that there were too many unnecessary random subplots - like the whole Flesh Fair part, and the Dr. Know part. There were other more interesting ways they could have bonded David with Joe.So what did I like about it? The acting was really good, especially Osment and Law. The effects were obviously good. It was visually very interesting. Gigolo Joe was an interesting character, and gave the audience a break from feeling sad for David. My favorite thing of all was Teddy, the robotic bear toy that used obsolete technology (according to one of the characters) but was still way more loving and devoted than any of the humans. So I guess the message in all of this is "humans suck." Especially the humans that made the movie...</fullReview>

It is a patchwork of hackneyed characters, dull simple hole-ridden plot, boring special effects, one-dimensional characters, and wasted acting talent in the case of Haley Joel Osment.It is excruciatingly slow, long, repetitive, derivative (think Star Trek Next Generation, Wizard of Oz and Spielberg's own E.T. for starters.), and pointless.The ending is a tacked-on, absolutely ridiculous, let's make sure to have a kinda happy ending, exercise in futility.I can't recommend anything about this film. And even if you still want to see it, by all means DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN. It is too dark and relentlessly depressing for them. They will have nightmares.To those who claim that people who didn't like the movie just don't like movies that make you think, well that's hogwash. I did plenty of thinking throughout this slo-mo.

		<fullReview>Welcome to a future which is so far-out, so mind-boggling and so forward that husbands go to work for large corporations and wives stay home and do the laundry.Welcome to New York where noble skyscrapers are submerged 3/4s of the way due to the melting polar ice caps, yet people work there and the electricity is on.Welcome to the high-tech realm of tomorrow where computer robots can be programmed but not de-programmed.Such factors made it impossible for me to 'suspend disbelief' and care about the plight of little David the Mecha robot. Still, the first half of the movie ?- which stays in the human realm ?- is effective. The second half of the movie is a brain-dead hodgepodge of standard futuristic images and ideas, however well executed. More skinny aliens: just what we need.But the core of the movie is nonsense. The robot is supposedly designed as a substitute son who will love his 'parents' unconditionally ? yet David is programmed to love only one parent, his mother. Right off the bat, he doesn't do what he is designed to do! The rest of the movie hinges on this wobbly foundation. And the Pinocchio connection ?- like the puppet, David wants to be a real boy -- is interesting up to a point, but, dear lord, instead of functioning as a nice association one can mull over, it is all but smeared in the viewer's face when the Pinocchio story becomes central and the Blue Fairy a literal reference point.And, oh yes, if they are going to quote the poet Yeats, can't they get it right?Spielberg fell into the trap of special-effects overproduction and overwriting when really, at core, this is a simple story that ought to have been simply told. Kubrik would have strangled it too. The story needed a director with a light touch, Sayles maybe, or Ang Lee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar Material...a cinematic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!I went into A.I. not knowing quite what to expect. I had already read the short-story the film was based on and had heard there was controversy about the movie's ending, and I've recently watched several otherwise good films where the ending killed it. This film was simply astounding from beginning to end. Spielburg seemed to have his usual trademarks of cranking up the emotions toned WAY down, and many scenes that could have been overdone were much more subtle. Subtlety is something that one rarely finds in films these days. A.I. takes the viewer on a horrific yet fantastic ride that starts off very Spielburgian and ends up in the bizarre realm of Stanley Kubrick, making the transition very seamlessly. Since this film's story is pretty well-known, I won't waste time by telling it again. But the ending that is causing so much controversy left me in awe of how far I'd come since the beginning of the film. People insist that the movie is asking questions that it can't answer, but that's the point-the answers must lie within ourselves, not the film. Also, some say that it should have ended with David praying to the Blue Fairy and getting no answer. That would have been a cop-out, though, and indeed, it almost seemed as though it WAS going to end there. This would have wrecked the film! There'd have been nothing worth ending with then. However, David's final existence and the fate of the humans 2000 years later seems very Kubrickian. I found that I could keep at least a slight grasp of what was going on, but I believe that because of the territory this film covers, one viewing isn't enough. I'll be watching it again when it comes out on DVD (watching a DVD is much cheaper than paying for another movie ticket). Haley Joel Osment deserves an Oscar for his performance. He is a very talented young actor who carries the entire weight of the film on his shoulders and does so with the skill of actors several times his age. I hope that he does even more wonderful movies as he grows older.</fullReview>

I never did figure out why spinach brought the android to a grinding halt, but hours at the bottom of the swimming pool left it unaffected. I will just have to break out the electrical engineering books on that one. So what did the movie say? Unrequited or unacknowledged love can last for thousands of years if you are a robot? We all want to be rescued from loneliness by the blue fairy? Poor Osment had to pine for two thousand years; the average abused child learns hatred in less time than it took to make AI. In some ways, it wasn't a very smart robot. Life is a solitary phenomenon no matter how we try to share it with others, even as that sharing is all there is in the end. I liked the idea that it isn't very nice to blow up robots in an arena sporting event. If we can get professional "wrestling" to treat humans like humans, and we can gets humans to treat animals with dignity, can we be too far from treating the toaster (or a robot) with a little respect? Maybe we can start with opening car doors carefully in parking lots and saving some poor Taurus a few dents.</fullReview>

Whatever you do, don't take a child. This film would scare the bejesus out of a kid. In fact, it's hard to decide who the audience is supposed to be. Certainly not children. Not teenagers.

		<fullReview>Going into this movie, I had heard all the hype, seen all the TV spots, but I not read any reviews. Thankfully so. If I had, I might of turned away. But I took the movie for what it was worth. It was a deep, complex, engrossing and all in all beautiful re-telling of Pinocchio, with Kubrickian coldness and Spielbergian warmth. The blending of these two talents creates a wildly uneven atmosphere, but one that we can see in society today, and one that is just a ball to watch. Each act of the movie has a different feel. The first being warm, the second, cold and depressing, while the third offers some thoughtful questions on our own existence. The seperation of these acts is so important, because each offers new insight, and new understanding, and the over all feeling of each makes the journey so much more poignant, because it is through the eyes of David, the boy robot so marvelously portrayed by Haley Joel Osment. We feel what he feels, and we see what he sees, and it make the end all the more worth it. While, at first glance, one make think that the last 20 minutes of this movie were over long and a waste, one must look at the source of this movie, Stanley Kubrick. He himself wanted the very ending Spielberg chose. So for all those Kubrick purists, this movie was all Kubrick. The ending itself is so beautiful, that one must be patient to understand its deeper meanings. In my opinion, I found the ending to be so enchanting and wonderful. Patience will help you get through it. Jude Law is once again excellent as Gigolo Joe, the guide on Davids journey. His one dimensional approach as a "love mecha" is just another example of the cold environment created where robots, like Joe, only know one thing: How to have sex with woman, how to get woman, and where to find woman, basically. Frances O'Connor pulls out an emotional performance as David's "mother" of sorts. She portrays so much confused emotion, that its hard not to cry at her lowest times. With so many nods to the great one himself, Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg directs this movie with so much heart and in so much reverence to Kubrick. Its obvious the apprentice has made the master proud. Don't write off this movie because of its odd approach and hard to sit through ending. After you sit and think about the ending, all will make sense. Its one to ponder, to talk about, to just look at in awe. Great filmmaking is hard to come by these days, but Spielberg proves that even he hasn't lost his touch. Don't miss A.I., or you'll regret it, for it will become a classic years to come. I give this movie a 10/10. Brilliant, marvelous and just a good time all around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people i know couldnt stand this movie. But most people liked it. I thought it was very well made. It had good acting, great cinematography and special effects, and it was a great fantasy to me. Most people in the world are to close minded when it comes to movies. If they see something they dont expect or somthing extremely different, it makes it a bad movie. AI gives u a glimpse of what humans are capable of. Its kind of scary in a way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating and compelling - must see it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this on the opening weekend at the Mann's Chinese Theatre - great audience and a great atmosphere made this very exciting - certainly not your usual Spielberg movie - but his magical style shines through frequently, combining with a homage to the work of Kubrick. The movie's fairly gripping, scary and funny and Haley Joel Osment is unbelievable - simply amazing - an Oscar nomination must be guaranteed, and I hope Spielberg's humorous and compelling script is also nominated. John Williams creates the perfect score for this film and the ending is certainly no let down, although inevitably sentimental. There was so much in this movie and I know I'll enjoy it just as much a second or even third time. Within a summer of absolute crap, this stands out so high above everything else this year and even last year. It reminds me very much of the magic of Close Encounters, but it certainly isn't the landmark movie that Close Encounters was. What it does is guarantee that Spielberg's masterful and magical touch will appear again and again throughout the next two decades and that his films will live on in history longer than David does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg, you're fired (spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another Spielbergian example of great special effects but a horrible plot. Had the movie ended with David jumping into the water, it would have been complete. Depressing, but complete. Because I think the point of the film was that the robot child turned out to be more loving and devoted than the humans, which is a profound idea. Instead of ending it there, though, the filmmakers spent way too much time pounding the audience with the message that David was sad, and then finished with one of the cheesiest "happy" endings I've ever seen on film. Ugh. I can suspend my disbelief far enough to handle loving robots, but not far enough for an omnipotent alien race that could bring humans back to life -- for only one day! Give me a break. Plus, they gave David the capacity to reason but not enough sense to realize that the mother didn't deserve his devotion. I also felt that there were too many unnecessary random subplots - like the whole Flesh Fair part, and the Dr. Know part. There were other more interesting ways they could have bonded David with Joe.So what did I like about it? The acting was really good, especially Osment and Law. The effects were obviously good. It was visually very interesting. Gigolo Joe was an interesting character, and gave the audience a break from feeling sad for David. My favorite thing of all was Teddy, the robotic bear toy that used obsolete technology (according to one of the characters) but was still way more loving and devoted than any of the humans. So I guess the message in all of this is "humans suck." Especially the humans that made the movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. -- WELCOME TO THE DARK SIDE, MR. SPIELBERG.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILERS!) A masterpiece, pure and simple. From New York to Chicago to LA, reviews for this film have been schizoid, shallow, sophomoric at best. A.I., the darkest Sci-Fi film of all time, is about one thing, and one thing only: The planet itself has decreed the extinction of the human race; and Mother Nature gets what she wants. Spielberg never, ever veers off course in his brilliant script. Directorial execution, likewise, is flawless. The episodic structure of A.I. is a metaphor for EVOLUTION, cruel, omnipotent, forceful. It goes where it must. "Metaphor" is the key to analysis of A.I. Every character, every setting represents layer upon layer of meaning. Mommy rejecting David is EARTH rejecting our "electronic" selves (the ying/yang out of balance, etc.). Daddy -- MAN -- who can no longer protect his children (from our electronic selves?). The very meaning of childhood is perverted -- Martin is awakened from a coma, despite his atrophied legs, to satisfy perverse, unsatisfiable, parental needs. Can David, a creature who doesn't need food, who lies there quietly, but never sleeps, who never really "depends" on anything, really answer the call of grieving parents? Everything is out of balance. Gigolo Joe and Rouge City are obvious stand-ins for EROTICISM, the new religion. Destroying rogue "mechas" is the new blood sport; the puny human way of declaring superiority to . . . what? Circuitry? Other metaphors abound: Professor Hobby (William Hurt. The actor awakes at last!)-- represents our intellectual selves completely removed from spirit. Even the ocean in A.I. has meaning(s) -- particularly, amniotic fluid -- the planet must give birth to something BETTER than human. David, trapped for 2,000 years under water, "excavated" by evolved machines, still searching for Mommy's approval (Well, our inner children know what that means). Lastly, the ending -- a tautological equation loop -- the creatures (evolved mechas, including David) are caught in an endless effort trying to answer the unanswerable -- "Where did we come from? Who created us? Is there a meaning?" The mechas will be no more successful in their search than were the living, from whom they descended. How long will the planet put up with "THEM"? I was gasping at the hopelessness, the darkness, the hugeness of that statement. Beneath the Blue Fairy's seeming benevolence lurks Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Kubrick, angry, godlike, visionary, and . . . true?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. Should Make Us Stop &amp; Smell Our Stupidity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to try to read all of the reviews before I made mine so that maybe I wouldn't repeat something that had already been eloquently put. But after about 100 messages, my eyes got tired and I got sick of reading comments I think are false. So if I repeat something that's already been said I apologize ahead of time. Also, I'll try to make this short and sweet to save your eyes, but sometimes if I get passionate about what I write about, I get carried away - so bear with me.Also, you probly shouldn't read this if you haven't seen the movie and would like to.For those of you who think that A.I. didn't have a message - I think you must have been in the theater next to me seeing Scary Movie II.Yes, as human beings we have made wonderful advances in technology and science - BUT the stupid part of us is that we do these things without taking the time to consider the moral implications to our society. Take cloning for example - the technology is already here but now we're arguing over how it should be used and even whether or not it should be used. This movie takes artificial intelligence - something that is still in its infancy today - and allows us to take a glimpse into the future and see what could happen if we don't think about our actions before we take them. Our society today is so enamored with the "quick fix." We have so little patience.In the movie, Professor Hobby wants to create a child mecha who can love its parents because, he believes there's a market for it. Once again the quick fix. He mentions the market of childless couples waiting for a lisence - so why not make them a robot, capable of love, that can fill the void in their lives. Only he doesn't consider the implications - so many people in this future world hate mechas and the child could be teased mercilously, as David is. And by making him a robot with emotions, these things hurt him. The professor considers the feelings of the parents who want a child to love but he doesn't consider the feelings of the child robot. Parents may in time decide that because the child robot is only that, a robot, they can discard it, forgetting that it too can feel. I'm reminded of the plethera of teen mothers today who have children because they don't feel loved and want the unconditional love of a baby. They don't consider the work that goes into taking care of that baby and the child suffers because the teen wanted a quick fix.The movie deals with other quick fixes in much more subtle ways. Rouge City and creating robots to perform sexual tasks. Here we have the quick fix of sex but without the worries of the usual consequances such as STDs or pregnancy!Back to the issue of having no patiance - many humans are afraid of what they don't understand and have little patience in trying to learn to understand it. So, the quick fix is to destroy what is not understood. We humans are famous for doing this all throughout history in our many instances of prejudice against people unlike ourselves. I see the "Flesh Fairs" in the movie as a paralell to Roman times when Christians were thrown in with the lions to be eaten. It is in this way that the movie makes us think about how history does repeat itself and that we need to educate people before moving onward so that this doesn't happen. I get the feeling that in this future time when robots were starting to be made, they were again created as quick fixes in the form of factory workers, butlers, maids and nannies as many of the robots to be destryed at the Flesh Fair illustrate. I imagine that these robots were created and immediately sold for a profit without taking the time to educate people about them.Yes there are blatant, in-your-face issues brought out in this movie such as what is love? and how far should we take ai? BUT I think the movie has some other very subtle messages and questions that are quite important that many people miss. In some reviews I've read on here, people breifly mention that in this movie the ice caps have melted as a result of global warming and, as a result, NYC and others have been submerged under water. Whoa there! This is a HUGE issue - and one I see of equal importance if not more so, to the topic of AI. Seeing Manhatten under water had a very eery effect on me as I hope it did others. Just as we get a glimpse into the future of technology, we get a glimpse into the future of our planet if we continue to treat it as we do. Again, back to the topic of quick fixes and no patience - people want things that will improve their quality of life now and don't think about how we're screwing things up in the process. People won't recycle or car pool to work, under the guise of "how can one person make a difference" when they really are saying "i'm too lazy to do that." And, although its just speculation of course, look where it gets us! We end up with good portions of land underwater, which cause a greater population of people to be confined to a smaller earth, which in turn makes people have to wait to get a license before having a child!Although it takes place in a future that was imagined and created by a film crew, this movie should make people re evaluate today and ask themselves if that's where they want to be someday. Maybe a far off someday, but I definately think everything in the movie, if not worse, is possible to happen. This takes us to the issue of the movie being depressing and dark and a movie not for children. Bingo! Life isn't always happiness and flowers - if the movie had ended with David being reunited with a very apologetic and loving family, it could be discarded as another Hollywood movie that allowed us to escape reality for awhile. Instead AI encourages you to say "hey, you know, I didn't like the outcome of that movie - maybe i should think about what i'm doing now, and what the human race is doing now, and consider the long term consequences." Even if the negative events in the movie don't happen in a not so far off or a far off future - we still are making drastic mistakes as a human race and we need to stop ourselves and think about what we're doing.The acting in the movie was excellent - overall I really enjoyed it. As an aside - does anyone know which mecha Meryl Streep did the voice for? Its been bothering me since I saw her name in the credits. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to go see A.I. with promise in my heart. I thought, "Well, it is a Hollywood blockbuster production; however, one of my favorite filmmakers (Stanley Kubrick) has been working on this film for years, and Spielberg does have an upside to his resume (a very large downside, too...)." So I was excited to see it, if only to find out what the collaborative efforts of Kubrick and Spielberg could accomplish. The answer? Total Hollywood crud. The visual effects in this movie are no less than stunning, I must give credit where it is due. And the middle section of the film, during the Flesh Fair and about 20 minutes on either side of it, is very, very good, and after an excruciatingly slow and overly dramatic start, I thought the movie would pick up from there. I was wrong. The last about third of the movie, where young David journeys to the remnants of New York to find the Blue Fairy (come on!) and after, was just bad, horrible, unjustifiably, excruciatingly awful storytelling. And why did this movie HAVE to have a happy-ish ending? If the movie had ended with David stuck in the police helicopter stuck at the bottom of the sea, it would have been much better. I realize that the story parallels that of Pinnochio, but why all the overblown, overt melodrama? This was just a dumb movie almost all the way around, and I can't help but think that if Kubrick himself had finished the picture working outside the confines of a major Hollywood studio, the movie would have been great, if not amazing. The only redeeming quality this movie had for me were the previews of "Ghost World" they showed before it started. Very, very bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar Material...a cinematic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!I went into A.I. not knowing quite what to expect. I had already read the short-story the film was based on and had heard there was controversy about the movie's ending, and I've recently watched several otherwise good films where the ending killed it. This film was simply astounding from beginning to end. Spielburg seemed to have his usual trademarks of cranking up the emotions toned WAY down, and many scenes that could have been overdone were much more subtle. Subtlety is something that one rarely finds in films these days. A.I. takes the viewer on a horrific yet fantastic ride that starts off very Spielburgian and ends up in the bizarre realm of Stanley Kubrick, making the transition very seamlessly. Since this film's story is pretty well-known, I won't waste time by telling it again. But the ending that is causing so much controversy left me in awe of how far I'd come since the beginning of the film. People insist that the movie is asking questions that it can't answer, but that's the point-the answers must lie within ourselves, not the film. Also, some say that it should have ended with David praying to the Blue Fairy and getting no answer. That would have been a cop-out, though, and indeed, it almost seemed as though it WAS going to end there. This would have wrecked the film! There'd have been nothing worth ending with then. However, David's final existence and the fate of the humans 2000 years later seems very Kubrickian. I found that I could keep at least a slight grasp of what was going on, but I believe that because of the territory this film covers, one viewing isn't enough. I'll be watching it again when it comes out on DVD (watching a DVD is much cheaper than paying for another movie ticket). Haley Joel Osment deserves an Oscar for his performance. He is a very talented young actor who carries the entire weight of the film on his shoulders and does so with the skill of actors several times his age. I hope that he does even more wonderful movies as he grows older.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good brew of the best sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe the reason for the low attendance to this movie is the subject matter - call it a backlash or fear of advanced computer technology. That's a shame - people are missing out on a very good film. It's also ironic, because the Flesh Fair in the movie is comprised of an audience who are also technophobes, determined to wipe out all the "mechas" (mechanical beings) because of their ability to dominate the "orgas" (organic beings).The story is somewhat of a sci-fi version of Pinocchio. A mecha boy, David, goes on a journey to find someone who can turn him into a real boy.The film's got the influence of Stanley Kubrick thrown in (scenes in the Manhattan offices of Dr. Hobby will remind you of the end of 2001 Space Odyssey) and even a reminder of the final scene of the original Planet of the Apes, with the Statue of Liberty partially submerged. Remember, the planet underwent a catastrophic global warming, so the coastal cities are underwater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will this Ai boy be loved? I dont care enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERThere were many problems with this movie.The main problem is with the main character David.What does he want? He wants the love of his mother.Ok, but the reason i dont care if he gets this love is because they never show David having any good times with his mother so why would he want her love so badly. He acts more like a battered child than anything. All they show is her `putting up' with him and trying to convince herself that he doesnt know any better. In other words she tolerates him. She doesnt read to him, she leaves him at the bottom of the pool, and she leaves him in the forest alone! I know, I know she was saving him from being destroyed by the lab, but still. So im thinking he's better off with his own mecha kind.A few other things that bugged were the visuals, and the Kubrick-Speilberg thing.The visuals were stunning, no doubt. However, the visuals must be consistent. That futuristic car was fantastic, but why are flesh farm guys driving antiquated dirt bikes with wolf masks on them? Doesnt match up. And they said how the tidal wave storm sank the great cities; New York was this half-sunken end of the world. But they lived in New Jersey? Manhatten is not that big and New Jersey is too close to manhatten for this to be believable-what a puny storm. One last thing. I read were some guy wrote that it showed Kubricks genius that he chose Spielberg to finish his project. C'mon!(with all due respect to Mr. Kubrick) Kubrick: Whos that guy that did that film? You probably didnt see it. The thing with the dinosaurs? Studio Exec: Barney? Kubrick: No. Studio Exec: Walking with Dinosaurs? Kubrick: No. Studio Exec: Jurassic Park? Kubrick: That's it. That guy is pretty good. Lets get him. Studio Exec: I dont know. Your going to need somebody who tells a great story with visuals. Kubrick: I know, I know. I just have a feeling in my gut with this guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I haven't cried this hard watching a movie since "Titanic".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't really enjoyed Spielberg's output since "E.T.", really. I liked "The Goonies" for its mindless fun, but everything else just got more and more snores from me. I was beginning to think that "E.T." was some sort of a fluke.But with this film, Spielberg had a fantastic writer to work in collaberation with: the talented Stanley Kubrick. And I never would have guessed that he of all people could produce a story to move me so deeply.This isn't really science fiction so much as it is a hi-tech fairy tale (like "Star Wars"). Put all expectations for logic and the like out to pasture and expect the innocence of a traditional children's story in terms of the storytelling and you'll be swept away by it.I was constantly wiping my eyes and blowing my nose throughout this film. It's true that the main character is a machine, but (as old stiffs like Roger Ebert can't get, as is proven by his own essay on this piece) the point here is that this is a machine that really CAN feel. And that machine, David, is used as a metaphor for so many things that are important to us as human beings that we don't get to enjoy or think about very much most of the time due to hectic everyday life. He's a reminder of the things that really are the most precious and priceless.I'm not going to take a chance of spoiling a bit of this film by describing it any further. I'll just say that it is easily a heartbreakingly beautiful film. It also has a score which is even prettier than "E.T."'s, sounding almost like a more deeply realized version of it. For pete's sake, just listening to the SCORE makes me cry (I bought it the second I got out of the theater).It's also touching, in a way, to see this film because it gives the impression that Spielberg has come full circle. Here we are, twenty years after "E.T." and we have another classic in its genre.Easily the best motion picture I've seen so far this year, I highly recommend it to anyone with a heart and an imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aliens or mechas?For those who espouse the idea that the new characters at theend of the movie are "evolved mechas" (an intriguing idea until youconsider it closely), let me just ask, how could a mecha possiblyevolve?They cannot reproduce. There is no genetic selection. Nor canthey create beings more sentient than they themselves are.So whatever they may be, I cannot accept the idea of the "evolvedmecha". Even though it does seem more palatable than throwingin some aliens as the ultimate deus ex machina.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie shows Spielberg is only human</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Steven Spielberg's latest movie, A.I., his opus to the late Stanley Kubrick, he shows to his audience that he is only human and can make mistakes too. A.I. was built around a great idea. A robots search to become a real boy is a fantastic idea for a movie. However, the actual story turns out to be far less than par.The biggest news when A.I. was first introduced last year was that one of the greatest directors of our time was behind the helm. Who else but Steven Spielberg could tell the story about a robot's journey to find love. Unfortunately not even Spielberg could wave his magic wand and turn this movie into a real blockbuster. Continuity was the greatest flaw in this film. The story itself jumps from one spectrum to a completely opposite one. The only true character development comes from David, the eleven year or mecha. Every character in his journey seem unimportant and are undeveloped. Even David's maker, whom we are introduced to in the first fifteen minutes, makes only a five minute cameo with David towards the end of the film.I was told that Spielberg changed the ending of the movie because it was too sad. It is easy to see where the old ending ended and the new ending began. The last third of the movie was painful to watch. It was as if Spielberg couldn't find a way to wrap up the movie and in the end had to resort to pulling the plug all at once. This was the first time it ever seemed like Steven Spielberg had struggled to make a film work. It was that disappointment which made A.I. an unbearable film. A recommendation for Spielberg next time. Stick with your own great way of telling stories and don't try to mimic other directors visions.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielburg: The prince of sentimentality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people know that this film was originally the brain child of Stanley Kubrick whose directorial style is worlds apart from Steven Spielburg.This material really required a full fledged film director. The problem is that Spielburg doesn't direct films. He directs spectacles that are filled with gimmicks designed to evoke specific responses from the audience. This film tries desperately not to follow suit, but Spielburg clubbed into a sentimental happy ending in the last 20 minutes thus totally invalidating the over all story. His total lack of subtlety is also quite appalling. If the audience wasn't sure whether or not to feel a certain way, the narration was there to helpfully tell us exactly how we were meant to feel: Sad, angry, laughing, warm and fuzzy and seized with the urge to hug a little child...etc.Spielburg doesn't trust his audience. That is why he seems to find it necessary to force them to accept his contrived happy endings which are so unbelievably sugary one feels the need to go get an insulin shot after seeing the film.The fact that people actually think this ringmaster of pyrotechnical sentimentality is a brilliant film maker frankly bothers me because it shows yet again how Hollywood marketing has affected the expectations of people.This wouldn't bother me SO much were it not for the fact that had this film been handled by Kubrick, it would have been a brilliant work of art instead of a passable film that should have ended twenty minutes before it's idiotic ending. I found the ending frankly insulting to my aesthetic sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely one of Spielberg's best. Simply beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: MAY CONTAIN MILD SPOILERSI saw this film on July 4th, and I loved it. It beats Close Encounters and E.T. in the sci-fi aspect. It is right up there with the Indiana Jones movies in quality. The acting is tops, and so is the special effects. I've learned to expect the best from Steven Spielberg and he hasn't let me down on this one. I found the story to be very emotional, as the film was beautifully done. (I left the theater in tears, but that's just me :)). This is definitely one of Spielberg's best, I'd highly recommend this movie. If you are the emotional type, bring tissues! While the first 2 hours rocked, the last 30 minutes were somewhat disappointing. I felt there were other ways to end it, rather than introducing the alien aspect, but hey, it's Spielberg!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating and compelling - must see it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this on the opening weekend at the Mann's Chinese Theatre - great audience and a great atmosphere made this very exciting - certainly not your usual Spielberg movie - but his magical style shines through frequently, combining with a homage to the work of Kubrick. The movie's fairly gripping, scary and funny and Haley Joel Osment is unbelievable - simply amazing - an Oscar nomination must be guaranteed, and I hope Spielberg's humorous and compelling script is also nominated. John Williams creates the perfect score for this film and the ending is certainly no let down, although inevitably sentimental. There was so much in this movie and I know I'll enjoy it just as much a second or even third time. Within a summer of absolute crap, this stands out so high above everything else this year and even last year. It reminds me very much of the magic of Close Encounters, but it certainly isn't the landmark movie that Close Encounters was. What it does is guarantee that Spielberg's masterful and magical touch will appear again and again throughout the next two decades and that his films will live on in history longer than David does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blue Fairy !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of those movies that I was itching to see, but did not expect much of it. Not because of it's director or because it was based on the ideas of a creative genius. I just think it had too many attachments to others stories and information coming from two different ends of the world. When I first heard of this movie and it's basic plot, I thought it sounded like another movie I saw over 15 years ago. That was a movie called D.A.R.Y.L. where a boy was found by a family and loved, but he had no memory of his former life. Why? He wasn't a real boy. By no means does that movie compare to the Blockbuster version of A.I., it still makes me recall its similar themes. Oh and we can't forget the references throughout the movie to Pinocchio. Where would this story be without the part of this Disney classic? Don't get me wrong ... I love what Spielberg does with movies and I know Kubrick is a genius in his story telling abilities, but they are two different people with way different angles in movies. I do believe that if Kubrick was still alive he would have done his 'real' version which would have been darker and creepier. It probably would have been loved by a different type of audience. I wish I could find Kubrick's written version of this because of how different it would have been. I know that Spielberg was his friend and that's why he knew of this. Although Spielberg had a task that was a hard accomplishment indeed. He had to bring another creator's vision to the big screen. That's not an easy task in general, but especially when that creator is no longer alive and the two of you have completely different styles. Did he do it justice? He did create a great Spielberg movie, but that's exactly what it was a Spielberg movie that was only based on a Kubrick idea. That's why there is such a problem. It totally looks like a children's movie. I bet parents saw a similarity in E.T. and A.I. I don't mean those movies were alike, but they looked like they were for children, but there were some great parts that begged to differ. My opinion is strong ... this was NOT meant for children. You should really take the "PG-13" rating as a high sign. This was a movie that was worth seeing. I don't think it is what people would expect. Just be your own judge. I use this forum as a way to get things out of my head, but I am not trying to urge you to see a movie or persuade you to not see one. I have to end with saying, I was glad I saw this movie and I would give it a 7 out 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pinocchio meets Bicentennial Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...among others. (some spoilers in this review) The most disappointing aspect of this movie is that it is so unoriginal. While there are some parts of the movie that made me sit up and take notice (most notably the "Flesh Fair" and the great set of NYC), most of it was rehashed bits of other stories. The acting was great, as so many others have said. Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law are excellent. I actually found myself thinking of them, at times, as non-human. Some of the scenes were also eye-catching. My son's favorite was the visit to Dr. Know with it's holographic images. I found the images of the ruins of Manhattan striking. None of that, however, is enough to truly save this film. For a movie that was so long (and the last 1/2 hour is the longest by far) there were many questions that remain unanswered. I cared just enough about the mom and the rest of the family that I would have liked to know what happened to her. No answer to that one. Why did the boy only imprint on Monica, the mother? If a company could make such an impressive robot, why couldn't this child imprint on two parents? And if he could, why did the mother choose to go it alone? How did their child, Martin, suddenly get better? Overall, it was a decent movie, but did not live up to its potential. There were many places this film could have taken us, but rather than climb to new heights, it took the path of least resistance, going where nearly every sci-fi film has gone before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick could have handled this material much better and maybe have averted some of the emptiness of the "Blue Fairy" plot diversion but aside from that, Spielberg has made a great and bold Hollywood movie that will go on to be studied and puzzled over for a long, long time, a feat that Kubrick applied to most of his movies. Jude Law steals the show as kind of a Jiminy Cricket/Tin Man/American Gigolo who guides the robotic David (H.J. Osment) on his quest to become a real boy ( a phrase we hear about a million times during the course of the movie). Thought provoking cinema that should be viewed more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Masterpieces - One of the greatest films of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. stands in a class by itself - it single handedly will define the path of grand film making. It is so gorgeous a creation, it left me breathless. It remains the grandest film to be reported to humanity in our time. Just go see it!!! The message is ultimately spiritual in nature. It is one of love. It is of such a high vision, that Spielberg has created the 2001 of the 21st century and released it in the year 2001.This is absolutely BREAKTHROUGH cinema. An adventure one can never know where it is going. Every scene is a surprise once the story moves out of its first phase. This is the movie that will set the tone for filmmaking in the 21st century. See it at the highest level of consciousness, from your visions, and above all, from your humanity. There is nothing like it.The issue here is the environment, the greenhouse gases that can doom the earth into a global warming and then another ice age. This is the premise of A.I. David is the outcome of our present environmental policies. The Earth is warming, ice caps are starting to melt, seacoast cities will be drowned by rising seas. Spielberg was correct. Holland will go first since most of the country lies below sea level. New York is exactly at sea level. The depictions of seeing Manhattan destroyed are uncannily accurate. It's scary. Robots were the outcome of this story. With hundreds of models by dozens of makers, we see them in the dump, looking for spare parts, all the old models, and recent ones such as Gigolo Joe. Yet there was nothing like David. He was imbued with human affection and love, plus the intelligence to create his own destiny. He was a masterpiece and so was this film. There is nothing of "God" in this film. Everything IS "God". The world and the whole cosmos in all dimensions and time. This encompasses what we call "God:.A.I. addresses these issues that are of great importance to our world and it does so with the greatest of sensitivity. This is a work of profound love and compassion. It is filled with humanity. It took a genius young actor pretending to be a robot under the direction of arguably America's finest living director who is paying homage to America's most influential director, Stanley Kubrick, to convince us that David is indeed a robot who teaches intelligent universal Beings about human love.The alien beings are exquisite creatures and utterly beautiful, formed from the shadows and shapes of the aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind made in 1977, these Beings are majesterial and memorable forever. What this famous director accomplished is a feat of the highest magnitude. We should all be saying to ourselves, Thank God, I have lived long enough to see this masterwork. What an honor and privilege it is to experience a work so great, it can change the lives of those who see it.Spielberg masterfully asks us questions to ponder about the universe and our lives. Think about them. A.I. IS the most important film of our lifetime just as 2001 was a generation ago. The beauty of this film being released in 2001 is synchronistic.To my mind A.I. is a "tour de force" a masterpiece par excellence and one of the greatest films ever made. Why? because it addresses philosophical and metaphysical issues right on with a direct hit. Because it forces viewers to think deeply and ponder the great questions of life. Because it is courageous enough to think far ahead of our time and give us the opportunity to consider the ideas of humanized robots and about the nature of love in this world.If you have any kind of spiritual awareness, take your favorite friend(s) and go see it, prepare to be stunned beyond belief! Thank you Kubrick and Spielberg. You have utterly transformed my life by confirming my greatest hopes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A note about the length</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** warning - spoilers follow ****I'd like to post a response to those who complain about this movie's length and its many endings. It's true that the "A.I." pushes beyond conventional endings to a place that is uncomfortable, creepy, and even hard to understand.But the final twenty minutes are an essential part of the movie, and here's why:Humans have the capacity to love and dream. With those abilities comes the capacity to pursue those things we love, those things we long for. To that end, our mortality is a gift, because it is a natural end to our painful longing. But a sentient robot, a robot who can love, would have no such end. His longing is eternal. Therefore, a robot's pursuit of his dreams would push beyond anything humans could fathom. It would go on for thousands of years, to incredible places. In the last third of "A.I.," Spielberg tries to imagine where a robot's longing would take him, and I salute him for having the audacity and the courage to take that journey.Many of Kubrick's movies pushed the audience to the edge of their willing imagination and beyond. "A.I." is a fitting eulogy to a great film artist.Personally, I would have ended "A.I." with David trapped underwater, staring at the blue fairy for all eternity. But I'm only human. Come to think of it, maybe Spielberg intended this movie for robots: thousands of years from now, when we're all gone, this is the movie the robots will pay to see, and Spielberg will still be making money.Because the only thing that lasts longer than robot longing... is residuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He's not real, nor is his love, neither is this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has some *spoilers* so beware. Where do I begin. The acting is amazing, the effects, stunning, and the cinematography top shelf. The story however ranks up there with the worst episodes of Ray Bradbury Theatre. Flawed from the get go, our lil boy David, the first robot built to actually "love" is very easy to fall in love with. However, 45 minutes later, when we all realize that David is NOT going to develop, he is NOT going to learn, he is NOT going to evolve out of the incredibly annoying, very babyish child that he was created to be. This seems to be the pattern with most 'Mechas' (the very Bradburian term given to AI's). David is as dependent and as primitive as the day he is activated. Never once does he come to seperate fiction from fact, or fairy tale from fact. DAMN IT CHILD THE BLUE FAIRY ISN'T REAL. He shows some learning and mimicking skills, but he never LEARNS...something the most primitive AI can do TODAY. If David were a real boy, he'd be a learning disabled one. The idea of David is flawed in it's own right. To create a child that never evolves, that never grows that never becomes anything but the same dependent drain is pointless.(Unless you are a pedophile or some other sicko, a possibility the film should have at LEAST touched on, seeing how the corporation was going to be, in essence, selling children.) Part of the joy of being a parent is watching your child grow into what he/she will eventually be. A child that never grows up voids this concept. The ending, oy vey, do we even NEED this? But let me say this: David never loved his mother. David's mother never loved him. Let me repeat that: David never loved his mother. David's mother never loved him. What David exhibited towards Monica was NOT love, it was dependence bordering on obsession and psychosis. He was programmed to 'imprint' on the person who pushed that button and read those seven words. He acted within his programming. That is NOT, nor will it ever be, love. Monica, on the other hand treated David like a puppy she hated to put down. She was a bit shaken by abandoning him, but if she loved David, she would have asked him what happened, or played back those vaunted memory banks of his perhaps to see what really happened in the incident with the hell spawn Martin. All of this completely negates the validity of that soft lighted, sugary sappy sweet 'one last day' with his mommy. Oh, and by the time they had clipped that hair from Monica that they used to 'bring her back' (sure its 2000 years in the future but we can't clone...whatever!!) she would have already had memories of Martin and would be wondering where her 'real' son was. Instead she plays with the toy son. The adaptation of the 1966 short story that this was based on was poorly done(2 words Steve...creative license), and the flaws in the plot were just too huge to ignore. Not a bad movie per se, but I could have waited to rent it. Oh yeah, Kubric may be dead, but hes still overrated and he still sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie should be renamed to MI - Mediocre Intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what do you do when you are in over your head in a project and have no idea what to do???? What one does is fall back on what one knows, what one has done before, and what others have done before. One throws together a whole bunch of stuff trying to come up with an end product, hoping it will all come together and coalesce into something greater than the parts. That is what Steven Spielberg has done in AI (Artificial Intelligence), finishing a project started by the late great Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick's movies always had a cold clear intellect behind them. They had points to make and always dissected some aspect of humanity. What better subject to tackle then Artificial Intelligence? Human and robot interaction, computers with human intelligence and emotions??? But in Spielberg's hands, the movie became MI, Mediocre Intelligence. It was evident from the very beginning of the movie that Spielberg and his team did not have the intellectual depth to make this movie. This movie is filled with ideas and scenes from other movies such as Star Wars, Tommy, Close Encounters Of the Third Kind, etc etc. Not only that, the scenes were badly filmed, in a hazy style that did not fit the scene and the movie. The cinematography is mediocre. Adding insult to injury, the music score is by John Williams, and did not fit the movie. The music was so bad and inappropriate I sat there stunned, when I was not wincing from the movie itself. When one hears reviewers extol the special effects in the movie, one knows the movie has nothing else to offer. What surprised me, is that there were very few stunning, new, interesting special effects. The only memorable ones were of a few robots. And Spielberg made sure you noticed them by showing the same effect over and over and over again. So what does the movie AI boil done to??? What was the main focus of the movie???? It's a young boys search for his mother's love?.granted the young boy is a robot, but the movie still boils down to that same old schmaltz?.Mommy, Mommy, I love You!!!! Please love me!!! Where are you???? So what can I praise in this movie? Only the acting of Haley and Jude Law. They did the best they could with the awful script they were given. Haley gives a sustained perfect performance, quite amazing for his age. The last part of the movie where David is trying to find his mother and become a real boy went on and on forever, interrupted now and then with a syrupy voice over reminiscent of a Disney movie. When the movie finally ends, and the credits started rolling, all I could do was hissss when Steven Spielberg's name was shown. There is so much that could have been done on the subject of AI and robot/human interaction. One only has to read the Robot series of novels and stories by Isaac Asimov. Is Steven surrounded by nothing but yes men? Did no one have the guts to tell him he was making a real stinker? I sat there in the theater embarrassed for him. How could he have made such a bad movie, and especially one given to him by Stanley Kubrick?????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that subject kinda speaks for itself. You obviously have to be at a certain level of intellect to enjoy this movie or something. What did you guys expect? This movie was definitely a masterpiece. It had a great plot and the acting was excellent. A.I. was an emotional rollercoaster and I can easily say that it is one of the best movies I've seen. The movie was a little unsettling at times and a little depressing, but the ending made up for it. It's a DIFFERENT kind of movie, and it's really disappointing that there are people out there that can't appreciate it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Masterpieces - One of the greatest films of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. stands in a class by itself - it single handedly will define the path of grand film making. It is so gorgeous a creation, it left me breathless. It remains the grandest film to be reported to humanity in our time. Just go see it!!! The message is ultimately spiritual in nature. It is one of love. It is of such a high vision, that Spielberg has created the 2001 of the 21st century and released it in the year 2001.This is absolutely BREAKTHROUGH cinema. An adventure one can never know where it is going. Every scene is a surprise once the story moves out of its first phase. This is the movie that will set the tone for filmmaking in the 21st century. See it at the highest level of consciousness, from your visions, and above all, from your humanity. There is nothing like it.The issue here is the environment, the greenhouse gases that can doom the earth into a global warming and then another ice age. This is the premise of A.I. David is the outcome of our present environmental policies. The Earth is warming, ice caps are starting to melt, seacoast cities will be drowned by rising seas. Spielberg was correct. Holland will go first since most of the country lies below sea level. New York is exactly at sea level. The depictions of seeing Manhattan destroyed are uncannily accurate. It's scary. Robots were the outcome of this story. With hundreds of models by dozens of makers, we see them in the dump, looking for spare parts, all the old models, and recent ones such as Gigolo Joe. Yet there was nothing like David. He was imbued with human affection and love, plus the intelligence to create his own destiny. He was a masterpiece and so was this film. There is nothing of "God" in this film. Everything IS "God". The world and the whole cosmos in all dimensions and time. This encompasses what we call "God:.A.I. addresses these issues that are of great importance to our world and it does so with the greatest of sensitivity. This is a work of profound love and compassion. It is filled with humanity. It took a genius young actor pretending to be a robot under the direction of arguably America's finest living director who is paying homage to America's most influential director, Stanley Kubrick, to convince us that David is indeed a robot who teaches intelligent universal Beings about human love.The alien beings are exquisite creatures and utterly beautiful, formed from the shadows and shapes of the aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind made in 1977, these Beings are majesterial and memorable forever. What this famous director accomplished is a feat of the highest magnitude. We should all be saying to ourselves, Thank God, I have lived long enough to see this masterwork. What an honor and privilege it is to experience a work so great, it can change the lives of those who see it.Spielberg masterfully asks us questions to ponder about the universe and our lives. Think about them. A.I. IS the most important film of our lifetime just as 2001 was a generation ago. The beauty of this film being released in 2001 is synchronistic.To my mind A.I. is a "tour de force" a masterpiece par excellence and one of the greatest films ever made. Why? because it addresses philosophical and metaphysical issues right on with a direct hit. Because it forces viewers to think deeply and ponder the great questions of life. Because it is courageous enough to think far ahead of our time and give us the opportunity to consider the ideas of humanized robots and about the nature of love in this world.If you have any kind of spiritual awareness, take your favorite friend(s) and go see it, prepare to be stunned beyond belief! Thank you Kubrick and Spielberg. You have utterly transformed my life by confirming my greatest hopes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is like non i have ever seen before. When i first saw the trailor i thought that it wasn't going to be all that good, but i was still going to see it. I am so glad i did. Not only did this have great special and visual effects, but great acting, too. Steven Speilberg is probably the only director that could have brought a movie like this to the big screen. He did such a good job. I think there is a hidden message in this film, too. In the scene where all the real humans are killing the mechas at the "Flesh Fair" David asks "What's going on?" One of the mechas answers "History Repeats itself." I think that this means that there is another nuclear holocaust. The Germans wanted to get rid of one race and the Real humans want to get rid of this race. This was such a good movie and i recomend it to anyone who likes movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Fellini than Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard a lot of negative comments about this film, both in the movie theatre where I watched it and on this site. The problem, I think, is that Spielberg has produced a European-style art film and then launched it into general release with a typical Hollywood media blitz. AI will have a hard time finding its audience. It felt a lot more like Fellini's 8 1/2 or La Dolce Vita than like either 2001 or E.T. This is a careful, intelligent, deeply moving film that will dissapoint those looking for either quick adventure or that warm fuzzy feeling. The major themes seem to be responsibility and love. The story takes place in a future world ruined by global warming. The wealthy characters who make up most of the cast don't seem to care. They have not only ruined the planet, they have turned to machines to fulfill their sexual and emotional needs. They care neither about the planet nor about the machines they have created. That's the responsibility part. Nobody is able to understand David's pure love, which is the way we consistently treat our prophets and messiahs. The central contradiction the film presents is that humans want real love but are ultimately unable to accept or understand it. I didn't find the controversial "epilogue" an epilogue at all. It seemed rather to be the logical conclusion to the whole story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This "train-wreck" of a film had all the potential in the world. Unfortunately Speilberg's vision of humanity crashes head on with the late Stanley Kubricks' isolationist views. A.I. "borrows" from several films; and as a result A.I offers nothing new (save maybe for the odd ending) I've seen parts of this film in others such as: "Bicentennial Man", "Blade Runner", "A Clock Work Orange", "E.T", "Close Encounters", and yes "Pinochio".The film wasn't awful it's just another manipulative tear jerker offering from formulaic Steven Speilberg. If Speilberg uses this formula to force us to cry one more time I just may vomit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrated with Spielberg...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING-----SPOILERS----DO NOT READ THIS POST IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET------------SPOILERS-----WARNINGI am genuinely dismayed at Spielberg's latest ?uvre, A.I.Once upon a time, Steven Spielberg made movie magic: Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the lost Ark, E.T., Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, even his lesser movies like Always and the Color Purple were magnificent examples of his craft.What happened?Well, to be honest with you, A.I. has lots of great stuff in it. The acting by Jude Law and especially Haley Joel Osment is incredible. I mean, if you see the movie, you'll know what I mean when they really do behave like they are limited by their programming.The behaviour of the David character is right-on: Osment reacts only to what he is allowed to react to. He does not have any ulterior motives or hidden agenda, since he is incapable of doing so. Since he does not require sleep or nourishment, he does neither unless prompted or provoked into doing so, just like a machine would.David is a near-perfect emulation of a child: he can play, he can display the usual range of emotions, and he can also provide affection - even profess love. What keeps David from being a perfect boy is that as a robot, he cannot initiate human social behaviour. He can only react and adapt to what he sees and hears. Osment conveys this brilliantly in David's body language, vocabularly, even the way he laughs and attempts to interpret the actions of his family members.Many sociological and ethical questions are raised when the issue of human vs. robot (orgas vs. mecchas) come into play. For instance, a question is asked: what responsibility does a human have for a robot that loves. The movie itself tries not to answer that question, but the obvious answer is: none.David may be programmed to love, but what he is trying to carry on isn't love, it's just a simulation. It is programming, pure and simple. David loves only to fulfill his programming, not because he has genuine feelings for his `mommy'. This is where Spielberg has trouble maintaining this concept and the movie begins to pitch off kilter.After almost 2 hours of a near-perfect movie, he tacks on a useless and disconcerting part to introduce sentimentality and schmaltz, when in fact he should have left the tone unsentimental and cold.You can't suddenly say that David, a robot, is finally a boy, who, even after running the gamut of emotions (the abandonment scene is particularly heartbreaking) never sheds a tear. He can weep, he can display sorrow and joy, but he cannot cry. He cannot physically shed tears.Yet suddenly in this end piece, he can. It just lacks of consistency, much like the flaws with Saving Private Ryan. Great opening, great second act, VERY disappointing coda where the logic and flow of the first 2 hours is replaced by jingoistic pap that has really nothing to do with the movie. It's almost like Spielberg gave up. Looks like he did it in A.I. as well.Throughout the movie we are led to invest emotionally into a robot. Nothing wrong with that concept, because it becomes a compelling allegory of the human condition - awareness, acceptance and belonging. What would have made this movie perfect would be to shatter the illusions that we humans should really care for and love David, who is, after all, only a machine. The pity and empathy we feel for David in the movie is in fact, misplaced, because David can't really reciprocate, because in the end, he is just a machine. It is all simulation - none of it is real.That's what Kubrick would have done. It would have been honest and it would have been logical, and the emotional impact would have certainly been more thought-provoking than manipulative. Instead, Spielberg trots out the old `E.T. formula' and goes for the easy sentimentality for David to get what he wants, namely, to be loved by mommy in return. It jars. It's almost like Spielberg tagged this on to appeal to the 'family' demographic (after all, this movie is rated PG-13). Bad move.Spielberg needs to stop relying and let go of the schmaltz when he's trying to make challenging, artful movies like this. It's truly a shame because had it not been for the outlined flaws I've written in this review, he certainly would have created a true masterpiece that provoked, emotionally and intellectually.It would have likely have been the best movie he'd ever made so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie twice mainly because I was so impressed by Haley, this 13-year-old incredibly talented young actor, and some of the visual wonders in the movie, yet not because of the movie itself in the name of movie. I am always a big fan of Steven Spielberg, yet this time I am kind of being turned off, it might be because I expected too much. However, I still think it could be a masterpiece if they ended the movie at the right place and right time, if they got rid of the narrator, if they cut off those unnecessary explanations, if they..... All in all, I think Mr. Spielberg made a very wise choice to have Haley played David. It is Haley who held the whole movie together by his amazing performance and he is the real magic of this movie.

		<fullReview>Through the first 2 hours of the movie, I was having a good time. The movie had such a good plot, and I was completely into it... ...then suddenly, that changed. The movie WOULD have been the best of the summer (possibly) if they cut off the last 1/2 hour. After the ferris wheel scene, the movie practically went nowhere. It went completely away from the whole point of the movie. I definitely agree with some of these other people--simply, the end wasn't worth it.If they want to make a movie like this "the best of the summer...possibly the year", they need to make an ending that's just as good as the rest of the movie. If not, it's a waste of $5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie on so many levels. I can't believe I hear some bad reviews for a movie like this. In my personal opinion this movie is near perfection. The story engages you and in some scenes can frighten you, but nevertheless this is an excellent movie. I have to admit, the ending wasn't as strong as the begining and middle, but I am not complaining about it. Haley Joel Osment DESERVES a best actor nomination, because his is easily the best performance I have seen this year. He is arguably the best child actor in 20 years, and he lifts this film up with his incredible performance. Steven also deserves another Best Director nomination but I won't forget the other actors in this movie. Jude Law is also terrific in this movie, so is Frances O'Connor. I hope that people will not listen to stupid negative reviews for this movie. I saw this movie about four days ago and still think about it all the time. This is probably the best summer movie since THE SIXTH SENSE. Please Enjoy this movie, its excellent. *****Happy Fourth OF July</fullReview>

Jude Law steals the show as kind of a Jiminy Cricket/Tin Man/American Gigolo who guides the robotic David (H.J. Osment) on his quest to become a real boy ( a phrase we hear about a million times during the course of the movie). Thought provoking cinema that should be viewed more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most wasted sci-fi movie of the year (caution: theme discussed)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected for AI to be a good movie (I mean, Spielberg is a name you associate with other names, like Schindler and Amistad). Combine with a screenplay developed in part by Kubrick, and you get the cover of an impressive movie. But that's all you get. While the effects were impressive, and some parts were especially moving, this alone does not a good movie make.While I won't discuss the plot, the Ending was really what ruined my impression. Up until the resumption of the troublesome and less than subtle off screen narrative, I thought Sp. had a good thing going. Some parts were hairy, but the good outweighed the bad. The ending, to speak plainly, sucked.Besides being hopelessly contrived (and as an s/f fan, I can bend pretty far), the end, in my opinion, sacrificed much of the theme, and indeed Power of the story to create a situation that would appeal to the mass audience. (I am oft of the opinion that directors these days woefully underestimate the movie-going public). Thematically, AI leaves you with the impression that love unconditional will always result in happiness, if given enough time. A message that is idealistic at best, but imho, Kubrick is turning in his grave as we speak. Faced with this capitulation of a conclusion, all the faults of the film come crashing down.Spielberg had the opportunity to create a movie that was both poignant and beautiful, but ended up with a sci-fi flick destined for mediocrity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So what do you do when you are in over your head in a project and have no idea what to do???? What one does is fall back on what one knows, what one has done before, and what others have done before. One throws together a whole bunch of stuff trying to come up with an end product, hoping it will all come together and coalesce into something greater than the parts. That is what Steven Spielberg has done in AI (Artificial Intelligence), finishing a project started by the late great Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick's movies always had a cold clear intellect behind them. They had points to make and always dissected some aspect of humanity. What better subject to tackle then Artificial Intelligence? Human and robot interaction, computers with human intelligence and emotions??? But in Spielberg's hands, the movie became MI, Mediocre Intelligence. It was evident from the very beginning of the movie that Spielberg and his team did not have the intellectual depth to make this movie. This movie is filled with ideas and scenes from other movies such as Star Wars, Tommy, Close Encounters Of the Third Kind, etc etc. Not only that, the scenes were badly filmed, in a hazy style that did not fit the scene and the movie.

		<shortDescription>One of the most depressing films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Some Spoilers) I saw this movie on Monday (July 2) and i regret it. The movie is 2 1/2 hours long but feels more like three for it is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen, it is almost completely joyless and is filled with one scene of emotional pain and scaring after another. The beginning of the movie is way too slow to be enjoyed. This movie is definitely not for kids.In this nightmare, David is "adopted" by one of the employees of thecorporation who created him and by his wife. He, Henry Swinton (Sam Robards) and his wife, Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor II) have a biological son; Martin Swinton (Jake Thomas), who is in a coma.The story of Pinocchio is heavily featured in this movie and likePinocchio, David wants to be a real little boy so his mommy will accept and love him. There are some rough waters to cross when Henry brings David home to meet Monica and she is upset at the thought of David being brought into their home as some substitute for their comatose dying child. But eventually her need for mothering wins out and she activates the program within David that will cause him to feel emotion, to feel love, and to bond to Monica as deeply and powerfully as any child could to his mom -- for the rest of his life. Thus David becomes the first robot to feel on an emotional level, the other robots in the film feel only on a physical level.There is no turning back this love programming. If his "parents"should ever wish to return him no one else could adopt him, he will bedestroyed. Eventually their flesh child makes a recovery and the little brat comeshome. Like the Serpent in the Garden of Eden, Martin tempts David intotaking an action which results in him appearing dangerous. His mothershrugs the event off and trusts him but the father is very waryand distrustful of him. But appearances are misleading and unlike theevil human child, David had no evil intentions in his heart -- heart?Neuro emotichip? Whatever, there was no evil within him.Shortly thereafter another event occurs in which David innocently putsMartin's life in danger. So Henry decides that David must go tothe dumpster like an old broken toy and instead of delivering him to his doom he lays the burden on his wife who has bonded with this child created not of nature but of man.So she drives him to where he was created so he could be destroyed, buton the way to his destruction Monica has a change of heart and releases him into the woods like one would a pet who has become a burden. Accompanying him is a teddy bear robo toy by the name of Teddy (Jack Angel 1st) the cutest thing with fake fur you'll ever see. So there begins David's quest to find the Blue Fairy of Pinocchio so she will turn him into a real boy so his mom will let him back into his home and will love him. LOVE him; as he does her. A deep undying, unchanging love.David soon meets up with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), one of the mostentertaining characters in this film. Gigolo Joe is a...well he's a love machine. He is funny without trying to be. He is flashy, he is roguish, he is ridiculous. I love this character and the way Jude Law played him.Joe and David end up at a "Flesh Fair", where they (along with others) are about to be viciously slaughtered by robot hating humans. Unfortunately for David, they escape and David resumes his quest for the Blue Fairy whom he hopes will make his Pinocchio inspired dream come true.The acting is terrific, from the stars of the film to the actors in thesmaller roles. The furniture, the buildings, the vehicles are all cool and futuristic looking without looking so fantastic as to not be a realistic vision of the near future. I could easily see its Rouge City being a futuristic Las Vegas. I left the theater feeling depressed and really bummed out. For thismovie is dark for the sake of being dark. It has no message exceptmaybe that one should not create beings who love without loving them in the process. Well i admit that is a pretty big message but at the same time it is negated because there is nothing in this movie which says that life is worth living, that love is worth giving, that humanity is worth saving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way too much Spielberg, way too little Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's too bad that the technology wasn't around back when Stanley Kubrick wanted to make this movie, because I can't help but believe that the end results would have been much, much better.A.I. isn't a terrible film, and good thing that it ended when it did because another ten minutes or so and it would have been. There is much here that deserve praise, not John Williams uninteresting music though, what happened to this man? Has he forgotten what wonderful music he used to give us? The good stuff is an excellent performance by Haley Joel Osment, this kid has something going for him; namely talent. There is also some wonderful production design. But alas the bad overshadows the good. For two thirds of the movie we are taken on a wonderful adventure, too bad that David can't tell just what jerks his new family really are. But, and this is a big but (no pun intended) once the third act starts you are suddenly thinking, what the hell is this shit. This movie would have been so much better had we had never experienced this god awful third act. Why not end the movie at the bottom of the ocean? that was the ending, Steven, thank you and good night. We didn't need that moronic sub-plot of visiting aliens and the search for who man was. Who is man? an unfulfilled viewer after having to sit through this third act. And I'm surprised at this because Spielberg for the most part has already proven that he can do it, but not this time. What was he trying to do? Make us feel sorry for this kid? Well, we felt sorry for him, but not because his mother refused to love him but because he couldn't realize that she wasn't worthy of his love, and we realized this very early on.For anyone who reads this, do yourself a favor and walk out two thousand years before it ends, (you'll know what I mean) and you will think much more of this film than if you wait for the credits. Believe me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pinocchio meets Bicentennial Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...among others. (some spoilers in this review) The most disappointing aspect of this movie is that it is so unoriginal. While there are some parts of the movie that made me sit up and take notice (most notably the "Flesh Fair" and the great set of NYC), most of it was rehashed bits of other stories. The acting was great, as so many others have said. Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law are excellent. I actually found myself thinking of them, at times, as non-human. Some of the scenes were also eye-catching. My son's favorite was the visit to Dr. Know with it's holographic images. I found the images of the ruins of Manhattan striking. None of that, however, is enough to truly save this film. For a movie that was so long (and the last 1/2 hour is the longest by far) there were many questions that remain unanswered. I cared just enough about the mom and the rest of the family that I would have liked to know what happened to her. No answer to that one. Why did the boy only imprint on Monica, the mother? If a company could make such an impressive robot, why couldn't this child imprint on two parents? And if he could, why did the mother choose to go it alone? How did their child, Martin, suddenly get better? Overall, it was a decent movie, but did not live up to its potential. There were many places this film could have taken us, but rather than climb to new heights, it took the path of least resistance, going where nearly every sci-fi film has gone before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the first half of the movie was good. It was looking forward to see how our robot-boy would interact with his family.But once his "Mommy" dropped him off in the forest, it was all downhill. The plot took so many disjointed and far-fetched twists and turns that what was a pretty good movie turned out to be a real stinker. The fifth-millenium ending was just plain absurd.But this is Spielberg's fault, not Haley Joe's. He was his usual terrific self, despite a horrible script. He certainly has a shot at Best Actor for this one. Best Screenplay? Nobody with any degree of intelligence (artificial or real) would vote for Spielberg's AI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film About Ethics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the quotes in the advert for A.I. in the NYTimes ad, WHY not call it another Blade Runner-genre film?First off, SEE THE FILM. It is geared for adults thanks to Kubrick's influence in taking the story into the darker elements of human morality. It is a long film and yet the ending was not a cop out and although some in the audience found it laughable, it was a poignant epiphany to the viewer that David became an ironic symbol of Mankind.As you would expect from Spielberg, the movie is wonderfully crafted and captures the characters emotions beautifully. And there is always a message to the viewer that you are not merely watching an entertaining film, but a human struggle against the majority. Here, like in Blade Runner, instead of Replicants we have Mechas who have again been created to serve Mankind. The morality issue comes in when they are allowed to think independently: to have memories, to live, and to love, in this case. Do they then have rights, like humans?Blade Runner has become the stylistic blueprint of many sci-fi films and there are several similarities in this film that it is at times, embarassing. No wonder, Spielberg afterall is adapting a short story(Minority Report) from the same writer who had also inspired Blade Runner, Philip K. Dick.FILM SPOILER: My rant is that David should have confronted Prof. Hobby and given him an earful! The husband's emotions seemed mech to me. He wasn't very understanding to his wife's feelings about David. David's mission to be human was practical but the story abandoned the core of the film which I thought was the struggle for David's acceptance as a family member. He failed, so the movie then goes into entertainment-mode, sadly.However you feel about the film, it will at least makes you think that technology(recall Gattaca) only creates new dilemmas!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can definitely tell that this movie was touched by Kubrick. The ending is unsettling (of course, the sappy part at the VERY end is definitely a Speilberg thing). There are parts in the movie where Speilberg obviously tried to make it more Kubrickian. The classical music playing sometimes. Making the narrator English. I'm sure this movie would have been better if Kubrick had directed it, but Speilberg didn't do too bad of a job. The Blue Fairy stuff got old. Osment was excellent as David, also. The movie had a very creepy aspect to it. I wonder why some "technology-will-send-us-straight-to-hell" Radiohead music wasn't put on the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Spielberg bump" causes A.I. critics to give a too high a rating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's latest directorial effort, A.I. is getting many scores of 7 and 8, out of a possible 10, but the 2 hour and 25 minute conceptual piece is really enjoying "the Spielberg bump." Many critics are being generous to Mr. Spielberg due to his many other excellent contributions.Without spoiling the plot, these reviewers would have to admit that the story begins to drag somewhere about the 2 hour mark. It is so "deep," not many young teens will enjoy it, and the effects, while outstanding, are not good enough to carry what was essentially, a sad story. I think that the Amblin-Machine, known for (among other accolades) brilliant adaptations, esteemed too highly the adaptation from the late Stanley Kubrick. Which is sad because Mr. Kubrick, who loved serving "deep," thought-provoking films, like 2001 A Space Odyssey, and Dr. Strangelove, was clearly not at the top of his game (example, Eyes Wide Shut) when he adapted this sci-fi drama. It is so dark, and such a downer, that those touches of Spielberg that are sprinkled in, only serve to frustrate the audience with false hope, and make the experience unfulfilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe how bad this movie turned out. The first hour is very promising as the movie focuses on a family and how it interacts with a robotic child. But after abandoning this setting, the movie demonstrates one of the steepest declines in quality that I've ever witnessed. I would almost guess that this is where, the generally dumbed down direction of Steven Spielberg took over. The movie totally loses focus, continuously defies logic, and abandons nearly all of the many plotlines it touches. The movie could end thirty minutes earlier than it does and almost be acceptable. But it doesn't. There were some things that were good about this film: the acting, ideas introduced in the first half, and, of course, as in the case of all bad summer blockbusters, appearance, yet these features are not nearly enough to suffice for the stupidly incomprehensible plot. I give this movie a 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a heck of a lot of movie here ? maybe just a little too much.With a runtime of over 2 hours and pacing that is deliberately slow ? without being ponderous ? some of this film could have been cut. Or at least tightened up a bit.Based on Brian Adliss' short story `Supertoys Last All Summer Long' this is a dark, bleak film with many extremely disturbing images ? in other words: Do not bring your kids to see it. The `warm and fuzzy' moments are few and far between and the length will have them squirming in their seat and, worse, talking.Essentially a futuristic re-telling of the Pinocchio story, the film combines a bit of `Wizard of Oz' a bit of `E.T.: The Extraterrestrial' and even a bit of the science fiction classic `Metropolis.'The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski was amazing ? he has a penchant for photography through transparent surfaces that provides as much information in reflections as in the subject being shot and gives an appropriate other-worldly effect.The Lighting Director was a genius. The interplay of light and dark was simply brilliant.John Williams does his usual outstanding job of providing a score that adds to the overall thematic push of the film without detracting from what is happening on the screen.Haley Joel Osment, as David Swinton, turns in an uncannily brilliant performance ? equal to the job he did in `Sixth Sense.' He is an outstanding actor now ? we can only hope he will continue in the same vein.Jude Law, as Gigolo Joe, was an intriguing character. A Mecha designed only for pleasure he became more human and humane as he became more involved with the David Swinton character. He certainly had the look down perfectly.This film is stylish, exotic, dark and disturbing; with just enough of what David Swinton was searching for: humanity.</fullReview>

For those who love dreamy sad slow John Williams music rather than high paced action, this film has it. For those who appreciate Haley Joel Osment, he's got it in this film.But there are bridges to cross for the viewer; several places where there is the opportunity to go from impressed and appreciative to feeling like this may be the worst film ever. Only you know if you're willing to bridge those gaps. If you're ready to sit in judgment, you will fall into the trap and scream at Spielberg for fooling you once again, and you will feel cheated and angry. I noted those gaps and bridged them. And if mommy and sentimentality and funny looking creatures are your thing, this is just the film for you. For me, 7.8/10, for you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off Ive read some of the negative reviews on the film and I gotta say you people have seem to have missed the point entirely. AI is not ET, AI is not 2001, AI is not supposed to have been the definitive work by either Kubrick or Spielberg. If you look at the movie with only expectations on what you've seen in the past then your going to walk away dissapointed. But if your willing to go in, like I did (although being somewhat pessimistic towards the genre) with an open mind you'll find this film to be a very deep character study of the human condition. If the film were to follow the conventional order of huge explosions, fast cutting, etc, it would fall into the usual bargain bin scifi flop. But Spielberg did something really amazing with this film, he's able to to grasp at a very deep need all people have, and he's able to do it in such a way thats its neither sappy nor cliche. I walked out of this movie stunned, I didnt know what to feel, but I identified with the story. AI is the most thought provoking, heart provoking film Ive seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now wait a minute. Is this a cutesy, cuddly retelling of Pinochio, complete with jiminy cricket fill-in Teddy the Bear? Or is this a gripping adult drama about the conflicts between artificial and natural intelligence, including a not altoghether fleeting expoloration of mechanized sex for hire? Or is it an exploration of the emotion of love itself, and how it might even transcend a definitively human level? Well, I believe the third proposition is the most relevant, but it is too intermixed with a confusing presentation of the first two to come across very effectively, even with all of Spielberg's usual and adept as always magic at his disposal. This combined with one of the most bizaare transitions of a movie I have ever seenk in which we arrive (without wanting to spoil) rather suddenly at the ending of another famous Speilberg effort with only a brief narrator (who waited, by the way, to well over two hours into this movie to pop on in there) to explain. None of it ever seems to gel, despite another bravero perfomance by Osment. His pairing with gigalo joe is never satisfactorily fleshed out, and jude law spends much of the movie with absolutley nothing to do but stand around. By the time Mr. Spielberg has finally settled overwhelmingly on the fairly tale, there has been too much Kubrick inspired mischief in the shadows for a violent, however somber, return to E.T.-ville.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I've ever said this before, but I am truly dissapointed in Spielberg's work on this film.. The story seeks to be something it fails to accomplish.. it has some good ideas and concepts, but lacks good execution.. My biggest thing against this movie is the fact that it pretends to be a fairy tale, but is missing something that prevents it from achieving that level, in the music, the direction, the construction of the story itself. Instead, its a dark drama trying to be something that its not. The biggest fault, I believe, is the story reaches out, but lacks the ambition to carry it to greatness. I never got a sense of wonderment, of something grand, only trying, but never succeeding. I wanted to like this film, unfortunatly I couldn't. They should have given the concept to Tim Burtan to work out, and I think his work on such films as Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow is proof of his ability to create true fairy tales (especially Edward, a truly magical film with constant elements of something more beautiful, even in the darker areas).. This was not a good undertaking for Spielberg..Special effects? Well, there were definitely some very good special effects, and some bland ones as well.. the integration of the bots with realworld flesh was simply amazing to behold, and the underwater segments looked photorealistic.. Biggest thing is it didn't look digital, as many films suffer from (even Episode 1)..Cast? A talented cast to be sure, especially Jude Law, though his character seems to lack a true place in the story, like they just needed to fill a slot, and once that slot was ended, he was whisked away in a very dull manner, no real purpose in the story other than that. Osment is a good actor, and he did well as the child constantly lost in a sense of niavity. But, I don't believe his character was used well enough, as with Jude's. Now, the best character in the movie was Teddy, the only true character that I could be satisfied with throughout.Story, Direction, Screenplay? Not enough thought went into the screenplay of AI, though I'm sure the same can not be said with the original treatment by Kubrick. Its not the dialogue I have a problem with, its the story itself, how its put together, the direction.. Overall? The movie seemed to me like a B Movie affair with a good cast and special effects, but never succeeds to draw me in fully into the film itself, to let me be apart of the characters, the action, and the story.. and for that, I give it a C-.. Well, atleast it was better than Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but then again, that's not saying much.</fullReview>

The abrupt shifts between Act 1 and Act 2 and then the almost interminable and unnecessary Act 3 were startling and very off-putting. The more time that passes since seeing the film, the less I find I liked it. While the beginning wasn't great, the ending ruined any goodwill I might have had for AI. If you're going to see this movie, go to a matinee. $8 is just too much to spend on a sugar-coated gumdrop that takes forever to get to the juicy center, especially when all you wind up with in the end is an awful, cheap, saccharine aftertaste that won't leave you for days.

A perfect example of what can happen to a great cast, great special effects, unusual characters but a lame story. We kept waiting for something or someone for you to get attached to. Haley Osmet was VERY good but his character alone and his quest were not enough to make us ever see this movie again. Not even as a rental. Some parts were so slow we and others in the theater were falling asleep. Not an optimistic outlook for our future at all. I refuse to look for inspiration from a Robot whose creator was trying to do something for mankind and create a market for a new product. Gee, I think the drive for the new product won. I do not recommend sitting for 2 hours and 25 minutes seeing this movie. Spielberg has done and could do much better. We feel burned on this Sci-Fi over-expanded short story. </fullReview>

In every way, this was the most magnificent film I had ever seen. It's not perfect, but it is the best ...I.... have ever seen. If there hadbeen an 11 on the scale, I would have selected it. I have beenwowed by Jurassic Park, traumatized by Aliens, touched byShawshank Redemption, numbed by Leaving Las Vegas, andinspired by Crouching Tiger, but this ... "AI"... did all that ... andmore.Without going into any details ... it took me places, new directionsin my mind and spirit ... where I have been yearning to go, butcould form no question to lead me. It was simply every ingredient ...I... needed to be the recipe for my new favorite movie.It's true, Haley's performance was stunning, but FrancesO'Connor's performance paced him step for step.A.I. is not E.T.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. Awfully Imperfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While visually stunning in many instances and containing a stellar score from John Williams (as always), as well as wonderful performances by Haley Joel Osment and particularly Jude Law, AI was very very disappointing. The abrupt shifts between Act 1 and Act 2 and then the almost interminable and unnecessary Act 3 were startling and very off-putting. The more time that passes since seeing the film, the less I find I liked it. While the beginning wasn't great, the ending ruined any goodwill I might have had for AI. If you're going to see this movie, go to a matinee. $8 is just too much to spend on a sugar-coated gumdrop that takes forever to get to the juicy center, especially when all you wind up with in the end is an awful, cheap, saccharine aftertaste that won't leave you for days. Go see Moulin Rouge (again!) instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think, therefore I am -- what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a heck of a lot of movie here ? maybe just a little too much.With a runtime of over 2 hours and pacing that is deliberately slow ? without being ponderous ? some of this film could have been cut. Or at least tightened up a bit.Based on Brian Adliss' short story `Supertoys Last All Summer Long' this is a dark, bleak film with many extremely disturbing images ? in other words: Do not bring your kids to see it. The `warm and fuzzy' moments are few and far between and the length will have them squirming in their seat and, worse, talking.Essentially a futuristic re-telling of the Pinocchio story, the film combines a bit of `Wizard of Oz' a bit of `E.T.: The Extraterrestrial' and even a bit of the science fiction classic `Metropolis.'The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski was amazing ? he has a penchant for photography through transparent surfaces that provides as much information in reflections as in the subject being shot and gives an appropriate other-worldly effect.The Lighting Director was a genius. The interplay of light and dark was simply brilliant.John Williams does his usual outstanding job of providing a score that adds to the overall thematic push of the film without detracting from what is happening on the screen.Haley Joel Osment, as David Swinton, turns in an uncannily brilliant performance ? equal to the job he did in `Sixth Sense.' He is an outstanding actor now ? we can only hope he will continue in the same vein.Jude Law, as Gigolo Joe, was an intriguing character. A Mecha designed only for pleasure he became more human and humane as he became more involved with the David Swinton character. He certainly had the look down perfectly.This film is stylish, exotic, dark and disturbing; with just enough of what David Swinton was searching for: humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, fabulous created world, unnecessary coda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. is a spectacular film, visually at least, that would have been better off had it ended underwater - don't worry, this is not much of a spoiler - but it doesn't, and I would imagine that for those whose thumbs are barely up at that point will yell and scream and pout and call this the worst film since Titanic.For those who love the incredible creation of an amazing world with mechanical beings, this film has it. For those who love dreamy sad slow John Williams music rather than high paced action, this film has it. For those who appreciate Haley Joel Osment, he's got it in this film.But there are bridges to cross for the viewer; several places where there is the opportunity to go from impressed and appreciative to feeling like this may be the worst film ever. Only you know if you're willing to bridge those gaps. If you're ready to sit in judgment, you will fall into the trap and scream at Spielberg for fooling you once again, and you will feel cheated and angry. I noted those gaps and bridged them. And if mommy and sentimentality and funny looking creatures are your thing, this is just the film for you. For me, 7.8/10, for you...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look Deeper: A Response to Critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read many of the criticisms of the film and feel that most of the critics are overlooking some points. This comment contains spoiler passages, so please only read this if you have already seen it or are prepared to have details disclosed. 1. Many have said that Monica's abandoning David is closer to junking a computer than abandoning a pet dog. For this reason, they complain about Spielberg's manipulating emotions to make us think that David is already a boy. This is the Pinocchio issue. Do we suspend disbelief and accept David's sentience? Monica certainly did, or else she would not be as distraught. But it was the act of abandoning David that created the second greatest transformation of his "intelligence" (the first being the imprinting). Had that personal transformation not been a vital part of the story, he would have just walked back home, oblivious to the hardships and the emotion of rejection.2. A.O. Scott in the NYTimes pointed out the contradiction between our emotional identification with the robots in the Flesh Fair and our sense of humanity as expressed by the MC. Are we alienated from truly human responses when we closer identify with the idyllic David? Critics see this as Spielberg's setting us up. But I would say that the extreme Luddite stuff at the Flesh Fair is the human position caricaturised. So when David calls out, "I'm just a boy!" it is both another sign of his processor making a quantum leap and a kind of middle ground, from the mecha feelinglessness to the human extremism. A critical piece in making us think again about the nature of both feeling and human "nature."3. Most critics hated the last third, especially the scenes 2,000 years hence. Roger Ebert said that David wasn't deserving of admiration for his unflagging devotion as much as rebooting. But the last third is what marks the story as a fairy tale, not a science fiction story. The storytelling conventions of the first half were but details to hook us. The essence is the moral lesson, and this can only be made clear with the (admittedly corny) aliens at the end. How else would we get the situation (big time spoiler here) that David would prefer one "day" with his mommy, then willingly turn himself off? The point is that he acted totally in conflict with self-preservation, one would even say irrationally, to show how human he finally became.The entire film revolves around the statement made in the very beginning: If we create a machine that can love, don't the humans have a moral obligation to return that love?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was eagerly awaiting this film, I knew that this was probably going to be one of the only really interesting movies of the summer. First, all of the speculation about this film because of the Kubrick/Spielberg collaboration put an unfair expectations on the film. Cynical critics of Spielberg were ready dismiss the movie as a failed attempt to imitate the great Stanley Kubrick. Though I agree that Kubrick was a master, I honestly think that this material suits Steven Spielberg much better. What the story comes down to is a sci-fi fantasy take on Pinnochio. David(Haley Joel Osment) is a robot boy programmed only to love, he loves his mother, but the real question is, how can his mother return the love, after all he is a machine. David wants to be real, he wants his mother to love him back. He goes on a journey to try become a real boy. Spielberg has created an intriguing world here, there are alot of moments and nods to Kubrick, he respects his colleague but never copies him. Kubrick's style was always ineresting, but cold and distant. Spielberg's style is more inviting, and warm. This movie is not ET though, Steven has grown up. I think that visually it is as ambitious as anything that he has ever done. The movie's ending will leave some wondering if it was necessary, it is at going to seem at first glance simplistic, but thinking about it it is very appropriate. In a summer full of mindless action entertainment, including a so-called historical epic that didn't amount to much(Yes that one!) it is nice to see a film with something to say. The questions asked by the film are not answered, they are to complex to be faithfully be attempted to be answered by a 2 and a half hour movie. But at least the movie leaves us thinking about them.Bravo Mr. Spielberg!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous, tacked-on ending ruins the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a dark challenging film, not for children, interesting and very Kubrick. Until the last 30 minutes. What was Steven Spielberg thinking? Why would he tack on a second ending to this intriguing film in so obvious a manner you can almost see the scotch tape on the screen? Did he show the film to a test audience? Did they find the original ending too sad? It sure looks that way. The second ending is so bad, so artificial it made me gasp. No first-year film student would have been allowed to get away with it. The whole sorry mess could be saved by just cutting those last, ridiculous 30 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many film critics and moviegoers have panned AI. The beauty of this movie will not be realized for sometime. It is noteworthy that many people walked out of 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first premiered.The secret of AI is it forces the viewer to recognize our human capacity to love and our desire to be loved. By using a non-human form, a robotic boy, the story allows us to examine the love we as human beings give and love we require to be happy.When the Blue Fairy tells David `Your Wish is My Command,' it invokes a commonality among all humankind - We dream. We dream of things not possible or known, things that bring joy to our lives and those we love, we dream of living in a better place, we dream of living forever.As others have reported on this board, the movie is broken into 3 parts. The last segment of an archeological dig of a flooded and frozen 2000-year-old Manhattan is awesome in scope.I highly recommend this movie. You will think about the messages for a long, long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clarification: the ending was not tacked on by Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I see this movie as a failure (see my other comment), but one criticism that's not valid is the accusation that Spielberg tacked on the end to give us closure, defying Kubrick. In fact, Kubrick was the one who wanted to end the film 2000 years later, with the robot getting back his mother for one day. I am trying to find the place I read this, but I know it was an article from a few years back in a major magazine. If you really can't believe this, I'm sure if you do your own research you'll see.Though the ending is muddled and perhaps saccharine, I thought it the strongest part just because it felt the weirdest, the craziest, the most eerie, and the most Kubrick. These qualities alone don't make it good, but they were a relief after a first act that was wholly contrived, false, and filled with ridiculous dialogue, and a second act that asked us too earnestly and too often to feel genuine sympathy for this twisted droid, rather than standing back and letting us measure our own reactions to the surreal journey motivated by a simplified, programmed version of love. Spielberg wanted too badly for his story to be sad and emotional, when a story whose protagonist is a man-made robot can't really make sense as anything but something surreal and remote. In the third act Spielberg finally seemed to ease away from the emotions, embracing weirdness completely, or maybe it was just that my separation from the characters became so complete that emotion no longer touched me and I only thought "weird." Either way, this gave me the hope throughout the end that things were about to take that final step into Kubrickness and get not only weird but challenging, not only unusual but genuinely thought-provoking. Unfortunately, A.I. was stuck between two directors. It did not make me think about real love, because it was clearly not about real love; it did not make me think about the man-made robot-love it portrayed, because it thought it was about real love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Jarring Mix of Two Minds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now wait a minute. Is this a cutesy, cuddly retelling of Pinochio, complete with jiminy cricket fill-in Teddy the Bear? Or is this a gripping adult drama about the conflicts between artificial and natural intelligence, including a not altoghether fleeting expoloration of mechanized sex for hire? Or is it an exploration of the emotion of love itself, and how it might even transcend a definitively human level? Well, I believe the third proposition is the most relevant, but it is too intermixed with a confusing presentation of the first two to come across very effectively, even with all of Spielberg's usual and adept as always magic at his disposal. This combined with one of the most bizaare transitions of a movie I have ever seenk in which we arrive (without wanting to spoil) rather suddenly at the ending of another famous Speilberg effort with only a brief narrator (who waited, by the way, to well over two hours into this movie to pop on in there) to explain. None of it ever seems to gel, despite another bravero perfomance by Osment. His pairing with gigalo joe is never satisfactorily fleshed out, and jude law spends much of the movie with absolutley nothing to do but stand around. By the time Mr. Spielberg has finally settled overwhelmingly on the fairly tale, there has been too much Kubrick inspired mischief in the shadows for a violent, however somber, return to E.T.-ville.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special effects alone wont cut it-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I left this film feeling like Spielberg owes me 2 1/2 hours. The film's special effects were wonderful. Unfortunately, almost everything else about it bothered me.To give credit where it's due, Hailey Joel Osment took what he was given to work with, and worked it hard. His performance absolutely was a bright spot. Jude Law had less to work with, but gave it a good shot as well. The rest of the cast became also-rans in Law and Osment's wake.More than the moments of stilted dialog, what pained me most were the lack of motivations for many of the character's actions. Add to that a portrayal of the future that seemed skewed at best and two false endings and you'll leave the theatre feeling much the way I did: Short-changed and mildly angry.I thought it held such promise. What a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, the more you think about this film the more it reflects another facet back into your face. It is a diamond in the rough, it will not be cleaned for years ( and even then it will be flawed or dirtied in the process or 1000's of muddied minds like my own) The execution at times was drawn out. I agree with many comments regarding the protracted ending. They could have let the boy rust staring at the blue fairy and it would have worked just fine.. if not better.If they had made a little more clues about the final "world" we end up in there may be more appreciation of its role in the film.If used, it could have constricted and done in a much more poignant fashion. [though the heck if kubrick would have done it that way , or shall i bite my tongue in looking back at strangelove it its tactics]I could go on and on and segment the film and analyze, but it is beyond a user comment. You don't want to hear my or others babbling about.In view of that: it is wonderful, could have been better in parts. (of course we can easily say that of any film, especially one that is 15 years in the works by kubrick and 4 writers later).Worth seeing : please though , I do not think this is for children. Late teens and older perhaps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A frustrating masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are spoilers in this review -- I have bracketed them with the word SPOILER in caps.There is one point of advice I must offer in this `review,' which could be construed as a spoiler. There is a point in the movie when your gut tells you `The movie is over,' and adds, `Wow.' This is the point when you should get up and leave the theater. Trust me. Get up, leave the theater, and know that ignorance is bliss. You have just watched two hours and ten minutes of beautiful, haunting filmmaking; you have seen the film Kubrick probably wanted to make. Run.For most of the movie, the meshing of Spielberg's and Kubrick's styles is seamless. References to films from both directors' opuses are plentiful: when David first enters his owners' house, he is haloed by light, an echo of the aliens' first appearance in Close Encounters. He mirrors his `mother' in scenes reminiscent of E.T.'s imitative behavior. He compulsively writes his thoughts in crayon on large sheets of paper, found by his mother in a scene that smacks of The Shining. One scene must be an homage to 2001: David's `supertoy,' a talking teddy bear named (of course) Teddy, is passed from person to person in a crowd, saying in a deep, mechanical voice: `Are you taking me to David? I must find David. Where is David?' This scene is a reminder that Kubrick had previously tackled issues of artificial intelligence - and that his take on the subject was hardly optimistic.The movie gets better as it goes along, [SPOILER until David, accompanied by a Casanova hustler mecha named Joe, nears the end of his personal quest in the submerged ruins of New York City SPOILER]. The underwater scenes are indescribably beautiful and worth the price of admission. I'm thinking: it just doesn't get any better than this. I am enthralled. And then comes the scene that should be the end. I think: perfect. What a movie.Roger Ebert said in his review: `When we lose a toy, the pain is ours, not the toy's, and by following an abandoned robot boy rather than the parents who threw him away, Spielberg misses the real story.' At this scene, I could not have disagreed more with Ebert: David's story had become the perfect allegory for man's constant search for his creator, for our undying desire to be loved by our maker. The scene where the movie should have ended is the perfect crystallization of this quest: [David looks into the face of `god' and begs, relentlessly and infinitely pleads, to be `real' and to be loved.]I'm thinking, Wow. End now. More movie? Okay, doesn't seem to be the need, but okay.[SPOILER Then the hammer falls. The film skips forward two thousand years and we are suddenly dumped into a pure Spielbergian vision, an assortment of deus-ex-machina characters who can, with the help of an idiotic plot device (that one alien helpfully explains in depth for three minutes as the audience says in unison `Uh huh, we get it'), make David's wishes come true. There's another chance for the movie to end and still keep its dignity, and it does not end, and I begin to sympathize with the teenagers in front of me who are now chortling without restraint. Then there comes a scene so ill-conceived, so monumentally goofy that I join in the chortling. It becomes impossible to imagine that this is what Stanley Kubrick would have wanted. SPOILER][SPOILER This is when Ebert's critique becomes valid. Until now, the movie has been fascinating because it is the perfect allegory for mankind's endless quest for fulfillment; now it is all about the robot boy. In his compulsion to provide a `happy ending' for the film, Spielberg gives us one that is not only not happy, but unfulfilling and, well, just plain stupid. It obliterates all the good stuff that preceded it. It made the people behind me yell out `End! End!' ? la Tom Servo. Tell me you don't choke down the vomit when Teddy crawls up on that bed. SPOILER]It's awful how this ending destroys everything that came before. Until this point the movie is somber, thoughtful, wondrous, dark - a masterpiece. But that ending sticks out like a gangrenous thumb.There is plenty to admire about A.I. Its special effects alone [SPOILER until the CGI-saturated final third SPOILER] earn it a special place in the pantheon of great science fiction movies. The acting is wonderful, especially from Haley Joel Osment, who manages to make David both endearing and creepy, using subtle mannerisms to remind us that he is not what he seems. And best of all, the first two hours of A.I. raises questions that are impossible to answer and deals with them intelligently. But if you go and stay until the ending credits, prepare to be frustrated and angry. For two hours, you've been watching a work that could be mentioned alongside 2001, Blade Runner, Metropolis, and Star Wars. Then for thirty minutes you are served lukewarm Hook.</fullReview>

At the end of the movie, everyone in my area of the theatre was looking around at each other with blank looks on their faces. They were probably thinking that they couldn't believe that they actually paid to see it. I was with five other people, and none of us cared for it at all. I would have gotten up and walked out, but I was with them!While I will have to give Osment credit for some fantastic acting, the movie is boring, overly long, unconnected and cold. In fact, the last 15 minutes of the movie (felt like an hour) was like something out of a bad LSD trip. Were there 3 seperate scripts that fell on the floor in Spielberg's office, and then when they picked all of them up, A.I. was born? If so, then that would explain a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I have already seen A.I. twice, and I find it to be in the long run a very good film. I've read many reviews and opinions of this movie and they are all over the place. Techincally the film is perfect with amazing visual effects and sound. I was extremely impressed with the photography and editing. They should definitely be up for an Oscar. When it comes to story, it's good. The entire movie's story is perfect until the end however. After David's two thousand year wait ends and is given the wish he has always wanted from his examiners, the movie loses its iron grip. Why? Too much was explained and given. It looks as though Spielberg tried to go for the tearjerking ending with the resurrecting of his "mother". But hey, its still good. The performances are top notch and Haley Joel Osment definitely deserves an Oscar nomination. For what its worth, its a film definitely worth watching. Teenagers and young people may find it boring since there is no fast paced action or explosions around every corner However people who like movies that make you think and wonder, this one is for you... Oh and and about the beings who examine David at the end, they are not aliens. They are robots! 'Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe Gigolo, and how he works in AI's plot, are the weakest link in the film. I was left with three unanswered questions:1) Who (or what) does Joe work for? As a robot, Joe would not necessarily have a need for money himself. Who is profiting from his work, and making his "appointments"? If he is working independently, why? If he is capable of choosing to work on his own, doesn't that imply he has a free will?2) What was to be gained by framing Joe for murder, and confronting him with the killer? It would only work if the murderer destroyed Joe as well. Presumably, there would be a way to access an android's memory and discern the truth of the matter. Just connecting the android with the corpse would not explain the murder.3) Aside from a graphic description, what did Joe have to offer the young guys in the car in return for a lift to Rouge City? Money? No. Access? Seemed as if anyone could just drive in. Services? If Joe set something up, it was done offscreen. Information/directions? I would think three guys would already know how to find the place.All this is saved by a memorable performance by Jude Law.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two and a Half Wasted Hours...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a visually impressive well acted piece of techno garbage. Don't fault the actors - they did well enough. Don't fault the special effects people -- they did very well. Fault the writing, most notably Steven Spielberg, for whom I have a wealth of respect, but whose work on this film falls far short of his usual norms. The story's premise is fatally flawed, it's telling is worse, and the bizarre ending could have and should have been totally avoided.While turning Pinocchio into a post-modern fairy tale probably sounded like a good idea at the time, the actual execution of the movie has given us something that almost ranks with the worst of the Saturday Night Live Specials (it's Pat, et al).That being said, Haley Joel Osment again turns in a good performance, showing us that his talents, once refined and matured into adulthood, may very well be enjoyed on the screen for decades to come. Jude Law also puts in a thoroughly enjoyable performance as the gigolo robot with the onboard speaker system. William Hurt was good in his too-brief scenes, though his character was left largely undeveloped. Truly, the teddy bear steals the show and should be up for the Best Supporting Stuffed Robot Oscar.The effects of the over-sexualized Rouge Town were visually stunning, but overly cold and dreary, and the characters seemed somehow misplaced. Worse, though, then ending leaves much to be desired, and the entire last half-hour could easily have been removed. While I thoroughly enjoy Ben Kingsley as an actor, his narration on this film was entirely unnecessary and often duplicative to the onscreen story.So, in summary: a 3 out of 10. One point for the effects, one for the acting, one for the teddy bear, and a lengthy trip to the woodshed for Mr. Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the film almost failed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much is made of the fact that this was a Stanley Kubrick project that ended up being a Steven Spielberg project, and that fans of each will be disappointed by the compromises made by the other. However, there is one element that I think Kubrick would have done differently, and the film is saved by excellent performances that save the change.After David is abandoned, the movie suddenly shifts to Joe, the android gigolo. We learn why he does what he does, without having to get into too many details. Then, just as abruptly, Joe is apparently set up for murder, to place him in "big trouble" and oblige him to turn fugitive. All this is done to support his meeting up with David, and providing a motivation for him to help David.I think it would have made more sense for the plot to go like this. We do not meet Joe until David meets him, while both are in the woods with the other fugitive androids. After Joe and David escape, David would learn about Joe's work first hand, because Joe would "work" to get them money and/or transport. This would likely have been a lot more graphic and disturbing, and would have pushed the movie into "R" territory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Only Kubrick had lived to direct this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. starts out promisingly. The first third is the most Kubrick-like part of the film, and sets up a story that is both thought provoking and very relevant. Unfortunately, from a certain point, the movie becomes pure-Spielberg, a child-like fairly tale again, full of sweetness and light, that is still, curiously, not at all appropriate for younger children. As the film progresses, contrivances, schmalz, and manipulation become rampant, and only the stunning visuals of the movie kept me interested (and the movie is quite long).The final scenes are so derivative of previous Spielberg (and Kubrick) films, that it really is almost a joke, and embarrassingly maudlin, at least for me. How much you like A.I. may depend on how much the basic premise pushes your own personal emotional buttons. It pushed none for me. I can't help but wonder what Kubrick would have done with this move. Surely it would have been a darker, more adult film, more thought provoking and other worldly. I certainly would have liked to seen a richer exploration of the issues involved here, as well as the cosmic implications of what is happening to mankind in the future. As in Jurassic Park, Spielberg has instead taken an intelligent story, and made it into "family" entertainment, except that's is not really suitable for the whole family at all. Worth seeing, but ultimately very disappointing. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it is true that this movie dragged on longer than expected, I still liked the story and special effects enough to give it a thumbs up.Some scenes are cheesily tear-jerking (as pointed out by movie critics in pre-opening night reviews), but I like Haley Joel Osment enough as an actor to look the other way. He's great in this movie. One could only hope that this talented young actor will not be corrupted by Hollywood. Jude Law also gave a good performance, although I think they should not have put on that much makeup on him (David's as real-looking as everyone else).The scene where David and the other mechas are chased by Flesh Fair biker dudes remind me of biker-dude B-movies from the 1980's, especially with all the loud music. Flesh Fair itself is reminiscent of American society's preoccupation with violent primetime fare such as 'pro' wrestling.There are no gratuitous sex or nude scenes, to the credit of Spielberg/Kubrick. There are a couple or so explicit biblical references, i.e., why God created Adam, and who may cast the first stone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think one criterion for a movie being worth seeing is that it stays in your thoughts for some time afterwards and gives you alot to think about. AI certainly falls in that category for me. Yes, as may have said, the ending sequence is a weak one, and seems not to fit the mood of the rest of the movie. But having said that, this movie is worth seeing. It is very emotionally affecting. Halley Joel Osment creates a performance that is unbelievable for one so young. He takes David from a creepy first intro and transitions him subtly to being more human than some of the humans in the movie.This story is (I think) to be seen as a sort of futuristic fairy tale. I think this would have been more gratifying if such strong references to the Pinnochio story hadn't been thrown in as much.This could have been a great movie, but as such, though flawed, it is valuable, thought-provoking and disturbing. I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got home from watching AI and all I can say is it's the best movie I've seen in years, many years. It's visually beautiful, the kid is one incredible actor, and most important of all it worked as a drama. As for the science,well a movie, even a science fiction movie, is not a science treatise but still it shouldn't have anything that would make an educated man groan; I didn't groan, not once. Well, ok, there was something at the very end that might be a bit doggy, but by then you're dealing with something so advanced, so unfathomable, it didn't bother me much. Also a big corporation that's smart enough to make a robot as sophisticated as David is unlikely to do a few things depicted in the film that were sort of dumb, but I confess these objections didn't occur to me until the movie was over and they did advance the plot so I'll cut the movie people a little slack.I'm certain time will be kind to this movie, I think this is the sort of film that will improve each time you see it. I am also certain that the professional movie reviewers who panned it in the year 2001 will be very embarrassed by their negative articles 10 years from now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it because you kinda have to, but it kinda sucks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I won't say that this movie is total crap, I will describe it, at least in comparison to its overwhelming potential, as a total failure. You can't fairly criticize Spielberg because it's really a Kubrick film, but then you can't really criticize Stanley for it, because what we get to watch isn't really his, either. When you throw as much money at a film as Spielberg, it would be difficult to make it NOT look really nice. I would have thought SS would have had enough respect for SK that he would have tamed his own apparently uncontrollable desire to coat everything in a thick layer of cheesy corny sap (or was that corny sappy cheese?), at least for this one film, seeing as how it is such an honor to have The Master ask you to take his baby of 15+ years off his hands. Kubrick could have scared the hell out of us and left us haunted by countless horrific images and provocative concepts to chew on, stuff to discuss with your friends afterwards to gain a better understanding of the movie you just saw. Instead you end up out in front of the theatre in a bitch session with everyone shaking their heads, commenting about Stanley doing all kinds of gymnastics in his grave, and deciding to (or reaffirming their decision to) never have kids for themselves. AI could have been a movie truly epic in proportion, concept, scope, et cetera, but SS instead gives us a nice-looking but shallow trip that is only epic in its running time. The potential exploration of such interesting, adult concepts is also wasted on its decidedly Spielbergian PG-13 rating. I guess Steven just can't handle the idea of five-year-olds staying at home for this one, or not understanding every bit of dialogue, so he just dumbs-down everything, driving everyone else up the wall. Imagine watching "Star Wars, Episode I: The Phantom Menace" with everything but Jar-Jar and little Anakin cut out. That is nearly the hell you have in store for you if you see AI.In short, poor Stanley. Poor, poor Stanley...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film puzzles me to this day. The first half is quite simply the best film of the year. Yet the closing half is a frustrating jumble of ideas and emotions. As a whole, it is so watchable that it really doesn't matter. Overall the film is moderately disappointing and I do imagine the ending leaving many people angered and impatient. See it, by all means and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was probably the most disappointing movie I've seen this year.It's a hodge-podge of E.T., 2001 a Space Odessey, and Blade runner, taking the worst from each.It's appeared that the test screeners were not happy with the ending, so they just kept going until they were. This movie was too slow, too long and too stupid. I really kept trying to like this movie, but it just wasn't psooible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was all ready to proclaim this the best science-fiction story since the Fifth Element, and then Spielberg destroyed the film with thelast twenty minutes. How? Aliens - again. Can't he just leave things alone? Take my advice - if you see AI, leave the film as the camera zooms slowly away from David as he's trapped under the old coney island ferris wheel and the voiceover comes in. If you wait any longer, you'll see a perfectly good film destroyed by Spielberg beserking with aliens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it because you kinda have to, but it kinda sucks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I won't say that this movie is total crap, I will describe it, at least in comparison to its overwhelming potential, as a total failure. You can't fairly criticize Spielberg because it's really a Kubrick film, but then you can't really criticize Stanley for it, because what we get to watch isn't really his, either. When you throw as much money at a film as Spielberg, it would be difficult to make it NOT look really nice. I would have thought SS would have had enough respect for SK that he would have tamed his own apparently uncontrollable desire to coat everything in a thick layer of cheesy corny sap (or was that corny sappy cheese?), at least for this one film, seeing as how it is such an honor to have The Master ask you to take his baby of 15+ years off his hands. Kubrick could have scared the hell out of us and left us haunted by countless horrific images and provocative concepts to chew on, stuff to discuss with your friends afterwards to gain a better understanding of the movie you just saw. Instead you end up out in front of the theatre in a bitch session with everyone shaking their heads, commenting about Stanley doing all kinds of gymnastics in his grave, and deciding to (or reaffirming their decision to) never have kids for themselves. AI could have been a movie truly epic in proportion, concept, scope, et cetera, but SS instead gives us a nice-looking but shallow trip that is only epic in its running time. The potential exploration of such interesting, adult concepts is also wasted on its decidedly Spielbergian PG-13 rating. I guess Steven just can't handle the idea of five-year-olds staying at home for this one, or not understanding every bit of dialogue, so he just dumbs-down everything, driving everyone else up the wall. Imagine watching "Star Wars, Episode I: The Phantom Menace" with everything but Jar-Jar and little Anakin cut out. That is nearly the hell you have in store for you if you see AI.In short, poor Stanley. Poor, poor Stanley...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must start by saying that I think that Spielberg is a great director. However, that said, I must also say that this show just didn't work. Period..... I now understand why Spielberg allowed this film to be released so soon before the release of Jurassic Park 3... He knew this one would be killed by word of mouth long before Jurassic hit the theaters. I greatly respect Spielberg's body of work, so I'll just chalk this up in the "Oops" category, toss it in there with his other misfire, "1941" (just with a vastly larger budget). The show is just so far off the mark, that it would be a waste of time to try to analyze. The person I went with and I both squirmed in our seats, looked at each other every ten minutes, then looked for the nearest door as our means of escape, finally settling back down believing that the show just had to turn around and get better sooner or later... We were wrong. I read a number of the reviews on this website, and almost without fail, the positive ones were overly long and sounded like the writers were desperately trying to convince themselves of the greatness of the film - that Spielberg could not do something this bad. Everyone has a slip up now and then. Talented directors are not immune from this fact. I'll just sit back and wait for the next Private Ryan, Raiders, Schindler's, or E.T. - After all, He is a great director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artificial: A Little. Intelligence: Definitely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By today's cinematic standards, this film is not very good. It has a slowly-paced plot, several gaffes in the storyline, and questionable characters. Anyone expecting a fast-paced, solid, tie-all-the-ends-together, action-adventure that are so common in today's theater will be sadly disappointed. AI reflects the futuristic outlook of the 1960's...fans of golden-age science fiction books will rejoice. AI has the beautiful quality of Arthur C. Clarke, Philip K. Dick, even Robert A. Heinlein.The plot IS rather complicated, and I will not deny that this movie is entirely too long, and the theme of the story (robots in a bleak future) is "glossed over" with contemporary appeals...but what current film isn't?Compare Artificial Intelligence to classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey and E.T. and no, you don't have a very good film. But compare it to current scifi flicks like The Matrix, etc. and you have a truly good movie.Be forewarned: AI is EXTREMELY emotional....possibly even OVERLY emotional. Several scenes are tear-jerkers...bring plenty of tissues.The ending to AI is odd and inconclusive. This (apparently) upset many movie-goers. But in my humble opinion, it left it open to controversy...what really DID happen? It's an interesting idea....I loved it. With the plot of a classic science fiction movie, but the glossed-over mood of any current scifi flick, AI is probably not a classic. But nevertheless, it is a must-see. It's merely a classic that's been mutilated by today's standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Only Kubrick had lived to direct this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. starts out promisingly. The first third is the most Kubrick-like part of the film, and sets up a story that is both thought provoking and very relevant. Unfortunately, from a certain point, the movie becomes pure-Spielberg, a child-like fairly tale again, full of sweetness and light, that is still, curiously, not at all appropriate for younger children. As the film progresses, contrivances, schmalz, and manipulation become rampant, and only the stunning visuals of the movie kept me interested (and the movie is quite long).The final scenes are so derivative of previous Spielberg (and Kubrick) films, that it really is almost a joke, and embarrassingly maudlin, at least for me. How much you like A.I. may depend on how much the basic premise pushes your own personal emotional buttons. It pushed none for me. I can't help but wonder what Kubrick would have done with this move. Surely it would have been a darker, more adult film, more thought provoking and other worldly. I certainly would have liked to seen a richer exploration of the issues involved here, as well as the cosmic implications of what is happening to mankind in the future. As in Jurassic Park, Spielberg has instead taken an intelligent story, and made it into "family" entertainment, except that's is not really suitable for the whole family at all. Worth seeing, but ultimately very disappointing. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2/3 of a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to the mindless drek (not Shrek, drek) constantly spewed out by the Hollywood movie machine, this film is a masterpiece. It actually has the audaciousness to make you think, and at its heart, underneath all the Spielberg smoke and mirrors, it presents us with a truly frightening ethical dilemma: what is our responsibility for what we create? This dilemma is elucidated in the first few minutes of the movie by one of Dr. Hobby's colleagues, and it remains to haunt us throughout the entire film. What the movie boils down to, at least for me, is that if we are going to play God, then we'd damn well better be aware of the consequences of what we create. If we are going to create sentient machines, complete with human feelings and emotions - something that will be technologically possible in the very near future - we'd better be really sure what we are creating before we do it. If only the creators of the atomic bomb had taken the time to examine the consequences of their actions! However, that said, the movie is only about 2/3 good. The ending is pure Spielberg, as if he had painted such a dark picture in the first two acts that he couldn't stomach it and had to try to tack on some sort of feel-good happy ending (sort of). I thought it told us more about Steven's unresolved oedipal conflicts than resolving anything in the movie.Finally, I'd like to put a plug in to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. If Haley Joel Osment doesn't win an Oscar for this performance, then there truly is no justice in the world. His performance is truly otherworldly. Not only doesn't he blink the entire movie, but try to see if you can spot him breathing! And his transition from mechanical boy to would-be real boy is nothing short of amazing, a master of subtlety. C'mon, Hollywood! Do the Right Thing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg is a well-regarded director, with a singular style. Stanley Kubrick was also a well-regarded director with a unique and singular style. The question is, can the two styles co-exist successfully in a single movie? In `A.I.' the answer is yes, for the most part. `A.I.' is certainly darker than one might normally expect to see in a Spielberg movie. But I think that in this case, it works. The special effects are fantastic, and the acting is superb. However, it is a flawed film.I don't think it will spoil the film by telling you that `A.I.' has two endings. The first, I believe, was clearly intended to be `the' ending by Stanley Kubrick. But then the movie just sort of starts up again, and we get the Spielberg `ET' type ending where we find out if someone can go home again. It's a good way to send the audience home; but its also distracting evidence that the movie is not one seamless whole, but instead the sum of its two parts. Still -- all in all, `A.I.' is a fascinating movie I recommend you go see. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, the more you think about this film the more it reflects another facet back into your face. It is a diamond in the rough, it will not be cleaned for years ( and even then it will be flawed or dirtied in the process or 1000's of muddied minds like my own) The execution at times was drawn out. I agree with many comments regarding the protracted ending. They could have let the boy rust staring at the blue fairy and it would have worked just fine.. if not better.If they had made a little more clues about the final "world" we end up in there may be more appreciation of its role in the film.If used, it could have constricted and done in a much more poignant fashion. [though the heck if kubrick would have done it that way , or shall i bite my tongue in looking back at strangelove it its tactics]I could go on and on and segment the film and analyze, but it is beyond a user comment. You don't want to hear my or others babbling about.In view of that: it is wonderful, could have been better in parts. (of course we can easily say that of any film, especially one that is 15 years in the works by kubrick and 4 writers later).Worth seeing : please though , I do not think this is for children. Late teens and older perhaps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thought provoking film from two of cinema's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I just want to say that I was brought to tears twice during this film. Personally, this indicates that the film was great, since I rarely cry during movies (even the "tearjerkers"). Anyway, I found this film to be quite thought provoking. Despite what some critics have said about it, I felt the merging of Kubrick and Spielberg's film styles worked quite well. It is definitely NOT a children's fairy tale movie, rather, it is an adult film. One could say that "A.I" is either a dark version of a Spielberg film or Kubrick lite. Either way it works. Briefly, the story concerns the journey a young mecha (mechanical being)named David takes to find the Blue Fairy (she of Pinocchio fame)to make him real. Along the way he encounters Gigolo Joe, a lover robot, who helps him find the Blue Fairy. As he did in "The Sixth Sense", Haley Joel Osment gives another outstanding performance. He is truly an accomplished and gifted actor who just happens to be a child. He carries this film and does it well. David may be a robot child, but I found him heartbreaking, especially in the scene when his human mom abandons him in the forest. Jude Law is great in a small role (that I wish I could have seen more of--but that's because I absolutely love him). There are a couple of details (which I won't divulge due to it's importance to the plot)that had me wondering when they occured. But that's what makes this a film stay with you long after you see it. Personally, I will see it again after I tire of the other noisy special effects laden movies that will populate the rest of summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think one criterion for a movie being worth seeing is that it stays in your thoughts for some time afterwards and gives you alot to think about. AI certainly falls in that category for me. Yes, as may have said, the ending sequence is a weak one, and seems not to fit the mood of the rest of the movie. But having said that, this movie is worth seeing. It is very emotionally affecting. Halley Joel Osment creates a performance that is unbelievable for one so young. He takes David from a creepy first intro and transitions him subtly to being more human than some of the humans in the movie.This story is (I think) to be seen as a sort of futuristic fairy tale. I think this would have been more gratifying if such strong references to the Pinnochio story hadn't been thrown in as much.This could have been a great movie, but as such, though flawed, it is valuable, thought-provoking and disturbing. I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

And when the alien started to "talk" to David... well ... i had no more pepsi.

		<fullReview>I left this film feeling like Spielberg owes me 2 1/2 hours. The film's special effects were wonderful. Unfortunately, almost everything else about it bothered me.To give credit where it's due, Hailey Joel Osment took what he was given to work with, and worked it hard. His performance absolutely was a bright spot. Jude Law had less to work with, but gave it a good shot as well. The rest of the cast became also-rans in Law and Osment's wake.More than the moments of stilted dialog, what pained me most were the lack of motivations for many of the character's actions. Add to that a portrayal of the future that seemed skewed at best and two false endings and you'll leave the theatre feeling much the way I did: Short-changed and mildly angry.I thought it held such promise. What a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a visually impressive well acted piece of techno garbage. Don't fault the actors - they did well enough. Don't fault the special effects people -- they did very well. Fault the writing, most notably Steven Spielberg, for whom I have a wealth of respect, but whose work on this film falls far short of his usual norms. The story's premise is fatally flawed, it's telling is worse, and the bizarre ending could have and should have been totally avoided.While turning Pinocchio into a post-modern fairy tale probably sounded like a good idea at the time, the actual execution of the movie has given us something that almost ranks with the worst of the Saturday Night Live Specials (it's Pat, et al).That being said, Haley Joel Osment again turns in a good performance, showing us that his talents, once refined and matured into adulthood, may very well be enjoyed on the screen for decades to come. Jude Law also puts in a thoroughly enjoyable performance as the gigolo robot with the onboard speaker system. William Hurt was good in his too-brief scenes, though his character was left largely undeveloped. Truly, the teddy bear steals the show and should be up for the Best Supporting Stuffed Robot Oscar.The effects of the over-sexualized Rouge Town were visually stunning, but overly cold and dreary, and the characters seemed somehow misplaced. Worse, though, then ending leaves much to be desired, and the entire last half-hour could easily have been removed. While I thoroughly enjoy Ben Kingsley as an actor, his narration on this film was entirely unnecessary and often duplicative to the onscreen story.So, in summary: a 3 out of 10. One point for the effects, one for the acting, one for the teddy bear, and a lengthy trip to the woodshed for Mr. Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg makes movies that well, roughly 90% of the population loves. Movies with universal themes such as love and hope put in science fiction-oriented settings and plots. Movies that make sense though. Movies where things happen for a reason other than to make the movie longer and show off special effects.Well, this movie was about love and hope, and there were aliens and robots galore, each a science fiction mainstay unto its own. The difference here is, nothing made sense. The plot to this movie was so horribly contrived! It's as though they ran out of ways to show off the special effects and thus just came up with the most outlandish possible course of events to unravel.Now I'm not going to spoil this movie for those who wish for some reason to see this special effects spectacular, though I don't feel this movie is worth leaving unspoiled. I wish someone had spoiled it for me. Then I wouldn't have been left scratching my head afterwards. If there was some sort of deep philosophical point to this movie, I completely missed it. Godard and Fellini were more coherent in transmitting themes.Oh yea, and Haley Joel Osment turns in his creepiest performance since "the Jeff Foxworthy Show."</fullReview>

It is definitely not a children's movie.I really enjoyed "A.I." I liked all the details, the high level of language, the complexity and the time span. My wife felt it was too slow and dragged at times. I knew this without her telling my by the amount of sighing that was going on. We both thought it was over when suddenly the third part of the movie began. I was torn between the enjoyment of seeing "what happened to David," and the drudgery of dragging the movie on another 20-30 minutes."A.I." had a great deal of eye candy, wonderfully done digital effects, a very believable future (until the third part of the movie), and a wonderful soundtrack.The movie was an emotional roller coaster, and at times I felt my self switching loyalties from David, to the robot creators, and back to David. The most likeable and memorable characters were Teddy (a supertoy bear) and Gigolo Joe (Jude Law's character).Unfortunately, I feel this is another movie for which Osmet and Spielberg deserve awards but will not receive.I'll be buying this DVD whether my wife wants to see it again or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie raised many questions such as "What is this movie about?", "Where are they going with this theme?", and "When is this movie going to end?" Some people on this site saw brilliance, I only saw confusion (It's Stanley's movie, no...wait..it's Steven's movie!) If you're REALLY into movies, you'll probably see it anyway. But if you're a casual movie-goer looking to be entertained for a couple of hours, don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, a few things could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. Obviously it was visually brilliant, and the acting was incredible. I think Osment is the frontrunner so far for best actor. Anyone who has a close relationship with their mom had to at least get teary eyed at the end. I am a momma's boy, so I cried my eyes out. There were a few noteably problems:First, the flesh fair..........just not necessary, and pretty much lame. They could've done this scene in three minutes, instead they sort of dwelled on it for awhile.Second, of course, the aliens. Firstly, I don't like the idea at all. Secondly, at least make them look like some sort of being instead of being way to CGI. The only justification I can think of for their presence is that how else could you set up that emotional one day meeting at the end?Overall, I recommend this movie, especially to those who are very close to your moms. Go see the movie with her, and hold her hand for the last twenty minutes. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly the most boring movie that I have seen this year. Spielberg could have edited out at least a half hour out of this movie and nothing would have been lost. In my opinion, most of the editing could of been done in the first and last acts. Like most S.F. morality stories that have been made into movies, this one did not work. This movie had shocking scenes only if you have never read any S.F. at all. I must give credit however, the sets, special effects, and filming of this movie were awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking yet not as great as it could have been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think one criterion for a movie being worth seeing is that it stays in your thoughts for some time afterwards and gives you alot to think about. AI certainly falls in that category for me. Yes, as may have said, the ending sequence is a weak one, and seems not to fit the mood of the rest of the movie. But having said that, this movie is worth seeing. It is very emotionally affecting. Halley Joel Osment creates a performance that is unbelievable for one so young. He takes David from a creepy first intro and transitions him subtly to being more human than some of the humans in the movie.This story is (I think) to be seen as a sort of futuristic fairy tale. I think this would have been more gratifying if such strong references to the Pinnochio story hadn't been thrown in as much.This could have been a great movie, but as such, though flawed, it is valuable, thought-provoking and disturbing. I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joe Gigolo - the weakest link in the plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe Gigolo, and how he works in AI's plot, are the weakest link in the film. I was left with three unanswered questions:1) Who (or what) does Joe work for? As a robot, Joe would not necessarily have a need for money himself. Who is profiting from his work, and making his "appointments"? If he is working independently, why? If he is capable of choosing to work on his own, doesn't that imply he has a free will?2) What was to be gained by framing Joe for murder, and confronting him with the killer? It would only work if the murderer destroyed Joe as well. Presumably, there would be a way to access an android's memory and discern the truth of the matter. Just connecting the android with the corpse would not explain the murder.3) Aside from a graphic description, what did Joe have to offer the young guys in the car in return for a lift to Rouge City? Money? No. Access? Seemed as if anyone could just drive in. Services? If Joe set something up, it was done offscreen. Information/directions? I would think three guys would already know how to find the place.All this is saved by a memorable performance by Jude Law.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will A.I. be forever misunderstood?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. will clearly be a film that evokes strong emotional reactions, either for or against it.First off, this movie...once again, like Eyes Wide Shut, was mis-marketed, all in hopes of making a lot of money, even though the classic "summer" audience is likely to not enjoy it that much (especially due to most people's assumption of what a Sci-Fi movie is). Some will like it, of course, particularly the more sensitive, and aware of what kind of film it was likely going to be.It's very interesting that Kubrick and Speilberg collaborated on this project and it ends up showing, I believe, that although Kubrick is a cold, analytical film maker, he has his soft HUMAN side.Speilberg does an excellent job of mimicking Kubrick's direction style, when he chooses to, but one can also see plenty of his own influence throughout. Some critics have said, "this is a Speilberg film, no doubt." But I think they are mistaken...it was a collaboration...a project that Kubrick had started, and ASKED SPECIFICALLY for Speilberg to take over.I think this is an important aspect of Artificial Intelligence.WHY did Kubrick do such a thing?I think if one understands the PRIMARY message of the picture, one can see why he chose Speilberg to direct it.Kubrick, it appears, would have had difficulty in sending the message he wanted of this film, if he had directed it.It is not completely "hoakie" as many Speilberg films can be, nor is it completely "cold" as Kubrick's. It had a little of both. It was balanced. It was not always effective in what it wanted to do, but overall it worked, because it couldn't get away from being "cheesy" and still send its message.THIS WAS A CLASSIC SCI-FI GENRE FILM.Many people think that Sci-Fi somehow translates into a lot of cool explosions and action...(the New York Times gave a good description of this understanding as...an Old Western done up with cool special effects), but this has not usually been the case. Oh, and don't get me wrong, the visual effects in A.I. are marvelous. But they compliment the story, rather than dominate it. This Kubrick understood when shooting 2001, Cameron with Alien and the Terminator (and tried with the Abyss), and now Speilberg with A.I. (as well as other films, i.e. the Star Trek series).This is something that over time will probably be appreciated more. It is both a fairy tale, and an examination of human beings and their attributes.The end sequence, which has been much criticized, although seemed a bit forced at times, was a prime example of this, and fits within the context of the films' message.Once you think about that, I think it is easier to digest. People looking for a fast paced story, sorry, you aren't going to get what you were looking for. I wonder if this was really a children's story, (as some have labeled it) or a fairy tale for adults. Most young kids are not going to understand it, and older kids, looking for the next Star Wars are probably going to get the wrong impression due to the movie's marketing campaign. And, of course, hardcore cynics will probably say how horrified they were with the effort...but REALLY...why is that so?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artificial: A Little. Intelligence: Definitely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By today's cinematic standards, this film is not very good. It has a slowly-paced plot, several gaffes in the storyline, and questionable characters. Anyone expecting a fast-paced, solid, tie-all-the-ends-together, action-adventure that are so common in today's theater will be sadly disappointed. AI reflects the futuristic outlook of the 1960's...fans of golden-age science fiction books will rejoice. AI has the beautiful quality of Arthur C. Clarke, Philip K. Dick, even Robert A. Heinlein.The plot IS rather complicated, and I will not deny that this movie is entirely too long, and the theme of the story (robots in a bleak future) is "glossed over" with contemporary appeals...but what current film isn't?Compare Artificial Intelligence to classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey and E.T. and no, you don't have a very good film. But compare it to current scifi flicks like The Matrix, etc. and you have a truly good movie.Be forewarned: AI is EXTREMELY emotional....possibly even OVERLY emotional. Several scenes are tear-jerkers...bring plenty of tissues.The ending to AI is odd and inconclusive. This (apparently) upset many movie-goers. But in my humble opinion, it left it open to controversy...what really DID happen? It's an interesting idea....I loved it. With the plot of a classic science fiction movie, but the glossed-over mood of any current scifi flick, AI is probably not a classic. But nevertheless, it is a must-see. It's merely a classic that's been mutilated by today's standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not religious enough for the masses.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers galore, you won't understand my point unless you've experienced the film) It's been almost a day since I've seen A.I., and I cannot wait to sit through this movie again. First off I should say that I am a huge fan of Kubrick and his films, and he is without a doubt the greatest film maker of our time. I should also say that I like a good deal of things that Spielberg puts his hands into. Yes, he's made some great films, but he is not the best of the best out there. I state that because of some of his sappy endings and liberty's with a storyline. However, his directing style is wide, and he should be commended for giving his time and money for some great films in the past, and also for some superb animated television as well. A.I. is a very different film for Spielberg, and only he could do this film with his vision of love and dreams. Kubrick is gone, and he most likely would have made A.I. too dark, mainly because this film is dark enough already. This movie is not a fairy tale...it is not Pinocchio. It is not for kids. Those subjects do happen to be the backbone of the plot, and those things already exist in our present "realities". A.I. also deals with other present day subjects like religion, sex, ignorance, our human psychology, and our reactions to those things in our so called modern world. This film, set in the 22nd century, should be understood, but it seems to be dismissed as just a "Spielberg" film lost in a sappy ending. Which is funny to me, because it doesn't have a sappy ending. It is sad for David that he in not real, but it is also quite hopeful and beautiful that he wants to love unconditionally. Finally it deals with the future of the planet Earth. If we make robots that do live past humans....then it seems very logical for them to make themselves better. A mirror of what humans do now for themselves, but without such the short life span that we encounter. The last bits of the film may be slightly over the top on the pulling of the heartstrings, but I did learn that even future A.I.'s could dream, and want to live a lifespan of peace, happiness, and most importantly, with a knowledge of their past creators for their future selves. The next step of evolution is upon us. It's not so bad either, because they will be here, even after we've lived the tiniest of moments in our universe......and also, I really love my mother. I think I'll call her now and share some conversation and coffee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE*Like others have said, this film is an impressive blend of Kubrick's slowly paced, sterile/precise style...and Speilberg's soft, sentimental approach. During the slower moments in the beginning that fade into black...you can almost sense Kubrick's presence. However, cartoony moments like the motorcycles chasing the mechas, and David trying to operate the police vehicle just ooze with Speilberg's joy in the spectacle. Overall, the film is very self-aware and very well crafted.However...I've been reading other User Comments about A.I. and its really beginning to bother me. Many people are complaining about the end of the movie and the "aliens"...but...they must be misinterpreting probably the most amazing concept in the movie! THEY AREN'T ALIENS!!! The beings at the end of the movie are obviously the evolved robots -- self aware and dominant. The whole point is that the humans, in the beginning, created David so they can be loved -- much like God created Adam and Eve. Unfortunately, much like humans, the artificial intelligence evolved, became self-aware, and then dominated the planet. The robotic beings at the end of the movie are searching for the one thing that they dont have..and thats the ability to have dreams and to wish. So, much like how the humans created David to understand love, the super-intelligent robots try to create humans in order to find out the secret to desire/love. They find these things in David after discovering him in the ice, and that is how, in a way, he becomes a real boy - even if it is for a short while. He is a carrier of the "human spirit" and, therefore, becomes a representative of human beings.The film is, in my opinion, one of the most optimistic and beautiful testaments to the human spirit. Humanity's drive and aspirations are applauded as well as criticized in this film. It shows the good that comes out of creation, but, however, reminds us of its dangers. We see technology as a bi-product of our goal to realize who we are and what we want.This movie was so amazing and thought-provoking...that when the movie was over and people in the audience applauded and said, "Thank, God" as the credits started to roll...I couldn't help but feel disgusted. A.I., like any Kubrick project, has a way of p***ing people off - and I can respect that. Some people just shouldn't see movies like this..or A Clockwork Orange..or 2001....because heaven forbid they require a little introspection afterwards. Granted, the pacing of the film can be fatiguing at times - as with all Kubrick films - but ultimately it is worth it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this film a masterpiece or a disaster? That is what people everyone shall argue over. Personally, I found A.I. the former. It is a Spielberg film that Kubrick would be proud to see. Some may say it's over-sentimental, but the entire central premise, the idea that gives complete credibility to David, is his core programming that gives him a loving bond to his mother. For the entire length of time I sat in the theater, I was completely engrossed in the story of David. Those with the greatest sense of wonder and imagination are the ones that will come away from the film with pleasure. This is in my opinion the best film of the year up to this point, and the remaining films of the year probably won't change my opinion very much. It's a shame that more people can't see the film as I have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you who go to the movies to see great Cinematography, this is a movie for you. For those of you who like Kubrick's cool objective intellectual approach, this is a movie for you. For those of you hoping to see Spielberg's fairy tale playfulness (a la E.T.), this is not the movie for you. I did enjoy the movie, and found myself drawn in by the superior artistry of the film. But it is told as a cautionary tale told without humor or wit, as soul-less as the Robots it portrays. I got the impression that Spielberg's wish to honor Kubrick elbowed out his own instincts to humanize the characters.Haley Joel Osment is superb as the mechanical Pinocchio. His brilliance as a child actor can be measured in the scenes he plays opposite his "brother" Jake Thomas. It's like watching Tom Hanks opposite Ben Affleck! Women (and quite a few men) will find their hearts going out to him as he searches for his mother's love.Jude Law steals the movie in his scenes, and is reminiscent of a darker Ray Bolger in the Wizard of Oz. Overall the movie's reach is too large for someone of Spielberg's talents, a director who does well when he plays but not so well when he thinks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(My apologies to the editors if you in fact got my first one... I was not sure, I am new at this... please feel free to delete if you wish)AI is a must see movie... As I sat in the theater watching the rolling credits, I was dumbstruck at what I had just seen. While I would not go so far as to call it a "masterpiece", I was deeply moved by the tapestry of emotion that was woven within the storyline; playing both on one's paternal instincts as well as the nagging question that is deep within all of all of us... "who are we really?" There were several scenes that were not necessary... (other than to perhaps gain a PG13 rating) and for that I was quite disappointed. Jude Law's Character was weak at best, in my opinion he was really no more useful than that poor excuse for a mechanical ewok of teddy bear that accompanied them. If there was supposed to be subplot regarding Law's Character that was later "cut" that was fine. However one should not tease the audience with an introduction then pull the rug out from underneath them.Young Mr. Osment once again provided a stellar performance. I would have liked have seen a further look into the complexity involved in the development of the parent child (or machine) relations. My question is, how did dad REALLY feel about David? Osment's character possessed a pleasant innocence about him that was refreshing, and reminiscent of a time when young people where in fact that innocent and trusting. As for the ending (no spoilers I promise) I have only one question... what was Spielberg thinking?! A trinitarian approach.... 3 plots in one?I guess we can all nitpick any great movie to death, and no review will completely do this effort true justice. The only way to truly understand this movie is to see it for yourself. You will not be disappointed that much I can be sure. I will caution that despite it's pg-13 rating, I would not bring children to see this show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What might have been a wonderful package..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the late great Stanley Kubrick had lived to see the fulfillment of this project it would most certainly have been an incredible movie, an easy 10/10. As it is, Spielburg does a decent job at points in trying to capture Kubrick's style, pulling off the unnerving, emotionally charged "Kubrick effect" quite well in certain scenes. Oh yes, I have complaints.. but the praise first.. :-)One particularly well-done scene that seems close to the way in which I would have imagined Kubrick directing it is the scene in which David destroys his duplicate mecha towards the end of the film. The mixed emotions that this piece generated reminds me of some of Kubrick's best works (certain scenes in ACO, FMG, 2001). Unfortunately, the majority of the movie does not do this, and Kubrick's stunning and often lengthy visuals are missing from the majority of it. Spielburg is certainly a great director in his own right, but Kubrick was an artist. I firmly believe that you can freeze-frame almost any given instant from any Kubrick film and find a pure piece of art. This is most certainly not true of AI. But that's all well and good, close to what I expected.There were great parts: the competition between the "brothers", the mother's desertion of the child, the flesh fair, the wooden dialogs with joe, the afore-mentioned destruction of the dupe, and definately the underwater patronage to the blue fairy. And then.. then it all went horribly wrong.I completely agree with the numerous other reviewers that the last 30 minutes of this movie never should have seen the light of day. I've been trying to convince myself since I saw the movie that the epilogue never really happened, that the movie ended underwater with David repeatedly whispering the same words over and over to the blue fairy. This is what Kubrick would have done. But not Spielburg.. ugh...I won't even take the time to go into everything that was wrong with the Disney-fied ending tacked on by the director. Instead, I'll just hope that the DVD version will feature a shorter "original intent" cut of the film that completely leaves this mess out of it. Ugh, what crap. I'll leave you with one thought: isn't it somehow ironic that Spielburg decided to nail on this sappy everyone-get-happy epilogue when it was Kubrick's own decision when making A Clockwork Orange to leave off that sappy ending that Burgess's publishers originally demanded before publication? This flies in the face of everything that made Kubrick's movies great and perfectly demonstrates why the director of the film will never be of the same calibre. It seems that Spielburg has done an injustice not just to us as viewers, but to the memory and eternal spirit of a great artist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really, this film, although marred by Spielberg's influences at points (END!), is a haunting portrait of our futuristic society, from the obvious Kubrick influences such as the neo-organic cityscapes (futuristic N.Y.C.) and clinical, to Spielberg's good to moderate job of attempting to imitate the cinematography done by Kubrick, this story based upon a short by Brian Aldiss ("Super-toys Last All Summer Long") has aspects of classic Kubrick (i.e. "2001: A Space Odyssey", "A Clockwork Orange"). Despite Spielberg's reverting to happy notions around the end, the tale when combined with John Williams' excellent score was at times disturbing. Overall, a great film very much worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artificial Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no shortage of "artificial intelligence" here. It's not only the subject matter, it's evident in the sloppy storyline, the treatment, the whole shebang. Make no mistake, this movie *is* artificial. As Mr. Ebert has already said, they got the "artificial" part down pat; the "intelligence" part, however, is missing."Artificial Heart" might be another title. It just *looks* like there's a heart ticking in it; it just *looks* like it's smiling; it just *acts* like it loves you; it just *looks* like it's thinking... You think I'm referring to one of the movie's creations? I'm not - I'm refering to the movie. There's hardly a character with depth; they only serve the plotline. There's a gigolo character in it who personifies the movie entirely: such a slick performer, he looks too good to be true, he acts the part perfectly... but we (or the customer) forgives him because he's obviously not pretending to be anything other than a simulacrum. It's harder for me to forgive Spielberg this movie, because he's pretending to be Kubrick. He's a pretender to the throne.I thought it was too slick. Like an old grade-B movie done up by a 21st century ad exec. Characters speak in *speeches*. They have as much depth as puppets - in other words, as much depth as you, the audience, willingly gives them. (I read somewhere a director commenting about how easy it was to shoot animal &amp; baby movies, because all you had to do was sandwich the subject's appealing face-shot in an emotional setting and the context would trick the audience into believing the subject had the same emotion.) Be forewarned: holes abound in the story. Even the warped internal logic of the thing. And the science was comic book. It's like watching a sloppy, clumsy robot imitating life... I got embarrassed for it. Metaphorically (keeping the marionette image going here), I couldn't hear the dialogue over the movie's whirring gears. I couldn't miss the clicking relays, the snapping eye movements, the jerky plot fillers trying to smooth over holes... blatant attempts to pull a viewers own heart-strings.Over-the-top? Yes. Missing the mark? Yes, maybe because of the former. It's not a movie for kids, but it's too much a mish-mash for adults. Like a kid trying to act grownup, it's a pastiche of odds &amp; ends learned from comics or Saturday morning cartoons. If you have ever read Brian Aldiss (the source of story here), or even Ray Bradbury... If you have ever seen a Kubrick film... This movie will definitely insult your intelligence, if not simultaneously the names I just mentioned.It seems aimed at an audience filled with people of *artificial intelligence* - how well one likes it is determined by how well one has been programmed ("dumbed down") by advertising &amp; recent movies. If I call this movie "cheesey," it's because in greasy-spoon pizza parlors, they know "adding cheese" covers a multitude of sins. In movies, you just keep pilin g on cheesey special effects.You want to see a far better movie on the same, exact subject (but without a cute liddle kid)? Go see Blade Runner, for one. To paraphrase a vice-president nominee in a memorable TV debate: "Excuse me, sir, I knew Mr. Kubrick's work. And Mr. Spielberg, you're no Stanley Kubrick." He's not even a Ridley Scott.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film that became a little strange in the end. Films are either realistic or fantasy. It isn't a good idea to mix the two. "AI" appears to be a film based on realism, i.e. tractable concepts. Yet, fantasy is used to bring closure to the story. I am referring to the scene with the marble-complexioned beings two thousand years in the future who recover David. Although conveivably plausable, these beings are fantasy for the viewer, and are a sharp contrast from the realistic ideas presented to us for the first two hours of the movie. In a movie like this, fantasy is sort of a crutch--taking the easy way out in finding an end to the story. Yet, even during the end, realistic concepts were incorporated--such as cloning from DNA samples. As I said, realism and fantasy are like oil and water. Perhaps if David's builders somehow programmed into him fabricated memories of his mother loving him. They could have put him to sleep, and he could have dreamed these things for all eternity....or when his battery runs out. But then again, perhaps the movie was trying to say that it would take more advanced and more civilized creatures to treat David as a human. Regardless, I'd be lying if I didn't say that I wished the Blue Fairy turned him into a real boy. Despite my problem with the ending being overall unrealistic, it was nevertheless a wonderful ending.This movie has Kubric written all over it. The minimal dialogue, the slow scenes, the imagery, the journeys, short or long. The cinematography was very 2001-A Space Odyssey-esque, as was the music. I enjoyed this film much more than any of Kubric's others, however. There was something incredibly creepy about this film. It's a touching story of how flesh and blood is not the source of love--that even a robot can feel love. (Cleverly, to keep the story more believable, David's love must be activated). Throughout the movie, however, I felt more empty than I would have had David been a real boy abandoned by his parents. Perhaps Kubric is suggesting that robots are the most innocent of all the beings, with the truest emotions most deserving of being loved back. Certainly, the robots being destroyed in the arena, although scared, never swayed from their personalities (particularly the female who simply smiled at David as acid was poured onto her). Why couldn't Kubric have been suggesting this point? After all, he was certainly suggesting that flesh and blood is the source of hatred and violence.This was one of the most thought-provoking and meaningful films I have seen. It made me think carefully about where we direct our love and why we direct it there. Perhaps, if we can learn that even machines can have emotions, we'd treat our fellow man with greater care.One more Oscar on its way for Haley Joel Osment.

		<shortDescription>so bad I want to punch myself in the face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>there are so many reasons to hate this movie: the most important one is that fairy tale does not come true. David never becomes a real boy, nor does his mother love him. He alters his wish to fit the circumstances and convinces himself that it came true. If you say the movie is a fairy tale, then it's a bad one. If you say it's Science Fiction, it's even worse. Robots programmed for love-making would never be programmed to fly a helicopter; robots that play music would probably be able to record music, also, so Law's character could record the real killer's confession to play to the police....a robot that can't eat food probably shouldn't go in the pool, either...the science doesn't work. The story mixes elements of Willy Wonka (Congratulations, David, you passed the test!); Return to Oz (Wheelies, Tick-Tock); and Hansel and Gretel. Why robots think it important to appear human is odd: they rummage for face parts when their faces serve to practical purpose (other that to generate sympathy from humans--why would robots be programmed with a survival instinct?) Robots think what they are programmed to think--the story did not say anyone was creating Blade Runner type robots, only servant lever models. Screw it, the movie sucks. I'm not wasting my time on this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding A Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's "A.I." is ambitious work that honors the vision of Stanley Kubrick which Spielberg ultimately makes his own-- a good thing. Spielberg's A.I. is a fable that takes on the nature of being human, and the nature of love. A.I. opens with Prof. Hobby (William Hurt) proposing the design of an android child that can be programmed to love it's human parents, and this love would be unconditional. A colleague poses the next logical question: Can a human love an android back? David (Haley Joel Osment)--the child android-- is placed under the care of Henry and Monica Swinton (Sam Robards and Frances O'Connor). The Swintons have an ailing young son, Martin, in cryogenic freeze. Monica has reservations about this undertaking. She develops a relationship with David. Along the way (for the one mechanical part of the story) Martin makes a recovery and returns to the Swintons'. Martin becomes jealous of David and plots his downfall. David falls out of grace due to circumstance. David must now find his place in the world. Though in his departure, Monica displays a true act of love for her "son" which goes undistinguished by David. The Spielberg screenplay from the Ian Watson screen story is coherent, though not always cohesive. There is a gaudy monster truck-like spectacle involving "mecha's" (androids) being demolished that is unnecessary, and making Martin the "evil" real son is manipulative. The movie could have been shorter. Like Pinochio (alluded to in the story), David believes that he can only be loved if he becomes a "real" boy. In his literal quest to find Pinochio's Blue Fairy, he is accompanied by Joe (Jude Law), a android prostitute. Spielberg keeps us guessing how this will all end to-- the very end. It is the search for the Holy Grail, the nature of love, that distinguishes "A.I." Perhaps one definition of love is that love is accepting someone for who they are, and for what they are NOT. What happens when that someone is a machine-- not human? "A.I." asks the worthwhile questions. Along those lines Haley Joel Osment gives an amazing performance. His David is "almost" human, and his quest in life is to be loved-- the most human of all. Osment showcases this kind of authenticity and compassion in a difficult role. The supporting cast, particularly Frances O'Connor are effective. Ultimately, Osment's David and his journey to find his place in the world keeps us inside the movie. Because we all have have thought about our place in the world, and the human legacies we will leave behind...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this film a masterpiece or a disaster? That is what people everyone shall argue over. Personally, I found A.I. the former. It is a Spielberg film that Kubrick would be proud to see. Some may say it's over-sentimental, but the entire central premise, the idea that gives complete credibility to David, is his core programming that gives him a loving bond to his mother. For the entire length of time I sat in the theater, I was completely engrossed in the story of David. Those with the greatest sense of wonder and imagination are the ones that will come away from the film with pleasure. This is in my opinion the best film of the year up to this point, and the remaining films of the year probably won't change my opinion very much. It's a shame that more people can't see the film as I have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first definitive science fiction movie of the new millennium? There are certain movies within any genre that, despite their flaws (read someone else's comment's for those), stand as a yardstick by which that genre thereafter must be judged. They are the ones that are discussed and dissected by a small minority until years later the film's significance becomes an accepted fact. Blade Runner comes to mind most readily, by virtue of content, but there is also Star Wars, 2001 and Close Encounters (the irony should not go unnoticed), The Day The Earth Stood Still, The Thing, Forbidden Planet. All flawed films, in some way, but all making a statement within the context of the genre and the time period in which it was made and all transcending their flaws to stand the test of time, becoming greater than the sum of their respective parts. Walk in prepared to be entertained and provoked; walk out with the memory of seeing a Hollywood classic of the future. Hollywood takes a lot of heat over the films it releases but sometimes they get it right; for the most part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen few films that goes off and beyond like "A.I." did. The sudden reality of the essense of the film goes beyond of what I was actually expecting. Goodness! The film is a prophecy in the making really. It seems just like a little fairy tale, but its not. Will we let ourselves reach this type of demise...in our own making? The film has breathtaking visual effects...some of the best that I have seen. Like Roeper said on his review, "it actually looks like NYC is under water." Haley Joel Osment has really outdone himself this time. I see another Oscar nomination in his future. He would probably win this time. However, this is what you expect when you put 2 legends of directing, a good cast, and smart story and good drama together. I wasn't expecting less from Spielberg to begin with.Recommendation: Adults just go see the film. I don't think a child will sit through the film. There is some action in the film and it does it loud at points, but it won't excite the child. I don't know where the critics and reviews got 140 running time from, but I calculated 3 hours and 15 minutes...excluding previews and not adding credits. Can your child sit through that?In conclusion, A.I., with startling and sometimes disturbing images, light humor and well-done plot and visuals, A.I. receives **** stars out of ****.</fullReview>

It really is immaterial which bits are Kubrick's and which are Spielberg's. The story is the key, and I urge you to read the original (very) short story and you will immediately recognize 5 key elements that endure in the movie.Quite simply, this movie is fantastic, wonderful and very reminiscent of some of the best books I ever read. Set aside your Spielberg-phobia for 2 and a half hours and sink into a crazy (very nearly possible) world.Oh... and those guys are not aliens; they're the descendents of David and his kin.

		<fullReview>Putting aside the "David Manning" wannabes, as well as those reviewers who got to where they are by the same dime "Gladiator" received so many Academy Awards, this movie was atrocious in every sense of the word.Spielberg, who hasn't written a script since before he became a businessmen above filmmaker, clearly displays to the audience just how out of touch he is with the average person... or even the average cineaste.We've heard mounds of rumors about how Kubrick actually wanted Heir Spielberg to direct his lifework, but the facts in the matter make us believe that perhaps Kubrick was correct in hating Spielberg, calling him a "jerk" on numerous occasions. The film was incredibly long, and not because Spielberg is a genius or beyond us, but rather, because he never learned that great Voltaire truism: "My essay would've been shorter... had I more to re-write it." That, and of course, the 30minute long ending that made no sense, coming out of nowhere. I don't believe I'm spoiling the film by saying that one truly believes the movie to end at a point... just for the film to go in a completely different direction one never assumed... and not in that fantastic "2001: Space Odyssey" sense. You can almost FEEL where Kubrick/Aldiss would've wanted the movie to stop... and where Corporate Hack Spielbergo took off.The dialogue was trite and petty, with melodramatic acting at its worse. Character development was non-existent, and the story (a sorry re-hashed rip-off of "Pinnochio" to be slightly forgiven only by the fact that Spielberg tells us over and over again throughout the movie that it IS a ripoff of said story) made so little sense that I honestly stayed only because I thought the film would end up being one large dream sequence.Unfortunately, Spielberg and his band of Yesman who allowed him to create such dribble are getting such rave reviews from their sponsored reviewers and from prideless worshippers that the few trueblue reviews they receive which will bash this horrible movie will be overlooked. "Hey, Kubrick was misunderstood in his time, too." Yeah, right. This movie will make a ridiculous amount of money and win Spielberg his Oscar again. So, in a way, I guess he succeeded.

		<fullReview>The positive is that Osment artfully demonstrates an emotional character that keeps people in their seats. Unfortunatly, that's about it for the positives.The movie is quite long (between 2 and 2.5 hours) and is quite tedious. While some scenes are interesting, the plot is very choppy as is the dialogue. It seems that segments were portioned together that have small links to one another. I counted at least three spots from an hour until the end where the story could have been brought to an end but wasn't.Unfortunately also the producers and directors confuse the unprepared movie watcher by constantly tweaking with the story direction and the earth year. There is never any smooth transition between parts of the story, whether it be explicit or implicit.Finally the end is completely unneccessary. Not only does A.I. start in the future, but ends up nearly 2000 years after the futuristic starting point. The creatures in the end were oddly shaped and had little to do with the story whatsoever. However, that's how this movie is characterized. There are lots of characters and scenes that have little to do with the main story and are disconnected to other parts.If you are prepared for a mental challenge, go see it...if you are going for entertainment, I recommend against it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. a worthy effort, a surprise summer thinking movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the exec at Time Warner was right. For once, a movie that goes against the idea that the summer is only for big spectacle action films.A.I. has some nice effects here and there, but it's the story that carries the movie. That *is* the movie.I recommend it highly. It's not a movie for everyone, but is a movie that seems plausible, and really makes you think where we're headed in our society.I don't want to spoil any plot or surprises, so lets just say that A.I. has some nice developing storylines that go deep into the future of what robots might mean to this world.Go see it !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Please, Get Real. This is a bomb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you loved 2001-A Space Odyssey, you'll probably love A.I. and you are probably also a pretentious idiot. Stanley Kubrick, the most overrated director of all time left his fingerprints and his dull vision all over this film. This movie blows big time. When my daughter came home and told me this was the worst movie ever, I figured I would disagree with her because I usually do. I was prepared to give this movie the widest latitude I could to prove her wrong but I couldn't. There is so much wrong with this movie and so many missed opportunities to make this a worthwhile entertainment that space does not allow me to elaborate. I will say this one thing. I feel so sorry for Haley Joel Osment, who gave the best performance he could with such poor material. I am so surprised with Spielberg's direction. I can only surmise that he was temporarily possessed by the ghost of his mentor-the less talented Kubrick.A.I. is another example of Hollywood forgetting that movies should entertain not sedate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film that became a little strange in the end. Films are either realistic or fantasy. It isn't a good idea to mix the two. "AI" appears to be a film based on realism, i.e. tractable concepts. Yet, fantasy is used to bring closure to the story. I am referring to the scene with the marble-complexioned beings two thousand years in the future who recover David. Although conveivably plausable, these beings are fantasy for the viewer, and are a sharp contrast from the realistic ideas presented to us for the first two hours of the movie. In a movie like this, fantasy is sort of a crutch--taking the easy way out in finding an end to the story. Yet, even during the end, realistic concepts were incorporated--such as cloning from DNA samples. As I said, realism and fantasy are like oil and water. Perhaps if David's builders somehow programmed into him fabricated memories of his mother loving him. They could have put him to sleep, and he could have dreamed these things for all eternity....or when his battery runs out. But then again, perhaps the movie was trying to say that it would take more advanced and more civilized creatures to treat David as a human. Regardless, I'd be lying if I didn't say that I wished the Blue Fairy turned him into a real boy. Despite my problem with the ending being overall unrealistic, it was nevertheless a wonderful ending.This movie has Kubric written all over it. The minimal dialogue, the slow scenes, the imagery, the journeys, short or long. The cinematography was very 2001-A Space Odyssey-esque, as was the music. I enjoyed this film much more than any of Kubric's others, however. There was something incredibly creepy about this film. It's a touching story of how flesh and blood is not the source of love--that even a robot can feel love. (Cleverly, to keep the story more believable, David's love must be activated). Throughout the movie, however, I felt more empty than I would have had David been a real boy abandoned by his parents. Perhaps Kubric is suggesting that robots are the most innocent of all the beings, with the truest emotions most deserving of being loved back. Certainly, the robots being destroyed in the arena, although scared, never swayed from their personalities (particularly the female who simply smiled at David as acid was poured onto her). Why couldn't Kubric have been suggesting this point? After all, he was certainly suggesting that flesh and blood is the source of hatred and violence.This was one of the most thought-provoking and meaningful films I have seen. It made me think carefully about where we direct our love and why we direct it there. Perhaps, if we can learn that even machines can have emotions, we'd treat our fellow man with greater care.One more Oscar on its way for Haley Joel Osment. As always, he was spectacular in his role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would say that A.I. is not the film Kubrick would have made and it's not typical of Spielberg. It's interesting to see the mix. At times you can say, that's Kubrick, as in the mother reading to her comatose son while classical music plays or David at the dinner table framed by a halo-like light, but at the same time the movie plays on your emotions in a way Kubrick films never do. At times the film has a cold, clinical Kubrick feel, and other times it's got a bit of that Spielberg emotion, but it's really its own thing. While it fails to be a brilliant film, and isn't in the same league with Clockwork Orange or E.T., it is a very good film. Personally I even liked the much-derided ending, although it could have been tightened a bit. My wife found the ending laughable and along with a few other people in the audience actually laughed out loud at the end, which really annoyed me. I got mad when she said the film sucked. Perhaps that's what is most Kubrick about the film; it elicits strong opinions one way or another.</fullReview>

That, and of course, the 30minute long ending that made no sense, coming out of nowhere. I don't believe I'm spoiling the film by saying that one truly believes the movie to end at a point... just for the film to go in a completely different direction one never assumed... and not in that fantastic "2001: Space Odyssey" sense.

		<shortDescription>I know understand more than ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got out of the theater less than 10 minutes ago, so I decided to write this while the movie was as fresh in my mind as possible.Let me begin with this, while I will describe the ending in vague terms, this review will contain NO SPOILERS.I now understand exactly how I would've felt back in 1968 when 2001: A Space Oddysey came out. Audiences, then as now, either "get it" or say "what the hell was that all about?" Think about it: audiences were thinking for "2001": "What was that? A baby in a sphere? A light tunnel? An old dying dude in a bed? Monkeys? A BIG BLACK STUPID BOX???"When I watched A.I., I thought of the audience. I could totally see how people who saw 2001 would laugh at certain scenes. So with A.I. There were many people, almost the entire theater, especially near the end, who were laughing and leaving the theater early. Let me be blunt: If you didn't "get" 2001, you will NOT "get" A.I.It's different, it's emotional, it's thought-provoking, it's brilliant, it's KUBRICK. He came back to life to direct this film. Only on certain occasions could you tell Spielberg couldn't help himself and had to be Spielberg. While at other times, Spielberg was somewhere else, letting Kubrick direct.Anyone who says this film sucks obviously didn't "get" it. And yes, there is something to "get" with this film.Haley Joel Osment was AWESOME. If he isn't the best child actor on the face of the earth, I wanna meet the kid who is. Jude Law wasn't as amazing, but his character wasn't really allowed to be. But still, with what he had, Jude Law was also great.Let this be a lesson to Lucas: there ARE good child actors out there. But more importantly, there are GREAT child actors out there. You suck for what you did in Episode I, but Spielberg showed you up by making this film.Let this be a lesson to Spielberg: You don't have to explain EVERYTHING to the audience. You don't have to hold the audience by the hand and hit them over the head with emotion. Let the scenes play themselves out.The voiceovers were distracting and unnessary. It'd be like Kubrick's original idea of having voiceovers in 2001: it would've been weird, and it was definately weird here.The story, while on the outset seems like a ripoff of Pinocchio, it is definately not. Even to the point of directly referencing it throughout the film. This movie is original, bold, and not for everyone. That's the one main problem: this is not a film for the audience. This is a film for that 1 or 2 percent of the population who, on seeing 2001 in the theater, stood up and cheered. I was so floored by this film that as we walked out of the theater I stopped and shouted at the top of my lungs: "That was F&amp;*@ING BRILLIANT!!!" which is what I would have said had I been in the theater of "2001" in 1968.I now love Kubrick more than ever. I have more of a personal respect and admiration for him and his work than I ever did before.Again, if you can't get into movies like 2001 that break the mold of conventional filmmaking, you will not like A.I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a excellent movie...almost.(Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing A.I. Artifical Intelligence. All I can say is what was Spielberg thinking with that ending. For two hours I sat enraptured by a story surrounded by pure Spielberg Schmaltz, and was loving it until the ending. Did we really need to know David was frozen with Teddy? Did we have to see him two thousand years into the future being unthawed and studied by aliens wishing to learn more about the human race? Personally I thought it an odd choice for a man who has won two academy awards for best director. But it wasn't my movie. Also an odd choice, choosing Chris Rock as the voice of the robot at the flesh fair. Taking what is an evil and disgusting scene with robots tortured and mutilated then adding a wise quipping robot played by Chris Rock just seemed a tad odd for a scene that should have played as a horror scene. But as I said before I did like the movie. Haley Joel Osmet better hope he can keep acting this good as he grows older, because again he excedes expectations and makes what I thought was one of the most endearing sci-fi screen characters. And Francess O'connor who I haven't heard much about also amazed me, especially in the scene where she leaves him in the woods instead of taking him to be destroyed at the robot manufactuer. Kudos should also be given to the Production Crew who create some of the most amazing futuristic landscapes since Blade Runner. But still, that ending was an odd choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you who go to the movies to see great Cinematography, this is a movie for you. For those of you who like Kubrick's cool objective intellectual approach, this is a movie for you. For those of you hoping to see Spielberg's fairy tale playfulness (a la E.T.), this is not the movie for you. I did enjoy the movie, and found myself drawn in by the superior artistry of the film. But it is told as a cautionary tale told without humor or wit, as soul-less as the Robots it portrays. I got the impression that Spielberg's wish to honor Kubrick elbowed out his own instincts to humanize the characters.Haley Joel Osment is superb as the mechanical Pinocchio. His brilliance as a child actor can be measured in the scenes he plays opposite his "brother" Jake Thomas. It's like watching Tom Hanks opposite Ben Affleck! Women (and quite a few men) will find their hearts going out to him as he searches for his mother's love.Jude Law steals the movie in his scenes, and is reminiscent of a darker Ray Bolger in the Wizard of Oz. Overall the movie's reach is too large for someone of Spielberg's talents, a director who does well when he plays but not so well when he thinks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got out of the theater less than 10 minutes ago, so I decided to write this while the movie was as fresh in my mind as possible.Let me begin with this, while I will describe the ending in vague terms, this review will contain NO SPOILERS.I now understand exactly how I would've felt back in 1968 when 2001: A Space Oddysey came out. Audiences, then as now, either "get it" or say "what the hell was that all about?" Think about it: audiences were thinking for "2001": "What was that? A baby in a sphere? A light tunnel? An old dying dude in a bed? Monkeys? A BIG BLACK STUPID BOX???"When I watched A.I., I thought of the audience. I could totally see how people who saw 2001 would laugh at certain scenes. So with A.I. There were many people, almost the entire theater, especially near the end, who were laughing and leaving the theater early. Let me be blunt: If you didn't "get" 2001, you will NOT "get" A.I.It's different, it's emotional, it's thought-provoking, it's brilliant, it's KUBRICK. He came back to life to direct this film. Only on certain occasions could you tell Spielberg couldn't help himself and had to be Spielberg. While at other times, Spielberg was somewhere else, letting Kubrick direct.Anyone who says this film sucks obviously didn't "get" it. And yes, there is something to "get" with this film.Haley Joel Osment was AWESOME. If he isn't the best child actor on the face of the earth, I wanna meet the kid who is. Jude Law wasn't as amazing, but his character wasn't really allowed to be. But still, with what he had, Jude Law was also great.Let this be a lesson to Lucas: there ARE good child actors out there. But more importantly, there are GREAT child actors out there. You suck for what you did in Episode I, but Spielberg showed you up by making this film.Let this be a lesson to Spielberg: You don't have to explain EVERYTHING to the audience. You don't have to hold the audience by the hand and hit them over the head with emotion. Let the scenes play themselves out.The voiceovers were distracting and unnessary. It'd be like Kubrick's original idea of having voiceovers in 2001: it would've been weird, and it was definately weird here.The story, while on the outset seems like a ripoff of Pinocchio, it is definately not. Even to the point of directly referencing it throughout the film. This movie is original, bold, and not for everyone. That's the one main problem: this is not a film for the audience. This is a film for that 1 or 2 percent of the population who, on seeing 2001 in the theater, stood up and cheered. I was so floored by this film that as we walked out of the theater I stopped and shouted at the top of my lungs: "That was F&amp;*@ING BRILLIANT!!!" which is what I would have said had I been in the theater of "2001" in 1968.I now love Kubrick more than ever. I have more of a personal respect and admiration for him and his work than I ever did before.Again, if you can't get into movies like 2001 that break the mold of conventional filmmaking, you will not like A.I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt, the most provocative film I have ever seen. I can't get the movie out of my head.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen a Kubrick film in the theater. I was too young to see Full Metal Jacket, I wasn't born yet to see The Shining, and I really didn't want to see Eyes Wide Shut. Well, I just came back from seeing one. Don't let the fact that Spielberg gets the credit for writing and directing this. AI is a Kubrick movie.First, let me show you the VAST difference between the two directors. Spielberg makes three kinds of movies: Wonder movies (science fiction films that inspire awe like Close Encounters and ET), Adventure movies (movies that take the audience on a fun ride like the Indiana Jones films and Jurassic Park), and lastly, his War movies (which includes Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List). In simpler words, Spielberg makes fun movies. He is an entertainer. He shoots his films with bright colors and swooping movement.Kubrick was an artist. No two of his movies are alike, but there are subtle differences. I can not put into words Kubrick's style. I just know it when I see it.AI is not shot like a Spielberg movie. It is shot like a Kubrick movie. It does have Spielberg's patented usage of lights against dark backgrounds. But the movie is SO different than anything Spielberg has done before. Spielberg has never done a movie about ideas. He's toyed with it, but Spielberg is a storyteller, not an artist.Okay, you want to know about the movie. Well, this movie was written and directed by Stanley Kubrick. I don't care what the poster or credits say, KUBRICK MADE THIS MOVIE.I swear, I just don't know what to think of this movie. It is a brilliant movie, but it has some serious flaws. I have never come out of a movie totally bewildered but at the same time amazed at what I had just seen. AI is an amazing movie, no matter what anybody says.The acting in this movie is BRILLIANT. Haley Joel Osment is the best actor I have ever seen. His ability to portray a robot is uncanny. This kid NEEDS a best actor Oscar for this, and trust me, he's getting it. Jude Law is also equally brilliant. Law looks fake. He acts fake. His movements and mannerisms are fake. And it's supposed to be that way. The guy looks like a robot. He is defiantly up for best supporting actor.Okay, so what did I think of the movie. Well, David (Osment) is a robot. He is programmed to love, or it just seems that way. This is such a weird movie because we can't love David. He is a robot. No matter what he does, he is a robot and he has no feelings. How can you love a robot? But honestly, as the film moves on, I think David learns. He really becomes more human with every passing second.To be blunt, the movie is pretty weird. I mean, I just don't know what to think. I'm a movie critic, and I can't express what this movie is like. It has totally blown me away. I have to see it again. Not because I didn't catch something, but so I can re-experience the most breathtaking film I have ever seen.I do want to pick on the ending. I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE IT AWAY! I don't believe in spoiling people. But the ending just seems like it's prolonging the inevitable. It just keeps going. Once you think it's over, oh no, another ACT comes in. Oh, and those are robots not aliens.There's just one last thing I want to say. When I first learned that Jude Law's character was a gigolo robot, I thought it was the dumbest idea I had ever heard of. But now I understand it. Both David and Joe are programmed to love, just in different ways. Joe loves physically, and David loves emotionally.Overall, SEE THIS MOVIE. It is not the greatest movie ever made. It will leave you just as unsatisfied as it left me. But this is an awesome movie both in scope and in presentation. But the weirdest thing is how it stuck in my head. I can't stop thinking about it. Weird. The whole experience of this movie is cold, uneasy, disturbing and uncomfortable, but for some reason, it is truly breathtaking and awe inspiring. I mean, that's what Kubrick movies do. There is one thing about AI that Kubrick never did. AI has heart. It truly does. And heart is something Spielberg does well.AI is the first real artistic movie, both visually and metaphorically, that Spielberg has done with the possible exception of Schindler's List. This is Kubrick, ladies and gentlemen. He rose from the grave and made this movie. Get over it. There's one thing no one can deny: this movie is historic and an instant classic, even though it isn't that good. Well, one thing's for sure: AI makes you appreciate humanity.No rating, just read the review. My head hurts.PS: THIS IS NO KID MOVIE! DO NOT BRING YOUR KIDS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Absolute 10! A Wonderful, Haunting, Disturbing Film! *May have a spoiler or two*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen few films that goes off and beyond like "A.I." did. The sudden reality of the essense of the film goes beyond of what I was actually expecting. Goodness! The film is a prophecy in the making really. It seems just like a little fairy tale, but its not. Will we let ourselves reach this type of demise...in our own making? The film has breathtaking visual effects...some of the best that I have seen. Like Roeper said on his review, "it actually looks like NYC is under water." Haley Joel Osment has really outdone himself this time. I see another Oscar nomination in his future. He would probably win this time. However, this is what you expect when you put 2 legends of directing, a good cast, and smart story and good drama together. I wasn't expecting less from Spielberg to begin with.Recommendation: Adults just go see the film. I don't think a child will sit through the film. There is some action in the film and it does it loud at points, but it won't excite the child. I don't know where the critics and reviews got 140 running time from, but I calculated 3 hours and 15 minutes...excluding previews and not adding credits. Can your child sit through that?In conclusion, A.I., with startling and sometimes disturbing images, light humor and well-done plot and visuals, A.I. receives **** stars out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a excellent movie...almost.(Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing A.I. Artifical Intelligence. All I can say is what was Spielberg thinking with that ending. For two hours I sat enraptured by a story surrounded by pure Spielberg Schmaltz, and was loving it until the ending. Did we really need to know David was frozen with Teddy? Did we have to see him two thousand years into the future being unthawed and studied by aliens wishing to learn more about the human race? Personally I thought it an odd choice for a man who has won two academy awards for best director. But it wasn't my movie. Also an odd choice, choosing Chris Rock as the voice of the robot at the flesh fair. Taking what is an evil and disgusting scene with robots tortured and mutilated then adding a wise quipping robot played by Chris Rock just seemed a tad odd for a scene that should have played as a horror scene. But as I said before I did like the movie. Haley Joel Osmet better hope he can keep acting this good as he grows older, because again he excedes expectations and makes what I thought was one of the most endearing sci-fi screen characters. And Francess O'connor who I haven't heard much about also amazed me, especially in the scene where she leaves him in the woods instead of taking him to be destroyed at the robot manufactuer. Kudos should also be given to the Production Crew who create some of the most amazing futuristic landscapes since Blade Runner. But still, that ending was an odd choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do they have this "one line summary"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film that became a little strange in the end. Films are either realistic or fantasy. It isn't a good idea to mix the two. "AI" appears to be a film based on realism, i.e. tractable concepts. Yet, fantasy is used to bring closure to the story. I am referring to the scene with the marble-complexioned beings two thousand years in the future who recover David. Although plausible (who knows what will exist in the future), these beings are fantasy for the viewer, and are a sharp contrast from the realistic ideas presented to us for the first two hours of the movie. In a movie like this, fantasy is sort of a crutch--taking the easy way out in finding an end to the story. Yet, even during the end, realistic concepts were incorporated--such as cloning from DNA samples. As I said, realism and fantasy are like oil and water. Perhaps if David's builders somehow programmed into him fabricated memories of his mother loving him. They could have put him to sleep, and he could have dreamed these things for all eternity....or when his battery runs out. But then again, perhaps the movie was trying to say that it would take more advanced and more civilized creatures to treat David as a human. Regardless, I'd be lying if I didn't say that I wished the Blue Fairy turned him into a real boy. Despite my problem with the ending being overall unrealistic, it was nevertheless a wonderful ending.This movie has Kubrick written all over it. The minimal dialogue, the slow scenes, the imagery, the journeys, short or long. The cinematography was very 2001-A Space Odyssey-esque, as was the music. I enjoyed this film much more than any of Kubrick's others, however. There was something incredibly creepy about this film. It's a touching story of how flesh and blood is not the source of love--that even a robot can feel love. (Cleverly, to keep the story more believable, David's love must be activated). Throughout the movie, however, I felt more empty than I would have had David been a real boy abandoned by his parents. Perhaps Kubrick is suggesting that robots are the most innocent of all the beings, with the truest emotions most deserving of being loved back. Certainly, the robots being destroyed in the arena, although scared, never swayed from their personalities (particularly the female who simply smiled at David as acid was poured onto her). Why couldn't Kubrick have been suggesting this point? After all, he was certainly suggesting that flesh and blood is the source of hatred and violence.This was one of the most thought-provoking and meaningful films I have seen. It made me think carefully about where we direct our love and why we direct it there. Perhaps, if we can learn that even machines can have emotions, we'd treat our fellow man with greater care.One more Oscar on its way for Haley Joel Osment. As always, he was spectacular in his role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique hybrid vision. Science Fiction on an Epic Scale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie; I enjoyed it very much. It's a great deal more thought out than the usual shoot-em-up style action sci-fi. There are elements of this that are clearly the result of Spielberg, and then the next scene will be almost eerily familiar in tone to such Kubrick works as the Shining or 2001:A Space Odyssey. The pacing is overall slow and deliberate, but be prepared for a few jumps from one time to one much later. Very entertaining and good food for thought about what might actualy happen someday in the future, almost the definition of good, solid science fiction. Some have commented on characters who appear late in the film, and I think their identity is subject to debate, but I think they are just more robots. Haley Joel Osment is excellent, giving a multifaceted performance of the mecha boy, and Jude Law is kind of weird but funny as a mecha gigolo. The special effects, it should be noted, are the best yet. Seamless and very convincing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing artificial about this intelligent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid I read so many sci-fi novels and the majority filled me with wonder and awe. They forced me to ask questions about the world in which I live. This is what sci-fi is all about. Then I became hooked on the "pulpish" sci-fi of Star Trek and the oh-so-many failed attempts at making a real sci-fi movie.Don't get me wrong; there are many great sf movies... though none of note since Bladerunner hit the screens.A.I. lives up to the same premises that all good sci-fi should; it is filled with topical debate material and asks some pretty serious questions and some very topical questions. It really is immaterial which bits are Kubrick's and which are Spielberg's. The story is the key, and I urge you to read the original (very) short story and you will immediately recognize 5 key elements that endure in the movie.Quite simply, this movie is fantastic, wonderful and very reminiscent of some of the best books I ever read. Set aside your Spielberg-phobia for 2 and a half hours and sink into a crazy (very nearly possible) world.Oh... and those guys are not aliens; they're the descendents of David and his kin. Two clues: Joe's "in the end all that will be left will be us" speech, and the sentence "he is an original; he will remember the humans". Geddit?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In reality, quite awful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Putting aside the "David Manning" wannabes, as well as those reviewers who got to where they are by the same dime "Gladiator" received so many Academy Awards, this movie was atrocious in every sense of the word.Spielberg, who hasn't written a script since before he became a businessmen above filmmaker, clearly displays to the audience just how out of touch he is with the average person... or even the average cineaste.We've heard mounds of rumors about how Kubrick actually wanted Heir Spielberg to direct his lifework, but the facts in the matter make us believe that perhaps Kubrick was correct in hating Spielberg, calling him a "jerk" on numerous occasions. The film was incredibly long, and not because Spielberg is a genius or beyond us, but rather, because he never learned that great Voltaire truism: "My essay would've been shorter... had I more to re-write it." That, and of course, the 30minute long ending that made no sense, coming out of nowhere. I don't believe I'm spoiling the film by saying that one truly believes the movie to end at a point... just for the film to go in a completely different direction one never assumed... and not in that fantastic "2001: Space Odyssey" sense. You can almost FEEL where Kubrick/Aldiss would've wanted the movie to stop... and where Corporate Hack Spielbergo took off.The dialogue was trite and petty, with melodramatic acting at its worse. Character development was non-existent, and the story (a sorry re-hashed rip-off of "Pinnochio" to be slightly forgiven only by the fact that Spielberg tells us over and over again throughout the movie that it IS a ripoff of said story) made so little sense that I honestly stayed only because I thought the film would end up being one large dream sequence.Unfortunately, Spielberg and his band of Yesman who allowed him to create such dribble are getting such rave reviews from their sponsored reviewers and from prideless worshippers that the few trueblue reviews they receive which will bash this horrible movie will be overlooked. "Hey, Kubrick was misunderstood in his time, too." Yeah, right. This movie will make a ridiculous amount of money and win Spielberg his Oscar again. So, in a way, I guess he succeeded. Congrats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is quite a disappointment for me. It is neither the awe inspiring spectacle that Spielberg is noted for nor a compelling drama. The main problem seems to be is the muddled narrative. It is all over the place. Without getting too much into the particulars of the plot, the film starts off okay, but by the second act the film starts to drift aimlessly and never gets back on track. In the last reel or so, the film rolls off a series of endings which mostly fail to generate the emotional impact that is Spielberg's trademark. Some semblance of a theme survives, but its impact is weakened by the film's lack of urgency. The theme is also not brought out in the most compelling way. If you have any interest in seeing this film, it's probably better to see it in the theatre. If you see it on cable, you're bound to start channel surfing about thirty or forty minutes in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is quite a disappointment for me. It is neither the awe inspiring spectacle that Spielberg is noted for nor a compelling drama. The main problem seems to be is the muddled narrative. It is all over the place. Without getting too much into the particulars of the plot, the film starts off okay, but by the second act the film starts to drift aimlessly and never gets back on track. In the last reel or so, the film rolls off a series of endings which mostly fail to generate the emotional impact that is Spielberg's trademark. Some semblance of a theme survives, but its impact is weakened by the film's lack of urgency. The theme is also not brought out in the most compelling way. If you have any interest in seeing this film, it's probably better to see it in the theatre. If you see it on cable, you're bound to start channel surfing about thirty or forty minutes in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In reality, quite awful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Putting aside the "David Manning" wannabes, as well as those reviewers who got to where they are by the same dime "Gladiator" received so many Academy Awards, this movie was atrocious in every sense of the word.Spielberg, who hasn't written a script since before he became a businessmen above filmmaker, clearly displays to the audience just how out of touch he is with the average person... or even the average cineaste.We've heard mounds of rumors about how Kubrick actually wanted Heir Spielberg to direct his lifework, but the facts in the matter make us believe that perhaps Kubrick was correct in hating Spielberg, calling him a "jerk" on numerous occasions. The film was incredibly long, and not because Spielberg is a genius or beyond us, but rather, because he never learned that great Voltaire truism: "My essay would've been shorter... had I more to re-write it." That, and of course, the 30minute long ending that made no sense, coming out of nowhere. I don't believe I'm spoiling the film by saying that one truly believes the movie to end at a point... just for the film to go in a completely different direction one never assumed... and not in that fantastic "2001: Space Odyssey" sense. You can almost FEEL where Kubrick/Aldiss would've wanted the movie to stop... and where Corporate Hack Spielbergo took off.The dialogue was trite and petty, with melodramatic acting at its worse. Character development was non-existent, and the story (a sorry re-hashed rip-off of "Pinnochio" to be slightly forgiven only by the fact that Spielberg tells us over and over again throughout the movie that it IS a ripoff of said story) made so little sense that I honestly stayed only because I thought the film would end up being one large dream sequence.Unfortunately, Spielberg and his band of Yesman who allowed him to create such dribble are getting such rave reviews from their sponsored reviewers and from prideless worshippers that the few trueblue reviews they receive which will bash this horrible movie will be overlooked. "Hey, Kubrick was misunderstood in his time, too." Yeah, right. This movie will make a ridiculous amount of money and win Spielberg his Oscar again. So, in a way, I guess he succeeded. Congrats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding A Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's "A.I." is ambitious work that honors the vision of Stanley Kubrick which Spielberg ultimately makes his own-- a good thing. Spielberg's A.I. is a fable that takes on the nature of being human, and the nature of love. A.I. opens with Prof. Hobby (William Hurt) proposing the design of an android child that can be programmed to love it's human parents, and this love would be unconditional. A colleague poses the next logical question: Can a human love an android back? David (Haley Joel Osment)--the child android-- is placed under the care of Henry and Monica Swinton (Sam Robards and Frances O'Connor). The Swintons have an ailing young son, Martin, in cryogenic freeze. Monica has reservations about this undertaking. She develops a relationship with David. Along the way (for the one mechanical part of the story) Martin makes a recovery and returns to the Swintons'. Martin becomes jealous of David and plots his downfall. David falls out of grace due to circumstance. David must now find his place in the world. Though in his departure, Monica displays a true act of love for her "son" which goes undistinguished by David. The Spielberg screenplay from the Ian Watson screen story is coherent, though not always cohesive. There is a gaudy monster truck-like spectacle involving "mecha's" (androids) being demolished that is unnecessary, and making Martin the "evil" real son is manipulative. The movie could have been shorter. Like Pinochio (alluded to in the story), David believes that he can only be loved if he becomes a "real" boy. In his literal quest to find Pinochio's Blue Fairy, he is accompanied by Joe (Jude Law), a android prostitute. Spielberg keeps us guessing how this will all end to-- the very end. It is the search for the Holy Grail, the nature of love, that distinguishes "A.I." Perhaps one definition of love is that love is accepting someone for who they are, and for what they are NOT. What happens when that someone is a machine-- not human? "A.I." asks the worthwhile questions. Along those lines Haley Joel Osment gives an amazing performance. His David is "almost" human, and his quest in life is to be loved-- the most human of all. Osment showcases this kind of authenticity and compassion in a difficult role. The supporting cast, particularly Frances O'Connor are effective. Ultimately, Osment's David and his journey to find his place in the world keeps us inside the movie. Because we all have have thought about our place in the world, and the human legacies we will leave behind...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I know understand more than ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got out of the theater less than 10 minutes ago, so I decided to write this while the movie was as fresh in my mind as possible.Let me begin with this, while I will describe the ending in vague terms, this review will contain NO SPOILERS.I now understand exactly how I would've felt back in 1968 when 2001: A Space Oddysey came out. Audiences, then as now, either "get it" or say "what the hell was that all about?" Think about it: audiences were thinking for "2001": "What was that? A baby in a sphere? A light tunnel? An old dying dude in a bed? Monkeys? A BIG BLACK STUPID BOX???"When I watched A.I., I thought of the audience. I could totally see how people who saw 2001 would laugh at certain scenes. So with A.I. There were many people, almost the entire theater, especially near the end, who were laughing and leaving the theater early. Let me be blunt: If you didn't "get" 2001, you will NOT "get" A.I.It's different, it's emotional, it's thought-provoking, it's brilliant, it's KUBRICK. He came back to life to direct this film. Only on certain occasions could you tell Spielberg couldn't help himself and had to be Spielberg. While at other times, Spielberg was somewhere else, letting Kubrick direct.Anyone who says this film sucks obviously didn't "get" it. And yes, there is something to "get" with this film.Haley Joel Osment was AWESOME. If he isn't the best child actor on the face of the earth, I wanna meet the kid who is. Jude Law wasn't as amazing, but his character wasn't really allowed to be. But still, with what he had, Jude Law was also great.Let this be a lesson to Lucas: there ARE good child actors out there. But more importantly, there are GREAT child actors out there. You suck for what you did in Episode I, but Spielberg showed you up by making this film.Let this be a lesson to Spielberg: You don't have to explain EVERYTHING to the audience. You don't have to hold the audience by the hand and hit them over the head with emotion. Let the scenes play themselves out.The voiceovers were distracting and unnessary. It'd be like Kubrick's original idea of having voiceovers in 2001: it would've been weird, and it was definately weird here.The story, while on the outset seems like a ripoff of Pinocchio, it is definately not. Even to the point of directly referencing it throughout the film. This movie is original, bold, and not for everyone. That's the one main problem: this is not a film for the audience. This is a film for that 1 or 2 percent of the population who, on seeing 2001 in the theater, stood up and cheered. I was so floored by this film that as we walked out of the theater I stopped and shouted at the top of my lungs: "That was F&amp;*@ING BRILLIANT!!!" which is what I would have said had I been in the theater of "2001" in 1968.I now love Kubrick more than ever. I have more of a personal respect and admiration for him and his work than I ever did before.Again, if you can't get into movies like 2001 that break the mold of conventional filmmaking, you will not like A.I.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would say that A.I. is not the film Kubrick would have made and it's not typical of Spielberg. It's interesting to see the mix. At times you can say, that's Kubrick, as in the mother reading to her comatose son while classical music plays or David at the dinner table framed by a halo-like light, but at the same time the movie plays on your emotions in a way Kubrick films never do. At times the film has a cold, clinical Kubrick feel, and other times it's got a bit of that Spielberg emotion, but it's really its own thing. While it fails to be a brilliant film, and isn't in the same league with Clockwork Orange or E.T., it is a very good film. Personally I even liked the much-derided ending, although it could have been tightened a bit. My wife found the ending laughable and along with a few other people in the audience actually laughed out loud at the end, which really annoyed me. I got mad when she said the film sucked. Perhaps that's what is most Kubrick about the film; it elicits strong opinions one way or another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Stanley Kubrick's movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was sad to hear of Stanley Kubrick's death a couple years back, also knowing he wouldn't live to direct A.I., but thank God his longtime friend Steven Spielberg took on the project. The movie exceeded my expectations because I thought it would be another E.T./Close Encounters feel-good movie. The special effects depicting a futuristic New Jersey metropolis and a now decrepit and underwater New York City were outstanding. I know Kubrick would have made this a colder and less personal movie and wouldn't have had such a sappy ending. Haley Joel Osment is such an outstanding actor for his age, never playing one of those annoying cutsey precocious types. Watch the begining of the last 30 minutes and it will remind you of 2001's "light show". I wished this movie had not been so sentimental, because I was pretty depressed watching the last 10-15 minutes, knowing that was not an actual event that really happened to the boy and that his adopted mother really didn't really love him. SPOILERS AHEAD! Did the boy live in eternity with his mother or was it just for one day?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt, the most provocative film I have ever seen. I can't get the movie out of my head.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen a Kubrick film in the theater. I was too young to see Full Metal Jacket, I wasn't born yet to see The Shining, and I really didn't want to see Eyes Wide Shut. Well, I just came back from seeing one. Don't let the fact that Spielberg gets the credit for writing and directing this. AI is a Kubrick movie.First, let me show you the VAST difference between the two directors. Spielberg makes three kinds of movies: Wonder movies (science fiction films that inspire awe like Close Encounters and ET), Adventure movies (movies that take the audience on a fun ride like the Indiana Jones films and Jurassic Park), and lastly, his War movies (which includes Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List). In simpler words, Spielberg makes fun movies. He is an entertainer. He shoots his films with bright colors and swooping movement.Kubrick was an artist. No two of his movies are alike, but there are subtle differences. I can not put into words Kubrick's style. I just know it when I see it.AI is not shot like a Spielberg movie. It is shot like a Kubrick movie. It does have Spielberg's patented usage of lights against dark backgrounds. But the movie is SO different than anything Spielberg has done before. Spielberg has never done a movie about ideas. He's toyed with it, but Spielberg is a storyteller, not an artist.Okay, you want to know about the movie. Well, this movie was written and directed by Stanley Kubrick. I don't care what the poster or credits say, KUBRICK MADE THIS MOVIE.I swear, I just don't know what to think of this movie. It is a brilliant movie, but it has some serious flaws. I have never come out of a movie totally bewildered but at the same time amazed at what I had just seen. AI is an amazing movie, no matter what anybody says.The acting in this movie is BRILLIANT. Haley Joel Osment is the best actor I have ever seen. His ability to portray a robot is uncanny. This kid NEEDS a best actor Oscar for this, and trust me, he's getting it. Jude Law is also equally brilliant. Law looks fake. He acts fake. His movements and mannerisms are fake. And it's supposed to be that way. The guy looks like a robot. He is defiantly up for best supporting actor.Okay, so what did I think of the movie. Well, David (Osment) is a robot. He is programmed to love, or it just seems that way. This is such a weird movie because we can't love David. He is a robot. No matter what he does, he is a robot and he has no feelings. How can you love a robot? But honestly, as the film moves on, I think David learns. He really becomes more human with every passing second.To be blunt, the movie is pretty weird. I mean, I just don't know what to think. I'm a movie critic, and I can't express what this movie is like. It has totally blown me away. I have to see it again. Not because I didn't catch something, but so I can re-experience the most breathtaking film I have ever seen.I do want to pick on the ending. I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE IT AWAY! I don't believe in spoiling people. But the ending just seems like it's prolonging the inevitable. It just keeps going. Once you think it's over, oh no, another ACT comes in. Oh, and those are robots not aliens.There's just one last thing I want to say. When I first learned that Jude Law's character was a gigolo robot, I thought it was the dumbest idea I had ever heard of. But now I understand it. Both David and Joe are programmed to love, just in different ways. Joe loves physically, and David loves emotionally.Overall, SEE THIS MOVIE. It is not the greatest movie ever made. It will leave you just as unsatisfied as it left me. But this is an awesome movie both in scope and in presentation. But the weirdest thing is how it stuck in my head. I can't stop thinking about it. Weird. The whole experience of this movie is cold, uneasy, disturbing and uncomfortable, but for some reason, it is truly breathtaking and awe inspiring. I mean, that's what Kubrick movies do. There is one thing about AI that Kubrick never did. AI has heart. It truly does. And heart is something Spielberg does well.AI is the first real artistic movie, both visually and metaphorically, that Spielberg has done with the possible exception of Schindler's List. This is Kubrick, ladies and gentlemen. He rose from the grave and made this movie. Get over it. There's one thing no one can deny: this movie is historic and an instant classic, even though it isn't that good. Well, one thing's for sure: AI makes you appreciate humanity.No rating, just read the review. My head hurts.PS: THIS IS NO KID MOVIE! DO NOT BRING YOUR KIDS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so bad I want to punch myself in the face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>there are so many reasons to hate this movie: the most important one is that fairy tale does not come true. David never becomes a real boy, nor does his mother love him. He alters his wish to fit the circumstances and convinces himself that it came true. If you say the movie is a fairy tale, then it's a bad one. If you say it's Science Fiction, it's even worse. Robots programmed for love-making would never be programmed to fly a helicopter; robots that play music would probably be able to record music, also, so Law's character could record the real killer's confession to play to the police....a robot that can't eat food probably shouldn't go in the pool, either...the science doesn't work. The story mixes elements of Willy Wonka (Congratulations, David, you passed the test!); Return to Oz (Wheelies, Tick-Tock); and Hansel and Gretel. Why robots think it important to appear human is odd: they rummage for face parts when their faces serve to practical purpose (other that to generate sympathy from humans--why would robots be programmed with a survival instinct?) Robots think what they are programmed to think--the story did not say anyone was creating Blade Runner type robots, only servant lever models. Screw it, the movie sucks. I'm not wasting my time on this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can an A.I. grows up to be intelligent?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Isn't it sad? Why can't a mind just let go? It is sad to see a mind is trapped by a desire that can never be fulfilled.It just as if you fell in love with someone who will never loves you in return. It is even sad when you start to lie to yourself `If I do so and so, become so and so, someday my love will come back to me?' What if some advance technology can offer you a virtual reality heaven that you can enjoy your desire in a computer program forever?Will you accept it? Isn't it sad to drug yourself into a fake happiness? To be deceived in a fake heaven, you are actually trapped in a customized hell?When a mind accepted the fact, and learned to let it go, this is what we called `growing up'.In this movie `AI', we are actually watching a `robot' trapped in a desire to be a human. I think this is even sad. It's sad that we can't tell whether he really `loves', or just programmed to `love'? `Please Blue fairy, make me into a real boy' David asked again and again. Is it a true desire? Or is it just a computer program trapped in a loop?In `A.I', I felt sad for David because he can never be human. David can never grow up both `physically' and `mentally'. A human mind will learn to let the pain and past go, and grow up. A machine / program will go on forever asking the same question, if there's no logical formula to solve the question. Can an artificial intelligence really grow up to be intelligent? It is sad, you know the answer is `no'?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here lies your answers to your logic holes ***SPOILER ALERT***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote another review of this movie that was a real review. What follows is a combination of a review and some answers to a lot of questions that people have been asking. Many people are ruining this movie by pointing out logic holes that flat-out don't exist if you just take some time to think about the movie. Remember, this movie is more Kubrick than Spielberg, so it's going to be deep and ambiguous (do you remember the ending to 2001 at all?). I warn you, what follows will spoil the movie, so this is only for people who have seen it. I normally hate giving stuff away, but I felt that these questions needed answering.Here are some answers for all of the questions that have surrounded AI. Question number one: why didn't they design David to not eat food if it shorts out his circuits? Answer: they did, but David overrided his own programming. His brother Martin was making fun of him, and David got angry. He hated Martin. His hatred overcame his program. You may say, "What? That's the dumbest explanation I've ever heard!" Well, it's not, because you do the same thing. In moments of passion, moments of intense emotions of rage or love, human beings loose logic. Haven't you ever been so mad you didn't think about what your consequences are? They designed David to be HUMAN, and they did it too well. Question number two: why does David's mother abandon him? Answer: simple, David's journey is an experiment. The company wanted David to escape so they could test exactly how much he loved his mother. The movie actually answers this question rather bluntly, but no one obviously was paying any attention. Remember the scene between David and his maker?Question number three: What is the deal with the aliens?Answer: they are NOT aliens, they just look like it (for reasons only Spielberg knows). First off, if you look closely, you can see little parts moving underneath their translucent skin. Second, remember when Joe (Jude Law) said, "The humans know that in the end, all that will be left is us," foreshadowing that one day humans will become extinct and robots will rule the earth. I honestly don't know why so many people didn't get this.Question number four: What is the deal with the cloning the mother thing?Answer: They didn't clone her. Think, for a few seconds. The alien-looking robots know that David is really, really important and they don't want to hurt him. They want him to be happy. They also know that he is programmed to be a child. So they make up the whole DNA thing so that David can somewhat understand (and they know about the hair in Teddy's pocket because they had to fix him too). In actuality, the robots just sent messages into his brain that seemed like his mother. In other words, David was dreaming. Remember when David first gets into his new home? Remember how distorted it looks? Remember how blurry it looks? HE WAS DREAMING (kind of). The reason they said it would only last a day is because they knew they couldn't just leave him there forever, so they gave him a boundary, a reason to "wake him up" you could say.That's just what I think. What do I know, I just took some time to THINK about the movie. This is a deep movie, so don't just write off something that you don't understand to be a logic hole, because the problem is not the movie. The problem is you. This movie is supposed to make you think, like it made me do. Just take some time and think about it. Or just sit there like a stubborn Neanderthal.The movie does have problems. As a person of film, I am not blinded to that. The ending, while it is a good ending, is too long. The movie drags, which is never a good thing. The movie seems like it ends at the ferris wheel (and if Kubrick was alive, it would have) manly do to the fact that the camera backs off and fades a little, like it's ending. Not to mention Ben Kingsley comes in as the narrator. Another bad thing is Dr. Know. It is way too over the top. The cartoon is way too vibrant and moving around. The movie is too slow for such an animated cartoon to burst in. Not to mention that it's just stupid. I know it serves a purpose, but please?So, in conclusion, AI is just a fairy tail for adults. It's a movie to loose yourself in. You don't need to think about it, but if you do think about it, think hard so you don't disguise stupidity as logic holes. This movie is way too artistic for mainstream people. It's also weird. It's also creepy. It's also cold and haunting. Kubrick is calling us from beyond the grave. Just accept the movie for what it is. It is the bravest science fiction movie since Gattaca (or Contact, I forget which came last). The same people who hate this movie are the same people who thought The Mummy Returns, Tomb Raider, and Pearl Harbor where classic movies. AI is a classic, whether you like it or not.Oh, and please remember that this is no kid's movie. There are many images in this movie that creeped me out, so imagine what it will do to your kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Absolute 10! A Wonderful, Haunting, Disturbing Film! *May have a spoiler or two*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen few films that goes off and beyond like "A.I." did. The sudden reality of the essense of the film goes beyond of what I was actually expecting. Goodness! The film is a prophecy in the making really. It seems just like a little fairy tale, but its not. Will we let ourselves reach this type of demise...in our own making? The film has breathtaking visual effects...some of the best that I have seen. Like Roeper said on his review, "it actually looks like NYC is under water." Haley Joel Osment has really outdone himself this time. I see another Oscar nomination in his future. He would probably win this time. However, this is what you expect when you put 2 legends of directing, a good cast, and smart story and good drama together. I wasn't expecting less from Spielberg to begin with.Recommendation: Adults just go see the film. I don't think a child will sit through the film. There is some action in the film and it does it loud at points, but it won't excite the child. I don't know where the critics and reviews got 140 running time from, but I calculated 3 hours and 15 minutes...excluding previews and not adding credits. Can your child sit through that?In conclusion, A.I., with startling and sometimes disturbing images, light humor and well-done plot and visuals, A.I. receives **** stars out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extremely strange experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"AI" comes across as a bizarre little hybrid; as if a Kubrick film and a Spielberg film got together and had an illegitimate child. This is clearly unlike any other Spielberg work to date. Only occasionally do we see his style peek through. This lends a certain uneasiness to the film. There are no two directors whose approaches are more diametrically opposed, and the fusion seems uncomfortable. This may just be a strength in a story that doesn't provide easy answers to its questions, or even definitively state what those questions are.As others have written, Haley Joel Osment is eerily perfect, and proves that his performance in "The Sixth Sense" was no fluke. Whoever is choosing this kid's projects deserves an award of their own. Jude Law is also excellent in his limited role, giving us a character who literally perceives everything through the limits of his programming.Visually, this is the most striking science fiction film since "Blade Runner". More than simply convincing effects, these are convincing and real worlds, showcasing an incredible breadth of imagination. And of course, Spielberg being Spielberg, he can't completely absorb himself in Kubrick's style, and there is some genuine emotion to be had.All of this makes it all the more jarring when the third act comes along. I'll try not to spoil anything here. First of all, was narration necessary? There is no narrator in the first two acts, which makes his presence in the third intrusive and annoying. It made me feel insulted; did they think we couldn't figure out what was happening? But this is a small complaint, really. The real problem is that the story runs miles for a conclusion that was inches away. Nearly half an hour is spent setting up a situation that could have been provided quite easily within the confines of the original situation. I can't get more specific than that without ruining anything, but believe me: it's a long way to go for closure.All in all, this is a visionary film that demands to be seen in a theater. It is challenging, intelligent, real science fiction. In an age when science fiction in Hollywood means gunfights and chase scenes, this work deserves to be celebrated. Its potential perfect score is marred only by its directionless final act: 8.As a final note to parents: please don't be fooled by the ads. This is in no way, shape, or form a children's movie. Get a babysitter, and see it on your own. You'll thank yourselves later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding A Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's "A.I." is ambitious work that honors the vision of Stanley Kubrick which Spielberg ultimately makes his own-- a good thing. Spielberg's A.I. is a fable that takes on the nature of being human, and the nature of love. A.I. opens with Prof. Hobby (William Hurt) proposing the design of an android child that can be programmed to love it's human parents, and this love would be unconditional. A colleague poses the next logical question: Can a human love an android back? David (Haley Joel Osment)--the child android-- is placed under the care of Henry and Monica Swinton (Sam Robards and Frances O'Connor). The Swintons have an ailing young son, Martin, in cryogenic freeze. Monica has reservations about this undertaking. She develops a relationship with David. Along the way (for the one mechanical part of the story) Martin makes a recovery and returns to the Swintons'. Martin becomes jealous of David and plots his downfall. David falls out of grace due to circumstance. David must now find his place in the world. Though in his departure, Monica displays a true act of love for her "son" which goes undistinguished by David. The Spielberg screenplay from the Ian Watson screen story is coherent, though not always cohesive. There is a gaudy monster truck-like spectacle involving "mecha's" (androids) being demolished that is unnecessary, and making Martin the "evil" real son is manipulative. The movie could have been shorter. Like Pinochio (alluded to in the story), David believes that he can only be loved if he becomes a "real" boy. In his literal quest to find Pinochio's Blue Fairy, he is accompanied by Joe (Jude Law), a android prostitute. Spielberg keeps us guessing how this will all end to-- the very end. It is the search for the Holy Grail, the nature of love, that distinguishes "A.I." Perhaps one definition of love is that love is accepting someone for who they are, and for what they are NOT. What happens when that someone is a machine-- not human? "A.I." asks the worthwhile questions. Along those lines Haley Joel Osment gives an amazing performance. His David is "almost" human, and his quest in life is to be loved-- the most human of all. Osment showcases this kind of authenticity and compassion in a difficult role. The supporting cast, particularly Frances O'Connor are effective. Ultimately, Osment's David and his journey to find his place in the world keeps us inside the movie. Because we all have have thought about our place in the world, and the human legacies we will leave behind...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schizophrenic Storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read many of the reviews on this page, I have to say that I think most of them, both good and bad, are very accurate.What we have here is a film with dozens of grandiose themes, none of which are fully realized or resolved. Yet still, the film does have its pros and its cons.The main "pro" is that this film will make you think. I highly recommend grabbing some coffee after the show and discussing it with others. It makes for great conversation.However, the main "con" is what I believe to be the film's major and fatal flaw. So many themes were present, yet few themes seemed to be fully realized for the audience. This is not a bad thing - especially when found in a novel, philosophical essay or op-ed - but it is when it comes to the language of popular filmmaking. But sill, in a day and age when Hollywood routinely cranks out thematically bankrupt pieces of trash, A.I. is overkill in the opposite direction.Why is this so?... If you ask me, it's because in the case of A.I., Kubrik and Spielberg, two of the greatest filmmakers of our time, proved that they are polar opposites in terms of their storytelling.Kubrik's vision is often cold and brutally honest. His stories are real and not afraid to delve into the darkest, most hidden corners of the human psyche. Spielberg, on the other hand, is often overly sentimental and idealistic when it comes to the human condition. I am sure many of you who have seen the movie will agree that there is one defining moment where the Spielberg/Kubrik schism is painfully evident.***WARNING: SPOILER ALERT -- DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T YET SEEN THE MOVIE***Personally, I believe Kubrik would have ended the film when David finds the Blue Fairy. However, it may be that Spielberg felt the need to continue the story so that David would finally get to experience the true love of his mother. Ironically, that true love is made possible only because of the technology developed by the robots of 2,000 years into the future.By and large, I feel that there was no one, singular vision for this film. Because of that, it left me feeling strangely dissatisfied with the end result. But at least it made me think, and think hard about what it was I had just witnessed. In that respect, it was a refreshing piece of work.Ultimately, I thought that the directed by credit should have read: "Directed posthumously by Stanley Kubrik via Steven Spielberg"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Isn't it sad? Why can't a mind just let go? It is sad to see a mind is trapped by a desire that can never be fulfilled.It just as if you fell in love with someone who will never loves you in return. It is even sad when you start to lie to yourself `If I do so and so, become so and so, someday my love will come back to me?' What if some advance technology can offer you a virtual reality heaven that you can enjoy your desire in a computer program forever?Will you accept it? Isn't it sad to drug yourself into a fake happiness? To be deceived in a fake heaven, you are actually trapped in a customized hell?When a mind accepted the fact, and learned to let it go, this is what we called `growing up'.In this movie `AI', we are actually watching a `robot' trapped in a desire to be a human. I think this is even sad. It's sad that we can't tell whether he really `loves', or just programmed to `love'? `Please Blue fairy, make me into a real boy' David asked again and again. Is it a true desire? Or is it just a computer program trapped in a loop?In `A.I', I felt sad for David because he can never be human. David can never grow up both `physically' and `mentally'. A human mind will learn to let the pain and past go, and grow up. A machine / program will go on forever asking the same question, if there's no logical formula to solve the question. Can an artificial intelligence really grow up to be intelligent? It is sad, you know the answer is `no'?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>21st century fairy tales</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I divulge any opinion, i must clarify two things: First, this movie IS an all-out Spielberg glutton-fest of colors, sounds, cute characters and attempts to break your heart. Second, it IS NOT a Kubrick dark and violent vision of our eventual demise, regardless of the references to Kubrick's abandoned project on the concepts of artificiality. Nevertheless it features elements of both.What this film is, beyond its collaborators and director is a proper fairy tale for modern audiences. Perhaps even one that will more appreciated in the future much like Brother's Grimm fairy tales are today. Two of the great cinematic storytellers of our time affected the outcome of this piece; one cannot deny the flourishes that are a Spielberg trademark, nor can one avoid the bleakness and melancholy vision of Kubrick's future.If your movie enjoyment boils down to what one man's vision should or should not be, then you've denied yourself a great story. Yes there are flaws, some of the Mom's ( Francis O'connor ) actions are dubious as a mother, one can only imagine how different they might act in a similar situation. Moreover, all geeky tech-heads will agree that there are many unanswered technical issues from where is all the power coming from to how did that amphibicopter fly AND swim?But frankly, who cares? The story is unabashedly Pinnochio, and Spielberg could be critizied for following that plot line too closely... but did anyone get that critical with Clueless (which followed the classic novel Emma), or the Lion King (Hamlet)? Perhaps having Kubrick's name attached to the movie many will immediately denounce the use of non-original plot line. But again, they miss the point.Visually A.I. is a masterpiece, its like to be unseen for years to come. From the detail lavished on the Swinton's home to the deft and stunning visual of an abandoned Manhattan, Spielberg leaves nothing to chance. Yet a fairy tale is more than its setting. Little Haley Osmont is once again a brilliant actor. You quickly forget him in his debut Sixth Sense role and believe he is David, a truly sentient being with the heart of a young child. And how can one ignore Jude Law's utterly flawless performance either.And yet we are treated to those flourishes that make movie watching great. Like Teddy, part cuddly toy, part barely tamed creature, part wise conscious. Hell, i want a Teddy (I see a potential christmas best seller)! Or Chris Rock's very brief but amusing cameo as a minstrel robot headed for his annihilation. If you allow your prejudices to sit down for the Two hours and fifteen minutes duration, you may very well enjoy the ride. I stress that this film is just like the stories your parents may have read to you in YOUR youth. Now, with movieplexes everywhere we may all experience again that which we have long not received: A story, rife with twists and turns, loves and hates and fantasy all told richly.So go see this movie if you miss your parents tucking you in at night, or need a new-age fantasy to ponder. But don't bother me with harpings of how "this wasn't a Kubrick", or "why did Spielberg rob his own work". This is simply a great movie, a great story, and just fantastic enough to not be another overwrought blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg shoots himself in the foot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wavered between giving A.I. a 6 or a 7, finally deciding on a 6 because Spielberg needs to be punished. Seriously.The film is inventive and packed with ideas, whatever its flaws. The real betrayal has been commented upon elsewhere, and I'll repeat it here:A.I. has three opportunities to close. The first ending -- the narration over the Ferris wheel -- would have been terrific, however grim, and the audience could have left satisfied and tantalized, if a little glum. At that point, the film -- warts and all -- would have been thought-provoking, evocative, and even mythical.But it keeps going. Again, it could have ended when a statue shatters; not as good an ending as before, but a halfway decent crescendo which still would have had some resonance thematically.And it keeps going. Now we're in the realm of total grafting and adolescent science in which, by God, we're going to get SOMETHING of a happy ending, however slim.With that, the increasingly creaky contraption breaks down and sputters out, wooden Oedipal overtones and all. Spielberg betrays his story and audience. This is one of those films in which, when it ends, the audience can't get out of their seats fast enough. At the screening I attended, half of us were on our feet when the director's credit came on.I may well buy the DVD when it's released, watch the movie and shut it off when its proper time comes. What will gnaw at me, however, is knowing there's that appendage on there -- a sixth toe I'm trying to ignore -- and I wish, like Kubrick -- that Spielberg would have the courage to lop off what's unnecessary even after it's in the theaters.By God, sir, I will not abide another toe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first went to go see A.I., I had very high expectations for the film. Coming from Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick, it ought to be good, right? I happened to enjoy the film to a certain extent, which involved much of David's fast-paced adventures. Yet, the film hit a glacial slow at the end of the film. This film seems like a major attempt to be a great one, but may fail due to the thoughts of the audiences. At first, the audience may feel provoked and disturbed by the situations in the film, which makes it an excellent film. But, just when the viewer thinks the film is going to end, it drones on into a corny and unrealistic ending. I must say Spielberg should've ended the film at a specific point (which will not be revealed due to the chance of spoiling the film). As I watched the film, it reminded me of Close Encounters a bit. Is Spielberg trying to tie the films together?? To be honest, the success of "A.I." is held in the hands of the audience. This film may make or break Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glorious Failure?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I finished watching A.I. just a few hours ago, and I have to say that I am ultimately disappointed. I knew that it wasn't going to work as well as I had hoped, but it's hard to stop hoping all the same.That said, however, the acting performances were *universally* *superb*. Osment is not just a great child actor, he is a great actor. I was not convinced by his performance in "The Sixth Sense", but then, one should never be convinced by a solitary performance. Here he shows his versatility and power. Essentially this film was laid on his shoulders to carry, and he doesn't let us down at all.The set design and special effects were excellent, though I wish I had seen less in the trailer. I would have preferred not to have seen the arrival at Rouge City before, likewise the Nanny Mecha.There are a couple of little skips and tricks in logic here and there, and they're almost forgivable, but they do intrude, which is a shame. If the film had been stronger then I doubt I would have noticed, or if I had, I doubt I would have given any of it a second thought.I also found both the Narrator and some of the backing music very intrusive. I have disliked narrators ever since I saw the Director's Cut of Bladerunner. Here it is much the same -- I don't think the Narrator is necessary to the film at all. As for the music, well, John Williams is a fine composer, but at times can become a little overwrought. He needs to be put on a stern leash when it comes to dramatic emotional swells.At about the 1hr 45min mark, I started to feel an urge to check my watch. This is never a good sign in a film. I think the problem was that the arrival in Rouge City seemed to drain momentum out of the film, just when we should have been preparing for the final act.Another problem: the encounter with Dr. Know should set up the resolution. The plot needs to move straight from there fairly directly to it conclusion (as with many movies, like, say, "A Few Good Men" when Kaffee decides to put Jessop on the stand, or "Alien", when Ash is destroyed, making it possible for them to blow up the ship). It does this, but then Spielberg sticks an extra act onto the end (the under-sea sequence). Structurally it doesn't work, which is why so many people have come out saying: "Why the hell was that ending so long and convoluted?"A.I. is a wonderfully ambitious film, and it does some things extremely well. Unfortunately, it does not succeed in becoming a great film, almost entirely because of its flawed final act.I gave A.I. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much Spielberg, not enough Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half the reason for seeing this film was the use of Stanley Kubrick's name as one of the creative contributors. I had no desire to watch the half-worried look on Haley Joel Osment's face for a solid two hours, but later found myself ignoring it for the greater appeal of the story -- at least the first half. The movie probably isn't what you'd expect. The best part is that there is no need for explanation, but that's also the worst part. Steven Spielberg redirects the tale to appeal to everyone, much in the sense of "Jurassic Park" or "E.T." Unfortunately, it hurts the film, which seems very promising with a very Kubrick-like world of emotional and psychological fragmenting that marks the first hour or so. Jude Law is terrific as an artificial human pimp, but the fantasy-land creations of Spielberg lend to disappointment -- especially if you were hoping for something totally serious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Spielberg did a great job on the film and the film itself is great, I found the movie to be too long, badly edited, and way too sentimental. There's just not enough Kubrick, and too much Spielberg. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have its share of great Kubrickian scenes. I just can't help but feel Spielberg didn't know where to go with this project. *MAY BE SOME SPOILERS* The acting is great. Haley Joel Osment once again does a great job, Jude Law almost steals the movie, and the rest of the cast is brilliant. The movie is also a wonder to look at with its surreal, beautiful, and colorful imagery. Some provocative ideas and poignant scenes make the film also an emotional trip. But this is where it all falls apart. The film becomes too hip for its own good. A ROBOT! Come on! We understand that we need emotional material but not this too much. The last 20 minutes desperately needed to be cut down. Kubrick would have had the film much more enigmatic and thought-provoking. He would have had less talk and more visual storytelling techniques like in "2001: A Space Odyssey". It's a shame ol' Stanley couldn't make this picture. It would have been ten times as good as it already is. 8/10</fullReview>

Haley Joel Osment delivers an astounding performance as a young, robotic boy. However, the quality of his work is rivaled by that of Jude Law, of whom I am a long standing fan. In this futuristic world of robots and "flesh fair" only the strong survive. Because this movie is about forty minutes too long, however, I rated it at merely a 7.

		<shortDescription>All substance lost in a sea of exhibitionism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been anticipating A.I. for quite some time, and I could not wait to see how Steven Spielberg, a very talented and imaginative director would handle a screen-story that was to be made by the late genius Stanley Kubrick. I went in with an open mind and good outlook on what I was about to see? I was let down. What I ended up seeing was a rather poor film which fell flat on all levels, in my opinion. I was very much intrigued by the ideas and characters presented in A.I. Having read the short story upon which the film is based, I thought it was a very interesting concept derived from such a simple basis. The question of the essence and veracity of love. The statement on human nature and the existence of emotion outside of the mind. The idea of the journey of self discovery of a robot, experiencing human emotions outside of humanity. All of this was very intriguing and, in me, sparked much thought. But why did I not like this movie? Because it was told completely wrong. Although I was being pleasantly surprised by many of the discoveries and people found on David's journey, I kept feeling led astray from the real truth of the story. And the end part of the film was appalling. There too many abrupt changes and the obvious, gratuitous images and "explanations" found throughout the ending segments really destroyed the essence of the film. But what really bothered me was the final steps in the plot itself. I do not want to reveal anything, but the conclusion of the film left me feeling neither happy nor upset, and that the end of David's journey was a disgustingly contrived finish-line to a story which I realized never really took me anywhere or led me to an affective conclusion. I realized that Mr. Spielberg had spelled-out the simple themes of this film, and stamped everything with over-obvious images and reduced the script to a almost juvenile sci-fi story. All of the essence and theme was lost in the terrible presentation. Why didn't this work? Why did a Spielberg-made Kubrick-film fall flat on all emotional, visceral, and philosophical levels? Because all of Spielberg's best films were impressive because of images. Even his most acclaimed work Schindler's List was powerful in what it showed, not through a sub-surface theme. Kubrick's films were successes in that there was always, at the least, an underlying tone or voice to what was being shown. Kubrick kept the story telling simplistic and ambiguous so that the viewer could retrieve a message from what he or she was seeing. While Spielberg would present something which could not be questioned or interpreted but merely witnessed. Now, Spielberg is an amazing director and effective storyteller to be sure, but transferring a story with underlying Kubrick themes into a very aesthetic Spielberg movie does not work. A.I. is not a terrible film. It has a lot of imagination and fascination to it, but it's story was reduced to a science fiction pornography by the film's conclusion. Overall, I was disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, i am not lying when I say i went into this movie a bit doubtful, because I did, and I thinked it helped me enjoy this film ALOT more. I was intrigued by the previews, and i made the wise choice of not reading reviews for this movie before i went to go see it, but i am going to do a review. This is already becoming one of the most debated movies of all time. And it has alot of contrasts Sappy and dark, A happy ending that is questionable, and just being downright disturbing, yet somehow having a high character sympathy. I saw this film as basically exploring one simple issue, one that bladerunner explored, but never went that much in depth with-What does it mean to be human, and what essentially are the differances if any between man and machine. Etc etc etc. This honestly is the most thought proviking film i have seen for along time, and the only titles i can think of being this close are Kubrick films(2001, Clockwork Orange). But this goes beyond even Stanley Kubricks original fare. Though either mistake or intention, what most people see as faults in the movie(the sap), basically what makes this movie so damn good. Basically Spielberg does one of the best character studies ever made, making a machine human, but making us doubt our own sympathy for the the boy machine david, because he exactly is that. Very few movies few with emotions so much, which is why there are two sides to this film, those who love it and those who hate it. those who hate it, want a dark cold intellectual kubrick film, or a spielberg great. However this film is much more challenging then either, because with every sappy moment there is doubt, and with every cold awkward intellectual moment there is sympathy. Basically a story of a robot became one of the most human movies ever, playing with every emotion, in an almost childlike state, and in the context of a fairy tale. This movie is ultimately a fairy tale, despite its sci-fi setting that is ultimately what it is, mixed within a heros journey. (basically if you have knowledge of either the happy ending makes sense). I can go on yaking, but either you think it as a success or the worst movie ever made it would still be a good idea to see it, because it will ultimately become one of the most debated films of all time, and is probably one of the most thought provoking and daring films ever. Though this film is not daring on the riske level that many people think of daring, it is daring on the intellectual and emotional context that ultimately surround the film. It would still be a good idea to watch this film, despite the flaws, which ultimately show the humanity of the film.</fullReview>

that's a big hole in my eyes. if she were an irrational alcoholic, then it makes sense that they need to be rid of this robot.but spielberg makes family movies to an extent, although he really tried to do otherwise at times here.instead it's a sad utopia failed type of thing, and the parents show a brash disregard for knowing the truth as they wholly accept their son, capable of deceit, as the innocent child out of the two, based on his humanity. so the mindgames of a gimpy 8 year old kid worked on his parents, woe is indeed me at this point.the framing of the gigolo came out of nowhere and went nowhere. it seems to me that this was added in at some point to give the movie some much needed action scenes to flex their CG skills. who killed the woman?

you got me there.the epilogue ended the movie on a low note, and in my opinion, this is where kubrick could have made this movie classic. first off, one more hole: how can someone be revived from a strand of hair and only live for a day with no viable explanation as to why they die? that's completely irrational, and likely a quick fix to finish up the movie in 5 mintues flat. so anyways, there's an aura of kubrick ambiguity with the unknown silver creatures (i presume them to be the future manifestation of mecha technology rather than alien), but the movie takes a sharp turn in the spielberg direction with the sappy feelgood ending. oh one more giant insulting plot hole: WHY NOT TAKE MORE OF HER HAIR AND JUST MAKE HER AGAIN? are we really that stupid? they tried to make some spacetime continuum passageway explanation as to why they can live again for one day, but that doesnt hold up as to why they can't just make a new mommy every day. please, a little credit for us?look at stanley kubrick's past with movies: he loves to leave you pondering a philosophical question at the end. did alex really get cured in a clockwork orange? is "curing" proper? what the heck happened t the end of 2001? should we trust machines with power over our lives? to me, this movie seemed to be building up to a big question at the end: what's beyond love? kubrick seemed to have a brilliant concept here. he detached the definitive human emotion from humans and put it in a heartless machine to analyze it from a different perspective. however, spielberg seemed to end the movie prematurely by showing david go to sleep aside his irrationaly dead mother figure, opting for a happy ending rather than a chilling one.i'm led to believe that if kubrick were alive and doing this movie, david would have gotten up as his mommy deceased and looked outside at a barren world in which he had no place, his one day of love now forever gone.. and he would have had a nearly blank look on his eyes, maybe even a tear running down his cheek in the inevitable close up shot as he began to realize infinite letdown. i'm confident that stanley kubrick wouldn't have left you with a cozy feeling coming out of this movie, and thus is the curse of steven spielberg. i give him credit for trying, but his tendencies eventually shined through this picture, proving that nobody can replace stanley kubrick. rest in peace, dude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. The child of 2 fathers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg partially succeeds in making a Stanley Kubrick film. The first Act of the movie, like the innocent robo-boy, is the definite child of Spielberg and thus filled with hope and magic. The second Act, like the sleazy "Gigolo Joe", is very much the child of Kubrick and so, it is filled with cold, harsh reality and destruction. Unfortunately, the last act of the film is a concoction of the 2 styles and is never fully realized. Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law are superb as is the visual splendor. But, the storyline disperses by the finale. Not Spielbergs best effort but certainly his most thought provoking since Schindler's List. In fact, I forgot to eat my milk duds. This film is not for the children or cell-phone addicted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first good movie that I've seen in a long time (from Hollywood). What stands out about A.I. is the abandonment of irony and self-mockery and the attempt to grapple with one of life's huge questions- what does it mean to be (or become) human? - in a format that's both timely and accessible without being patronizing. I'm sure other people will comment on the acting, pacing, costuming, etc, so I won't bother here. But it's the ambition and scope of the movie that really makes it exceptional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had expected Spielberg to turn Stanley Kubrick's edgy treatment of Brian Aldiss' thought-provoking story into his typical "feel-good" sort of schmaltz a la E.T.Happily -- I was wrong. This movie is an astonishing piece of work, no -- of art, anchored by the superb, unsettling and mesmerizing performance of Haley Joel Osment as the 'mecha' who would be a real boy.Needless to say, the effects employed in the film are first rate and world-class. Spielberg and his ILM CGI folks have created at least four separate and wholly believable artificial worlds on the screen.This is a wonderful film which attempts to answer very, very difficult questions, and, in the course of doing so, makes us feel very uneasy and threatened, but ultimately -- at peace.I cannot recommend it highly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arlo Guthrie covers The Doors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll spare the story recap. Kubrick never really got the script he wanted and when Spielberg stepped in, he was in one of his "batteries not included" bad-movie phases. The closest comparison I can make to this movie is "Contact" -- the _premise_ is intriguing and the setup makes you think this will be a great film, but it just loses direction.  It careens from "Starman" fish-out-of-water awkwardness to "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" psycho-battle to "Nightbreed" freaks-against-the-world to "Blade Runner" am-I-real-oh-gee-who-is-real blah-blah to "2001" finale I'm-sure-it-made-sense-on-Spielberg's-typewriter-at-4AM-but-lacks-meaning-in-the-theater transcendentalism. That ending is so tacked on you can almost hear the staple guns trying to keep it attached. Spielberg is of course a great director, and everyone has off days. This review will not change your mind about seeing it, but I just wanted to inject a little truth into these direct-from-the-studio reviews. This is not a good movie. It's a long, winding, stop-and-start-and-change lanes movie without a theme from a good director trying to interpret another vision from another great director who was almost his diametrical opposite. It's Arlo Guthrie covering The Doors; two talented but different artists mix, with the end result feeling not just tacked together but *smudged*, tainted somehow. Haley may or may not get another Oscar nomiation (which will be only because of the Academy's guilt over jobbing him out of one for "The Sixth Sense"), Jude Law is cast to perfection and the teddy will remind you of what you really wanted your favorite childhood toy to be like. Everyone else is either passable or forgettable.  Zero stars. See "Memento" again instead.</fullReview>

Haley Joel Osment delivers an astounding performance as a young, robotic boy. However, the quality of his work is rivaled by that of Jude Law, of whom I am a long standing fan. In this futuristic world of robots and "flesh fair" only the strong survive. Because this movie is about forty minutes too long, however, I rated it at merely a 7. This is the first film I've seen of Stanley Kubrick's and I must say that I am impressed, but most of all, I am inspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS COMMENT CONTAINS A SPOILER SO DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a film I have been looking forward to for quite some time. It has, in fact, surpassed my expectations in just about every level-- including it's ending. Now, I'll be the first to say I loved this film. It was touching, sad, creepy, imaginative, spectacular... Spielberg's direction shows a level of restraint we've only seen twice before (in The Colour Purple, and Shindler's List), and the young Osment has proven himself to be exceptionally talented- something rare for a child actor. So what's the problem? Spielberg just can't help himself. He doesn't know when he has a good thing. I (and the rest of the audience I was with) was certain the film was going to end with the camera slowly pulling back, with the voice over explaining how David pleads (seemingly forever, in vain) to the Blue Fairy. It was chilling, pulled softly on my heartstrings, and I thought it was one of the best film endings I have seen in ages. It was also so perfectly suited for an ending to the film. But wait! The film's not over! Not for another 25 minutes or so... The film was effectively ruined at this point, undoing everything that Spielberg has painstakingly achieved over it's entire previous running time. What follows is terrible. An ending so unnecessary and trite that I was terribly disappointed. I recommend to future DVD viewers that they turn off the player at the appropriate moment, and bask in the amazingly beautiful film they have just watched. Viewing beyond that point is just going to leave you very upset. I can't help but wonder if this ending is truly what Kubrick wanted. It's schmaltzy! Kubrick never did schmaltz... or forced sentimentality... or manipulative emotional wrangling... Oh well, I loved everything else, especially Teddy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had Potential, but falls VERY short...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS***Kubrick had a gift for pulling off movies like this with grace and intelligence. Spielberg obviously didn't feel that this movie should have been filled with as much harsh commentary in the subtext as I'm sure Kubrick would have included. Spielberg, at every opportunity, strayed away from the social commentary and concentrated on the individual. The problem with this is that the individual was a robot. Sympathy for David (Osment) seemed like it should have been a secondary objective of the film, but Spielberg couldn't resist.The movie is very segmented, which is fine if you can pull it off by having one "theme" throughout. This theme didn't exist, and left me thinking "What is the point?" Anyone who has seen a lot of Kubrick knows that he hits you over the head with the points of his films, which made him one of the most influential filmmaker of our time. Not necessarily at the box office like Spielberg, but in thinking minds all over the world.My biggest problems:The hounds were so cartoony it made me think of the gymnastics scene in Jurassic Park 2... you should remember. From that point forward, my skepticism began to grow. The Flesh Fest could have been a great dark scene (like the ceremony scene in Eyes Wide Shut), but instead turned a group of present day monster truck fans into fickle promoters of the destruction of robots, or Mechas.I'll combine my last too major problems together. I think that the Pinocchio theme was not done as well as it could have been done. If you have seen The Sweet Hereafter, you know what a fairy tale can do if used correctly. Also the end seems disjointed and forced... still interesting, but seemed like it was from a different movie, maybe Close Encounters?Subtexts that should have been accentuated: There was a little talk of David being like Adam (from the bible). Shortly after there were "halos" of light around both David and his mother... kinda like Mother and Jesus... This goes through to the end where he communicates to the aliens. David is special, but it was something that could have been more accentuated... It could have almost been like a modern passion play... But this takes a lot of extrapolation as the movie stands.Another great idea is that the humans hate the robots because they envy the robots and their immortality. The idea of the human ego being challenged really could have been an interesting and humbling topic.I know Kubrick would have focused on more universal issues than Spielberg did. I mean, think about it, the whole movie was driven by a love that was programmed into a robot... What makes that special? We know robots do what they are told?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, but a bit overdone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Idea formulated by Stanley Kubrick (The Shining, A Clockwork Orange). Directed by Steven Spielberg (E.T., Jurassic Park). Music by John Williams (Star Wars, Indiana Jones). Starring Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense, Pay it Forward).  With names such as these, the hype was on for A.I., one of summer's most anticipated movies. Featuring trailers that told next to nothing about the movie and TV commercials that told little more, Spielberg and company still had few worries that A.I. would be one of the biggest movies of Summer 2001. But not everything Spielberg touches is golden (Jurassic Park II, 1941), and Kubrick's last posthumous effort was far from his best (Eyes Wide Shut). So although big opening week sales were guaranteed, it remained to be seen: How good is A.I. anyway? The critics have been unsure, with some raving about it being some of Spielberg's best work. Some say it is overblown, pompous and a shining example of unfulfilled promise. Both groups are right. A.I. is a movie about finding your dreams, first of all. Haley Joel Osment plays the first-ever robot that has been programmed with the ability to love. Named David, he comes into the life of a couple whose only child is comatose.  But David struggles to grasp the nuances of human activity and is abandoned when he nearly kills the recovering son by accident.  Spurred by the story of Pinocchio, David searches for the mythical Blue Fairy, so he can be made into a real boy and be loved by the woman he calls `Mommy.'  In his journey, he meets a robot designed for the gratification of women named Gigolo Joe ? played by Jude Law ? and witnesses first-hand the human prejudice toward robots in a `Flesh Fair,' a carnival designed for the torture and destruction of abandoned `Mecha.' After an encounter with Dr. Know ? voiced by Robin Williams ? David and Gigolo Joe decide that Manhattan is the place where the Blue Fairy resides. But will David find his Blue Fairy and thus receive the love he has always wanted? Or will he realize his dreams are mythical, his perceptions of reality nothing but an illusion?  This is most likely one of the deepest, most heady movies made in the last five years, especially when taking into account the special effects factor that will surely draw the crowds. And its dual commentary on artificial intelligence as well as the unique human ability to reach for the stars is certainly refreshing. On a technical aspect, A.I. is phenomenal. Spielberg's directing is top-notch, turning the movie from a sterile quietness in the beginning to a warm solitude at the end. His effects are reminiscent of past work, especially with the use of aliens ? or perhaps they are ultra-advanced robots ? at the end, and the scenes of a drowned and abandoned New York City are both beautiful and unsettling. The score is simply incredible. Williams, known for his rousing action soundtracks, shows quite clearly that he is one of the best composers of our time with a soothing, entrancing score.  And finally, the acting is superb. Osment is indeed the modern male version of Shirley Temple ? the adorable child actor with copious amounts of talent. Law's modern-day, sci-fi version of the Tin Man is both comedic and lovable. Frances O'Connor's portrayal of David's `mother' is close to heart-wrenching. Technically, A.I. is very close to perfect, on a level with Citizen Kane, The Shawshank Redemption and other cinematic classics. But the story itself runs into problems that other Kubrick movies have experienced. Namely, it is too overblown. So full of great ideals and allegory, it is easy to forget that A.I. is a science fiction movie ? it is indeed one of the most realistic sci-fi movies ever. But it is a sci-fi movie that dreams to reach higher it seems, and in the process A.I. loses some of its mastery of the audience. In his efforts to make the audience cry, Spielberg only makes isolated scenes poignant, instead of a whole block of time, like in a true melancholic drama.  In its efforts to wrap everything into a neat little package, Spielberg's movie runs 20 minutes too long, ending with an unnecessary epilogue that contains far too much explanation and redundancy.  And in what seems to be a problem with several of Kubrick's movies, the point is far too overstated. To understand an implied meaning is great. To be told what the meaning is fine. But to be told the meaning and how you should derive it over and over as the movie goes on is certainly overkill, which unfortunately is what happens in A.I.  Overall, A.I. is a shining example of technical prowess, a sci-fi movie that becomes much more and deserves every accolade it receives. It dares to create a plot and develop character with special effects in an era where effects are the plot and characters are just additional props. Unfortunately, it seems that A.I. just tries too hard to be the artistic centerpiece, and it is here where A.I. will lose the following it tries so hard to achieve.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg can't do Kubrick, no matter how hard he tries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI Artificial Intelligence, succeeds on so many levels that it's hard to pinpoint just why it ultimately fails. The movie started out life as a Brian Aldiss short story that intrigued Stanley Kubrick, who is given co-writing credit and to whom the movie is dedicated. AI is Steven Spielberg's homage to Kubrick, and that gives the movie a two-toned effect that serves more to muddle the effect than to exemplify the genius of either.Kubrick is best at the static image and the slow movement that reveals human nature, usually the dark side. Spielberg is best at the moving close-up that reveals an individual's nature, usually the light side. We remember the robot HAL in 2001 and the destruction of civilization in Dr. Strangelove and the sex scenes that aren't erotic in Eyes Wide Shut. We remember the grizzled fisherman of Jaws and the little kid in ET and one unit trying to find one man in Saving Private Ryan. The discord between Kubrick's large-themed movies and Spielberg's small-themed movies is never resolved in AI.MILD SPOLIERSThe plot in AI concerns the attempt by a maker of robots, played by William Hurt, to built a "mecha", or mechanical being, so that a human will love him. To that end, he builds David (one of the things I appreciated about the movie), who's a cute kid, played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment, and places him with a family who have a sick child of that age in cryogenic freeze, presumed lost. Without giving too much away, let's just say that things don't work out and David is forced to flee to a world where he's surrounded by robots.For Kubrick, the story (I'm guessing) was that it's easy for a robot to love: You just program it in. But it's hard for humans to love. Spielberg's career has been built around love stories: Love of a town frightened by a shark, love of an alien, love of family and country, love of your fellow man. Spielberg's Kubrickian photography is gorgeous to look at, but rarely adds to the story. The emotional distance that's required to get into Kubrick films is the exact opposite of the emotional attachment that's required to get into Spielberg films. Instead of Spielberg using his tricks on the human part and using Kubrick's tricks on the robot part, he uses static imagery for the humans and wild movement for the robots. Kubrick may be smiling, but we're not.Still, AI is too well crafted to avoid seeing. There are lots of visual tricks and thematic overtones. My favorite little trick: At one point, the mother, Monica (played by Frances O'Connor) is having a conversation with David outside in the cold. You can see Monica's breath, but you can't see David's. A small bit of business, but shows attention to detail.But Spielberg can't do Kubrick, no matter how hard he tries. The framing sequence in Saving Private Ryan elevated this movie above other WWII movies. The added on sequence at the end of AI further muddles the point of the movie and doesn't say anything more. He should have just ended it, and left it a fairy story.The full title is AI Artificial Intelligence, mirroring the title ET: The Extra Terrestrial. They share some themes and plot. But the best parallel is last year's Bicentennial Man, about a robot striving to be a human. Robin Williams, the star of Bicentennial Man, plays a bit part in AI, which isn't credited until the end but I recognized his voice. The thing is, Bicentennial Man succeed where AI fails. You care about the Bicentennial Man. David tugs at your heartstrings, but you never really love him. The film answers the opening question: No. It is NOT possible to make a robot that humans can love. How Kubrick! How NOT Spielberg.I give a qualified recommendation to AI. For all fans of Kubrick and Spielberg's careers, this is a must see, just to keep up with them. But if you're looking for the next great movie from the directors of Dr. Strangelove, ET, 2001 and Schindler's list, this isn't it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mixture of Close Encounters, Pinocchio, and Deuce Bigalow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first went to go see A.I., I had very high expectations for the film. Coming from Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick, it ought to be good, right? I happened to enjoy the film to a certain extent, which involved much of David's fast-paced adventures. Yet, the film hit a glacial slow at the end of the film. This film seems like a major attempt to be a great one, but may fail due to the thoughts of the audiences. At first, the audience may feel provoked and disturbed by the situations in the film, which makes it an excellent film. But, just when the viewer thinks the film is going to end, it drones on into a corny and unrealistic ending. I must say Spielberg should've ended the film at a specific point (which will not be revealed due to the chance of spoiling the film). As I watched the film, it reminded me of Close Encounters a bit. Is Spielberg trying to tie the films together?? To be honest, the success of "A.I." is held in the hands of the audience. This film may make or break Spielberg.</fullReview>

I was and felt compelled to search for and find my birth mother/blue fairy, who threw the door open and welcomed me. After finding her, I do indeed feel I can live my dreams and I am happier than I have ever been.

		<shortDescription>leave when dr. know appears (slight spoilers ahead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI was a good movie for about 35-40 minutes; it presented some very interesting ideas about what it is to be human, for better and for worse, and the nature of parent child relationships. in the good bits, i found it thought provoking, and sometimes even sad. there were a few great scenes in there where you realize just how much children love their parents, and how much they desire that love to be returned. but what started out as an intelligent allegory became a didactic disney-fied disaster. also, how is one's suspension of disbeleif expected to be maintained when dr. know is voiced by robin williams? and not even just robin williams but robin williams doing his familiar and annoying einstein schtick? i did like teddy, sometimes despite myself. his HAL meets Harvey Fierstein voice was terrific. jude law was good (and looked very good, though i was less attracted to him than when he plays a human being). haley joel is a freak, but also good. his acting reminds me of jodie foster's... someone once referred to her as an acting machine. he's got the same thing going on, which made him, in this flick, an acting machine acting as a machine. yikes. it was as though kubrick died during the making of the movie rather than before. spielberg's spielbergness never fully takes over. the result is a pastiche of both kubrick and spielberg's styles... but never a true blend that stands solidly on its own. boo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I finished watching A.I. just a few hours ago, and I have to say that I am ultimately disappointed. I knew that it wasn't going to work as well as I had hoped, but it's hard to stop hoping all the same.That said, however, the acting performances were *universally* *superb*. Osment is not just a great child actor, he is a great actor. I was not convinced by his performance in "The Sixth Sense", but then, one should never be convinced by a solitary performance. Here he shows his versatility and power. Essentially this film was laid on his shoulders to carry, and he doesn't let us down at all.The set design and special effects were excellent, though I wish I had seen less in the trailer. I would have preferred not to have seen the arrival at Rouge City before, likewise the Nanny Mecha.There are a couple of little skips and tricks in logic here and there, and they're almost forgivable, but they do intrude, which is a shame. If the film had been stronger then I doubt I would have noticed, or if I had, I doubt I would have given any of it a second thought.I also found both the Narrator and some of the backing music very intrusive. I have disliked narrators ever since I saw the Director's Cut of Bladerunner. Here it is much the same -- I don't think the Narrator is necessary to the film at all. As for the music, well, John Williams is a fine composer, but at times can become a little overwrought. He needs to be put on a stern leash when it comes to dramatic emotional swells.At about the 1hr 45min mark, I started to feel an urge to check my watch. This is never a good sign in a film. I think the problem was that the arrival in Rouge City seemed to drain momentum out of the film, just when we should have been preparing for the final act.Another problem: the encounter with Dr. Know should set up the resolution. The plot needs to move straight from there fairly directly to it conclusion (as with many movies, like, say, "A Few Good Men" when Kaffee decides to put Jessop on the stand, or "Alien", when Ash is destroyed, making it possible for them to blow up the ship). It does this, but then Spielberg sticks an extra act onto the end (the under-sea sequence). Structurally it doesn't work, which is why so many people have come out saying: "Why the hell was that ending so long and convoluted?"A.I. is a wonderfully ambitious film, and it does some things extremely well. Unfortunately, it does not succeed in becoming a great film, almost entirely because of its flawed final act.I gave A.I. 7/10.</fullReview>

At times I was concerned as to where the movie was headed but it always redeemed itself.Haley Joel Osment again proves to be an incredible actor and carries the movies alone for the last 30 minutes of the film. Amazing.I feel some people may walk away disappointed from this film, but go in with an open mind and your imagination in check.One of Speilberg's best? I'm not sure.

		<shortDescription>Too much Spielberg, not enough Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half the reason for seeing this film was the use of Stanley Kubrick's name as one of the creative contributors. I had no desire to watch the half-worried look on Haley Joel Osment's face for a solid two hours, but later found myself ignoring it for the greater appeal of the story -- at least the first half. The movie probably isn't what you'd expect. The best part is that there is no need for explanation, but that's also the worst part. Steven Spielberg redirects the tale to appeal to everyone, much in the sense of "Jurassic Park" or "E.T." Unfortunately, it hurts the film, which seems very promising with a very Kubrick-like world of emotional and psychological fragmenting that marks the first hour or so. Jude Law is terrific as an artificial human pimp, but the fantasy-land creations of Spielberg lend to disappointment -- especially if you were hoping for something totally serious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had expected Spielberg to turn Stanley Kubrick's edgy treatment of Brian Aldiss' thought-provoking story into his typical "feel-good" sort of schmaltz a la E.T.Happily -- I was wrong. This movie is an astonishing piece of work, no -- of art, anchored by the superb, unsettling and mesmerizing performance of Haley Joel Osment as the 'mecha' who would be a real boy.Needless to say, the effects employed in the film are first rate and world-class. Spielberg and his ILM CGI folks have created at least four separate and wholly believable artificial worlds on the screen.This is a wonderful film which attempts to answer very, very difficult questions, and, in the course of doing so, makes us feel very uneasy and threatened, but ultimately -- at peace.I cannot recommend it highly enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Spielberg did a great job on the film and the film itself is great, I found the movie to be too long, badly edited, and way too sentimental. There's just not enough Kubrick, and too much Spielberg. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have its share of great Kubrickian scenes. I just can't help but feel Spielberg didn't know where to go with this project. *MAY BE SOME SPOILERS* The acting is great. Haley Joel Osment once again does a great job, Jude Law almost steals the movie, and the rest of the cast is brilliant. The movie is also a wonder to look at with its surreal, beautiful, and colorful imagery. Some provocative ideas and poignant scenes make the film also an emotional trip. But this is where it all falls apart. The film becomes too hip for its own good. A ROBOT! Come on! We understand that we need emotional material but not this too much. The last 20 minutes desperately needed to be cut down. Kubrick would have had the film much more enigmatic and thought-provoking. He would have had less talk and more visual storytelling techniques like in "2001: A Space Odyssey". It's a shame ol' Stanley couldn't make this picture. It would have been ten times as good as it already is. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been anticipating A.I. for quite some time, and I could not wait to see how Steven Spielberg, a very talented and imaginative director would handle a screen-story that was to be made by the late genius Stanley Kubrick. I went in with an open mind and good outlook on what I was about to see? I was let down. What I ended up seeing was a rather poor film which fell flat on all levels, in my opinion. I was very much intrigued by the ideas and characters presented in A.I. Having read the short story upon which the film is based, I thought it was a very interesting concept derived from such a simple basis. The question of the essence and veracity of love. The statement on human nature and the existence of emotion outside of the mind. The idea of the journey of self discovery of a robot, experiencing human emotions outside of humanity. All of this was very intriguing and, in me, sparked much thought. But why did I not like this movie? Because it was told completely wrong. Although I was being pleasantly surprised by many of the discoveries and people found on David's journey, I kept feeling led astray from the real truth of the story. And the end part of the film was appalling. There too many abrupt changes and the obvious, gratuitous images and "explanations" found throughout the ending segments really destroyed the essence of the film. But what really bothered me was the final steps in the plot itself. I do not want to reveal anything, but the conclusion of the film left me feeling neither happy nor upset, and that the end of David's journey was a disgustingly contrived finish-line to a story which I realized never really took me anywhere or led me to an affective conclusion. I realized that Mr. Spielberg had spelled-out the simple themes of this film, and stamped everything with over-obvious images and reduced the script to a almost juvenile sci-fi story. All of the essence and theme was lost in the terrible presentation. Why didn't this work? Why did a Spielberg-made Kubrick-film fall flat on all emotional, visceral, and philosophical levels? Because all of Spielberg's best films were impressive because of images. Even his most acclaimed work Schindler's List was powerful in what it showed, not through a sub-surface theme. Kubrick's films were successes in that there was always, at the least, an underlying tone or voice to what was being shown. Kubrick kept the story telling simplistic and ambiguous so that the viewer could retrieve a message from what he or she was seeing. While Spielberg would present something which could not be questioned or interpreted but merely witnessed. Now, Spielberg is an amazing director and effective storyteller to be sure, but transferring a story with underlying Kubrick themes into a very aesthetic Spielberg movie does not work. A.I. is not a terrible film. It has a lot of imagination and fascination to it, but it's story was reduced to a science fiction pornography by the film's conclusion.

		<fullReview>Well, i am not lying when I say i went into this movie a bit doubtful, because I did, and I thinked it helped me enjoy this film ALOT more. I was intrigued by the previews, and i made the wise choice of not reading reviews for this movie before i went to go see it, but i am going to do a review. This is already becoming one of the most debated movies of all time. And it has alot of contrasts Sappy and dark, A happy ending that is questionable, and just being downright disturbing, yet somehow having a high character sympathy. I saw this film as basically exploring one simple issue, one that bladerunner explored, but never went that much in depth with-What does it mean to be human, and what essentially are the differances if any between man and machine. Etc etc etc. This honestly is the most thought proviking film i have seen for along time, and the only titles i can think of being this close are Kubrick films(2001, Clockwork Orange). But this goes beyond even Stanley Kubricks original fare. Though either mistake or intention, what most people see as faults in the movie(the sap), basically what makes this movie so damn good. Basically Spielberg does one of the best character studies ever made, making a machine human, but making us doubt our own sympathy for the the boy machine david, because he exactly is that. Very few movies few with emotions so much, which is why there are two sides to this film, those who love it and those who hate it. those who hate it, want a dark cold intellectual kubrick film, or a spielberg great. However this film is much more challenging then either, because with every sappy moment there is doubt, and with every cold awkward intellectual moment there is sympathy. Basically a story of a robot became one of the most human movies ever, playing with every emotion, in an almost childlike state, and in the context of a fairy tale. This movie is ultimately a fairy tale, despite its sci-fi setting that is ultimately what it is, mixed within a heros journey. (basically if you have knowledge of either the happy ending makes sense). I can go on yaking, but either you think it as a success or the worst movie ever made it would still be a good idea to see it, because it will ultimately become one of the most debated films of all time, and is probably one of the most thought provoking and daring films ever. Though this film is not daring on the riske level that many people think of daring, it is daring on the intellectual and emotional context that ultimately surround the film. It would still be a good idea to watch this film, despite the flaws, which ultimately show the humanity of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg Displays Just What Kubrick Would Have Wanted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking out of the theater, I wasn't exactly sure how to feel. This was definitely not Spielberg's forte, classical cinema. This was very different. Thinking more about Kubrick, I evaluated the movie. Spielberg does a wonderful job of replicating the essence of Kubrick, however it doesn't naturally flow from him. A.I. looks like Spielberg looking like Kubrick, which is fine, Spielberg made a beautiful film, however it's noticeable Kubrick was replicated. I don't want to confuse anyone by this. A.I. was fantastic, and my admiration of Spielberg increases each time I think of this movie. There is so much about it that is fantastic, the acting, the style, and the cinematography are superb. If I had gone into the theater not knowing Kubrick had a hand in this, I wouldn't have thought twice about it. That is what I'm trying to get to. Because we know Kubrick was a part of this, it seems as though Spielberg had a stencil he had to use (which he uses and individually, creatively modifies perfectly). I will not discuss the ending, however, I will tell you Kubrick had the story down pat, until the end. Once its time came, he had no idea what to do next. I feel Spielberg could have thought of something stronger and a little more meaningful. The ending doesn't have as strong a punch as the rest of the movie. Frances O'Connor...I think someone older, more mature could have used the same ending, only perfected it, making it have much stronger a punch than the rest of the movie. O'Connor (in the end) was...weak? (very strong word, but accurate). Her performance was decent for the rest of the movie however, and whatever it is she lacks, Osment makes up for unbelievably. Overall, I give it a ten. Audacious, yes, Looks like Kubrick, yes (only because Spielberg had an obligation to surrender some of his originality), not Spielberg's best, yes, but definitely an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good effects, but lacking a plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The effects were amazing, the idea was imaginative, but the plot left something to be desired. I had a hard time connecting with the characters. David's mother and her husband had no personality, they were the typical TV middle class attractive parents you could find anywhere in movies. There were too many things left unexplained. I wasn't all that interested in this child's quest to find his mother, I wanted to know more about the scientific and cultural aspects of a world filled with artificial intelligence. I believe it was a good idea, but Spielberg didn't carry it out to its full potential. He focused too much on making the audience cry and not making them intrigued.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg Sentimentality strikes again! (unfortunately)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Spielberg did a great job on the film and the film itself is great, I found the movie to be too long, badly edited, and way too sentimental. There's just not enough Kubrick, and too much Spielberg. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have its share of great Kubrickian scenes. I just can't help but feel Spielberg didn't know where to go with this project. *MAY BE SOME SPOILERS* The acting is great. Haley Joel Osment once again does a great job, Jude Law almost steals the movie, and the rest of the cast is brilliant. The movie is also a wonder to look at with its surreal, beautiful, and colorful imagery. Some provocative ideas and poignant scenes make the film also an emotional trip. But this is where it all falls apart. The film becomes too hip for its own good. A ROBOT! Come on! We understand that we need emotional material but not this too much. The last 20 minutes desperately needed to be cut down. Kubrick would have had the film much more enigmatic and thought-provoking. He would have had less talk and more visual storytelling techniques like in "2001: A Space Odyssey". It's a shame ol' Stanley couldn't make this picture. It would have been ten times as good as it already is. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's newest and last film caught my eye as almost ahead of its time. Each year special effects get more and more astounding, as seen in Artificial Intelligence or A.I. Haley Joel Osment delivers an astounding performance as a young, robotic boy. However, the quality of his work is rivaled by that of Jude Law, of whom I am a long standing fan. In this futuristic world of robots and "flesh fair" only the strong survive. Because this movie is about forty minutes too long, however, I rated it at merely a 7. This is the first film I've seen of Stanley Kubrick's and I must say that I am impressed, but most of all, I am inspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All substance lost in a sea of exhibitionism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been anticipating A.I. for quite some time, and I could not wait to see how Steven Spielberg, a very talented and imaginative director would handle a screen-story that was to be made by the late genius Stanley Kubrick. I went in with an open mind and good outlook on what I was about to see? I was let down. What I ended up seeing was a rather poor film which fell flat on all levels, in my opinion. I was very much intrigued by the ideas and characters presented in A.I. Having read the short story upon which the film is based, I thought it was a very interesting concept derived from such a simple basis. The question of the essence and veracity of love. The statement on human nature and the existence of emotion outside of the mind. The idea of the journey of self discovery of a robot, experiencing human emotions outside of humanity. All of this was very intriguing and, in me, sparked much thought. But why did I not like this movie? Because it was told completely wrong. Although I was being pleasantly surprised by many of the discoveries and people found on David's journey, I kept feeling led astray from the real truth of the story. And the end part of the film was appalling. There too many abrupt changes and the obvious, gratuitous images and "explanations" found throughout the ending segments really destroyed the essence of the film. But what really bothered me was the final steps in the plot itself. I do not want to reveal anything, but the conclusion of the film left me feeling neither happy nor upset, and that the end of David's journey was a disgustingly contrived finish-line to a story which I realized never really took me anywhere or led me to an affective conclusion. I realized that Mr. Spielberg had spelled-out the simple themes of this film, and stamped everything with over-obvious images and reduced the script to a almost juvenile sci-fi story. All of the essence and theme was lost in the terrible presentation. Why didn't this work? Why did a Spielberg-made Kubrick-film fall flat on all emotional, visceral, and philosophical levels? Because all of Spielberg's best films were impressive because of images. Even his most acclaimed work Schindler's List was powerful in what it showed, not through a sub-surface theme. Kubrick's films were successes in that there was always, at the least, an underlying tone or voice to what was being shown. Kubrick kept the story telling simplistic and ambiguous so that the viewer could retrieve a message from what he or she was seeing. While Spielberg would present something which could not be questioned or interpreted but merely witnessed. Now, Spielberg is an amazing director and effective storyteller to be sure, but transferring a story with underlying Kubrick themes into a very aesthetic Spielberg movie does not work. A.I. is not a terrible film. It has a lot of imagination and fascination to it, but it's story was reduced to a science fiction pornography by the film's conclusion. Overall, I was disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's apparent that this is one of those movies which people either love or hate.To me it seems that people who don't like it simply don't get it, either being hung up on detecting whose directorial influences are where, or they are unwilling to meet the movie on its own terms--no explosions, slow pacing, and little humor. (Another barrier to some is misunderstanding what the creatures at the and of the film are--they are not aliens, but robots; robotic technology has continued to develop by robots for centuries. This is a common theme in the literature of science-fiction, but is probably unfamiliar to viewers who have read little sf.)For those who are able to see it without expectations of what a film should be, this movie is as profound as it is entertaining. I felt almost dumb-struck as the credits rolled, and am still in a state of high wonder as I write these words.This film brought home to me, as no other has done, the deeper questions behind the stories of automatons, gholems, robots, and puppets wanting to become human: What is the soul? Can we become like our Creator? Can love truly conquer all?Don't look for ET-ish innocence or Blade Runneresque drama here, although there are elements of both. Look for fuel for exploring the meaning of life, be prepared to find an incredibly beautiful and provoking treatment of the biggest questions of all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, i am not lying when I say i went into this movie a bit doubtful, because I did, and I thinked it helped me enjoy this film ALOT more. I was intrigued by the previews, and i made the wise choice of not reading reviews for this movie before i went to go see it, but i am going to do a review. This is already becoming one of the most debated movies of all time. And it has alot of contrasts Sappy and dark, A happy ending that is questionable, and just being downright disturbing, yet somehow having a high character sympathy. I saw this film as basically exploring one simple issue, one that bladerunner explored, but never went that much in depth with-What does it mean to be human, and what essentially are the differances if any between man and machine. Etc etc etc. This honestly is the most thought proviking film i have seen for along time, and the only titles i can think of being this close are Kubrick films(2001, Clockwork Orange). But this goes beyond even Stanley Kubricks original fare. Though either mistake or intention, what most people see as faults in the movie(the sap), basically what makes this movie so damn good. Basically Spielberg does one of the best character studies ever made, making a machine human, but making us doubt our own sympathy for the the boy machine david, because he exactly is that. Very few movies few with emotions so much, which is why there are two sides to this film, those who love it and those who hate it. those who hate it, want a dark cold intellectual kubrick film, or a spielberg great. However this film is much more challenging then either, because with every sappy moment there is doubt, and with every cold awkward intellectual moment there is sympathy. Basically a story of a robot became one of the most human movies ever, playing with every emotion, in an almost childlike state, and in the context of a fairy tale. This movie is ultimately a fairy tale, despite its sci-fi setting that is ultimately what it is, mixed within a heros journey. (basically if you have knowledge of either the happy ending makes sense). I can go on yaking, but either you think it as a success or the worst movie ever made it would still be a good idea to see it, because it will ultimately become one of the most debated films of all time, and is probably one of the most thought provoking and daring films ever. Though this film is not daring on the riske level that many people think of daring, it is daring on the intellectual and emotional context that ultimately surround the film. It would still be a good idea to watch this film, despite the flaws, which ultimately show the humanity of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick and Haley Joel Osment.WOW!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A an avid moviegoer and one who watches everything IN the movie including the story, the sets, the magic of Spielberg this is one of the best he has ever done. The genius of Kubrick combined with the Spielberg touch makes this a fantastic movie. Add Haley Joel Osment who is really a man in a boys body and you have Academy Award material. This is the kind of movie, much like Spielberg's body of work that you have to watch 3-4 times to see just a part of the movie that makes it so special. The teddy bear is an A+++ Spielberg touch, the Kubrick things that are hidden in the movie are also Spielberg's touch. Having had the experience of lifetime spending a weekend with Spielberg when ET was out at a movie conference in NY. I first learned how to watch a movie and the genius of Spielberg. It is not just a movie it is an experience. So when you go to see it, watch very very carefully and enjoy the story and the PICTURES. They tell great stories. Three cheers to our greatest story teller director, producer of our generation and all generations. He says he learned from the greats of the past and he has surpassed them all. Wow! WoW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a movie for the masses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"AI" shined in some points, but was ultimately pulled in too many directions. The final product is a bit too much for the average viewer to digest. One review I read (USAToday) said that "AI" was too dark for Spielburg, yet would have been too bright for Kubrick given the way it was made. The result was a messy compromise that satisfies no one, and even repulses others.For the first 1 1/2 hours, the movie is quite involving. Some philosophical questions are brought up, but nothing really that original or profound. Nevertheless, I was perplexed as to how the plot would be resolved. Where was this thing headed? What was going to happen to our little, android protagonist?During all this buildup, the movie proceeds as a fairly solid science-fiction piece, still grounded in reality or at least what could be, according to the rules of science and logic. However, the last 40 minutes slipped more into "science fantasy," perhaps even pure "fairy tale." It's ok to have a dramatic shift in tone, but only if the audience is prepped. In my case, the theater began to fill with chuckles, murmurs, which eventually evolved into loud outbursts, heckling, and laughter at times that certainly were not supposed to be funny. Out of a medium-size theater, around 10 people had even walked out by the end.The twists and turns this movie takes are simply too outlandish for the average movie-goer. By the end of the movie, the audience has lost faith in its believability. To make matters worse, the incoherent ending drags itself out at least 20 minutes longer than necessary.If this movie did fail, none of the blame should rest on the cast. Haley Joel Osment is rock solid, and Jude Law shows off his ability to push body language to the max. Perhaps the most lovable character of all was Teddy, voiced by Jack Angel. Teddy is David's Jimminy-Cricketish companion and guide. If an aftermarket of AI merchandise evolves, then Teddy could be the next Elmo.Furthermore, the special effects and sets are nicely done. The odd everyday devices, machines, household furnishing, vehicles, and other bits of technology "AI" shows us look believable, even practical. Score one bonus point for visual effects.In the end, some of the viewers were clearly upset at having been robbed of $7. Most were like me, just confused, with this blank expression on my face. The movie really leaves you wondering. For example, just what was the main point of the movie? So exactly what was Spielburg trying to say?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly successful amalgam of Spielberg &amp; Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had expected Spielberg to turn Stanley Kubrick's edgy treatment of Brian Aldiss' thought-provoking story into his typical "feel-good" sort of schmaltz a la E.T.Happily -- I was wrong. This movie is an astonishing piece of work, no -- of art, anchored by the superb, unsettling and mesmerizing performance of Haley Joel Osment as the 'mecha' who would be a real boy.Needless to say, the effects employed in the film are first rate and world-class. Spielberg and his ILM CGI folks have created at least four separate and wholly believable artificial worlds on the screen.This is a wonderful film which attempts to answer very, very difficult questions, and, in the course of doing so, makes us feel very uneasy and threatened, but ultimately -- at peace.I cannot recommend it highly enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A an avid moviegoer and one who watches everything IN the movie including the story, the sets, the magic of Spielberg this is one of the best he has ever done. The genius of Kubrick combined with the Spielberg touch makes this a fantastic movie. Add Haley Joel Osment who is really a man in a boys body and you have Academy Award material. This is the kind of movie, much like Spielberg's body of work that you have to watch 3-4 times to see just a part of the movie that makes it so special. The teddy bear is an A+++ Spielberg touch, the Kubrick things that are hidden in the movie are also Spielberg's touch. Having had the experience of lifetime spending a weekend with Spielberg when ET was out at a movie conference in NY. I first learned how to watch a movie and the genius of Spielberg. It is not just a movie it is an experience. So when you go to see it, watch very very carefully and enjoy the story and the PICTURES. They tell great stories. Three cheers to our greatest story teller director, producer of our generation and all generations. He says he learned from the greats of the past and he has surpassed them all. Wow! WoW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a movie for the masses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"AI" shined in some points, but was ultimately pulled in too many directions. The final product is a bit too much for the average viewer to digest. One review I read (USAToday) said that "AI" was too dark for Spielburg, yet would have been too bright for Kubrick given the way it was made. The result was a messy compromise that satisfies no one, and even repulses others.For the first 1 1/2 hours, the movie is quite involving. Some philosophical questions are brought up, but nothing really that original or profound. Nevertheless, I was perplexed as to how the plot would be resolved. Where was this thing headed? What was going to happen to our little, android protagonist?During all this buildup, the movie proceeds as a fairly solid science-fiction piece, still grounded in reality or at least what could be, according to the rules of science and logic. However, the last 40 minutes slipped more into "science fantasy," perhaps even pure "fairy tale." It's ok to have a dramatic shift in tone, but only if the audience is prepped. In my case, the theater began to fill with chuckles, murmurs, which eventually evolved into loud outbursts, heckling, and laughter at times that certainly were not supposed to be funny. Out of a medium-size theater, around 10 people had even walked out by the end.The twists and turns this movie takes are simply too outlandish for the average movie-goer. By the end of the movie, the audience has lost faith in its believability. To make matters worse, the incoherent ending drags itself out at least 20 minutes longer than necessary.If this movie did fail, none of the blame should rest on the cast. Haley Joel Osment is rock solid, and Jude Law shows off his ability to push body language to the max. Perhaps the most lovable character of all was Teddy, voiced by Jack Angel. Teddy is David's Jimminy-Cricketish companion and guide. If an aftermarket of AI merchandise evolves, then Teddy could be the next Elmo.Furthermore, the special effects and sets are nicely done. The odd everyday devices, machines, household furnishing, vehicles, and other bits of technology "AI" shows us look believable, even practical. Score one bonus point for visual effects.In the end, some of the viewers were clearly upset at having been robbed of $7. Most were like me, just confused, with this blank expression on my face. The movie really leaves you wondering. For example, just what was the main point of the movie? So exactly what was Spielburg trying to say?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly successful amalgam of Spielberg &amp; Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had expected Spielberg to turn Stanley Kubrick's edgy treatment of Brian Aldiss' thought-provoking story into his typical "feel-good" sort of schmaltz a la E.T.Happily -- I was wrong. This movie is an astonishing piece of work, no -- of art, anchored by the superb, unsettling and mesmerizing performance of Haley Joel Osment as the 'mecha' who would be a real boy.Needless to say, the effects employed in the film are first rate and world-class. Spielberg and his ILM CGI folks have created at least four separate and wholly believable artificial worlds on the screen.This is a wonderful film which attempts to answer very, very difficult questions, and, in the course of doing so, makes us feel very uneasy and threatened, but ultimately -- at peace.I cannot recommend it highly enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I need to clear something up, those robots at the end were NOT Aliens, they were extremely advanced robots, remember, when Joe said "When the end comes we will be the only ones that survive", he meant that robots would eventually become the only forum of life. Those creatures looked "alien" like but they were robots.Onto my review.Steven really tried to make a Stanley movie but he wasn't up to the task, while Stanley had slow moving scenes they always had style and vision, this on the other is slow for the sake of feeling like Stanley and it is very obvious.The film is still entertaining but E.T. eventually creeps in and it loses the edge Kubrick would have made razor sharp.Good, but not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** beware: minor spoiler ***If Stanley Kubrick had lived to see what Spielberg did with AI, the experience would have killed him. Oh sure, the movie runs along fairly smoothly and is done very well for the most part, except for the beginning and ending, which unfortunately ruin the entire film. The beginning is filled with an extremely phoney and amateur philosophy bull session which clumsily states all the themes of the film (which makes one wonder why it is necessary to view the film at all). The ending, quite frankly, goes screaming beyond silly to absolutely ludicrous; it relies on completely irrelevant, artificial, and not to mention just-plain-stupid plot devices to resolve the film a million miles away from any rational expectations. If you can get past that, it's a great film. :)IRONY WATCH and SPOILER: The film actually takes one step further at the end to total HYPOCRISY when David allows another life form to be made just so it can love him. Although the contradiction goes unnoticed by Spielberg, it is painfully obvious and therefore doubly obnoxious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this film expecting it too be a tearjerker, with an okay plot, great performances, and mind-blowing special effects. Believe me, this is not what I got. The previews for this film give away nothing. This film is extremely hard to watch. SPOILERS AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM DON'T READ ON! The opening of the movie explains the reasoning behind creating a robot child. William Hurt (ugh!) portrays the genius scientist behind the idea. He creates David (Halie Joel Osment) in the likeness of his own deceased son. His idea is to fill a void in the lives of couples who want children. Of course there is a problem, would the human 'parent' be able to love the child back. Here is when the film begins it's mind melding journey. A couple whose son is frozen because of an incurable disease purchases David. At first Megan (Francis 'O Connor) finds the idea of a robot child unsettling, but soon warms to the idea. She equips David to love her forever by saying the seven somewhat magic words, which make him fulfill his job. This of course is also problematic, because if she tires or has an issue with David he cannot be resold and will have to be destroyed. Of course Megan's son is cured and returns angered at the prospect of being replaced. The two boys don't get along and cause big time problems for poor David. Eventually the couple decides they must return David. But Megan doesn't have the heart to, so instead she abandons him in the forest and warns him to "stay away from flesh fairs, only your kind is safe." This is where the film turns into typical Stanley Kubrick. Flesh fairs turn out to be places where Robots have gas poured on them, and are ripped from limb to limb, all in front of an audience. Luckily David escapes with, Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) a love robot. David and Joe set out on a quest to find the Blue Fairy so David can become a real boy. He does and begs her to make him real, until eventually he dies. 2,000 years pass and David is resurrected by aliens, which are very reminiscent of the ones in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. They also resurrect David's mother after explaining to him that she will die after one day. The two spend the whole day together and both fall asleep as the narration closes the movie saying, "and for the first time in his life David went to the place where dreams are born." Bring Kleenex and get ready to cry. A+++++++</fullReview>

Not only that, but I had to sit through so many images from ET and Close Encounters that are already cliche in American culture. I couldn't suspend my disbelief, so I didn't get involved in the fairy tale world. There were too many distractions. Don't take your kids either, too much sexual content, including a not-so-subtle oral sex reference involving a futuristic bridge that spans the water to Rouge City.

		<fullReview>(SPOILERS)Alright, a few comments about AI. Walked out of the movie theater, looked at my wife, and said, "Never again will I see another Speilberg movie." If you are a thoughtful person who likes thoughtful movies, you will hate AI. If you liked The Phantom Menace, then AI will be right up your alley.This is truely a bad movie -- it starts out ok (albeit with some over-the-top sentimentality and ridiculous violin background music) with the story of a family with a half dead kid who is willing, with aprehension, to "adopt" cute little "i see dead people" robot-boy. At this point, I'm thinking: "ok, there are some issues that the movie could deal with that could be really interesting once it becomes a little less sentimental."But alas, the sentimentality part was the best part (and it was bad). Now we move into the second act. Robot boy is on his own and in search for that-which-will-make-him-human-and-make-mommy-love-him. But, OH NO, the evil humans capture him and try to destroy him b/c he is a robot. He escapes, of course, thanks to a good natured male prostitute robot. To give you a feel for this painful second third of the movie, imagine a really really really hokey Mad Max set complete with motorcycles with wolf heads on them and evil humans riding (for some reason) in a big balloon. Really really stupid.The final third is a return to the sentimentality of the first, but with a really forced attempt to be Kubrik-esque. Imagine Spielberg trying to make a surrealistic movie like A Clockwork Orange. He can't because he isn't that intelligent -- when he tries, he just looks pathetic.Take it from me -- use your tax cut check to do something other than see AI. Heck, go see Momento again: now there's the movie of the summer. Or save it to see The Fellowship of the Ring (Hollywood isn't going to mess that one up, are they?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure whether it was nausea, anticipation, or just plain dread, but this movie truly disturbed me. It was, to say the least, a thrilling experience. I have never seen special effects as real and fantastic as in this film, and it certainly gave me a lot to think about.As a morbid and dark story of a futuristic world which we may dream about and fear at the same time; it skillfully weaves together much of what we have enjoyed in the films of both Spielberg and Kubrick. We see bits of "E.T.," "2001," and "Close Encounters." The streets of Rouge City may have been inspired by scenes from another futuristic movie that pits humans against robots: "Blade Runner." This movie is far from perfect, however, but it would have been much closer had the audience been spared its last 30 minutes, in which it metamorphosed from a story of lost hope and unfulfilled dreams to a sappy fairy tale (which it claims to be anyway). This was bound to happen, however, because Spielberg and Kubrick handle fantasy and science fiction in dynamically different ways. Needless to say, "A.I." very skillfully presents us with important questions that we continuously ask ourselves at this time of scientific discovery; questions about morality, humanity, and how far we can go without going too far (this reminds me of the archeologists' discussion in Jurassic Park, as well as the squirm-inducing length of "A.I" itself), though it does not balance its child and adults aspects with as much diligence."A.I." succeeds on several levels, however, and is aided by the tremendous talent of one of the most amazing child actors I have ever seen. I watched, awestruck, as Haley Joel Osment convinced me that he was a mecha (short for mechanism), walking as if controlled by gears and springs, talking with a flat metallic twinge, until he is "imprinted," or programmed to love, then conveying a range of emotions to the audience. I feel sure he will be nominated for an Oscar, just as he was for his other memorable performance in "The Sixth Sense." Especially noteworthy is the performance of Jude Law, who makes a lasting impression with a very small role, just as he has in other films. As a "lover mecha," programmed solely to give pleasure to lonely and needy young women, Law is truly too beautiful to be mistaken for a human. He adds charm and even humor to the his scenes, and supplies some of the more thought-provoking dialogue. ("They made us too smart, too quick, and too many. We're paying for their mistakes because when the end comes, all that will be left is us") The humans of "A.I." may have first created robots to work for them, but playing God quickly allowed them to realize that they were mortal. This film may claim to be about the machine that can love, but it is really about the human who will always fear death and loneliness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pinnochio Retread</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. is a combination of genres, science fiction and fairy tale, about an abandoned robot on a seemingly hopeless quest to be reunited with his human mother. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. One thing it will do is enrage adoptive parents who also have biological children. Interestingly, Spielberg too has both.Despite the fantastic settings, animatronics and the super-marketable "Teddy," the movie is an uneven and disjointed mix of Pinnochio, Snow White, Wizard of Oz, E.T., Close Encounters, 2001 and Blade Runner.Haley Joel Osmet is showing his 13 years, yet carries the film like the pro he is. But his performance does not save or make the picture.For die hard film fans, Kaminski photographs each scene as a little jewel. However, like the Energizer Bunny the film goes on and on ... it seems a lot longer than its 2 and a half hours.This is a risk taking film that is in no-man's land between mainstream and independent. It will not be hailed as Spielberg's best, but it has his indelible mark all over it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Artificial Intelligence: The biggest disappointment since GodzillaStanley where are you when we need you? Spielberg takes the Kubrick plot line about an artificially Intelligent robot boy that wants to be a real boy and makes it his own. Despite the great bloodline this movie is not good, even though it has points where there are some interesting visuals.The first portion of the film ( where David gets a mommy ) sets the pace for the rest of this film, glacial.... once David is "adopted" by his new parents his creators seem to forget about him, sort of like all those furby's laying around in the kids closets. I think they would have monitored their new creation a little closer as well as done a little bit more serious psychological digging into the stability of the adoptive parents before handing over their prized David with instructions printed on a plastic card.The pacing never improves from the slow start, and then comes the darkness, the bleakness, the dreariness, the gloom. MOMMY! Save me! If you are looking for an entertaining movie of a sweet looking boy eventually finding happiness in a mixed up world,forget it. If you are looking for some deep insights into the question of creating thinking robots, forget that also. Rod Serling delivered more poignant messages in 17 minutes on the Twilight Zone. And then there are the Aliens? and the narration. Please! Kids where is my E.T. video ? Or maybe even better yet..... a screening of A Clockwork Orange.. RIP Stanley we miss ya!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've seen this story before--it's the story of Pinocchio, this time set in the far future, using cybernetics instead of woodcarving. All the elements are still there: kindly "Gepetto" (William Hurt as the robotics scientist), the "bad boy" (Jude Law as Gigolo Joe) the evil circus man (the Flesh Fair operator), the cute sidekick creature (Teddy), even the huge whale(seen briefly underwater.) Haley Joel Osment plays David/Pinocchio, the robot boy who wants to be a "real" boy, straining his eye muscles to look as innocent and guileless as possible, and stretching his acting muscles to be as loving and pathetic as he can be. Trouble is, the cartoon Pinocchio was a far more satisfying film than AI. This film fails in two ways: first by never addressing its biggest question: WHY would anyone want a robot that could love? and secondly, by doing it with manipulative special effects. These combine to make the viewer feel cheated and leaves one hungry for what isn't there.The FX is astonishing at times, and provides the only reason to see this film. The cinematography is truly futuristic, artfully done. They spare no expense to set the scene, but there is no substance in the story--just one effect after another, and a lot of missed opportunities. What could have been a truly great film veers off into a lot of sentimentality, over-long even tedious explanation, and deus ex machina endings that patronize the audience. By the end of the film you want to go drink a cup of vinegar to rid yourself of the cloying taste.It's unfortunate that Spielberg, for all his skill, could not flesh out this story as easily as he fleshes out his robots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not know what to expect when I sat down to watch this film. Was it going to be a paen to Kubrick? Would we be forced to watch a sappy Spielberg-esque interpretation of what Kubrick would have "wanted"? I was hoping this wouldn't be the case.And it wasn't.This was an amazing film. It was beautiful, it was emotional, it was heart-wrenching, and it was truly intriguging. an hour after watching this film, my stomach still has butterflies, and tears still linger in my eyes.For as annoying I have considered Haley Joel Osment in previous films, in A.I., this young man deserves the Oscar for best actor. He gives a gifted and astounding performance in this film, and should be given accolades of the highest order in Hollywood.The film was a perfect amalgam of Kubrick intelligence and dark morals, yet filled with the wonderment and visual astonishment that can only be brought to celluloid by Spielberg. The visual effects were stunning.Jude Law as "Joe" was also excellent in his role as "Joe". I will not spoil anything in this movie, as I prefer to see films unspoiled, but I have not seen a performance of this caliber from him yet. I was keenly impressed.Overall, I recommend this film to adults who enjoy sci-fi, but as well as adults who really love drama. Even if your better half doesn't want to go see a "robot movie" drag them kicking and screaming. They will love it. I would, however, recommend that you do not bring children under the age of 12 to see this movie. There were many disturbing scenes in this film that I think are too mature for young kids, and the subject matter and metaphysical and philosophical content might just be confusing.In summary, I loved this film. I hope it gets the accolades it deserves.</fullReview>

David is just as real, and no more so,as Teddy. Teddy is just as real, and no more so, than this computer on which I am typing. They exist, but they do not live and they do not feel. I can make my computer cry by running a .wav file. It does mean it feels emotions.Monica was littering by leaving David in the woods. She was not abandoning a dog or even a bird or a rat. She was throwing away equipment she no longer wanted.The alien scenes should have found the floor of the editing room. In the last act, David becomes an artifact, like a primitive mortar and pestle from an African archeological dig. David becomes a lab rat, except that a lab rat has feelings.He is not alive, can never be alive and can not feel. Not even the aliens can give him life. He is programmed to cry and throw fits at certain events. The aliens had no love for David. They used him for the knowledge in his memory banks.Speilberg fails to personify the machine.Comparisons to Blade Runner are apt. In Blade Runner, however, director Ridley Scott does a much better job of giving the replicants life than Speilberg does giving life to David in A.I.A.I. fails.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the breakdown: **SPOILERS**-Technical (Special Effects...): A visual masterpiece unlike anything you have ever seen. It's all so jaw-droppingly real, and yet at the same time unique, that it just imprints in your mind like no other film. The New York sequences are especially amazing.-Artistic (Visually, Aurally, Acting): The artistic design in this movie is amazing. Everything is futuristic, yet strangely real, and all the sets have the same Kubrickian sterility and chromed look. Superb. Also, the soundtrack by John Williams is one of the best I've heard recently, subtle and yet strangely hypnotic. The performances are excellent, especially by Osment and O'Connor, and by Hurt. Law is great, but I felt that his sub-plot was too truncated.-Story (Emotions, Intelligence): Ooooh boy, here the flaws come rolling in. The first two hours of this movie are some of the most captivating, brilliant, thought-provoking and philosophically charged hours I've ever experienced. They tell a story that feels like a futuristic fairy tale merged with an Asimov short story, all told by Kubrick. But then the last half-hour sets in, and here I feel Spielberg dropped the ball really hard. I really expected - MAJOR SPOILERS - the story to end underwater on Coney Island, but the whole sequence with the aliens felt so artificial, so pulled by the hair, and so conflicting with the last two hours that it almost wrecked the movie for me (I say almost, because it still asks some intelligent moral questions that may have you thinking for a long time). -END OF MAJOR SPOILERS. Basically, if they would have dropped the final ending and replaced it's running time with more complete sub-plots, the movie would have been - dare I say this - close to perfect.Conclusion: The movie is good. Really good if you can overlook the last half-hour. It's the most ambitious, intelligent, thought-provoking and visually haunting piece I've seen in a very long time, and Spielberg should be strongly commended for having the guts to bring Kubrick's vision to the screen. This is a work that will haunt you and keep you thinking for a long time, and for me, this is amazing enough to make me overlook some of the storyline potholes.</fullReview>

The boy was supposed to be very realistic but for some reason the teddy bear (had AI too so it's not an insult) seemed more human than the boy did. The movie had very interesting points but just seemed to rush through them as if they were nothing. They have them saying the humans hated them explained why and never touched it again. The ending was a bit of a stretch (won't say what but you will probably see it to). The sound track was good although John Williams has definatly done better. Special effects were great and hard to spot (this is coming from a 3D animator). I will say it is definatly original it may have been done before in Bicentenial Man but the way it unfolds is new and like no other movie.

I watched, awestruck, as Haley Joel Osment convinced me that he was a mecha (short for mechanism), walking as if controlled by gears and springs, talking with a flat metallic twinge, until he is "imprinted," or programmed to love, then conveying a range of emotions to the audience. I feel sure he will be nominated for an Oscar, just as he was for his other memorable performance in "The Sixth Sense." Especially noteworthy is the performance of Jude Law, who makes a lasting impression with a very small role, just as he has in other films. As a "lover mecha," programmed solely to give pleasure to lonely and needy young women, Law is truly too beautiful to be mistaken for a human. He adds charm and even humor to the his scenes, and supplies some of the more thought-provoking dialogue. ("They made us too smart, too quick, and too many. We're paying for their mistakes because when the end comes, all that will be left is us") The humans of "A.I." may have first created robots to work for them, but playing God quickly allowed them to realize that they were mortal. This film may claim to be about the machine that can love, but it is really about the human who will always fear death and loneliness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pinnochio Retread</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. is a combination of genres, science fiction and fairy tale, about an abandoned robot on a seemingly hopeless quest to be reunited with his human mother. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. One thing it will do is enrage adoptive parents who also have biological children. Interestingly, Spielberg too has both.Despite the fantastic settings, animatronics and the super-marketable "Teddy," the movie is an uneven and disjointed mix of Pinnochio, Snow White, Wizard of Oz, E.T., Close Encounters, 2001 and Blade Runner.Haley Joel Osmet is showing his 13 years, yet carries the film like the pro he is. But his performance does not save or make the picture.For die hard film fans, Kaminski photographs each scene as a little jewel. However, like the Energizer Bunny the film goes on and on ... it seems a lot longer than its 2 and a half hours.This is a risk taking film that is in no-man's land between mainstream and independent. It will not be hailed as Spielberg's best, but it has his indelible mark all over it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Artificial Intelligence: The biggest disappointment since GodzillaStanley where are you when we need you? Spielberg takes the Kubrick plot line about an artificially Intelligent robot boy that wants to be a real boy and makes it his own. Despite the great bloodline this movie is not good, even though it has points where there are some interesting visuals.The first portion of the film ( where David gets a mommy ) sets the pace for the rest of this film, glacial.... once David is "adopted" by his new parents his creators seem to forget about him, sort of like all those furby's laying around in the kids closets. I think they would have monitored their new creation a little closer as well as done a little bit more serious psychological digging into the stability of the adoptive parents before handing over their prized David with instructions printed on a plastic card.The pacing never improves from the slow start, and then comes the darkness, the bleakness, the dreariness, the gloom. MOMMY! Save me! If you are looking for an entertaining movie of a sweet looking boy eventually finding happiness in a mixed up world,forget it. If you are looking for some deep insights into the question of creating thinking robots, forget that also. Rod Serling delivered more poignant messages in 17 minutes on the Twilight Zone. And then there are the Aliens? and the narration. Please! Kids where is my E.T. video ? Or maybe even better yet..... a screening of A Clockwork Orange.. RIP Stanley we miss ya!</fullReview>

All the elements are still there: kindly "Gepetto" (William Hurt as the robotics scientist), the "bad boy" (Jude Law as Gigolo Joe) the evil circus man (the Flesh Fair operator), the cute sidekick creature (Teddy), even the huge whale(seen briefly underwater.) Haley Joel Osment plays David/Pinocchio, the robot boy who wants to be a "real" boy, straining his eye muscles to look as innocent and guileless as possible, and stretching his acting muscles to be as loving and pathetic as he can be. Trouble is, the cartoon Pinocchio was a far more satisfying film than AI. This film fails in two ways: first by never addressing its biggest question: WHY would anyone want a robot that could love? and secondly, by doing it with manipulative special effects. These combine to make the viewer feel cheated and leaves one hungry for what isn't there.The FX is astonishing at times, and provides the only reason to see this film. The cinematography is truly futuristic, artfully done. They spare no expense to set the scene, but there is no substance in the story--just one effect after another, and a lot of missed opportunities. What could have been a truly great film veers off into a lot of sentimentality, over-long even tedious explanation, and deus ex machina endings that patronize the audience. By the end of the film you want to go drink a cup of vinegar to rid yourself of the cloying taste.It's unfortunate that Spielberg, for all his skill, could not flesh out this story as easily as he fleshes out his robots.</fullReview>

I would not, however, call this a children's film. Joe is a great character, but try explaining what a gigolo is to a six-year-old. Also, some events that I'll not explain, for fear of spoilers (let's just call them lunar occurances), were downright disturbing (in a good, chilling, well-done film sort of way). Overall, it definitely nailed the Sci-Fi vibe, as I left the theatre pondering human-machine relations. I only wish that Kubrick had survived to finish it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw the film, so I will comment while it's fresh in my mind. So far, the reviews are fairly accurate- this film is a "brundlefly" fusion of Kubrick and Spielberg, and needs more fine-tuning. However, It deserves credit for being an intelligent, provocative summer film- a rare thing these days. Without spoiling too much, I will make my comments: Excellent performances by O'conner,Osment, and Jude Law. they were fascinating characters and gave memorable performances. The sleeper hit of the show: Teddy! I expected him to be this film's "Jar-Jar". Thankfully, he was not. For a stuffed animal, Teddy puts in a subtle, restrained performance, with a tremendous amount of quiet dignity. Can a stuffed toy get an Oscar? This bear earned iThe ending: I won't spoil it (as much as I'd love to), but the ending, or should I say ending(s), was laid on a bit thick, in typical Spielberg fashion. Although very interesting, and visually breathtaking at points, the story would have been served better with a quicker, more open ending. Note to the guys: We can all learn a few things from Jude Law's "Gigolo Joe" character. His hyper-smooth "Lady killer" character is a blast to watch in action. Note to the girls: If you're going to have children, don't have real and robotic children in the house at the same time... it will not go well. Trust me on this. My recommendation: see it. If nothing else, for some solid performances, serious robotic creepiness, the best whacked-out sci-fi city sets this side of Blade Runner, and one damn cool teddy bear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg's extraordinary talent at getting the most from his actors provides most of the drive in this overly long and languid exploration of what it means to be human. Frances O'Connor, Jude Law, and the unbelievably talented Haley Joel Osment turn in true star performances to keep the audience interest, but a slow and methodical pace diminishes the tension created by the well shot personal scenes. The script takes its time getting to where the audience already knows it's headed, and powerful scenery simply helps imply action where none is forthcoming. The key Spielberg moments are still here - tense and moving in their beauty, but a horribly overblown, overexplained (hint: don't start using voiceovers 3/4 of the way into your movie), and woefully underwhelming ending leave you wanting less. It's Speilberg trying to be Kubrick, and this movie does a disservice to them both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie with Great potential gone slightly wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I., is a quite interesting movie visually, conceptually and most importantly emotionally. The first thing that caught my attention was the fact, the I could 'feel' something for a robot. This is where this movie was strong. Weaknesses on the other hand were plenty. The main thing that this movie lacked was unity. There are three main parts to the movie, each having its unique style and feel. Separately, each part is gratifying as any good movie, but together, all three parts did not hold together. In my opinion, the links were too weak. The worst part about the clashing, is the fact that the makers of this film were aware of them, and instead of manipulating the scenes more to make the movie flow, they went for the quick fix. Each of the three parts had a blunt explanation of what is going on. As if there was no other way to link the sections of the movie, the situations are 'literally' spoon fed to the audience. At some points things even became really far fetched. So much so, that the movie left the Science Fiction realm and entered the Fantasy world. This can bee seen as a good or a bad thing. In my opinion, it detracted from a movie, making it somewhat unbeliveable and outlandish.If you are looking for visual splendor and to be moved by sweet emotional sequences, this movie is for you.If you are looking for a movie which will leave a lasting impression, go see something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please don't read this if you have not seen the movie. ----------Spoilers alert----------I was very disappointed in the film. I have so many issues I can't begin to list them all. I've seen Sci-Fi T.V. shows (the new Other Limits comes to mind) that have done a better job with this kind of material. The first thing that really got me started was the way that Monica was like some housewife from the Fifties. I mean this is suppose to be set in a time when they have robots doing everything, and her husband works for the company that makes them, but there she is, making beds, and doing the laundry. What the heck's up with that? I never could get a handle on where the people in this movie were supposed to be coming from. All we see is the parents, and then the WWF rip off scene with a bunch of red neck looking folk that get a kick out of watching robots getting killed in the worse kind of ways. I kept thinking if people hated robots so much how the heck does a family have one for a son without keeping him a secret. And of course we had to have it set up so that David only imprints with Monica leaving poor old dad with lines like (he's only a toy), And of course the real son does an amazing recovery and he turns out to be a mean little guy. What's a loving Mommy to do? Drop him and his teddy in the woods all by himself so we can all have a good cry, of course. The movie really takes a nosedive after that. Are we suppose to believe that the woods are crawling with deformed robots just waiting to get their spare parts from a dump truck? Didn't the world just about end and now there dumping tons of old robot parts right there in the open ground? Please explain that to me. And then don't you think if the guy rounding up the robots saw David he'd want to cash in on this one of a kind robot instead of just wanting to destroy it? The rest of the film is too goofy to go into, except the part were he sees all the Dave boxes and one of them jiggles. Really now are we supposed to believe that these super real robots come in big old boxes? Come on now! And the end really felt like one big sob fest set up. I think it would have been a lot better to end it in the water. At lest it would have been more convincing then the way it did end. For the record I counted 6 people leave the movie when the water scene was ending. I really though it was over to, but I looked at my watch and damn there's still 30 min's to go! The movie is nothing more then a high tech fairy tale with some really gory violence. I was expecting so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. struck me as a film that was a combination of almost all of Kubrick's films, Spielberg's films and Blade Runner. With stunning visuals and flawless acting this movie is sure to impress anyone. However, on the more philosophical level, this movie will raise many more questions than it answers. What is love? Can love be defined/given/taken? Also, it digs deep into the raw emotions of humans and their desires. I congratulate both directors and writers for pushing the envelope and creating a movie that tests the minds of the audience.However, I am thoroughly disapointed with the ending. It seems that once again Spielberg has decided to throw in another ending that tries to tie things up more completely. Throughout the movie it is quite evident when it is Spielberg directing and when it is Kubrick and the end is without a dought all Spielberg. I won't spoil any of the plot for you dont' worry I'll just say that at times in this movie I found myself stepping back and saying "woah how'd they do that" and "that's a great effect" These and the numerous cameos were all the detracted from an extroadinarily visual epic of a living robot boy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that one of the most blatant symbols ever utilized for tremendous effect in a Spielberg film was Teddy, the classic "supertoy". It perfectly showed David's neverending boyishness as it traveled with him throughout the film and was standing right by him when he discovered the "ultimate truth".The film is certainly a recollection of every Spielberg film and every Kubrik film ever made. And, in today's world of forced and contrived movie making, it would seem that the minds of two of Hollywood's most uncompromising directors ever would certainly crash in a storm that nobody would want. But somehow, it did work, and perfectly at that.It is the first time Spielberg has been given full writing credit since "Close Encounters" in 1977. It is also the last time Stanley Kubrik will ever be given credit on film (except for the thank you notes on the credits of every single director of the next generation). I think it perfectly makes up for the critical lambasting of "Eyes Wide Shut" and it will, over the years, certainly develop a cult following, for it has something for everyone.In closing, the movie is ultimately a film that looks extremely meticulous, but teaches the most simple of lessons: each and every person ever made is unique. It may be as cliched as Traffuat's freeze frame at the end of "The 400 Blows", but this film generates a uniqueness for retelling it. It will stay with you long after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEADI'm still raw from the movie. I was actually close to sobbing in the theater. Spielberg has created a wonderful film about the age-old question of: what does it mean to be human? David is, other than Joe and Teddy, utterly alone in his world. Even in the end, he's alone. When the Speaker says to David "You've had so little happiness," I thought that hit the nail on the head, and it let me relax, and cry, when I realized he would finally have some happiness - even if just for a day. This robot - this little boy who just happens to be a robot programmed to love - just wants to know he is loved. Professor Hobby is right, in the beginning, when he says that love is the key. It is the key to all other emotions. David becomes a real boy, he becomes just as human as he can, because of that love. I kept thinking of Roy from BLADE RUNNER, and of Tyrell's motto: "More human than human," and watching how the replicants and the mecha are so much alike. If you're questioning what you've seen, if you're calling this a poor film, you aren't actually watching the film; you're looking for a 'summer movie,' which this isn't. This is the Spielberg of SCHINDLER'S LIST, not JURASSIC PARK. This is the Kubrick of 2001 and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, not THE SHINING. Kubrick has given us one last message about the human condition. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absorbing, visually-stunning Pinocchio-esque sci-fi tale about a robotic "young boy" and his seemingly neverending search to become real. Haley Joel Osment is a stand-out, as is the supporting cast, especially Jude Law. Not necessarily a triumph due to it's uneven story and overly-sentimental end, but an astounding film nevertheless.

		<fullReview>A.I. struck me as a film that was a combination of almost all of Kubrick's films, Spielberg's films and Blade Runner. With stunning visuals and flawless acting this movie is sure to impress anyone. However, on the more philosophical level, this movie will raise many more questions than it answers. What is love? Can love be defined/given/taken? Also, it digs deep into the raw emotions of humans and their desires. I congratulate both directors and writers for pushing the envelope and creating a movie that tests the minds of the audience.However, I am thoroughly disapointed with the ending. It seems that once again Spielberg has decided to throw in another ending that tries to tie things up more completely. Throughout the movie it is quite evident when it is Spielberg directing and when it is Kubrick and the end is without a dought all Spielberg. I won't spoil any of the plot for you dont' worry I'll just say that at times in this movie I found myself stepping back and saying "woah how'd they do that" and "that's a great effect" These and the numerous cameos were all the detracted from an extroadinarily visual epic of a living robot boy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that one of the most blatant symbols ever utilized for tremendous effect in a Spielberg film was Teddy, the classic "supertoy". It perfectly showed David's neverending boyishness as it traveled with him throughout the film and was standing right by him when he discovered the "ultimate truth".The film is certainly a recollection of every Spielberg film and every Kubrik film ever made. And, in today's world of forced and contrived movie making, it would seem that the minds of two of Hollywood's most uncompromising directors ever would certainly crash in a storm that nobody would want. But somehow, it did work, and perfectly at that.It is the first time Spielberg has been given full writing credit since "Close Encounters" in 1977. It is also the last time Stanley Kubrik will ever be given credit on film (except for the thank you notes on the credits of every single director of the next generation). I think it perfectly makes up for the critical lambasting of "Eyes Wide Shut" and it will, over the years, certainly develop a cult following, for it has something for everyone.In closing, the movie is ultimately a film that looks extremely meticulous, but teaches the most simple of lessons: each and every person ever made is unique. It may be as cliched as Traffuat's freeze frame at the end of "The 400 Blows", but this film generates a uniqueness for retelling it. It will stay with you long after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEADI'm still raw from the movie. I was actually close to sobbing in the theater. Spielberg has created a wonderful film about the age-old question of: what does it mean to be human? David is, other than Joe and Teddy, utterly alone in his world. Even in the end, he's alone. When the Speaker says to David "You've had so little happiness," I thought that hit the nail on the head, and it let me relax, and cry, when I realized he would finally have some happiness - even if just for a day. This robot - this little boy who just happens to be a robot programmed to love - just wants to know he is loved. Professor Hobby is right, in the beginning, when he says that love is the key. It is the key to all other emotions. David becomes a real boy, he becomes just as human as he can, because of that love. I kept thinking of Roy from BLADE RUNNER, and of Tyrell's motto: "More human than human," and watching how the replicants and the mecha are so much alike. If you're questioning what you've seen, if you're calling this a poor film, you aren't actually watching the film; you're looking for a 'summer movie,' which this isn't. This is the Spielberg of SCHINDLER'S LIST, not JURASSIC PARK. This is the Kubrick of 2001 and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, not THE SHINING. Kubrick has given us one last message about the human condition. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please don't read this if you have not seen the movie. ----------Spoilers alert----------I was very disappointed in the film. I have so many issues I can't begin to list them all. I've seen Sci-Fi T.V. shows (the new Other Limits comes to mind) that have done a better job with this kind of material. The first thing that really got me started was the way that Monica was like some housewife from the Fifties. I mean this is suppose to be set in a time when they have robots doing everything, and her husband works for the company that makes them, but there she is, making beds, and doing the laundry. What the heck's up with that? I never could get a handle on where the people in this movie were supposed to be coming from. All we see is the parents, and then the WWF rip off scene with a bunch of red neck looking folk that get a kick out of watching robots getting killed in the worse kind of ways. I kept thinking if people hated robots so much how the heck does a family have one for a son without keeping him a secret. And of course we had to have it set up so that David only imprints with Monica leaving poor old dad with lines like (he's only a toy), And of course the real son does an amazing recovery and he turns out to be a mean little guy. What's a loving Mommy to do? Drop him and his teddy in the woods all by himself so we can all have a good cry, of course. The movie really takes a nosedive after that. Are we suppose to believe that the woods are crawling with deformed robots just waiting to get their spare parts from a dump truck? Didn't the world just about end and now there dumping tons of old robot parts right there in the open ground? Please explain that to me. And then don't you think if the guy rounding up the robots saw David he'd want to cash in on this one of a kind robot instead of just wanting to destroy it? The rest of the film is too goofy to go into, except the part were he sees all the Dave boxes and one of them jiggles. Really now are we supposed to believe that these super real robots come in big old boxes? Come on now! And the end really felt like one big sob fest set up. I think it would have been a lot better to end it in the water. At lest it would have been more convincing then the way it did end. For the record I counted 6 people leave the movie when the water scene was ending. I really though it was over to, but I looked at my watch and damn there's still 30 min's to go! The movie is nothing more then a high tech fairy tale with some really gory violence. I was expecting so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a kids movie that hides behind the shield of a conglomeration of Sci Fi movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film with the hope that maybe here would be another bladerunner. Unfortunately I should have realised that the Speilberg spin on artificial intelligence is one in which instead of embracing the awesome questions it arises in regards to the future of man all he sees is another blockbuster happy go lucky kids story. The strange thing is that he does raise all of the questions of morality and deception that many sci fi authors have spoken of and then somehow just leaves the questions unanswered so that he can have his happy ending, whether or not it makes any sense. I would agree with many of the critics that have written their comments here, the movie is too long, were it to end when things were still somewhat founded in reality it would have certainly been a film I recommended, but of course that didnt happen. I am still left with the feeling that no one out there really understands Sci Fi better than Kubrick or Ridley Scott. This is a hard fact to come to terms with because there are certainly some great stories out there just waiting to be capitalized and are not based around a childrens fairy tale, but are founded on the true exploration of Science in a world where technology is both embraced and shunned. I cannot emphasize enough how disappointed I was with this film, the ending was unbearable, the whole audience got up from their seats and looked somewhat amazed that this is what they had been excited about. I have never been to a premiere and seen so many people so silent afterwards, what could they say, I certainly felt the same. If you have seen Mission to Mars I would say it is on that level. Haley Joel Osmont was good and Jude Law is always entertaining even if his role was a little flat. It was the story just made you cringe not the acting. The other problem was that while the special effects were good you didnt see enough of them, Bladerunner was art, this certainly was not.In conclusion I will say that I would never recommend this to anyone, even children, it was too dark for them and too banal for adults. It displayed a whole range of visuals lifted from other more successful films and mixed fantasy with sci fi in the most irritating way I have ever seen. If you are going to do a childrens story, or if you want to do something that questions the morals of the human race then do one or the other, never try both because you will end up with a confused film such as A.I.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please don't read this if you have not seen the movie. ----------Spoilers alert----------I was very disappointed in the film. I have so many issues I can't begin to list them all. I've seen Sci-Fi T.V. shows (the new Other Limits comes to mind) that have done a better job with this kind of material. The first thing that really got me started was the way that Monica was like some housewife from the Fifties. I mean this is suppose to be set in a time when they have robots doing everything, and her husband works for the company that makes them, but there she is, making beds, and doing the laundry. What the heck's up with that? I never could get a handle on where the people in this movie were supposed to be coming from. All we see is the parents, and then the WWF rip off scene with a bunch of red neck looking folk that get a kick out of watching robots getting killed in the worse kind of ways. I kept thinking if people hated robots so much how the heck does a family have one for a son without keeping him a secret. And of course we had to have it set up so that David only imprints with Monica leaving poor old dad with lines like (he's only a toy), And of course the real son does an amazing recovery and he turns out to be a mean little guy. What's a loving Mommy to do? Drop him and his teddy in the woods all by himself so we can all have a good cry, of course. The movie really takes a nosedive after that.

		<shortDescription>Will satisfy the most discriminating of tastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever seen one of those Conan O'Brien skits, the ones where he takes two celebrity couples, and through the magic of computer, shows them what their child would look like, if they chose to breed? Since first hearing that Steven Spielberg was taking over Stanley Kubrick's film, A. I., after Kubrick kicked the celluloid bucket, I thought the film would be about as cute as one of those digitalized mongoloid freak infants Conan shows weekly on his show. To my surprise, Spielberg took Kubrick's vision, twisted in some of his own ideas, and created an amalgam of a movie that will hopefully satisfy the most discriminating of tastes.This isn't just one film that you're seeing. This isn't just one director, or one directorial style being displayed in front of your starving eyes. Although Spielberg gets most of the credit (Kubrick is relegated to "concept"), this is obviously more Stanley's film than it is Steven's. Sure, after the first 30 minutes, or so, it moves at a near breakneck pace that Stanley wouldn't hear of, during his lifetime, but Steven begins to slow things down again at the end, just enough to remind you that this isn't really his baby, after-all. This is merely a transfer from Kubrick's many discussions and concept designs regarding the film, before his death, to an actual movie that Spielberg created. There are the trademark Spielberg moments scattered throughout; but instead of wrecking the film that Kubrick would have made, they actually accentuate what was obviously Kubrick's idea of where the film should have gone.Steven Spielberg does a wonderful job contrasting the darker vision Kubrick had of A. I. with his own lighter, fairy-tale version of how he feels the film should play. After a few mushy E. T. type moments, the viewer is literally jolted into a world that could be created by no one other than the wonderful Stanley Kubrick. This isn't A Clockwork Orange, but it damn well isn't Hook, either. A lot of the parents in the theater found the film, and I quote, "disturbing" and, "not for kids at all." I don't agree with those comments, but I do think that children should definitely be forewarned that this isn't the sweet little fable they've been promised in the television commercials. Sure, David the machine (played by Haley Joel Osment) wants to become a real boy, to gain the love of his "mother," which is all heartwarming, but he has a hell of a lot of very frightening (especially for the under 13 gang) set of obstacles to go through, if he ever hopes to attain his dreams. This is a hard PG-13, and that's just the way Kubrick would have wanted it.Everything "Kubrick" in the film is spectacular. The way David is befriended by the flamboyant Gigolo Joe (Jude Law, in his best role to date), a machine made for no reason other than to make love to lonely ladies in Rouge City, a neon-crazed part of the country that would put any red light district to shame, just had to have come from Kubrick's zany brain. A few of the "Spielberg" moments in the film are slightly shaky, but luckily there aren't that many. The Spielberg scene that annoyed me the most was with "Dr. Know." The entire section seemed robbed from Spielberg's original Jurassic Park, when Mr. DNA introduces Dr. Hammond, and then Hammond talks to the film version of himself during a presentation played to his visitors in hopes of explaining how his team was able to extract dinosaur DNA from mosquitoes.Still, I'm making double D cups out of single A's. Spielberg and Kubrick essentially did a tag-team job of directing A. I.. Two directors of that caliber getting together to make a film just doesn't happen. And it didn't. It took the death of Kubrick to make it happen. Sure, if Kubrick had made it, with no help from Spielberg, it would be far more intense, a lot more boring (in a good way), and the cutesy stuff would have been cut. At the same time, if Spielberg would have made it, with no help from Kubrick, it would be far more sentimental, and all the "scary" stuff would be replaced with glowing alien fingers and magical moments created to put a lump in the audience's throat. Spielberg wrote and directed it with a little bit of both. I think that, in the end, he was extremely daring with the pacing and attitude of the film, and had the nerve to bring Kubrick's vision to light.I honestly believe Stanley would have been proud of the picture Steven created, warts and all. I hope the majority of the movie watching community feels the same way. In traditional Kubrick style, this film does get slow moving (think the last 15 minutes of Kubrick's 2001) in parts, and I'm afraid Attention Deficit Disordered America will turn their backs on A. I., looking for another hyper-spastic pile of crap like Tomb Raider. Spielberg doesn't usually move this slow, or probe this deep, and a lot of his diehard fans, many of whom have probably never heard of Stanley Kubrick, may leave the theater sorely disappointed.I hope that Spielberg's fans are more open than I'm giving them credit for, and they help make the film a huge success, so we can see more films, in the "event" arena, that slow down long enough for plot and character development. I honestly didn't think we'd ever get to see another big budget movie like A. I. again, and I don't want this to be the last of its kind. I've seen one too many great movies become financial disasters, over the last decade. And yes, A. I. is a great movie. Kubrick and Spielberg produced the perfect baby; not even Conan, and his wonder-computer, could have seen that one coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw the Toronto Premiere last night.... 3 words. Edit, edit and edit.What starts out as a really very promising story just loses it along the way. It's as if Spielberg had all these scraps of paper from Kubrik and wanted to include every possible scene and idea into the film.Yes, there are cutting edge effects but you get that in every other TV advert these days. (Special effects are becoming the 'bearded lady' of modern entertainment; seen one, seen em' all!)The one thing that we KNOW Spielberg can do (arguably better than any other modern director) is just tell a story. But somehow, the pacing and sense of discontinuity I felt watching the film from the 'abandonment' onwards shows that something went wrong with this... it stuttered clumsily between characters and scenes, and went off on a tangent or two that Kubrik obviously steered more than Spielberg..Great performances from Law and Osment though, just a shame that the editor was tied and gagged in a broom closet somewhere during the production. I have to say, I know it's a tough audience (all media types) but there were about a dozen walkouts before the film ended, which I haven't seen happen since 'Mission To Mars'.Go see it anyway, Mr Spielberg is a nice guy and needs your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome To the Machines.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the death of Stanley Kubrick on March of 1999, I was sad to see both the loss of a excellent director and the long planned project of his titled, "A.I." that would never be shown. I first heard about A.I. about ten years ago on a radio talk show when a caller ask the host on what was Stanley Kubrick up to. Then hearing that Steven Spielberg was going to take over, I felt that Stanley's wife Christina, wanted Spielberg to take over the project since Steven and Stanely were both good friends. I was then very pleased to hear that Stanley's original intentions were to have Speilberg direct, and Stanley would design and the have the credits read "A Stanley Kubrick Productions of a Steven Spielberg Film." Now that time of waiting for about ten years has come, I heard more rumors and anticipation with A.I. than I did with STAR WARS EPISODE I. And viewing A.I. had transported me into another world........... A.I. tells a classic tale of a very human like robot named David (Haley Joel Osment) who is taken in by a grieving couple, Monica and Henry Swinton (Frances O' Connor &amp; Sam Robards) to replace their son, Martin, who is lying in a coma after a terrible accident. Monica is angry at David and doesn't want anything to replace Martin, especially a machine. But Henry warns Monica that if they send David back to the factory, he'll be destroyed. Monica has a hard time trying to cope with David, and after a while, Monica begins to accept David as a new son. When Martin (Jake Thomas) wakes up from his coma, he sees David as a threat to his parents love. Martin pulls cruel tricks and pranks on David that causes Henry to hate David and Monica worried about the robot. It isn't until a birthday party accident that Henry orders Monica to take David back to be destroyed. Monica gets second thoughts about this, she still loves David like a son, but she knows that he's not welcomed back. So she drops David off in the forrest with his friend/toy Teddy (voiced by Jack Angel). Monica warns David to stay away from humans and only be with robots. David is heartbroken by his abondenment from Monica that he thinks that he's not loved because he's a robot. He feels that if he finds the blue fairy that was talked about in the story Pinocchio, that maybe David could also be a real boy. Thus begins the journey of David, the search of becoming a real boy. Along the way he meets a sexual pleasure robot named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) who is wrongfully accused of one of his female customer's murder. Lord Johnson Johnson (Brenden Gleason) a cruel robot hunter who destroys robots in a arena for entertainment value. And also Professor Hobby (William Hurt) the man who designed the robot to not only make it able to learn, but also to have feelings and love. After this summer crop of bad films and disappointments (PEARL HARBOR, A KNIGHT'S TALE, MUMMY RETURNS, TOMB RAIDER, etc.) Leave it to Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick to make not only the most pleasing film of the summer, but the most enjoyable film of the year. A.I. is short for Artificial Intelligence, it should be Absoultly Incredible! This was the movie that I was looking forward to the most this year(more than PEARL HARBOR and PLANET OF THE APES) and I am pleased to say that it met more than my expectations which makes it so far my favorite film of this year. What makes this a fantasitc film? First the acting is very well done. Haley Joel Osment proves that he is no ordinary child actor, but the Jodie Foster of his generation. Osment gives another outstanding performance as the robot David. He can act very much like a robot and a young curious and frighten child. I am expecting to see Osment get another Oscar nomination for this film. But I also like to recognize Jude Law and Frances O' Connor for their wonderful protrayl of the sex pleasure robot, and the mother who is depressed to let her newly arrived son released on his own. Then there is the set designs and costumes. I found out yesterday while watching the documentary STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES that Kubrick designed most of the sets and costumes for A.I. (he had to, he faxed over 500 drawings to Spielberg over the last year's of his life). The look of A.I. is a very fascinating mixture of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, BRAZIL, BLADE RUNNER, and WATERWORLD. With the future not looking bright and cheerful how it is protrayed in BACK TO THE FUTURE 2 and the STAR TREK movies, but dark, devistating, and apocylptic. The futurisic world of Mechna City where there is holograms displaying entertainment everywhere, to the ruins of Manhattan, where only the tops of the skyscrapers and torch of Lady Liberty stand above water. Then the costumes of the futurstic look are also great. The style that Gigolo Joe is wearing to impress the ladies with his looks, to the very scary look of the robot hunters who's outfits look like the characters from TRON. And the story most of all has great meaning to it. One would figure that it's a typical Spielberg story with as much corn as in the state of Iowa in it. But it does have a very deep and intellectual meaning behind it. The tale of a robot who thinks he's a boy that he is willing to do anything to try to become a real boy just to win back the love of his mom, Monica. Like UNBREAKABLE, it takes a while to digest it, but after digesting it, you would like more of it and begin to really appreciate it. Finally the directing style of Spielberg, where he does familar scenes from both his films and Kubrick's as well. The popluar "Monkey See, Monkey Do" scene from JAWS where Chief Brody makes movements as his son Sean imitates his every move. The isolation in the forrest in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is similar to when Monica takes David out to the forrest. And the horrific scenes in SCHINDLER'S LIST with what the Nazis did to the prisoners also are seen in A.I. with the abuse to what the humans do to destroy the robots, and make a show out of it. The irony is intresting, the most popular film of Stanley Kubrick's is 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Now that 2001 has arrived, the most entertaining film of 2001 is the film that Kubrick started to create. Maybe Kubrick was telling us something back in 1968 about what we could expect in the year 2001, not with the story but with the meaning. That something wonderful was yet to come, and that something is the film, A.I. It just would have been creepy to see a copy of A.I. sitting on the record shelf next to 2001 in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or having one of the female teens ask Alex about the group, Artificial Intelligence. People have always said that Stanley Kubrick was ahead of our time, and again, after passing away over two years ago, Kubrick is still years ahead of us. DON'T MISS THIS FANTASTIC FILM!!!! ***** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie at one o'clock in the morning, I was asking myself why I didn't fall asleep. I knew the answer immediately after: because I really liked this movie. Not so much because of the actors or the plot, but because this movie is packed full of imagination seen pretty much in all of Spielberg's films.I also found myself taken in by the sometimes annoying Haley Joel Osment's performance. Of course, throughout the film, I was comparing it to Bicentinial Man. I liked that movie alot as well, mainly for the same reasons. A.I. is imaginative, eerie, and yes, long. It's not an action movie, but Spielberg knows how to deliver amazing and effective effects. I was touched by the last half of the movie most of all. I won't give anything away, but it's surprisingly powerful and tear-jerking. I didn't cry, but I almost did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick/Speilberg blend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, Stanley Kubrick's movies improve with each viewing. The first time watching 2001, The Shining or Full Metal Jacket I left puzzled. The more I see these movies, the more they resonate. I think that in a Kubrick movie, the journey is more important than the destination. They don't have powerhouse climaxes. They don't end on a big emotional climax. They continue in the mind of the audience beyond the confines of the movie theater.Steven Spielberg's movies are a different matter. They are wonderful, manipulative and more than fulfill the first viewing's expectations. The best Spielberg movies are great the first time and every other time because they seem fresh each time you watch them. Jaws, Raiders and Jurassic Park each can thrill me with the same visceral energy I felt the first time I watched them. These films aren't deep. Hidden meanings aren't revealed. The lesser films in the Spielberg catalog, The Color Purple, Always and Hook lose that freshness with repeated viewings. They sometimes make me wonder why I liked them when I originally saw in them when I watch them again. The lone exception, in my mind, is Empire of the Sun, a subtle movie that reaches for more emotional resonance than the typical Spielberg film and which has grown on me through the power of its story and visual eloquence.So AI a strange hybrid. The performances are wonderful. The story is beautiful. The images are astounding. With a single viewing, I felt that Speilberg tried too hard to explain things that Kubrick would have left to be pondered on future viewings. It's not over the top explaining (my favorite example of over explaining is the end of Mission to Mars, which is like 2001 for Dummies) but there were times when my personal experience was interrupted by narration. I felt that each time my mind started to be intellectually curious, the narration would drown out my thoughts with overly simplistic words.But, that may have been the point of some of it. There is a strong fairytale theme. I suppose I will have to see it again to make sure. I'm looking forward to that. AI is a hard movie to pin down, and these days, that's got to be a good thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, when I first walked out of the theatre, I scratched my head, not because of my lice infestation, but because I wasn't sure if I liked the movie or not. As you all know, it is supposed to be a Kubrick/Spielberg hybrid, but it ends up being a little more warm'n fuzzy (ie Spielberg) than I would have liked. Having said that however, the various themes presented and outstanding performances by Osment and Law made me really enjoy this film. There are many questions posed in the movie, and although some of the answers are spoonfed to the audience, many are left with us - a typically Kubrick maneuver. Some of the devices used are a little silly, but in the end I chose to overlook them and totally dig the underlying messages delivered. And, let me finish off by saying this: be glad you aren't going to be around in the distant future. I for one believe that eventually, based on our historical and present relationship with machines, humanity as we know it will cease to exist...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg on Love on Human Destiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I never see a better movie than A.I. -- a more ambitious, intriguing, thoughtful, beautiful or satisfying one -- I won't be terribly disappointed, or even surprised. Spielberg (the benevolent, optimist, ecumenical humanist who favors the open cinematic style of Renoir) uses his great gift to transform a story with shades of Kubrick (the brilliant misanthropic satirist who used the closed, deterministic style of Lang) to tell the story of human spiritual yearning. That's not a subject that critics are comfortable with, so beware their misgivings and carpings and falsifying comparisons, especially their supposed fealty to how Kubrick would have done it. I remind readers that while they claim to idolize Kubrick (now that he's dead and they never have to sit through another of his movies) they've been picking him apart since the beginning. "The movie is so completely absorbed in its own problems," The New York Times wrote about 2001 in 1968, "its use of color and space, its fanatical devotion to science-fiction detail, that it is somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring."Remember that when you read bad things about A.I. Spielberg suffers the same misunderstanding and refusal to accept his movies on his terms from critics who, frankly, miss the point or deliberately avoid it so that they can seem unimpressed. I have no such interest in remaining cool about a movie as passionate as A.I. I can't tell you much without spoiling the pleasure of discovery that lies ahead; I can never see it again for the first time. (So, as Truffaut says to Dreyfuss in Close Encounters: "I envy you.") So let me speak in hopefully helpful generalities: It's a movie about love and man's spiritual journey, his relationship to God throughout history (you can watch it pass, in fact, from Old Testament allegory through an age of modern skepticism). There are images of Kubrickean human cruelty and suffering made all the more excruciatingly haunting by the contrast of Spielberg's sweetness and delicacy. (Bring no children, by the way: Savor the time you'll know they're ready for it.) Without giving away the ending, just contemplate Pinocchio's meaning, opened up for adults as if it's a myth. For what is the wish "Make me a real boy" but a timeless prayer that means "Make me worthy of love"? Don't miss this one, folks. It can restore your faith in cinema, if not something far more important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got the privilege of seeing a sneak preview of A.I. here in Seattle.I am not going to say much, because I do not want to ruin the film. This is, by far, Spielberg's best film. It encompasses everything you could want in a summer film, but is also has substance, something many films these days are lacking.Haley Joel Osment gives a brilliant performance. Not since Elijah Wood and Jodie Foster has a child actor carried a film so effortlessly and valiantly.This film does not focus too much on its brilliant special effects. Rather, it focuses on the moral dilemmas that we will have to face if this fictitious story does become fact one day. The ending is a fascinating mixture of Kubrick and Spielberg's filmmaking techniques. Certain parts of the film (most notably the ending) just screamed Kubrick. Aspects of the ending were directly taken from 2001.I could go on and on, but this is a film every person need to see for him/herself. Critics will praise the film, the public will probably be confused by it, and it may just be forgotten by Oscar time. However, in years to come, it will be known as Spielberg's seminal work and he will be appreciated for bringing his friend's final vision to life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg has done it again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hopefully this will be the hit of summer. In a seemingly lackluster crop of summer movies, this stands out amongst the other films. This movie was originally to be directed by the late (&amp; great) Stanley Kubrick, and Steven Spielberg stepped in. I know not what the movie was to be like with Kubrick at the helm, and it would have definitely been a much different film, but Kubrick would have loved this movie. This movie should already have a spot reserved for itself as a nominee for next year's Best Screenplay and Best Picture Oscars.The film (adapted from a short story) keeps you on the edge of your seat with a incredibly endearing and involving plotline. The movie deals with loving a robotic creation, and the performance of Haley Joel Osment does that for the viewer. You grow to love "David", which may possibly be one of the greatest pure "heroes" in the last few years of film. While the viewer spends the beginning of the movie growing attached to this character, you also search for a clean-cut "bad guy," but there isn't a single antagonist. The supporting cast perfectly compliments Osment's performance. Jude Law rebounds from a sub par performance in Enemy at the Gates, and Frances O'Connor should make a name for herself after this great performance. Jack Angel provides the voice of an intelligent futuristic walking, talking teddy bear that "David" takes a liking to.Steven Spielberg has done it again. The legacy of Kubrick should remember this as his last work, not "Eyes Wide Shut." This movie does the man's genius justice as a farewell and as a tribute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spielbrick Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was amazed at how much of the film felt like Kubrick, from the neo organic forms to the dark carnival atmosphere that draws inspiration from the less nice side of one's id. The story is based on a short by Brian Aldiss called Supertoys Last All Summer Long (if you get the chance, read it before you see the film - it won't spoil anything). The story itself reads like a Kubrick film, and its mood was maintained throughout. Spielberg's influence clearly wasn't absent, with its persistent appeal to the viewer's emotional side through bold situations and brilliant cinematography. The film does what it's supposed to do - it challenges the viewer at a fundamental level on the subject of love and dreams, albiet a bit darkly. I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was able to attend a free screening for this movie Monday night.This movie certainly will make you think as you leave the theater. From thoughts of your own children (if you have any) to your own mortal existence. It's an interesting ride that Spielberg/Kubrick take you through as you view this film. Emotions go from highs to lows. The portrayal of our future certainly was done with a lot of thought and the the special effects and scenes are truly amazing. At times the movie may tend to drag a wee bit, but I think that's mainly with the dialogue involved (some of which isn't really necessary.) Overall there's enough "eye excitement" to keep your interest, and Haley Joel Osment does a terrific job as the boy "mecha". I gave this movie a 7 and perhaps upon a second viewing may give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest disappointment about this film is that it could have been a masterpiece. I don't want to give anything away, but let's just say the story should have ended sooner than it did. Other than that, and one or two hokey lines in the beginning, it was sheer perfection. Osment was amazing and deserves an Oscar nomination. He's about the greatest child actor since Jodie Foster. Jude Law was terrific and has a good shot at a nomination as well. Definitely worth seeing. I plan to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We haven't had a serious science fiction film this good in quite a while.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, at long last, is the world of Stanley Kubrick's A.I. For 15 years, the movie remained a seemingly mythical promise -- Kubrick's long awaited return to science fiction. For ages, the movie remained in pre-production as Kubrick waited for special effects technology to advance to the point where his vision could be achieved. Alas, just as that time arrived, Kubrick left this mortal coil. And so it is left to Steven Spielberg -- who collaborated with Kubrick during the movie's long development process -- to examine the concept that so fascinated his mentor. At its core, A.I. looks at what will happen when the human race acquires the ability to create a machine that will love. What will happen when love can be literally packaged, put in a box and sold? What responsibility will humans have for machines that love them?The machine, in this case, is David, a prototype robot boy played wonderfully by Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense) made-up to make his skin look slightly rubbery. David is the perfect child. He goes to bed whenever you tell him. He smiles, he's helpful, polite, and he will never grow up. And he loves unconditionally.He is given to a set of parents in need, but like any toy, David quickly becomes expendable. Soon, he's cast out into the futuristic wilderness and must set out on a quest to regain his mother's love. Sadly misguided by the fairy tale Pinocchio, David believes the only way he can win his mother back is by finding someone who can turn him into a real little boy.Here, the sensibilities of Kubrick and Spielberg both merge and diverge. Kubrick -- the cynic -- would have had fun with the absurdity of a machine that will stop at nothing trying to carry out its program, even if it means trying to achieve something that's unachievable. Spielberg, meanwhile -- the more sentimental artist -- approaches David's quest as being emblematic of one of the most basic and universal human desires... David just wants his Mommy! We all identify with that basic need and Spielberg taps into that to pull our heart strings.The styles of Kubrick and Spielberg are seen in different ways. The lighting and the shooting style is mostly Spielberg, with a few Kubrick homages. Kubrick was known for a cold style and probably would have foregone the many warm tones used here. Much of the art direction and music is reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange (there's even a "Milk Bar" sign visible at one point). But the movie probably owes just as much to Blade Runner, particularly in David's journey through the harsh urban future world. One setting, Rouge City, looks like a sexed-up Las Vegas on crack.It is in these harsh outer realms that David meets up with other mechas, namely a sex robot named Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law. Spielberg plays the "sex machine" concept for laughs, but in a PG-13 way. One can only imagine where Kubrick would have gone with the idea. David also sees the harsh treatment most mechas receive from resentful orgas. In one extended sequence, David is swept-up into a "flesh fair" -- a bizarre spectacle in which robots are destroyed in violent ways for the amusement of humans.The visual effects involving the mangled robots are well done, but we've seen this CGI craftsmanship so often now, audiences will almost take it for granted. The most enjoyable visual effect turns out to be David's robotic "supertoy" sidekick, Teddy. Spielberg manages to make the character utterly adorable without causing you to gag. Think Snuggle the fabric softener bear with the voice of a truck driver.The worst sight is a cartoon character voiced by Robin Williams that feels completely out of place. By the way, also listen for voice cameos by Chris Rock, Ben Kingsley and Amy Irving.A.I.'s only other weakness is its pacing. The movie is only about two hours and 15 minutes, but it feels a lot longer. Many will also find the ending too drawn out. The film could easily end about a half-hour before it does; instead we're treated to a 2001-ish through-the-stargate style denouement. Some will lose patience with this part of the film, but its addition allows the introduction of another BIG SCIENCE FICTION IDEA -- one that I won't reveal here.In the end, A.I. is not everything fans have hoped for all these years, but it's darn close. And it's simply nice to see the film finally unspooling on a theater screen. We haven't had a serious science fiction film this good in quite a while. A.I. is a film that ponders deep ethical questions about technology and the future of the human race and challenges us to examine the true meaning of love. You can't exactly say the same thing about, say, The Fast and the Furious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught a sneak preview of A.I. tonight and I must give it 2 BIG THUMBS DOWN. I've heard it's getting very mixed reviews and I can see why. There's a lot of great stuff in this film, both visually (very Blade Runner-esque) and with the story (not original, but interesting enough). Steven Spielberg, however, manages to ruin it all by the end of this meandering, contrived, REPETITIVE and ultimately boring 2 1/2 hour fiasco. In fact, about 2/3 of the way through the movie, almost everyone in the theater was shifting and fidgeting (myself included), which is a pretty good indication you've lost your audience. Through the first hour, it's an interesting story that really seems like it's going to go somewhere. But it goes way downhill from there and then keeps digging. The entire character base changes, thin sub-plots emerge and loose ends get left all over the place. And probably my biggest complaint: almost every scene is way too long! The pace of the film is unbelievably slow. What this film needs is some major re-editing. If cut right, it could be good. I mean there's certainly potential there--good acting, many great individual scenes and lots of emotional set-up. As is, though, it's a runaway train that takes too freakin' long to finally wreck. ...And once the aliens show up (oh yes, there are aliens!), you know they're grasping for how the heck to end this thing. It might as well have been raining frogs (anyone see Magnolia?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001: A Spielberg Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's now been about 12 hours since I left the screening of A.I. last night, and I'm still not exactly sure what to say about it. I think I feel like I felt the last time I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey. Okay, I'm not sure about this whole monkey thing at the beginning, but that's okay, suddenly we're in space, and we're trying to figure out how to not get killed by HAL, the computer that's gone haywire, great - I'm with ya. Then, the obelisk shows up, with the baby, and the old man in the bed, and I'm just sitting there with my mouth open saying, `huh?'That's the closest approximation I can make to how I feel about A.I. Spielberg takes us into the near future and modernizes the Pinocchio tale by creating a robot boy in the image of the amazing Haley Joel Osment, and giving him to a family that has lost a son. This is the first robot, however, to truly feel and experience love of a human. After an accident occurs, however, he ends up on a journey, with his supertoy Teddy, to find the Blue Fairy, believing he can become a real boy.What this story is really about though is unrequited love. However, it's unrequited love raised to the nth degree. Can you portray any love stronger than the love between a parent and a child? What if the love from that child never, never fades? And I do mean never.That's when the big `huh?' factor came in for me. The movie moves along, it all makes sense, and it comes to a point that seems like a natural conclusion - fade to black and everything. That's when I thought, `wow, that was a pretty special movie. It took tons of risks, was scary, funny, exciting, broke new ground, just incredible.' The problem was that the movie didn't end there. No, it went on for another 30 minutes or so, and while much of it was spectacular to watch, it didn't fit with the rest of the film, didn't make much sense, was predictable, and even corny.I guess I'll put it this way: even when Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods is having an off day, they're still incredible to watch. They're not just doing a job; they're artists, and even if they bogey every hole on the front nine, or if they only shoot 5 for 21, they're going to do something amazing, something you've never seen before. That's why we continue to watch these people, that's why expectations are ridiculously high for them, and that's why you should see the latest film from Steven Spielberg.</fullReview>

The trailers have been vague, the television spots are misleading, and the film itself is far darker and far more "Kubrick" then you ever expected. I refuse to give away any of the secrets, but I do want to applaud Haley Joel Osment for pulling off a textured performance (yet again!), and Jude Law and Frances O'Conner are two of the best actors working today. Stunning visuals, great mix of warm and cold contrasting images. This is unlike any Spielberg movie you've ever seen... and you might like that end result, or loathe it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's see here... I'm not sure where to start! I suppose the first thing that I did after I saw the premiere was scratch my head and ask myself, "did I like this?" It's certainly is not your run-of-the-mill type of movie; it's different and creative, taking you to places most movies don't go. I'm almost certain most people will either love it, or hate it, but few people in-between. (like me) If you liked the George Lucas THX movies, 12 monkeys, original Planet of the Apes, science fiction type of movies, then you're in for a real treat. Though don't venture to this one expecting heart-pounding action at every turn, there's quite a bit of a dramatic edge that can slow the movie down rather quickly.Perhaps this is the paradox. The audience was very mixed, older people who were looking for an interesting and compelling plot, and teens/college people, looking for those fast-pace multi-million dollar computer generated graphic action sequences. When the movie combined both, I think it left a few people upset. Younger folks literally left the theater when it got too slow, and older people thought it was too crazy and unexpected when it picked up. I seriously thought it was several movies in one.If your asking me whether or not it's worth it to pay to see this in a theater, I would have to say yes, it's quite a unique experience even if you dislike it. It's one of those movies that stays in your mind for the rest of the day, leaving you pondering.A WORD OF WARNING: Toward the end of this movie, certain sequences will give you the sensation that the movie is about to end. This happens like 20 times, but keeps on going, and going, and going. In reality the movie is like 2 1/2 hours, which still is shorter than other big budget movies like Titanic and Braveheart. I think I would have SERIOUSLY enjoyed this movie more, if someone would have told me, "wait there's more!" Some people actually left because of the frustration of waiting for it to end. Not that the movie was necessarily bad, in actuality the end gets rather interesting. Its just that it kept going for a while. So kick back, and don't even think about getting up until you've literally seen the credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very long; the whole theater was squirming the last 30 minutes of the movie. It had a Steven King feel, the entire time you are waiting for some kind of twist or something to put it over the edge, but unfortunately it never comes. The camera work was great; some of the shots are very powerful. There are also some really cool special effects. The story was not original, it is a mix of Terminator and Pinocchio and many other movies. The movie really gets very cheesy at the end. If it ended 20 minutes earlier, I would have thought it was a better movie. All of the visually elements of the movie were great: great camera shots, great special effects, great props and sets. The story line and the dialogue is where this film fell short. I never could figure out if the movie was trying to be morbid/ twisted or if it wanted you to "feel" for the little boy.</fullReview>

I found it quite entertaining, but after a point, I was just waiting for the end so I could leave. This was due mostly to the melodramatic element which got to be too heavy-handed, There were some good performances: Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, and Frances O'Connor stand out.

What I didn't get is how a movie about the human soul can throw in everything but the kitchen sink about what it is to be human and yet be devoid of any real humanity. What isn't outright manipulation is just a parade of sci-fi themes done in better movies marching across the screen. Good effects, good performances, some interesting ideas, but not enough to carry 2.5 hours of rehash. And not enough to keep you from forgetting about it later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remarkable thought provoking and perplexing satire! Indeed, this movie is a spectacular tribute to a spectral marriage of cinematic brilliance of two phenomenal filmmaking geniuses! This flick glitters up memorable delights of their famous productions. Flashes, flashes and flashes of hints of their past movies spiral around a fabulous emotional tale of a cybergenic combo creation of `Hal 2000,' E.T's space creature, the Star Child of `2001` and `Pinocchio'. the result? Wonderfully spooky and mesmerizing! Dreams, visions, survival, vulnerabilities, bias, et al. --everything that is maniacally human is revealed. Yet this futuristic fairy tale seems to branch out of the roots of `Pinocchio' and dappled with some `Wizard of Oz' fantasy! I was charmed, empathizing, angry, frightened and disoriented. okay, and I cried! Who wouldn't when wonder rolls into magic, then into nightmare only to surface as a sort of Oedipal chopsuey mesh of Kubrick's `2001' and Spielberg's `Close Encounters.' Fabulously dreamlike special effects and animation! Even the musical tones are sweetly familiar, enhancing the soaring emotions of this film! Osment's David, O'Connor's Monica and Law's 'animated' Gigolo Joe are awesome. they certainly punch up their emotional challenges right into the viewers' hearts. If the subject of artificial intelligence doesn't stimulate questions in your mind, go see this flick. Then ask yourself: Will android technology support the improvement of the human race? What if androids share the same paradoxical human feelings? Alas, a messy thought! Yet, this movie certainly stresses that dreams are inevitably timeless... undeterred by the changing faces of earth! Certainly a great philosophical theory! And convincing. Kubrick's dreams never perished!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had hoped that the fusion of Kubrick's and Spielberg's cinematic personalities would result in a kind of Lennon/McCartney, cynical/romantic synthesis, which would result in a great film. However, A.I.'s state of the art visuals and gorgeous John Williams score don't make up for a screenplay that is too long, too episodic, and at times so bad it comes off like a film student's first draft. I am not a great admirer of Spielberg, but I had high hopes for this project. My disappointment was shared by some in the preview audience who started laughing at the film around the two hour mark. On the other hand, the woman next to me was crying at the end, and some in the audience applauded. You'll be the judge.Update:2007 I'd say the real failure of AI begins as soon as the boy is abandoned by his mother. Up until then the movie is strongly involving. But most of the central part of the movie just doesn't work for me. I think a much shorter movie, with much of the boy's wandering condensed (and the complete elimination of the mekka demolition derby), might work better. That being said, the last 15 minutes of this film may be the greatest creation of Spielberg's career. I have come to admire this portion of AI tremendously. With the hindsight of knowing some of the jarring elements of the film's conclusion, one can be swept up in the achingly emotional reunion of mother and child. And that music! John Williams never wrote anything more beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see an late-night preview of this film here in Tokyo, so here are my thoughts and comments: (don't worry, NO SPOILERS)This is one of those odd films that has you filled with a squiggly warm feeling at one point, and squirming awkwardly at another. Whilst experiencing those two see-sawing emotions, the viewer will be gazing at awe at the technical prowess of the Spielberg team as they bring to life probably one of the most realistic "near-future" environments seen-to-date.Its not all good however. To begin with, there is too much "explanation" of events - I could feel Kubrick turning in his grave at some points where the monologue sounded tuned for the eager 8 year-olds in the audience. Also, the entire "epilogue" should be half the length it is and re-written (sic) to avoid all the unnecessary dialogue. Additionally, the initial third of the movie should probably be longer, and *colder*; I felt some of the scenes were chopped in and it felt a little like the audience was being rushed through in order to get to the juicy bits later. (the original kubrick script had the mother become alcoholic to deal with the stress of bringing up a robot, this might have been a better route and would have portrayed the mother in a colder light which I think would have been cleaner)Its not all bad however. If you sit back and tune out parts of the dialogue you will get treated with quite an intriguing Kubrick-like movie.Interestingly enough, I feel Spielberg *did* manage to distance himself from himself (until the epilogue) - do *not* watch the first third of the movie as if it is E.T. because you *will* feel Kubrick's icy fingers on your neck at certain points and it will shock you.Another note, this isn't really a kids' movie as there are some truly subliminally scary scenes in the story. Its an adult movie in kid's clothing...Finally, the music score is one of the best I've heard in a Spielberg movie since Close Encounters. There are some obvious (and obligatory in my opinion) references to Kubrick's masterpiece of a soundtrack "2001" and just the music alone gives some scenes that "tingling on your back" sensation.For all its niggly points, I'll definitely be going to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A.I." is a wonderful movie. A modern classic, that's for sure. One of the few movies from the 2000 generation that will be classics. I remember that, during the first years after the movie was launched, it was criticized by many. But now more people seem to be giving it the value it deserves. Maybe they are recognizing its potential as a classic."A.I." was a difficult-to-born movie, and it has a long story on that matter. It has roots on the 1969 short story "Super-Toys Last All Summer Long" by Brian Aldiss. Development of "A.I." originally began with Stanley Kubrick in the early 1970s, however the film was in development hell for years, because Kubrick felt that technology was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray.Also, Kubrick felt that Steven Spielberg should direct the movie because it was closer to Spielberg's sensibilities than his own. Spielberg's opinion, however, was that Kubrick should direct the movie, although Spielberg would happily produce it for him. In the end, Kubrick died without making the movie and, at the request of Kubrick's family, Spielberg directed the film. One can only wonder how Kubrick would have felt about the final film, but I believe he would have been proud of it.Haley Joel Osment was Spielberg's first and only choice for the role of David. I think he was the perfect choice. I can see why Spielberg cast him. However, when Kubrick's work on the movie began in 1993, Joseph Mazzello was cast as David. At the time, Mazzello was the perfect choice because he was a brilliant child actor and I'm sure he would have been a phenomenal David as well.Though I love the final movie as it is, I wonder what it would have been like if Kubrick had directed it and with Joseph Mazzello in the lead role.Haley Joel Osment is simply superb as David. To make his portrayal even better, he doesn't blink once in the movie, so that his portrayal of a robot-child was more realistic.Jude Law is also phenomenal as Gigolo Joe and his make-up makes him really look like a robot. Gigolo Joe is my favorite character of the movie, he is just so cool. I feel sorry for him at the end.I also like William Hurt very much as Professor Hobby and I think this is his best role and performance ever.Jack Angel does very well the voice of Teddy Bear. Ben Kingsley is great as the narrator. Robin Williams is terrific as the voice of Dr. Know and Meryl Streep surprises with an incredibly soft voice for the Blue Fairy."A.I." is a futuristic and original movie, although it clearly has some inspiration in movies such as "2001: A Space Odyssey", "Blade Runner", "E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial", "D.A.R.Y.L.", "Bicentennial Man" and "The Wizard of Oz", but also in the tale of Pinocchio (both the original book by Carlo Collodi and the Disney classic)."A.I." is a drama and a touching story, but it also has moments of comedy, mostly thanks to the character Gigolo Joe. Plus, the movie is visually stunning, not only because of the sceneries but also because of the ground-breaking special and visual effects.Title in Portugal: "A.I.: Intelig?ncia Artificial".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Artificial Intelligence, directed by Steven Spielberg, revolves around a highly advanced robot who longs to become a 'real' human boy to gain the love of his human mother. It is based on the short story, "Supertoys Last All Summer Long" written by Brian Aldiss and also reflects on the story of 'Pinoccio'. Set in the future when the polar ice caps have melted and various cities submerged, the human race begins to make realistic and highly advanced robots, called 'mechas' to serve them. One such mecha, called David, played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment is created to serve as a substitute for the paralyzed human child of a bereaved mother who is then programmed to love her. However, as the human child, Mike recovers, David gets abandoned by his parents in a forest, left only with the company of a robotic teddy. As described aptly in the movie, "his love was real, but he was not" , David gets convinced that the only way to gain acceptance from his mother was to search for the Blue Fairy from the fairy tale 'Pinoccio' who he believed could make him 'real'. Hence, he embarks upon a journey to look for her, fighting against the hostile humans around him. This scientific-fiction with its intriguing plot, brilliant actors and intricate visual effects, keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats right up to the end. Moreover, it poses a philosophical question to the audience about their standards and ethics. The mecha, though an artificial construct, possessed all the feelings demonstrated by a human and was yet, abandoned by his human parents. This makes the viewers contemplate on what responsibility they hold towards the objects they create and if they have the right to destroy it. Moreover, this movie depicts the thin line that exists between humans and the mechanical robots. If the feelings can be equally manifested by a robot as can be done by a human, then does the difference lie only in their composition? If yes, then is that difference enough for us to be justified in assuming the role of their destroyers? With such questions, this movie compels the viewers to re-evaluate their notion of right and wrong which very few movies in this genre have been able to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy meets Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Artificial Intelligence is a success story of a heart warming and emotional tale about a mechanical subject who has no soul, yet is programmed to love and connect with human beings by his manufacturers.David is a part of project of pretend-children created by Cybertronics in New Jersey. Because the Swanton's son, Martin, has been ill for a long time, the bosses of Cybertronics come to a decision to grant them the opportunity to be the very first parents of a child Mecha. Society detest the Mechas and are trying so hard to eradicate them but David's uniqueness makes him special, or one of a kind.Monica rolls the dices when he activates David to start experimenting with affection. The procedure is irreversible and only destruction is the only way out. When David realizes 'consciousness' he asks Monica about death because he knows he will outlive all his loved ones. Monica then introduces to Supertoy that belongs to Martin, named Teddy.Teddy had been shut down ever since Martin went to hospital. Monica explains that Teddy is a toy and this pisses him off. Even machines before David have some emotional intelligence. Even though it is limited since Teddy does not believe that 50 years is a long time.It is when the Swanton's son returns home, rivalries start. Firstly, he asks David to break his own toy wanting to test his mechanical powers. Secondly, he plays with both Teddy and David's 'minds' when he asks the Supertoy to elect his leader. Teddy surprised everyone and asks for their mother to bail him out. This must be the Self- Motivated Reasoning Professor Allen Hobby spoke about. Thirdly, he suggests to Monica to read them a children's book about Pinocchio. David becomes inspired by the story of Pinocchio becoming a real life boy. He also learns that a mythical heroine named The Blue Fairy transformed the wooden marionette into human.Fueled by jealousy, Martin asks his brother to get a locket of Monica's hair illegitimately. David is cast out of the Swanton Family because of a misunderstanding involving him hurting Martin. He goes on to meet Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute Mecha escaping a murder scene to the Flash Fair.David's uniqueness and likeness results in him surviving being 'slaughtered' and together with Teddy and Gigolo Joe they set out to look for The Blue Fairy because David believes that she will turn him into a real boy so he can return to his mother who will accept him unconditionally.David discovers his origins at Cybertronics and runs into a copy of himself. We learn through Professor Allen Hobby that David's image was influenced by Hobby's own son who has deceased. When Hobby goes to gather David's 'mothers' and 'fathers' David tours the headquarters and stumbles across hundreds of his own look alikes who are still undergoing mass productionSo this means he is not one of a kind. He is only a first of a kind. Grief stricken, David commits 'suicide' by diving into the risen sea. Although he knows being immersed into a large body of water won't 'kill' him. Through it all, the 11-year-old David succeeds and finds The Blue Fairy on the theme park that has been submerged by the sea.David exercises his faith and starts praying to The Blue Fairy to make him a real boy for the longest period.Act IV starts when an excavation crew of Advanced Mechas find David and Teddy frozen inside their Amphibilcopter, shut down 2 millenniums later. The Blue Fairy is not real and is just made out of plastic when she breaks down to pieces as David makes contact with her. This must be the worst heartbreaking scene of the movie.The Advanced Mechas learn about David and recreate his former him because he is confused.'This looks like my house but it is different.' - DavidHow carefully planned and original did the story come about because the new Mechas couldn't give him the exact copy of his old house. Even with their much advanced technology. It must make sense that they also have limitations.The Mechas also recreate The Blue Fairy for the young boy and speak through her. We know this because The Blue Fairy isn't real and David is just too young to understand. They then resurrect Monica out of a hair strand Teddy kept in his pouch. They also warn him not to say anything it will result in everything being ruined. By the end of the day David gets his ultimate wish - for Monica to finally love and accept him.The narration by Ben Kingsley stood out the most because his voice talent was soft, encouraging, pleasant and tender. It was a good idea for us to never see things the way David sees them since he has mechanical components. It would ruined the sense of him being a person. David did love his human brother , Martin. As seen on his birthday he got him a present.Teddy was more of a brother than Martin could ever be. He always looked out for him and stuck by him. Maybe because they were the same kind. At dinner he advised him against consuming vegetables fearing that he would break. But he never advised against the gathering of Monica's hair because it was her biological son's request for him to get the locket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think Kubrick would have been appalled.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To criticize this story for is unbelievability is rather hopeless (may favorite nonsense was the rain that was falling while the action was supposedly underwater). So, I think you have to take this mainly as a fanciful entertainment. But that is sad, since there was an opportunity for this story to have had some substance.The movie starts out posing some interesting questions about human/machine interactions. Humans have a heightened ability to bond with inanimate objects and fictional characters. Indeed, I think it is that ability that we are being called on to exercise when watching this movie. But for me this works only when I can identify with a character. This movie very much wants us to identify with the cute robot boy, but that I could not do. I get irritated enough when my GPS man or my computer talks to me, so I doubt that I would respond a whole lot differently to a robot. But the movie does make a good case for how the so-called parents become attached to their robotic boy who was programmed to give and receive love. That *would* make things more difficult. But when the kid starts to behave in unexpected and unwelcome ways and the mother makes an agonizing decision to part with him, that is where the movie went astray for me. From there it was mostly an orgy of CGI effects. Not to say that these were not entertaining, but most all intellectual content was lost, even though there were some interesting observations on an ultimate conflict between humans and the machines they had created. The topic of how humans would react to sophisticated robots is deserving of treatment more substantial that what is presented here.It would be interesting to see what Kubrick would have done with this, since his visual style was more refined and less in-your-face than Spielberg's, whose primary goal seems to be to impress. Kubrick had a more significant way of tapping into my deeper emotions than Spielberg's forced sentimentality. And the John Williams score that tries to tell us how to feel at all times is an embarrassment.This is entertaining enough, but misses an opportunity to explore the subject at any depth. The main effect this movie had on me was to make me realize how much I miss looking forward to a new Kubrick movie..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange Spielberg experiment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 11/25/2008 -(Dir-Steven Spielberg): Strange Spielberg experiment of what would happen if a robot child was programmed to love. The movie strays way too much from this main theme to make it a watchable film despite it's promising premise. The movie does have it's good moments but many other un-necessary bad moments outweigh the good. The basic storyline is about a future where robots are made in bunches and encouraged to be done because of global warming and less space to occupy humans. There has never been a robot made that could love until David, played by Haley Joel Osment, is introduced and is manufactured to forever love the parents who adopt him. The new couple that is chosen is perfect because they lost their son(supposedly) and would probably love the child back. Unfortunately their real son makes a recovery and in comes jealousy from the robot child and competition for the parents' love. The mother has bonded with the child and knows she needs to return it to the factory but instead abandons it on the way to the factory in a wooded area. At this point, the movie falls apart as far as credibility is concerned. A stupid decision by the mother brings about what we know is going to be confusion and disaster for the child. David hooks up with a lover robot, played by Jude Law, to be his friend but this character is weak and cartoon like and doesn't help the story at all. David remembers the Pinocchio story read to him by his mother and begins a quest for the blue fairy so that he can become a real boy and truly be loved by his mother. This quest is ridiculous, comical and switches into fantasy way too often giving us a mixed-up story. What could have been a good diversion into what would happen if a robot loved becomes a silly fantasy which tries to redeem itself in the end but faulters. This could have been a much better movie if Spielberg would have tugged the heart a little more and not wandered into fantasy land.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can Make It If You Cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his stunning 1990s success, Steven Spielberg satisfied those salivating to despise him, with "A.I. Artificial Intelligence". The poised knives could be released, at last! So, the initial reactions took an undeserved negative tone, while, still, offering praise to individual efforts too obviously evidenced in the production to ignore.This is really an excellent, thought-provoking film.The beginning of the film could have been improved by combining the character "Professor Hobby" into "Henry Swinton". The resulting "Henry Swinton" would, then, more closely resemble "Geppetto" from "Pinocchio". This would, necessarily, make "David" the image of their dead son. Then, the parents' conflict would be the focus of the film's first act. This would have made the relationship between the parents much more dynamic; and, it would throw the mother "Monica" (Frances O'Connor) into incalculable conflict with the robotic "David", resolved in the film's already powerful ending.Mr. Spielberg marvelously breathes life into Stanley Kubrick's unrealized project (he died before realizing this dream work); and, he directs Haley Joel Osment (as David) to a peak performance level. Mr. Osment, Jude Law (as Gigolo Joe), and "Teddy" (voiced by Jack Angel) are an unforgettable "mecha" (short for "mechanical") trio of humane robots. Janusz Kaminski and the Spielberg crew are magical.Good night, David. Pleasant dreams.********* A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) Steven Spielberg ~ Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, William Hurt</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic visual experience but with no real audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this movie is definitely worth watching because it is very unique. The special effects are very well done and it is entertaining to see futuristic versions of well known cities (you will se Manhattan under water due to global warming). What also makes it unique is obviously that it is a Kubrick script. It contains the concept of emotional robots (like HAL in Space Odyssey, but this movie takes it to the step of a physical boy), and his search for identity. However hard it is to appreciate child actors, Haley Joel Osment has a lot of talent and is almost not annoying at all. Jude Law will show up as a prostituted robot and has a interesting and entertaining character, which he pulls of very well. However, I see some problems with this film. 1. It tries to reach too many audiences at once, which makes it end up with no real audience. At times, it is very childish and you wonder if it is a Pixar movie you are watching. But at other times, it has the bleak atmosphere of for example Blade Runner. The concept of the movie is serious but it has a lot of Disneyish features (this is also enhanced by the overdose of color in the picture). It is obvious that Kubrick would have made this movie a lot less lollipop-ish (Hollywood). 2. It baked in too much in the plot. You are already in the future, but in the ending you go 2000 years further and the robots are hyperintelligent and they apparently admire humans. You get no background why. And Osment can bring his mom back, but ONLY for one day. This just seemed like a last-minute solution to give the audience that are used to clich movies a little reward, but to audiences that don't like clich movies it was just unessecary. It should have ended when Osment was underwater.A.I. is despite these reasons a fantastic visual experience for sci-fi lovers, and an interesting suggestion to the scenario humans vs. robots. See it and get an opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good film that has lost its way on the path to greatness! A great idea, some very good acting, excellent special f/x, masterfully directed, but... the film ends up incomplete. Too many questions are asked, very few are are even explored and almost none are answered. In the end, I was left empty, wondering about how many excellent films could have been made out of just some of the pieces of this one when carefully analyzed and developed.I think the best summary of this motion picture was given by Ebert when he states that "What holds it back from greatness is a failure to really engage the ideas that it introduces". What a pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is not about Artificial Intelligence at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am disappointed. This movie is not about Artificial Intelligence at all. I wonder what Mr Spielber's science coach was doing. If there were such a coach, which I doubt. Unfortunately there are issues where everybody seems to believe they know enough to try an discuss them. Or even to make a movie about them. And this may unfortunately be the case with this movie. I for one think this is not what Mr Spielberg use to do. Usually he gets pretty documented about the issues before he dares to commit himself to a major task like making a movie is. But this time he maybe thought it wasn't necessary to even read about it. 'Who doesn't know about Artificial Intelligence?' I am sure he told to himself. And he fumbled on this one. This is a story about making robots who can love. I can hardly think on a subject more afar from what Artificial Intelligence is about than this one. Maybe you will be surprised to learn that making a robot not necessarily implies the use of Artificial Intelligence at all. For example a robotic arm who takes an auto part and solders it on place hardly needs anything more than lubricant to perform its task. There is no intelligence involved in performing any repetitive task, no matter how precise it might be. The industry nowadays uses a lot of robotics elements than can perform their task without a hint of intelligence. There are task however, where some sort of intelligence is required. But we will get to that later. There have always been some confusion about what intelligence is. I am not sure scientifics have reached a definition which encompasses all the requirements. But of one thing I am sure: feelings are not part of any of these definitions. You can be a perfectly intelligent being without have any feelings. On the contrary, feelings get in the way of any intelligent response. Or in others words "feelings modulate intelligent responses". Up to the point of blocking any intelligent response. For example if you are in the path of a car that is speeding toward you, the intelligent response would be to get out of the way. But if you get scared (a feeling) you may get frozen, thus fear would block your intelligent response and may get you killed. So as you can see feelings are somewhat opposed to intelligent responses in the sense that feeling can make that the response would be not as intelligent as they should be. And that is true for every feeling you may think of: love, hate, fear, you name it. How many times you have seen a guy making a fool of himself because he's in love? The examples are endless. So if you have read up to this point you may be getting the picture and may be starting to understand the big fiasco this movie is. This movie is about making a robot that behaves like a human. That's not Artificial Intelligence. That's an Artificial Human Being manufacturing. I wonder what good one may find on making artificial human beings when it is too easy --and enjoyable-- to make them the usual way. But that's just another story. So what's Artificial Intelligence and when it is needed? Artificial Intelligence deals with a hosts of search methods, computer methods, who allows computers to exhibit intelligent responses to an usually changing environment. Also to act as "experts" on fields such as --but not limited to-- medicine and complex equipment repairment. Optical Character recognition, game playing, natural language understanding are the main areas where Artificial Intelligence is applied. When a robot is working in an environment when Artificial Intelligence is needed --such as in shape recognition -- then a computer is attached to the robot in order to make the needed calculations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally-charged view of humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I picked up on, besides the obvious Pinocchio parallel, was the fragility of human love and life. I actually was drawn to consider my own mortality and what kind of life I've led to this point as well as what I will leave behind for my child. For me, it was an excellent movie to reflect upon. My wife cried (a rare thing for her) quite a bit while watching the movie. I was close to tears a few times, myself.Why not give it a "10"? Only because there were several leaps that the director assumed the audience would follow. I wanted some more answers and to fill in a few blanks (left to my own imagination). Being a Steven Spielberg fan, I was surprised on how he handled this movie...it did seem to have more of a Stanley Kubrick feel, than Spielberg. It was a well-crafted story and well-shot movie.</fullReview>

Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Sam Robards and William Hurt give their best effort in their respective roles; however, nobody could save the movie from the disastrous script the cast was given by the writers.There was a lot of hype surrounding "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" because it was a Kubrick film. "A.I.

It took me 20 minutes to tell myself this was a disappointment because all of the excitement and joy drained the life out of the movie leaving Spielberg to rely on the special effects to save the rest of "A.I. Artificial Intelligence." Osment follows his breakthrough role in "The Sixth Sense" as David, an eleven-year old android who takes an emotional journey to see if the love he gives his family is returned. Under the direction of Professor Hobby, played by Hurt, David is part of an experiment to create android children for families to love. Robards and O'Connor play parents who take David. Osment will become a huge superstar in Hollywood, but with his role as David, he won't accomplish this achievement.Hurt, Robards and O'Connor were among the only bright spots in "A.I. Artificial Intelligence." Their roles were the light I was looking for in the dark world of this movie. These three actors were responsible for bringing integrity, honesty and genuine emotion.It is refreshing to see actors bring characteristics like this to a role because it truly shows the range of talent they possess; however, "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" was the wrong decision for them to make as well intentioned the movie planned to be.The biggest problem I had with "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" was the urgency to care about David or any of the other characters in the film. For example, Gigolo Joe, played by Law, had no reason to be placed in a film like this because he didn't fit in with the storyline.Furthermore, there was no pizazz or flash that stood out and made a statement that this is the film to see. One thing I have noticed with awful films was the endings were always better than the previous 120 minutes."A.I. Artificial Intelligence" never seemed to get on track with one major theme. For example, it jumped from storyline to storyline without clear and complete explanation. I reached my tolerance limit early on in the movie, so when the movie was over; I was relieved and couldn't wait to get home.Despite my hatred for "A.I. Artificial Intelligence," I must give Spielberg credit for bringing some enjoyment to the film. For example, Hurt's role as Professor Hobby stood out because he was the only actor that seemed to be genuine to the role, roles as mother and father put Robards and O'Connor on my favorites list, promising premise surrounding the film as well as the start and finish of the film were the only aspects of the movie that stood out from the rest of the movie."A.I. Artificial Intelligence" contains heart and spirit and I can understand how people may enjoy this movie; however, Spielberg failed to capitalize on the golden opportunity handed to him by Kubrick."A.I. Artificial Intelligence" is a shallow and empty movie. With their heart and spirit misplaced, my only advice regarding is to watch "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a magnificent achievement when you consider that there was input from both Spielberg and Kubrick. I was sure the movie would have to be very disjointed, but to Spielbergs credit it is a very cohesive picture.This film is a cinematic fairy tale, with a great story and interesting characters. The emotional impact of the movie will probably take you by surprise, and this may have been the reason that Kubrick entrusted Spielberg with the directing duties. However, Steven Spielberg doesn't resort to cheap sentimentality to involve you emotionally.I would expect Stanley Kubrick to be very proud of the A.I. Spielberg has produced, because when the movie ends you are left with a feeling familiar to many of Kubrick's work, an uneasy and haunting feeling.By the way, don't be alarmed by that salty discharge flowing from your eyes, it's perfectly normal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, Steven Spielberg is trying to make movies that are a little more dark and a little more unnerving, but he still has this infatuation with happy endings. I honestly thought A.I., was going to end twice, before it actually did. The first time was after the suicide attempt &amp; the second time, when David is trapped beneath the water staring longingly at the Blue Fairy. Any of these two points in the movie would have been appropriate for a finish, but NOOOOOO, we have to go on and on, and tie up all the loose ends in a mechanized future where all your wishes come true. BORING!!!It was the same deal with Minority Report. This movie rivals Blade Runner in its dark complexity, until the last 5 minutes, when we have to put the world right again. The movie should have ended with the final confrontation between Cruise &amp; Von Sydow, and not dragged on with how everybody has their problems solved.A.I. had a lot of potential. It had Kubrick written all over it, but it was ruined by an ending that was too long and too happy. Remember only Steven Spielberg could make a movie about the Holocaust, that has a happy ending.</fullReview>

The sharp intellect and non-clich of Kubrick is in complete contrast to Spielberg's soppy, sentimental clich extravaganzas. The ending does away with all the cerebral handling of the theme of artificial intelligence and cooks a stew of Close Encounters cuddly aliens, fairies and resurrection superstition. Oh dear, what a mess! If you want brain exercise and uniqueness please see anything done by Kubrick and don't be mislead by the homage connection here. It is a complete waste of Kubrick's 15+ years of analysis, it deserves to be remade by a peer of Kubrick.</fullReview>

Osment will become a huge superstar in Hollywood, but with his role as David, he won't accomplish this achievement.Hurt, Robards and O'Connor were among the only bright spots in "A.I. Artificial Intelligence." Their roles were the light I was looking for in the dark world of this movie. These three actors were responsible for bringing integrity, honesty and genuine emotion. It is refreshing to see actors bring characteristics like this to a role because it truly shows the range of talent they possess; however, "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" was the wrong decision for them to make as well intentioned the movie planned to be.The biggest problem I had with "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" was the urgency to care about David or any of the other characters in the film. For example, Gigolo Joe, played by Law, had no reason to be placed in a film like this because he didn't fit in with the storyline.Furthermore, there was no pizzazz or flash that stood out and made a statement that this is the film to see. One thing I have noticed with awful films was the endings were always better than the previous 120 minutes. "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" never seemed to get on track with one major theme. For example, it jumped from storyline to storyline without clear and complete explanation. I reached my tolerance limit early on in the movie, so when the movie was over; I was relieved and couldn't wait to get home.Despite my hatred for "A.I. Artificial Intelligence," I must give Spielberg credit for bringing some enjoyment to the film. For example, Hurt's role as Professor Hobby stood out because he was the only actor that seemed to be genuine to the role, roles as mother and father put Robards and O'Connor on my favorites list, promising premise surrounding the film as well as the start and finish of the film were the only aspects of the movie that stood out from the rest of the movie."A.I. Artificial Intelligence" contains heart and spirit and I can understand how people may enjoy this movie; however, Spielberg failed to capitalize on the golden opportunity handed to him by Kubrick."A.I. Artificial Intelligence" is a shallow and empty movie, which was made several years ago with Robin Williams. With their heart and spirit misplaced, my only advice regarding is to watch "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrik_speilberg venture is artifical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I Kubrik-Speilberg venture is Artificial. Cast: Haley Joel Osmont, Jude Law, Francis O'Conner, John Hurt. Rated: M Critics Warning: Some provoking and disturbing scenes. Critic's Rating: 6 1/2 out of 10 Why do Speilberg's films always feel the need to pose an important moral question? Why do they then address this with such a convoluted plot and soppy sentimentality that it makes me cringe? Why did Kubrik's estate let this chronically flawed movie off its feet? The questions asked by this movie certainly touch a raw ethical nerve. Can humans play `god'? Can A.I supercede humans as the ultimate practical, socially adaptable and emotionally sensitive being? But unlike its spiritual predecessor, Blade Runner, it does not have the flair or subtlety to rise above the choppy waters of the subject matter.The story revolves around David, a sort of space age Pinocchio in a world where global warming has drowned most coastal cities, where both resources and the natality rate are limited. A world of `mechas' and `orgas', nature and simulated nature struggling for survival. David is a prototype, created by the visionary professor Hobby to tap into a previously unexplored market a market for robots who can love. The first recipients of this new product are Monica and Henry, whose son is cryogenically suspended in comatose, beyond cure. Monica is at first repulsed by David but his sheer blissful innocence wins her over and she imprints her love on him. Then Martin is revived from his frozen state and the two vie for their mother's love. After Martin sickeningly exploits David to make him seem insane, Monica abandons David and his quest to become real and regain his mothers love, begins. It is a quest that will see him go to Flesh Fair (a place where robots are destroyed for entertainment and to show human supremacy.) to meeting Gigolo Joe, a pleasure `mecha'. From Dr No, the man who knows all (with over 1000 outlets statewide) to the end of their world, a half-submerged Manhattan.The cast performs with exemplary effectiveness, especially Jude Law as a charismatic, some how gentlemanly android sleaze. There are some great scenes in the movie, but they are always marred by some Speilbergian element that seems to be at ambivalence with the scene. For example the ending is very unpredictable, but a sappy voice-over makes it sound remarkably contrived. The feeling of contrast between both Kubrik and Speilberg's techniques is most grating here. The music is also cloying, saturating the scene in its thick, syrupy folds. The cinematography is also quite soft and yielding at times. The art direction is lavish, ostentatious and sometimes awe-inspiring. But these formidable elements never seem to add to the sum of its parts. And also, although the movie tries to address the emotions that shape the mould of man the movie is slightly hollow, lacking in real feeling. Like so many of Speilberg's films and David, this movie is devoid of real soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fascinating Misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is Steven Spielberg's most problematical film. Originally the brainchild of the late Stanley Kubrick , Spielberg took over writing and directing responsibilities after Kubrick's untimely passing in the spring of 1999. Years before Kubrick had read Brian Aldiss' Sci-fi short story SUPERTOYS LAST ALL SUMMER LONG , a futuristic tale of a grieving couple who 'adopt' a robotic boy in order to assuage the pain of losing their natural born son who lies in a coma and is confined to a cryogenic capsule until a cure can be found for his terminal condition. Set in the not-too-distant-future, in a world overrun by massive flooding due to global warming , strict family planning is enforced to modify the world population. Robots , or Mechas , become an increasingly large part of the population , serving in various capacities as domestic servants. When a brilliant scientist creates a new prototype, a robot that possesses tactile feelings and human emotions, trouble ensues. Film critics seemed to be split down the middle in assessing A.I. : they either loved it or hated it. The movie-going public had a more immediate response. The movie was one of Spielberg's rare financial failures. A.I. has the unmistakable look of a Kubrick film with its often symmetrically composed images, a hypnotic slightly futuristic music score reminiscent of 2001 and a cold, somewhat sterile set design that evokes his famous space epic and A Clockwork Orange. The film's visual effects are astonishing, particularly in a climactic sequence when Haley Joel Osment's robotic boy (an eerily effective performance) searches the ocean floor of a sunken metropolis in search of an unusual mother surrogate. A.I. falters badly when it tries to incorporate the famous Pinocchio fairy tale into its story : it's a clumsy device that simply doesn't work, although it does afford some oddly fascinating special effects.Although A.I. is a failure, it is not an ignoble one. There are images in this movie that are hard to shake, and despite its clumsy storytelling devices, the movie manages to convey a sad, eerie power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Herein:I seem to be one of the few people who think of this film positively. I found it visually stunning, as well as fascinating. No, it is not full of action. In many ways it is reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey, one of them being the lack of action. But still, the film is intriguing.Haley Joel Osment plays David, the first child robot produced. Humans have apparently been producing robots for years, but only now have they moved to make these children. The plot centers around his plight to find the Blue Fairy (from Pinocchio) who can turn him into a boy whom his "mother", Monica, will finally love.The fairy is not the only thing that is blue. The entire film is lit in different shades of blue. The cinematography is fantastic, and the computer generated images are as well.As for the acting, I don't know of anyone who questions the talent of Haley Joel Osment. His portrayal of the innocent, naive David is amazing. The other notable performance is from Jude Law, who acts as David's protector for some time.Granted, the film has its flaws. I didn't mind the length, but the end seemed to go off onto a tangent. In fact, much of the film did. People would come in and no clear resolution would ever happen. The characters of Gigolo Joe, the Professor, Henry, and even Monica were not explored as well as they should have been. Even people who dislike the film praise the score, but to be honest, I think I only even noticed it once.I find the major flaw to be the ending. For a young, naive "boy", David never even does a double take when he encounters the new creature. He seems a bit too understanding and adult at this point. One might say he has grown, like a human, but the creature comments on his naivete. The ending reminded me much of the final act of "Our Town." There is the chance of resurrection-but only for one day. The only part I liked about the final half hour was the idea of how everything went full circle. The humans tried to create the robots, the creatures tried to resurrect the humans.Overall, 8/10 for a thought-provoking, intriguing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed - but touching and suprising at the same time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many have noted that the last third of this film 'drags' and should have been 'lost'. Well - I'd like to suggest that it's actually the middle third that should have been omitted. The last 45 minutes is where the film really takes off for me - and contains some extremely surprising and touching moments that you won;t see coming and which elevate the whole to something rather good.It all changes when the boy finds the blue fairy. One minute we're dabbling around in the shallows, the next we find we are actually swimming over a deep ocean trench, and it's an uncomfortable and thought provoking change. When set against the almost claustrophobic 'one location' setting of much of the film, the span of time is an amazing contrast. The 'lake woebegone' narration is beautifully done as it smoothly moves us with a few sentences forward two millenia. I don't imagine that this was hard to bring off - but it's managed here very convincingly.The middle third - the 'Jude Law' third I guess you could call it... could be considered to provide 'action' contrast to the opening and closing sections. But to me it jars. It has a different look and feel, again intentional, but it's the lack of development of the ideas of the opening that really hurts....ideas that are reprised at the end.No - lose the 'flesh fair', and you have yourself a tremendous movie.ps. Joel Osment's performance was quite outstanding - totally believable, slightly chilling at times - never sentimental - tremendous 'physically' and oscar worthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Sci Fi since Blade Runner?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)I understand that Steven Spielberg took over this project started by the late Stanley Kubrick, which would explain the uneasy edge to the usual Spielbergian treatment. The remnants of Kubrick's message, namely that humans are soon-to-be obsolete beasts, contend with the usual Spielberg formula of corn syrup, tears, and awe, so that the result is unsettling and more than a bit curiouser and curiouser.First of all, be aware that, despite the fact that there is a full serving of the Spielberg recipe here (cute kids, dazzling special effects, a beautiful score by John Williams, social consciousness seen largely from a kid's POV, etc.), this is not a "feel good" movie that will appeal to the mass audience at which Spielberg usually aims. The heartland of America will find this film disturbing and will tell their neighbors to stay away. Sci fi afficionados of the hard science variety (like myself) will have mixed feelings since some of the science is, shall we say, unlikely. The fantasy/sorcery crowd will probably be disenchanted for other reasons, although there is a glorious ending that might mist up one's eyes (it did mine). Overall, however, this is an unsettling look at humanity and where we're headin' ("Is that Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?"), and the treatment is definitely NOT something for the kiddies. It's liable to give them nightmares.The central hook of the film is that we are made to identify with the robotic mechas, especially Haley Joel Osment's David and Jack Angel's Teddy and Jude Law's Gigolo Joe, while being reminded that they are not human, or more properly, that they are more admirable than human. In a way the robots resemble the have-nots of the current society, the handicapped and the poor, while the humans in the persons of Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor), her son Martin (Jake Thomas) and the Flesh Fair entrepreneur (Brendan Gleeson) represent respectively the privileged, the cruel, and the exploitive. Monica's compromised morality is made clear in the scene in the woods (which I won't describe for fear of giving away too much). One also gets the sense that she and her husband (who portray the usual kid-show parental mentality) are not actually bright enough to figure out what has happened when siblings and friends have conflicts. Monica simply sides with her biological child and throws David to the wolves, as it were.On another level this is a movie about a child's undying love for his mother, a love that lasts for two thousand years and a day and is never compromised. It is about believing in fairy tales and the miraculous, a modern day Pinocchio in Wonderland as might be dreamed up by admirers of Blade Runner (1982). In the Spielberg canon, echoes from his cinematic predecessors mesh with echoes from his own movies in a sometimes all too obvious way. Note the return of the moon (in sinister splendor) from E.T. with Teddy (who could have been retrieved from the set of Blade Runner--as could Prof. Hobby, AKA Geppetto) trudging across the top of a rise in front of it.The sets and the animations are sumptuous and beautiful. The robots and the aliens are ingeniously crafted. I very much liked the vision of a drowned Manhattan with the upper stories of the skyscrapers rising above the level of the sea (presumably from global warming), giving us a very quiet and almost contemplative Manhattan, and then the skyscrapers immersed in ice as the earth falls into a prolonged ice age. The sense of the rapid passage of awesome time reminded me a bit of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), while Dr. Know (voice of Robin Williams) recalled The Wizard of Oz (1939), and the Blue Fairy (voice of Meryl Streep) something from Disney.This is a substantially compromised masterpiece, as it certainly had to be coming from the ghost of Kubrick as fashioned by Hollywood's most powerful and most commercially successful director, but an engaging, ambitious spiral into the future, one well worth watching one, one that will linger in the mind awhile.See this to encourage Spielberg to emphasize creativity over formula, to encourage him to make more movies that dare to offend the mass mind while intriguing the rest of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pessimistic future view only a plot device - futuristic pinocchio story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect with this movie, as I never like to read the blurb. Initially I thought it was going to turn out to be a horror movie! - (at which point I checked the blurb to steel myself - it turns out the "boy" goes on an adventure!) But it turns into what can only be called a tearjerker of a movie, a futuristic pinocchio story, or maybe velveteen rabbit.Unlike most disney movies, I had my disbelief suspended to the point where I didn't feel I was getting played.Teddy the bear is absolutely priceless! I was splitting my sides laughing at almost everything he said. Maybe they were influenced by the Sixth Day? (Also an excellent movie).Before I get to the spoilers, I will say one final thing, and that is on Jude Law's performance as "Joe Gigolo". In general, a fantastic job. When I first saw him, I thought, wow, that looks like me before I head out on the town on my weekly quest to pick up women. Only difference would be that I have a leather jacket and not a leather trench coat. And not a pronounced widows peak.The only things that I could really nitpick is that he moves too fast in the motel room. Most women would be put on the defensive by this. And maybe he might be more funny, but I guess since he is a robot he can fake emotion convincingly.Lastly why would a twenty-something woman of much better than average looks pay for sex? I would think that the main market of a gigolo would be the old, fat, crusty types - similar to the market for hookers.Perhaps in these things speilberg is catering to what people want to see on cinema. Fair enough.*** includes spoilers ***I think that Speilberg/Kubrick realized that in all likelihood, we will have more than enough food to feed our future populace - all developed countries have very stable or declining populations, the area of unstable areas is declining. Meanwhile, our foodgrowing capability is increasing at incredible rates due to improvements in machinery, crops and animals. It's hard to believe that food would be rationed and marriage would need to be licensed, and that it would somehow be more economical to produce a robot than to produce enough food to feed a human.Imagine the more likely scenario - that human beings will continue to develop economically, with the so-called gap between rich and poor increasing while the poor also get richer. Where being poor means having to eat at McDonalds instead of Wendy's, and only owning one car and one computer. That people will eventually manage to create perfectly humanlike artificial intelligence, then hyper-intelligence and probably spread to other planets.How do you tell the pinocchio tale in futuristic scenery, and delve into the ethical issues? Why would there have been a big enough demand to focus on the childless couple market? Why the difficulty to get an android to love? How to have David explore the pinocchio of Coney Island?Of course, the story is not "artificial intelligence", it is a tragic fairy tale, no different to the Velveteen Rabbit. As a good storyteller should, they chose to make the future world fit the story, not their worldview. It's a fact that a few people here seem to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit too Oedipal for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. is a physically beautiful film, but whilst watching I was taken aback by the notion that men are bad and women are good, and fathers are the bottom of the barrel.Firstly, almost all emotion springs from the mother while the father treats everything more mechanically than the android boy. David is presented as a gift to Monica from Henry, and Henry spends the rest of his part in the film at a distance.There is also something uniquely disturbing when Monica bonds with David while Henry is away. It's as if to say the role of the father is immaterial. There's also a telling moment when David calls Monica 'mommy' but addresses Henry by his name. [possible spoiler] David is further alienated when Martin returns to the fold and lies his way into getting David thrown out. Father and son collude against mother to spoil her love. Nobody asks why anything is happening, no one demands explanations, and Martin is never blamed for his rather obvious lies and set-ups.The remainder of the film is David's quest for his mommy (what 11-yo uses that word?), through a cloying miasma of vicious, lascivious, and/or misguided men. No evil women, just men.It's good eye-candy, but too Oedipal for my tastes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The problem is obvious here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: *** out of ****. Stanley Kubrick was one of the best directors that ever lived. Steven Spielberg is one of the best directors of today. A.I. is a film that Kubrick wanted to do for a long time but died before able to do it. He was going to be working on the film with Steven Spielberg and when Kubrick died, Spielberg took over. However, though Spielberg does many things right in this film, it still has a split personality. This was a project that interested them both. The problem is that Spielberg makes light entertainment Sci-Fi films like E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. His films, particularly E.T. have a cute side to them. Not so with Kubrick, whose Sci-Fi film was 2001(Im not sure if Clockwork is a Sci-Fi film), which was much more deep than E.T. and Close Encounters combined. Spielberg's films are enjoyable to the public (well atleast most of them), but Kubrick's films were not always that way. Even his biggest success, The Shining, was not enjoyed by everybody. The first two hours of A.I. border on great. Spielberg captures the perfect tone that Kubrick would have had without copying him. Theres a very emotional scene in the woods that almost had me in tears. The first 120 minutes of A.I. represent great filmmaking and could have possibly been a masterpiece. The problem is in the last 20 minutes of the film. Spielberg was doing the things the way Kubrick wanted without ripping him off, until the ending. You see that scene under the water would have been the ending Kubrick would have wanted. But Spielberg did not fully understand what Kubrick wanted and gave it a "nice" ending. These moments drag and you want it to be over.The flaw cannot be placed on the actors though. Halley Joel Osment does a solid job as David, there actually moments where we think he is human. Jude Law is excellent as Gigolo Joe, he is very charismatic in this role. Feances O'Connor does a nice job in her role. A.I. does well in the technical categories. The Visual Effects are first-rate. The Original Score is haunting in areas. Overall, A.I. is a good movie but with Kubrick it might have been great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick must be rolling over in his grave....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something happened very interesting to Spielberg in 1993.I think he realized that he was a technically accomplished director and good at manipulating audiences, but he needed to make cinema.Then, he made SCHINDLER'S LIST. From that, he proved he could walk with giants of cinema.After that, he made SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. From that, he proved that he could take cinema into visceral realms that would have had Sam Peckinpah shaking in his boots.Then, Stanley Kubrick bequeathed a project to him. That project was AI, and it seemed that Spielberg, after approaching Kubrickian detachment with SCHINDLER'S LIST and parts of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, decided to regress to the "Nudge, Nudge, Wink, Wink" school of Moviemaking that many have shunned him for. I have to say this: the results are quite disappointing.I will not fault the film technically, for on that realm, it is superb. It is Spielberg's execution of scenes that in the hands of Kubrick would have been chilling (ie., Dave's murder of his robotic twin) and intriguing (i.e, The Flesh Fair), turn out to be turgid and banal.I have just one hope for Spielberg long term: forget about the audience. Let them find their own clues and responses. Then, you will make more cinema, and not silly little ridefilms....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb, fascinating and unusual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Artificial Intelligence is like a multiple-walled room with doors on every wall, each door leading to a different destination. I use this simile simply because there are so many ways this film can be read, and indeed so many ways in which this film leads you. It takes you through each and every one of those doors and you have to decide in which destination you stay.Being the final working project of Kubrick, it obviously had high promise. The fact that Spielberg had to finish it off, obviously leads to disappointment. Not because Spielberg does a bad job- far from it- but because one can only speculate how much better Kubrick could have done.There are elements of both directors in the film: the first thirty minutes are very Spielberg, while from about thirty to ninety minutes the Kubrick influence is extremely strong, and this is definitely my favourite part of the film. It's dark and cynical and provides us with a world we are not accustomed to, and don't particularly want to be. While the first section dealt with the dream of a robot boy who could be taught to love, which is quite a corny and cliched concept, the second section deals with the harsh realities of the inferiority of robots and mankind's inability to accept and adjust to them, and their violent retaliations. The principle character, David, played astonishingly well by Haley Joel Osment, plays a key role in this section. Being young and innocent and carrying an animatronic teddy bear (arguably the greatest character in the film) wherever he goes, he embodies the naivety of your average child growing up in a terrifying world which he does not understand. But in this film, that real-life situation is explored to its extremes.David is helped along his way by another very likeable character, Gigolo Joe, one of Jude Law's most interesting performances. The interaction between the two is absolutely fascinating, almost absurdist at times and always with that quirky, Kubrickean feel to it. The quest that forms the central part of the film is essentially nothing more than an appropriation of the Pinocchio story, retold in a science-fiction context: David must become a real boy in order to gain the love of his mother. When he reaches Manhattan where his final destination is supposed to be but in actual fact finds him nowhere else but back at the manufacturer's where he was made, we think the film is over. But in actual fact there is about another hour to run.It is this last hour that is the most criticised, and it is quite clear why. There appears to be too much resolution to the film; there are three different points at which the film could end, and at only one of these it does. All three are very sad and tragic ends, but the third and actual ending is somehow the least fulfilling, it gives you a far more hollow feeling. At first I thought it was just because it is such a bleak portrayal but in actual fact it is simply because personally I felt one of the other two endings would be better, but maybe that's too conventional an outlook.The final resolution is something that has never been done before, in a way that has never been done. It's really unexpected and unpredictable, it deals with a bizarre concept in a very serious manner and essentially finishes for you a movie that one person could never make alone. It's one of the most original and thoughtful endings of all time and really gets you thinking. It is so evident that so many minds and so many hours went into the crafting of this modern masterpice that you have to appreciate it. The film borders on being silly so often but never quite falls into that trap (I'm still not sure why) and for that I am forever grateful.Overall - ****1/2 / *****</fullReview>

And why when there is no way you could go wrong with Steven Spielberg, OK I will change this one: there is no way (90% of the cases) that you won't be entertained. If not intellectually then visually which is pretty much the case with AI-intellectually not very good but the artificial (visual) part was perfect-a la Spielberg.What Spielberg is trying with this movie is to make us shed tears over, well there is no other way of saying it, a robot. A robot, which the entire film does nothing but to execute the encrypted by his owner (Monica) program. There isn?ft much sense, is it. But then comes the completely awesome special effects with my favorite kind of scenes from abandoned cities-it this case the flooded New York. All this supported by Haley Joel Osment?fs perfect performance. He was totally different child from the one he played in the "Six Sense." Very convincing-simply brilliant. Great supporting performance from Jude Law, as he always does.I definitely didn't find the movie being too long. I can't tell whether it should've finished earlier. For me it is fine the way it was. I would recommend AI to anybody who enjoys great visual effects. I won't recommend it highly, but it is still worth viewing. I think the rating is fair: 7 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A major disappointment, as if it had been made by two different directors. Which it was, sort of. The first half, clearly the Kubrick half, explores the concept of robots built to resemble humans and their exploitation by society. We mainly follow the adventures of a robot boy being taken into a home where the real son is dying of an incurable disease. When the son recovers, the robot boy is quickly abandoned, literally thrown to the wolves. The second half is the boy's never-ending search to be reunited with the mother who threw him away. And this is clearly Spielberg territory. It gets very cloying and overly sentimental. The movie also suffers from multiple endings. The first ending comes when a gigolo robot bids farewell to the boy, telling him he has helped him gain a sense of what it feels to be human. Perfect. But then comes a second ending when the boy commits "suicide," plunging from a building into the depths of the ocean. Not a bad ending either. But Spielberg still is not done. Oh no. A third ending comes with the boy hunkering down to spend eternity staring at a statue of the Blue Fairy from Pinocchio. He has been searching high and low for this thing. OK, now we're getting into "I wish it was over already" territory. But there is yet one more ending, involving robots in the far future and a reunion with mommy that is right out of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, Kubrick's masterpiece. At this point, I think most viewers would gladly have swapped places with the boy and taken that plunge into the ocean two endings back.</fullReview>

More than a blockbuster, thanks to Stanley's visions and designs, but that he died too soon, I think that Mr Spielberg should have consulted him more carefully.enjoy a trully moving titleregards;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two directors alone together--for better or worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg are/were two of the best directors cinema has. I have followed their careers from Flying Padre to Eyes Wide Shut and from Amblin to Catch Me If You Can. Having said they are the best doesn't mean they are without their likes, dislikes, gifts, flaws, aptitudes, and obsessions. This film has it all-- the excellent, the good, the bad, and the really ugly. It is easy to see what Kubrick wanted and where Spielberg took over. There are some reviews that trash this film, but it must be taken for what it is-- a two director flawed masterpiece. The movie starts out wonderfully without explaining where it is going or what it is doing and showing the characters flaws and all--typical Kubrick. Then it moves to wonderful special effects science fantasy--typical Spielberg. And by typical I mean the best of the directors respective obsessions. But the flaws must be taken with the good (yin/yang) in that by not telling us where the movie is going (Kubrick style), it is disjointed and apparently without aim or meaning. By moving into the special effects fantasy (Spielberg style), it becomes sappy and loses the willing suspension of disbelief needed for the best of movies. What keeps this movie on an even keel is the excellent acting and excellent direction--a hallmark of both of these directors. As for the ending-- yes, it is as bad as the reviewers say it is. Anytime you START voice over 120 minutes into a movie, that is a bad sign. If you have this movie at home, just get used to turning the DVD or tape off at two hours--it makes for a MUCH better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Spoilers***A lot has been written here about A.I., and I'm not sure what I can add. I do like it, but there are a few flaws.I happened to see an episode of the old sci-fi series, Night Gallery, that had a similar story to A.I, but told it in less time. The story was about a husband and wife (played by Cloris Leachman) who keep abusing their robot maid and breaking her. They bring her back into the shop for another model, but this time the maid kills the couple. In the end, we find out that the robots have taken over the factory. They now make and sell each other, gradually taking over the human race.The Night Gallery story, while showing that the humans were bad, also show the possibility of robots taking over . . . on purpose. I think A.I. leans too heavily on the side of orga (humans), bad; mecca (robots), good. The anti-mecca people were ultimately correct: we became extinct and the mecca survived. But A.I. seems to point to our stupidity for our demise: could it be environmental problems caused by pollution that only robots could survive? In A.I., we see how the humans misjudge the mecca: blaming Gigolo Joe for murder and blaming David for trying to drown Martin. But the mecca were capable of violence: David did destroy reading David in Dr. Hobby's office.The super mecca praise the human race, though. And Dr. Hobby seems to be shown in a good light for making such a creation as David. But wasn't he just a grieving father who wanted to replicate his dead son? Did Dr. Hobby ever think of the consequences of his creation? And why did Hobby let David wonder around when he was abandoned? Wasn't Hobby just as selfish as Monica? They were trying to make themselves feel better. In the scene in which David is being repaired after eating food, we see Monica clutching his hand, but she lets go of it when David says that it doesn't hurt Mommy--realizing that David is not human. And Monica's husband is really quite hypocritical: he doesn't agree with having robots and is freaked out about it, but he works at a place that manufactures and sells robots.The mecca themselves even seem to recognize they are at war with humans. Teddy seems to be a wise sage who knows that he is not a toy. The other old mecca in the flesh fair cage says something about how humans are always trying to lower the number of mecca to increase their superiority.My two favorite scenes in the movie are David's abandonment and the flesh fair spectacle. When Monica takes David for a drive in the county, I thought about how people take their unwanted pets for "a drive in the country." We have become the ultimate disposable society. If we created mecca, maybe we would show a little humanity and responsibility for them. But no--we have the flesh fair boss who doesn't really care if technology has taken over--he just wants money. But all this still points to the fact that A.I. makes us the bad guy and robots victims.Still A.I. is destined to be a classic and definitely worth a look-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My only flaw with this film is the 2nd act could have been stronger, it feels messy, though with repeated viewings it gains more structure. But i can't find flaw with the extended first act and the extended 3rd act.. in fact i love them to utter pieces. I personally think the ending is genius.. people who try find technical plot holes in it simply don't know enough science, and sort of forget the notion of science fiction... there's hardly anything in this film or minority report which could not happen in the timeframe each movie has been put in. Come on people! the film took 14 yrs to make, by 2 very intelligent people with access to technical information most of us would dream of having. Anyway, forgot all that, the ending is one of my favourite pieces of celluloid, and i think one of Spielberg's greatest sequences, i can only think people who don't see it that way simply don't get it, as i can't see anyone not falling in love with it once they do 'get it'. and John Williams created a masterpiece score that got very unnoticed, due in part to the film not doing as well as it should have, and people think Williams doesn't 'create' any more, he simply does it.. no he's a genius, and this score is a master at work. Like 2001, i really think A.I. will win over a lot of people in time to come, it seemed to split audiences too much into the negative side, much like Vanilla Sky, which is a shame, because both these films are inteligent and different films which the hollywood mainstream needs a bit more of.. i like popcorn movies just fine, but i just wish people could look more deeply into the films they watch, and not expect everything to be done for them.A.I. carries one of the most beautiful and purest messages in any film, and does it in such a way i can't help but label it as a combined masterpiece of 2 of the greatest film-makers around, if you expected something else, shame on you.. go watch it again, and again.. in time you too will see why people like myself label it as one of the most under-rated great films ever made.10/10</fullReview>

And to have it love you -- andapparently love only you, nobody else, there's a guilt trip waiting tohappen. Too much responsibility, if you ask me. Amazinglyambitious, beautiful effects, flawless acting, great music,technically superb, like so many top notch Hollywood productthese days, marred by so many little (and big) plot implausibilities,mostly in the film's 2nd half.</fullReview>

The only problem, as in Bicentennial Man, being that the boy is outliving everyone. And this was bad, unlike in Bicentennial Man, because the boy's sole purpouse was to find the blue fairy. The plot was reasonably distributed along the timeline until (approx quote): "Boy moves in time. Seeks fairy. Uses submarine. Gets frozen in ice for a few thousand years..." WHOA! What? Hold on, he freezes? And then they totally randomly introduce wobbly translucent aliens. It's ridiculous. Talk about writing oneself into a corner...I do that sometimes, but then I go back, and start again at the point it started to get silly. They definitely let is get silly. The only mistake worse than this that Spielberg has made on an ending is the sterotypically cliched finale for Minority Report. A happy ending to end all happies... UMPH! Bad film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever I see a new Steven Spielberg movie for the first time, the words that pop out of my mouth are almost without exception "well, the bloke did it again". However I was very suspicious about "Artificial intelligence", simply because Spielberg usually has a very over-sentimental style of filmmaking and the story of a robot-boy desperately seeking motherly love sounded like the corniest film he has ever done. Once again I'm glad I was wrong. Of course the ending is so annoyingly "Spielbergish" that it's really not even touching anymore but most of the movie actually looks more like, well, Stanley Kubrick's work than a traditional Spielberg film.Of course that leads to a question what would "AI" have looked like if Kubrick would have been the man behind the camera instead of Steven. Even better, I'm sure, but this one is a wonderful experience too so why bother to complain? Haley Joel Osment's performance was surprisingly incredible. I never really understood his talent when I watched "The Sixth sense" but now I have to admit that he's a phenomenally gifted kid and I'm sure he will keep on getting roles as an adult. Jude Law made a fantastic supporting role as Gigolo Joe. He was funny, stylish and downright terrific. "Artificial intelligence" will be remembered as one of the big Spielberg classics.</fullReview>

It might not have been that different or even as good. The film takes you on a journey which is never less than interesting and in some places very beautiful and startling. Unfortunately the one major flaw you can never forget throughout the film is that David is not human and therefore is very difficult to actually care about. But Hayley Joel Osment is so good it almost works. Also John Williams score is wonderful and his best for some time. If your a Spielberg fan you might be disappointed but if your a Kubrick fan its definitely worth seeing, it's as close in spirit to 2001:A Space Odyssey as we're ever going to get.

Massive budgets and state of the art FX can not compensate for the hideous plot flaws that simply spoiled the remainder of the movie.&lt;SPOILERS&gt;Picture the scene. A company that develops A.I. devices creates it's most sophisticated, advanced humanoid ever. An automaton in the shape of a normal little boy. They send this one-of-a-kind device home with an employee to test. The employee's emotionally distraught wife, disturbed that the robotic child is just too lifelike, takes the (presumably) multi-million dollar prototype android out in the middle of nowhere, and abandons it.Puh-leeeeze!While I can appreciate all the psychological perspectives of the anguished mother, it still does not warrant or justify the actions. Why don't they show the follow-up scene of the husband coming home, learning she has ditched the device, and going ballistic?This movie repeatedly disregards the most basic concepts of technology in order to further it's efforts at creating an emotion filled saga of a confused little boy. A humanoid device that has a fully articulated, fully functional oral cavity, capable of the mechanical action of drinking, chewing, and most importantly, _swallowing_, but no facility or safeguards to keep ingested food and liquids from damaging the internals?again,Puh-leeeeze!And the ending.... the final ending...the last ending..... No not that one, the one after the ending...well, you get the idea. Out of everything that mankind could possibly create, the only surviving representation of a human is this one robot??for a final time,Puh-leeeeze!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minor spoilers.This is the story of a boy named David, the most advanced robot of his time. Being the most advanced form of A.I., he is given the ability to love. But is this love real? David's creator has built David in the image of his dead son, and gives him to a grieving couple whose own young son is ill and nearing death. Add this to a debilitated future society that is beginning to resent "artificiality", and we have an android with human-child qualities put in complicated and unfortunate human circumstances. This dilemma actually serves as an experiment to see how far this piece of technology can define its newly-found ability to love, desire, and dream. We follow David's journey as he struggles to cope in this unpredictable world. He is joined by another advanced robot, Gigolo Joe, an adult model built specifically to serve human female sexual needs who becomes David's guide and protector; and a supertoy teddy bear, Teddy, who is loveable and loyal. Together they seek the Blue Fairy, a mystical female being ready to grant wishes if one believes hard enough. This journey is not one where spectacular and obvious events occur. It is not an action/chase science-fiction movie with explosive effects (see Spielberg's next film, "Minority Report" for that) but a movie of philosophical musings in metaphoric settings. I believe that Spielberg does a complete job in rounding out Kubrick's vision here. Spielberg wears his heart on his sleeve, and putting that into a clinical Kubrick story gives it another dimension. But it is ultimately a sad tale, where the most human qualities are given to machines, and where the machines seem to be more caring than the humans themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read Brian Aldiss short story behind this movie but I have read plenty of his stories to know his style. This and the fact that Spielberg and Kubrick, as so many others here have mentioned, are direct opposites, makes it difficult for me to judge this movie. First of all the movie excels in special effects and as a whole works quite well up until the boy is stuck under water. After that something went wrong. The rest is simply too sentimental. Kubrick wouldn't have done it like that. Brian Aldiss would, though. And, eh, Spielberg did. In fact, I think Spielberg hit a note not at all unlike Brian Aldiss', still it makes me wonder, what would this have turned out to be had Stanley Kubrick directed it? To be quite frank, I would have been much happier had Spielberg left it alone and left us with a complete deprivation rather than a feeling of an untimely loss of innocence.No, the movie is not wrong. Spielberg made a marvellous, seeworthy movie. What is wrong is the thought of Stanley Kubrick contemplating making this movie. The mere thought is incomprehensible. I simply can't figure out what he would have done with it. Something very different, no doubt. But what?!I am puzzled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's dreamchild, realized poorly by Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off, let me say that this movie was doomed from the start. Master directors Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg were apparently good friends, so when the former died, the latter took it upon himself to create what was to be Kubrick's next film, a complicated story about a machine child who is programmed to love. I understand Spielberg's tribute, and it's a noble gesture, but the impending failure should have been obvious from the start. No two directors I can think of have such completely contrasting styles as Spielberg and Kubrick. Kubrick is the icy intellectual, while Spielberg is the great entertainer. Kubrick's films are ponderous and philosophical, Spielberg's delightfully exuberant and, in some cases (Schindler's List, The Color Purple) amazingly dramatic. Both are true titans, but this film is a reality suspended in the void between intent and realization. I am certain, had Kubrick done it, this would have quite closely resembled his 1968 masterpiece, 2001. As it is, it bears a closer resemblance to Spielberg's E.T., yet carries with it none of the joy and emotion that film managed to bring. INstead, A.I. is weighted down by the two director's visions. Spielberg, having written the film himself, did his best to honour Kubrick, yet all too often, A.I. lapses into Spielberg's sentiment, which Kubrick could not have tolerated. The movie is redeemed somewhat by astounding visuals, and an intriguing premise. It carries with it certain undeniable emotions including pity, sorrow, and even guilt. Yet, at the same time, these emotions seem almost suspended as a concept. Up until the ending, which is entirely proposterous and purely Spielberg, this manages to maintain a fair amount of dignity, as if Spielberg were saying 'it won't be great, but i'll do it right.' All in all, A.I. is worth seeing, but if you're a fan of Kubrick or Spielberg, this film will dissapoint, for it falls into a vast gap of indifference that seperates the two great, if diametrically opposed, directors.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS INCLUDED***OK, this movie wasn't too bad, but it wasn't too great either. The direction was excellent, the special effects were excellent, BUT the story was going absolutely nowhere. It started off really well, with Haley Joel Osment (great, great, great job) as David, coming and getting acquainted with his new family. He gets attached to them almost immediately, especially his 'mother', very nicely portrayed by Frances O'Connor. Then he meets the extremely charming and irresistable (well, to me anyway), Gigolo Joe, played brilliantly by Jude Law (the guy has A LOT of charm, I'm telling you). After a few scenes the story starts to go down - fast. I have absolutely no idea why it was written the way it was. It went from a not-so-much-but-still-pretty-believable plot to a completely this-is-just-so-weird-and-impossible plot. Yeah, I know this is sci-fi, but still, this story took the weirdest turn I have ever seen. The whole idea of the major cities submerged under the water thing was ok...but the end... what's with the aliens? I seem to think they were aliens anyway... reading poeple's memories and recreating people from their pasts by some sample of DNA that they might have left behind. It just had nothing at all to do with David's development. He was in exactly the same "emotional" state as he was when he was separated from his family... the hope to become real and to be with his mother again. All the emotional development was already done. That was the whole point of the movie wasn't it? Everything else after that just seemed to go way off track. The whole "blue fairy" business was cute, but strange. There must have been a million other ways to get David back to his mother. Well, as for the overall special effects and direction, they were superb. The make up was good and the futuristic atmosphere created in some of the scenes was impressive. Haley Joel Osment does an excellent job, as always. He's a very pleasant actor to watch with extreme talent. His expressions are magnificent. Jude Law did very well, looked great (let's be honest here) and made Joe look very sophisticated in a strange sort of way (loved the little dance moves). Besides these two, Frances O'Connor was great, her expressions looked very real.Overall, this movie wasn't all that great, but not too bad, either. I wouldn't recommend it too strongly, but watch it for the brilliant performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>7 out of 10I'm not surprised audiences responded with less than glee to Steven Spielberg's A.I. This immensely flawed sci-fi drama does little to please the popcorn crowd and the sentimentality won't go well with art-house/Kubrick fans who seem to like their movies entirely thought-based, emotion-free. Artificial Intelligence is a movie of three segments, the first two are terrific and unlike anything Spielberg has ever made. It's the last part the movie begins to crumble. The slow pacing brings to mind the works of Stanley Kubrick, mainly 2001, which A.I. actually bears little resemblance to, structurally or plot-wise. As a whole, the film is a fascinating endeavor, buoyed by superb performances and typical first-rate craftsmanship. And yes, messy as the ending was, it still brought a few tears to my eye. Oh, and is it just me or is Teddy not the most adorable "pet" you've ever seen?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my 2nd comment on AI. The first one is still accurate but I wanted to add these words to augment the first comment. As I stated the director does not take a position on what the bot-boy is and so you are confronted with various points of view - that is all - no definitive answer there in the movie. I was thinking that a good project would be to count the number of times each side of the argument is stated, those being: he is a bot, or he isn't a bot.There is one point that tends to make me think that the director gave his opinion - the scene where the hanging charm from a mobile is that of a child with a hole in the middle of the chest, in the shape of a heart. This might have been the director putting in his own two cents while trying to allow both sides to "speak" in the movie. In short, the director might have been saying: "David does not have a soul."However, there is a definitive answer: self-consciousness, or awareness of one's own self. This cannot be programmed nor created - only immitated. Man cannot create self-consciousness. There is only One who creates our consciousness. As such the boy-bot is only, and always will be, just a robot.Dr. Hobby is driven by his compassion for his dead son to create an immitation/substitute for his grieving heart. And it is his single-mindedness that drives him to create a very close approximation to a human child.David is a child stalker of Monika (his Organic "mother"). This is not love. He feels nothing other than what the programmers put into him in order to "learn" how to react when he is "imprinted" on Monica. He knows only one way - "love Mommy." His "love" is single-minded to the point of his: 1) "praying" for 2000 years to a lifeless statue to be made real, and 2) accepting a clone of his "Mommy" as if she is the same person, 3) he didn't say how much he "missed" his "Mommy." (his first words to her (after 2000 years) are: "Do you want some coffee?"(I accept clones as 1) not truly being made by man - man only plants a seed, and 2) as such, they are/will be fully human... God helps us.)There were two features I want to mention that caught my attention as innovative (because of their believability): 1) the character "teddy" - very cool "super-toy," (the best lines in the movie are said by this character), and 2) the helicopter David flew around - very cool "super-toy" :)Ok. Now here's my opinion on what the movie is *REALLY* about - it's not about if an AI is a real sentient being or not, but rather it's about that man will extinguish himself and all that will remain are our machines - aka "super-toys." Simultaneously telling a story about one such "super-toy" - a very unique one, called "David."- Zafoid</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't find it surprising Kubrick wanted to turn the film over to Spielly, whose compassionized filmmaking style better suit the source material of a robotic boy who wants the love of his mother.But it really shouldn't be seen as a "mix" of two directors. Kubrick fans will say it's a disgrace because of it's sentiment, Spielberg fans won't like it too much because of that exact opposite. This is a film, and should be seen as one, not compared to the director's work.As a film, it's definitely not flawless. It's a bit too slow (even for me, and I like my films slower paced) in plot and speeds up quickly at the end. I would have liked to see more worlds than just Rouge City, or maybe another character? Also, I would have liked more backstory behind Jude Law's Gigolo Joe. The man steals every scene as the "love mecha" helping the mecha boy David on his journey to become a real boy. This role was made for him and is filled with quirkiness and charisma. It also amazes me how little credit Haley Joel Osment got for making this film. The entire film is weighed on his soldiers, and his emotional restraint to play the mecha is a amazing.Ultimately, the theme of love and source material means it'll grow in popularity in time like other sci-fi films, similar to Blade Runner as an example.Judge it as a film on your own, and you'll enjoy it.Oh, did I mention the cinematography is absolutely beautiful? The "Moon on the rise" scene alone warrants admission. Wait, I think I've said too much already...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*Many a film my ultra-critical brother has warned me against watching I have, and have wondered why I just didn't listen to him when he said "don't waste your time." 'Chairman of the Board' with Carrot Top was one such movie, and this is another. With the latter, he was most definitely right. With 'AI', though, I'm not so sure.All starts out well. The concept of a flooded planet where humanoid robots are created to take care of food problems is certainly a good one; there's a lot you could do with a basic story like that. The creation of David to replace the comatose biological son of Monica is interesting as well, and this is where the fun starts. To be honest, 'AI' is really kinda creepy with a great number of the scenes in the movie, and it starts when super-toy Teddy starts walking and talking - just weird, period. Then Martin returns home, and he and David start competing for Monica's love. There's of course the scene where David stuffs his mechanical mouth with food, and his face starts to sag...creepy. But the surrealism truly digs in for good in the movie after David is left in the forest. The junkyard where the robots search for new parts? The "moon?" The motorcyclists with the dog-faced bikes? It just gets creepier by the moment.All told, I really did like the film overall. Yet it would have been SO much better if, as my dear brother had specifically told me, it had ended at a certain point. As I had discovered, this certain point was the collaspe of the old, rusted ferris wheel over David's submersible as he prays to the Blue Fairy to become real. If it had ended right there, I'd give this movie a 10, no question. But it doesn't end. It keeps on going, bringing two more millennia, a second ice age, and aliens into the picture. Ugh. Leave these for another film, even a sequel, Mr. Spielberg, not in the same darn movie.Despite this major flaw, 'AI' is still a very likable movie. Not the best I've ever seen, but far from horrible.Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

I can't even count how many times I looked at the clock waiting for this to be over. And the story was not that entertaining. If this hadn't been directed by SS, then it would have got even worse reviews and made no money at the box office.FINAL VERDICT: Not worth the time it takes to watch. Nothing is especially good about it. A well below average film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AI is, perhaps, too sci-fi for many</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading numerous reviews and comments of this movie, one thing seems quite clear - AI is, perhaps, just a little bit too serious of a SF film for the mainstream. Kubrick handing it over to Spielberg may have been the perfect choice, as this movie has elicited much the same views as Kubrick's own great SF masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Essentially, this is a love-it-or-hate-it movie that is dark, dreary, yet filled with a hope that subtly pervades the entire film. But it IS science fiction in the true sense of the word, even if it is based on another literary work (Pinochio). For those that think it is too slow moving, I dare you to go back and watch Soylent Green again and notice the very glacial pacing of that movie which is considered one of the great SF films, or at the original Planet of the Apes. By today's standards, these are almost motionless pictures, but it is the time that is spent developing the whole plot and sub-plot and counter-plot and sub-counter-plot that makes an intricate film like this work. This is not a film where you sit down and turn off your brain for 2 hours, it is designed to elicit thought and emotion, and whether you love this film or hate it, if you have one of these two reactions, then it has done exactly what it was intended to do. That is the core of SF, and that is the core of this film. On the pywrit scale of 1-10, I give it a solid 8.5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Revenge, Kubrick's Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Mr. Spielberg had no REAL hand in creating this film, i.e. the story... I was left confounded as to how a director so revered for his excellent storytelling style and direction could allow such a misguided story to get the better of him. I do not know the inner workings of Hollywood but are these men and women who produce movies so wrapped up in making money (by banking on their name)and so capable, that all the other men and women around them just go along with whatever they say? This is a terrible FILM and it is terrible probably because everyone, i suppose because of Mr. Spielbergs track record, quite casually agreed that his ideas for this film were solid and innovative, everything Kubrick may have wanted. THIS IS PAINFULLY NOT TRUE. The story dies within the first ten minutes. NOW As a screenwriter I have decided to re-write A.I. because it is far too fascinating A SUBJECT TO LET DIE BY THE HANDS OF Mr. Hollywood himself. If Kubrick had been alive I am sure his vision would have been far greater than Mr. Spielbergs but this is only because as Spieberg has said: "I am only interested in doing things that challenge me at this point in my career." Well Steven as you can now see, To be challenged is far greater a task and risk than just making money and you can make all the money in the world but at the end of the day when you go home and sit on your 2.3 billion dollar nest egg you just don't feel fulfilled because you've thought about everything, except making a superior artistic film. This one should never have been made, and STEVEN needs to fire some of those YES people he has feeding off of him. His career is on a downturn not because he's losing his creative edge but because those around him have no creative edge. TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THIS ONE. SKIP IT! There is nothing here. Then again if Spielberg is as aware as he is notoriously known to be when it comes to even the many minor details concerning his films...then perhaps he knew exactly what he was doing, and if that's so perhaps it is true as NIETZSCHE has said: there is a jealousy in hating too, for we want to have our enemy for ourselves. I know that might sound ridiculous but Kubrick would never have released this film and his name being attached to it the way it was does his legacy a disservice.</fullReview>

The performances of Haley Osment and Jude Law are terrific, to start with, but their characters tend to get very annoying as the film progresses.Jude Law's first scene as a vain, mercenary, hard-hearted gigolo is wonderful, but then he becomes a "lovable" buffoon and ruins everything. Haley Osment's character also loses track and decides he's just like Pinocchio. I lost interest in the end. It would have been considerably more entertaining if it had taken a dark turn at the Flesh Fair, developing into a robot revolution, instead of going smarmy, and lasting for a few thousand years longer. I felt as though I'd endured every second of that time just by watching the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful film that gets sidetracked, but amazingly so! (Spoilers included)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched A.I. and I feel this is a wonderful film that has several other films in it that may bog it down and turn alot of people off.The first hour reminded me of a Stanley Krubeck film similar to 2001. As Robot David got caught and sent to the Flesh Fair and the speech of the Flesh Fair owner, to me this WAS the ending of the film. Not an anti-climax mind you, but the true end of the film A.I.Then...there is the robot "Gigolo Joe" and his world. That was a whole adult concept within itself (especially with the City which is visually stunning!) that wanted to go somewhere but kept chickening out into PG-13 land. All I kept thinking about when I watched Joe was "Gosh....I wish Director Ken Russell would have done this." Then...there was the "Pinocchio" factor. There were threads of it throughout the film, but surrounding the story with it was overkill to me. They could have just left that in the development room. I found it overbearing.Then...there was the establishment where Robot David was made. I love William Hurt and I felt there was a separate story somewhere that included his character, the makings of David, other robots, the subsequent mass marketing of David, etc., that got downplayed and sidetracked. The New York City situation was also confusing to a point but I think the connection IS with the William Hurt character, why he really developed David as opposed to the obvious explanation, why he was so driven to develop David, etc., etc.Then...there was the "Close Encounters from the Third Kind - esqe" thing. It "kinda" worked for me, but again, I felt that something was missing and something didn't quite work. What is that Pinocchio thing? It might have worked if the film went one way, then again, maybe not. The very, very last 5 minutes of the film, upon looking at it a third time, did finally make me cry. But I had to find that within myself and ignore everything else to get to that state, to understand.I am not saying this isn't an entertaining film, it is. I am not saying this will not grow on you, for it will. And I am not saying that the Special Effects were awful for if you view this film for anything, the special effects are FANTASTIC!!! But that was alot of effort into a story that just didn't quite leave you feeling complete.I did enjoy the story of the A.I. love robot David wanted and had. One could easily substitute the Robot David for -- any adoptive child, or any pet. I really enjoyed "Teddy" very much and was totally transfixed on him and how Robot David made a clear A.I. division between he and Teddy when there really wasn't one at all.The part of the film I loved the MOST was "Dr. Know". If you see the film for nothing else, this part is truly a gem, excellent work.So if you're looking to be "wow-ed", and visually stunned, this is the film. If you're looking for a deep story, this film has several deep stories, they just don't quite lead to one good story.</fullReview>

Perhaps only the smug elitists have been enlightened as to the meaning of the transparent imagery, but I found it pretentious, tedious and self-absorbed.The sole message inherent to A.I., though unintended by Speilberg, is that movie making, like life and love, can not be created or duplicated though a means of high-tech computer generated scenes and mechanical automation. This is true no matter how much art, music or mathematical equations are applied (a prophetic line uttered by one of Spielberg's E.T.s in the end.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was absolutely amazed at just how tedious this film was to watch. The entire enterprise was directed at such a slow pace it acts as a sleep aid. After the obligatory needless prologue (designed for people who, like the scarecrow, haven't got a brain), we get to a drawn out story of the old cliche of a misunderstood robot that only wants to be human -- cutting edge in 1946, but hardly worth redoing now. Every point, every dramatic moment, is hammered home with a 20-pound sledgehammer. The Pinocchio references get so overdone and annoying that you want to scream "Enough, Steve! Enough! We get it! We get it!" Only in the last twenty minutes does an interesting concept emerge (as a deus ex machina out of the clear blue sky), but by then you're screaming, "I don't care! Get this over with!"The visuals are impressive, no doubt about that. But the movie fails on every other count. It is awash in smarmy sentimentality, and makes absolutely no logical sense (the Spinach Incident, for instance -- they never expected something like that to happen?) and seems satisfied to simply parade its cliches and hope someone applauds.A major disappointment.</fullReview>

After seeing it, I am glad I took the precaution. E.T. it is NOT. I found it dark, disturbing, quasi-violent and depressing. The little robot-boy was treated horridly throughout the entire movie and, perhaps my maternal instincts prevented me from being more objective about the film as "art." My heart just kept breaking for him - not a fun experience. I will say that I thought it was well-acted and the special effects were, well, special. It obviously achieved what it set out to do because it still has an immense emotional impact on me, months after seeing it. (Just once, I couldn't go through that again.)

He peppers the movie with lots of references to Kubrick's work, e.g. "Dave", Dave's first tentative footstep in the white slipper is straight out of 2001, long tracking shots, etc. I feel that he was too in awe of Stanley Kubrick to make this a work of his own and tried to make this the movie that Stanley would have made. I am not knocking this movie completly, it has wonderful moments and fantastic special effects. Some of the acting is outstanding, Jude Law in particular. I think that his performance as Gigolo Joe was wonderful and really convincing (surely the acid test of any acting performance), I think he should have received a best supporting actor nomination for his potrayal. His "Singing in the Rain" parody was particularly good. I watched this film back to back with K-PAX and it's strengths show up the weaknesses of AI. K-PAX had a very good script and plot so it didn't need all the expensive (though stunning) visual effects and sets. I think that Spielberg needs to remember the first rule of story telling, make sure you have a good story to tell first.Movie 4/10, Jude Law 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Flawed Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. from Steven Spielberg is an interesting union between two of the greatest (or "so-called" greatest) film-makers of our time. Stanley Kubrick conceived of the film and Steven Spielberg actually made it after Kubrick's death. Many people have said that there are obvious signs of Kubrick's hand on the film and perhaps they are right. Being that I am not, nor have ever been, a Kubrick enthusiast I am not the person to talk to about this. I am more qualified to look at Spielbergs work as a director and comment on it. A.I. is the story of a robot who was built to love. Haley Joel Osment proves once again that he is a prodigy of an actor. His portrayal of the robot, David, is so layered and just plain good that one truly watches in awe at his abilities. Jude Law is also good in his small role of Gigolo Joe. I could go on for a while about the acting but, suffice to say, the acting was never a problem. Neither is the overall directing of the film. Spielber's shot composition gets more and more interesting with every film he makes. There is one shot in particular where David is staring at his mother over a metal table and we see his reflection staring back at him that is quite amazing. At no point in the film did I ever have problems with the mechanics of film-making. The actual conception of the film and many of its written elements... that is another story. The story of A.I. begins as a moralistic fable and a cautionary one. The dangers and lunacy of giving something the ability to love without thinking of the consequences, the irresponsibility of parents, the inability of humans to relate to anything at all that is not exactly like they are. These are all statements that begin to take shape throughout the film and, had the film continued on this particular journey, could have solidified itself as, possibly, the greatest motion picture in history. But after David is abandoned the film starts to fall apart. We see Spielberg having to rely on visual effects and sci-fi cliches because the story is simply not built strongly enough to carry through the moral fibers of the initial plot. We see the Mechas acting in ways that is not quite accurate of beings unable to love or feel. We see a great mystery which could have been the central arc to the film solved in under 10 minutes of screen time. And, lastly (and mostly tragically) we see the climax dissect itself into a confusion of emotions that eventually lead the viewer to feel just tired and cranky. I didn't mind the idea that David would be the last link to the past, I didn't mind the idea of the Uber-Mechas searching for their own past (in fact I rejoiced it), what I did in fact mind was the way that the film tried to wrap itself up made little sense. Not that I don't enjoy a head scratcher, which this wasn't, but I do like a story to make sense within its own universe. What Spielberg tried to do was amazing. What we got was something less than what it could have been... SHOULD have been. It left me sad not because I felt for the characters, but rather because I saw what it might have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***WARNING: DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SPOIL THE MOVIE FOR YOU!*** Incredibly disappointing. The concept and imagery were both great, but if felt like they were trying to tell too many different stories at once; like they couldn't decide on one so they just spliced them all together. It wasn't really clear what Gigolo Joe's role was other than a MechaLover, or how he was changed(if at all)by David. He was just there, part of the situation, and it didn't seem like he had formed a real relationship with David despite all they went through. Some parts were very poignant, like the part where David discovers that he's just one of many mass-produced Davids. I also like his journey to become real, which shows that maybe he had more emotions than love. Now, about the ending: it was, in a word, disgraceful! Every time I thought it would end, it just kept on going. I was relieved when it was finally over. They should have left him sitting at the bottom of the sea, looking at the blue fairy. Another good spot would've been when he opened the door: I fully expected to find his mother and the end, but it was just another dead end. The bit about only having her for one day had the feeling that it was thrown in there, maybe to try to make the point that the world isn't perfect, but we already got that from the Flesh Fair and Joe's death. When it finally ended, I wasn't left with a feeling that this was a good movie and I didn't come away with any deep thoughts; just a feeling of immense relief that the end had come at last. Don't waste your time; there are much better movies out there!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Working Title: Dissapointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has all the hallmarks of one of the greatest films of our time, the experienced and respected director, a protege child-actor, a supporting cast comprising of some well established stars and some promising up-and-comings, a ridiculous budget and of course inspiring and thought provoking subject matter. However, I have rarely forced myself to sit through such drivel. The plot was completely inconsistent, slow moving and the ending itself left me feeling quite numb. It's the type of film that one feels no emotion for or attachment to any of the main characters, specifically because they are not human.Haley Joel Osment's character is completely sterile, and as he film is a journey that follows the robot-child's development, there should at least be some involvement between the audience and the character. Osment's portayal of "Cole Sear" in "The Sixth Sense" proves his acting capability but the character of "David" in AI is so poor it may as well have been Macaulay Culkin. Unfortunately, unlike so many big budget Hollywood flicks, the special effects do NOT carry this film.Poor. Very poor indeed.</fullReview>

This movie is incredibly slow, and incredibly corny. If you are a fan of the Public Radio show "Echoes", you might enjoy watching it with your eyes closed while listening to the music. I found Haley Joel Osmett (?) to be little more than annoying in this film, and most of the other actors seemed to have fallen asleep before I did. This film is literally a real sleeper - as is anyone who tries to watch it. Only die-hard sci-fi fans should even attempt this at home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't read much about this movie except that it was badly marketed as a mass-audience appeal film when in reality it was on the super-arty end of the spectrum. Truer words . . . All the acting is superb. And Haley Joel Osmond was fantastically good. Talk about lovable! He is infinitely more appealing than the flesh and blood children in the movie who are vicious little ogres in both character and appearance. The John Williams score is absolutely the best he has written, maybe the only really original film music he has ever done. Everything else he has written sounds to me like Richard Strauss or Mahler or Gustav Holst. This music is truly ethereal, mystical, and scary. My favorite scene was the Flesh Fair. What is so bizarre about this scene is that I found myself identifying with and feeling sympathy for the terrorized robots in the merciless hands of the humans who were staging a kind of auto da fe with them. I'm still digesting the film. It has many levels. The special effects, especially towards the end are spine-tingling. And of course, the Kubrick legacy is palpaple, as is Spielberg's perennial obsession with the mysteries of childhood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. maybe seriously flawed,yet its also the first movie of 2001 from director Steven Spielburg that demands to taken seriously. For one thing,the picture's in the hands of a real filmmaker who has given us some of the greatest films ever conceived during the latter half of the 20th century. For one,Spielburg is not like some fly-by-night hack like Micheal Bay(Pearl Harbor),or Simon West(Tomb Raider),or Tim Burton(Batman) because you're dealing with a true Hollywood genius here. For another,its a movie about ideas,and its running threads concerning the nature of unconditional love and th ramifications of accepting institutionalized prejudice provide it with a deep seated relevance. Finally,it's sure to elicit a wide spectrum of reactions from unprepared audience members,leading to plenty of healthy discussions. Unlike Pinocchio(whose tale figures prominently on this film),the protagonist of A.I.(Haley Joel Osment) wants to be a real boy. As it stands,he actually a robotic entity named David,created by Dr. Hobby(William Hurt) to prove his theory that robots can be built to display genuine feelings of love and devotion. The last film produced by Stanley Kubrick is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While a lot of people doused on this film's flame because of the third act, it was quite amazing from a technical standpoint. While no one could make a movie like Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg certainly put some heart into this project. Up until the point where the earth freezes over, the film is amazing. I'm just angered an obvious editing gaffe made this film what it currently is. At the earliest, it should have faded out when all of the futuristic androids were converging on David. Jude Law gave a rather endearing performance as an elegant gigolo android. There are a lot of good things to mention about this film, but there is also its fair share of bad things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AI is definitely not an ET!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a number of things that can be said about this film, both good and bad. After seeing it, I was unsure if I had seen a good movie or not. I knew I had not seen a bad one, but I did not think it was a masterwork either.I allowed myself to get excited about a film directed by Steven Spielberg. He is easily the greatest filmmaker in cinematic record. The single best moment in Hollywood history is 'Schindler's List,' followed by 'Saving Private Ryan.' Unfortunately, 'A.I.' is not close to either of those films. It is even safe to say that 'A.I.' is no 'E.T.' either. In fact, I could easily create a long list of more satisfying movies from Spielberg.The first hour asks us to accept a robot as a real living, loving boy, and it seems that the boy eventually does earn the family life he was hoping for.But, the organic, normal people decide they don't want him anymore, and that is when the film takes a radical tangent I could not fully accept. It descends into nothing more than an odd quest, and when the boy finds it, it does not satisfy us in anyway.Let me defend Spielberg slightly to a point. He was working with ideas that started with Stanley Kubrick. Spielberg did it to honor Kubrick, but made a big mistake. Since Kubrick had died, Spielberg apparently did not have the heart to cut out anything from the older director's original work. It seems as if Spielberg was only trying to make a film that he thought Kubrick wanted to see, which is an overlong, and at times boring, mass of film that truly needed some cuts. Visually, 'A.I.' has plenty of wonders to behold. I enjoyed the acting, as well. Haley Joel Osment is a very good actor. Jude Law was great too as Gigolo Joe. But the finale is silly, which utilizes aliens that seem to be transplanted from the final scenes of 'Close Encounters".Using the four star system, I rate this one **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I'm a Kubrick fan, and yes I loathe just about everything Spielberg has done since 'Jaws'. However I can't entirely let Kubrick off the hook for the indulgent mess that is 'AI'. The embarrassing 'Eyes Wide Shut' showed that he was capable of making a turkey in his own right, and let's face it many of the weakest concepts in 'AI' (e.g. the silly "blue fairy" idea) were as much his as Spielberg's. Even so Spielberg's lame-brained script does this movie no favours. It is trite, over long, full of holes, and fails to engage on any deep emotional level. As much as I hate George Lucas for turning science fiction movies into a children's genre and synonymous purely with "action" and "fun", if this is supposed to be a good example of an adult SF movie of ideas, then come back Chewbacca, all is forgiven!</fullReview>

Funniest parts included the bear; I couldnt stop laughing at this bear walking around (David's Toto perhaps?) and being oversentimental. Hysterical! Also, when David finally sees his mother, for whom he has been waiting to see for 2000 years, he offers her coffee! This was pretty funny and original too.I may have to go see it again; my rating: as a comedy 9 out of 10. As a drama: ummmm, this one goes to negative one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg the mecha</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seems that Spielberg was given a opportunity to fulfill Kubrick's dream. But it was not to be. Turning on his techniques of sappy sentimental and manipulation of emotions that he has often employed in his childish movies. He made a film that neither showed the dark/cold/sinister side of this Mecha reality or the true emotion that the kid felt while in search for love by his mother.Some scenes seemed too typical, with the bad guys humans in Flesh Fair depicted as typical Spielberg bad guys, and to have the audience stone the announcer in angst over his upcoming tearing apart of a kid mecha, it is so predictably Spielberg.I would assume that a beta project like the deployment of the first mecha with true emotions, the family receiving it would keep in constant contact with the creator for feedback, tweaks and modifications. But they are nowhere to be found, so it leads from one unfortunate event to another, eventually leading to the point where the mecha kid is a danger to the family, leading to his exile in the forest where mecha hobos roams.Somehow the social message got lost in the fairy tale story telling. It is as if Spielberg is still making a children's movie like E.T. With an ending that tells nothing about outcome of the mecha/orga conflict, which was probably the most important subplot of the movie.What was good about the movie was the visual depiction of the future, from the route to and view of Rouge City, and the New York City that is submerged in water with only some skyscrapers protruding out. Although it is not as visionary as in Metropolis.I thought Blade Runner (directory's cut) was the better movie when it came to the concept of throw-away beings coming to terms with their existence. More visionary, darker, more cynical and no pandering to the emotions.Still, a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Haley Joel Osment again proves beyond doubt that he is an excellent actor in this beautifully made movie. I hope to see him in other works. This movie, if made twenty years ago, would have been a major hit, if not, a major oscar contender. But its pace was as slow as "2001: A Space Oddessy" and could have been a little more intense. The 'Flesh Fair' scene was poinent: "He who is without sin, cast the first stone." I thought that was a very powerful scene. I didn't understand the origins of the beings at the end of the movie. Were they archeologists from another planet, or highly evolved machine creatures? I'll have to watch that scene again to hopefully answer that question. This movie is worth at least one must see and would have been a 10 in my book but for the fact that I found it to be boring at times, like an Acadamy Awards show with too many presenters.</fullReview>

Once again he invokes sappy allusions to fairy tale characters. And again he brings back the benevolent beings, albeit artificial intelligent machines, but reminiscent of the aliens in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."The dark Kubrickesque world of the film seem light-years from utopia. For all their advanced technology the robots simply can't clone humans that last longer than a day? Even human scientists did this in Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park. Simply dumping the robot child in the woods also made for wrenching drama but very improbable.</fullReview>

Meanwhile the cinematography is very un-Kubrick (=interesting). It's very Gattaca-like (=dull).The whole "what makes us human" issue is better covered in Pinochio, The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy and STTNG.If you didn't see it in the theaters, I recommend you rent it.

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this film but found it difficult to enjoy for any long period (which this film has aplenty). As other reviewers on this site have made it is split into three acts (or four if you count what I considered a prologue) and each had its own good and bad points which I will try to review without spoilers. The prologue sets the scene - fair enough, can't complain there. The first act is a bit wishy-washy as HJO's robot character is intergrated into his 'new family'. You can't help but see Spielbergs E.T. element in this act as it tries to range from emotional to humourous in small outbursts. Some bits did make me chuckle but probably because the rest of it was so dreary. You keep looking at the length of the filming thinking 'I hope this gets better'. Had it not been for Teddy I may have fallen asleep (you'll see who he is when you watch it). The second act is David's daring (?) and dangerous (??) trek to escape the clutches of those who want to break him into little pieces and with the help of Jude Law, search for the answer to turn him into a real boy. A weird mix of a Pinochio story line, a poor copy of a Blade Runner back-drop and just about every other sci-fi film you've ever seen. The special effects are superb in this bit and Mr Law gets a chance to shine but once more the storyline lets it down. David becomes so annoying with his obsessive search for the blue fairy you begin to think that the flesh fair had a point. And then without warning or even managing to round off the second act properly we are thrust (courtesy of a notice '2000 years later') into act three. Simply a poor attempt to remake the mastery of the final scenes of 2001 A Space Odessy - and Odd it is. I don't know the full history but if this is the bit that Spielberg finished for Kubrick then it shows. If this was done by Kubrick then I expect better. It leaves you with the same 'whats going on' feeling as 2001 only not in such a good way. I find this bit hard to describe and can only summarise with '?'. To recap the film:- Storyline - Good idea but poorly delivered 4/10 Script - Average but annoying in places 5/10 Acting - HJO and Jude did the best they could 8/10 Music - Effective and unobtrusive 8/10 Effects - Impressive but seen better 8/10 Teddy - 10/10 Length - Tooooo long 3/10 Overall - 6/10. Saved by the effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What were they thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Hollywood mess with lots of special effect and imagery in lieu of a good story or a story that goes somewhere for that matter. All through the movie I kept seeing scenes from other movies. It was kind of like a term paper, other people's stuff, just arranged a little differently. There is one scene in the first half where a trash truck pull up and dumps a load of broken robot components and other robots appeared and began sifting through it for things they could use, like a new jaw or eye or whatever. I was so convenient they just snapped on, completely interchangeable. Then comes a strange ship and then motorcycles with dogs faces and round up the robots (in one case using nets), I felt like it was ripped right out of the planet of the apes. I don't expect movies to be completely believable but from beginning to end it was filled with things that just wouldn't happen, future or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is going to be a bad revue!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I get started on this review I want to let you know that I have to reveal some of the plot. PLEASE READ NO FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE THE PLOT REVEALED!!This movie really disapointed me, I expected so much more from Steven Spielberg. The premise of the movie as explained in the beginning is that they have created an android child that can love and be loved and as a real child. There will be no discernable difference between a real child and the android. Except that the android never gets any older, does not eat, and sinks to bottom of a pool and survives because he does not have to breathe.In order for this movie to work you have to believe that the android child is real, just like his new parents have to believe that he is real in order to feel like real parents. Now when Monica ( his mother ) follows the instructions for the imprint my heart broke and I had tears streaming down my face. I really believed, I wanted to, it worked. Then the problems started, when the family ate he ate air mimicking their motions. How is anyone supposed to forget that their son is an android when he eats air every day. The one time he puts food in his mouth, his face melts. I think that alone would stick with you for ever, you would never be able to forget that the child was an android.The movie ultimately fails because you can not forget that the android is an android and not a boy who loves and inspires love. I don't think that Spielberg set out to make a movie about a technology that failed I think he set out to make a movie that would make you believe that the android was a real boy. He failed in this, although the movie was incredible to look at and there were moments of incredible emotional weight.The movie Bicentenial man suffers many of the same problems, you would think that Spielberg would have learned from the mistakes of another movie with ideas that were so similar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small boy robot tries a little too hard to earn the love of a human "mother". Although all the performances in this film are stellar, the essential story premise is hard to take. A dying mankind creates a race of robots to "love" and serve man--but man cannot love the robots in return. The special effects are stunning and powerful, but the story flags in comparison to the (1985) film "D.A.R.Y.L" (In that movie, at least the robot boy is befriended by a human boy). The young robot David in A.I. is only barely competent in the challenges of his world. Can you imagine the robot in the movie "Short Circuit" spending 2,000 years at the bottom of the ocean talking to a lifeless statue? ("Johnny Five is alive, man!") It does not compute. Also, this movie never had a good chance of being a family film because it is never really kind to the robot boy David. The Professor should have had a back up plan-- a "Mommy" robot. Then the robots could have spent their existence in constant communication--("I love you Mommy-bot," and, "I love you David-bot") in more perfect mimicry of human existence (while they watched old reruns of Robocop)...</fullReview>

It's pretty easy to tell where kubrick ends and spielberg begins. I personally loved this movie. Haley joel osment is one of the finest child actors i've seen in a long time. And jude law is also excellent. The movie challenges your beliefs about the meaning of life and makes you think about concepts like the spirit and love in general. Lots of people don't like this movie cuz of some loose ends and others think it poorly depicts kubrick's vision. That might be true, but it's a really well-made movie, nonetheless, that is entertaining and opens your imagination. Give it a chance... you won't be disappointed.

Unfortunately, AI is there to prove you wrong.Hopelessly naive armchair philosophy about what it means to be "real" is made even less palatable by the irritating performances of Haley Joel thingy and the actress who played his mother. The script is average at best, but the special effects are very good.There was potential for a great movie here, but it's attempt at profundity is so watered down &amp; clueless that it derails the whole project.Will probably appeal to people with low IQs, however... especially with it's large doses of Hollywood schmalz.</fullReview>

Spielberg applies the more-is-more philosophy of film making to create this visually stunning but off target wandering which pumps effects into the gaping holes where a story should be. An interesting watch for technical and production excellence, "A.I." eventually becomes a boring morass of excess. Rent the video but be prepared to keep the thumb on the fast-forward button.</fullReview>

Given the competence both behind and in front of the camera, it is hard to see how things went so wrong, or how Hollywood with all its test-screenings and feedback, has produced such a jumbled piece of work, which is all the worse for dragging on so long. Just when you think it's hit rock bottom, it finds new depths to sink to. I avoided this for months after hearing so much bad press &amp; word of mouth, but even so I was astounded at how BAD it really was.

		<shortDescription>A Spielberg/Kubrick classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that I find spectacular about this movie is the directing, and the acting between Haley and Law. The reason why this movie is a combination of Spielberg and Kubrick is it's humor and it's message about the dark and stupid side of the human race. I'll tell you some parts about the movie that make me feel this way. Remember that scene with Jude Law when he's dancing around and the scene when he tells this woman "Once you have a Meca inside of you, you will never want a real man again". Or the scene when his mom is about to die and Haley starts to cry. Steven is showing us that Haley has become human again after 2,000 years because Mecas can't cry. And if Haley's become human that means he's the one human left alive because the Human race was destroyed. Spielberg loves the Human race unlike Kubrick. This particular scene is a Spielberg idea.Now here's the Darkside of the movie. Remember little evil Martin and the evil dad who wanted to get rid of Haley, or when Law told Haley that the world changed and made everything worse starting with Manhattan, or when Mecas where being hunted and destroyed by Humans, and the aliens roamed a frozen Earth; all this was Kubrick's brilliant idea for the Human race.I don't want to offend, but anyone who thinks or says that those aliens in the movie were evolved Mecas are just plain ignorant. Spielberg tells you what they are (aliens) right there in a scene when one of the aliens actually tells Haley where, why, and what's, their purpose for coming to Earth. This is one of the best classical movies ever made in the 21st century and in the last 50 years. And it's not as sad an ending as you might think. I know people may not get it, but what's not to get. The message is right there in front of you. Spielberg and Kubrick are telling us to slow down on our evolvement because if we create a being using Artificial Intelligence then maybe it will think bad thoughts and may become like a dictator and start a revolution against us, or maybe the Human race will become enraged and start a Meca Holocaust like in the Movie. Who knows what will happen.I hope whoever reads this comment will see the movie and remember to bring you're tissues and anti-depressants. I give it a 15 out of 10. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched this film you can't help but feel a touch sympathetic towards both Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Wonderful filmmakers as they were/are I have the feeling that this picture could have been so much better if they had done on their own and not combined their talents. It is impossible not to be impressed by this film however. Visually the effects are second to none but this alone is not enough to sustain one's enjoyment for 2 and a half hours. There are too many bits which drag on whilst skipping over ideas which would benefit from further exploration: the development of David's relationship with Monica for example. I'm sure a good 3/4 of an hour of this film could have been left on the cutting room floor. That said, Haley Joel Osment pull off a mesmeric performance once again and Gigolo Joe's a good laugh. I'm sure this film will be a huge success on video because people will be able to skip all the soft-focus moments which seem to drag on forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third futuristic HORROR movie I've seen recently (cf. ANTI-TRUST, GATICA, the latter on video), and positively the most horrifying of all. It's quite clear the collective unconscious of the species foresees control, cataclysm and hatred, but this film was positively heartbreaking at points, and sheer nightmare elsewhere. Only towards the end of the film does it start to look a bit like Stephen Spielberg had anything to do with it. The story is of quality, just hopefully not anything to do with the future -- at all !!! "Darkening despair", "desolation", and "depravity" all come to mind.Haley Joel Osment once again stuns us with his ability to interpret abstract and obscure roles (cf. PAY IT FORWARD, SIXTH SENSE), and Jude Law could also end-up on award rolls again -- a fantastic performance by him, rivaling the best of anything he's yet done. But were it not for the Bear (go and see the film to find out what I mean... but see my note below), this film would have been too much to handle and I would have walked out.For the characters, the ending, and the Bear, rating is 4 stars (on 5). For this depiction of humanity viz. future, rating = minus 10. WARNING (my opinion only): DO NOT go and see this film if you are depressed, worried, or anxious... = Old Rose's disclaimer...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am one of those people who tend to think of Steven Spielberg as being a bit overrated. I am also someone who is not very familiar with Stanley Kubrick's films, and I know that is my loss. Perhaps because I haven't seen too many Kubrick films (although 'Clockwork Orange I clocked on its original release)I rather liked the combination of ideas, fusing dark material with family fare. I have criticised the 5-tier censorship ratings for a long time but I was left at a loss after seeing 'AI' as to what certificate it should have been awarded. At times it does seem like a Disney movie yet there are some quite sombre moments, which probably do justify the '12' rating.If anything I would have given it an old 'AA' rating (14+) but that system went years ago. In my own ratings system, I give 'AI' 8 out of 10, making it the second best film I have seen this year. I never used to go for sci-fi but I liked everything about this movie - except, that is, for Jude Law, who I cannot tolerate, for some reason. His character should either have been developed, or not introduced. I don't know why I can't stand him. He also ruined 'Enemy at the Gates' for me. His accent never seems to change! Funny, though, as I never had a problem with Rachel Weisz's similar accent! In spite of him ( and I'm sure I'm in a minority of one) 'AI' is a great film. I knew very little about the movie beforehand, nor did I know how long it was. I thought that the 2hours+ flew by, and, unlike some other comments I have read, did not find it slow-going at first at all. Haley Joel Osment is an incredible talent. This performance exceeds even that in the 'Sixth Sense'. Perhaps Spielberg should make a permanent return to writing his own screenplays as this one was practically faultless. Perhaps I have under-rated him in the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me put it this way.People dont seem to understand that not everything in a movie needs to be explained. It just happens and thats it. It depends of the story. In this movie we experience a lot of plot turns and twists that doesnt need to be explained, because it is a fairy tale.Do you imagine what would have been if we read Peter Pan and it explained that he never grew up because he had some kind of a gland syndrome that didnt allow him to grow, etc. etc.?No, because it will ruin the whole point of the fairy tale. Who would want to know all that technical and irrelevant stuff?Thats what A.I.s about. It is a robots fairy tale. And what better to a NON-human being that feels emotions that to compare him with Pinochio? It is the best point of view.Its all about imagination. Child imagination. Filled with colors, figures, buildings, seas and skies, people and animals, to do things that you cannot normally do like to fly high and to breath beneath the water.Its all about the basic emotions that we learn when we are children, loving and hating, missing and meeting...And it is all about searching for hidden treasures, great wizards, sky cities, and the best ones of all, searching for wishes.I dint care about the length. For me it was just perfect, it gives you just what you need to know. Nothing more, nothing less.When you think that it is going to finish you just want it to keep going and the beautiful thing is that it keeps going!I was thrilled with its visual accomplishments, and the astounding performances. And I was just pleased by the plot. Simple, going like a leaf in the wind. Pure poetry.And I didnt care about Kubrick. I love his films, but I simply accepted the fact that hes gone, and I think Spielberg didnt filled anybodys shoes, he just did what he liked to, and that is visual emotions,the purest and most simple ones. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>after a promising start the film goes badly off the rails and makes little sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a turkey. No, seriously - save it for Thanksgiving.The film starts really well and is something of a cross between Pinnochio, Robocop and DARYL (1985)! The way in which the robot moves to showing human emotion is really nicely done and neatly moves onto the main theme of the film - David's struggle between that part of him which is robot and the part that is human. Haley Joel Osment does a good job here and shows more acting ability than many of the humans - though I'd recommend 'Pay it Forward' as a script worthy of his talents.This film had promise and looked like becoming a family-friendly thought provoker.All of a sudden though, in Act II, somebody completely lost the plot and we were bizarrely transformed into a vision of the future that was like a cross between Blade Runner and Super Mario Brothers. In trying to be an adult movie but aiming at a PG certificate, the film goes downhill very badly and you feel as if you have changed channels to watch something different from the opening section. It just didn't work.Act III just gets plain weird. If I wrote the plot the reader wouldn't believe it - the film gets really ludicrous. In going for a novel (yet family oriented) view of the future we get something more akin to 'Flight of the Navigator' crossed with '2001' crossed with heartwarming, fuzzy sentiment.Conclusion: after a promising start the film goes badly off the rails and makes little sense. It is not, as some suppose a new fairy tale - it would probably give young children I know nightmares!! It is, however either a kids movie that hopes for an adult audience or vice versa, with a rehash of many ideas that have been far better set out before (e.g. Robocop, Blade Runner).2/10, though could have been 8 or 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant ideas, lightly brushed over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the ideas and themes were in place, and the emotional potential was there but Speilberg is a great film maker, not a deep thinker. So it all goes to waste. A slow start followed by an engaging 40 minutes then it's all downhill (a seemingly long time) to the end. Great concepts and ideas are presented and then dealt with a superfical, I would even say shallow, way by Speilberg. Perhaps being so brilliantly talented and successful has left him too sheltered in his life and unable to draw on the emotion really needed to pull this off. As for the cast Haley-Joel does okay, Jude excellent but Teddy steals every scene. Teddy represents everything that is good about Speilberg while the light dusting over the moral issues and one-sided presentation of good and evil is all that is bad about Speilberg. Possible SPOILERSThe movie can be quite jarring in it's scene transitions but I viewed this as a good thing and it helped hold my interest when it was beginning to wander. But the sudden appearance of the arena scene with cheesy motorbikes complete with dog heads really took me out of the movie. A lot of this scene seems incomplete, out of place or too in-your-face, often all at the same time! I guess in this respect he did some justice to Kubrik's style. The not too subtle American imagery (stars and stripes everywhere), the south style accents, the ridiculous arena set-up looking more 'Running Man' or 'Escape from New York' than something conceptulized in 2001.As for the ending - I never used to believe people who would say a voice over is a lazy or convenient way to explain exposition and move a story forward because I'd seen so many good uses of it. But this film proved that it can be a very misused device.Although I doubt it's true, it really felt at times Speilberg was on autopilot, ripping bits from his other films. The opening scene felt so much like the obvious exposition it was and reminded me of Sam Neil at the dig in Jurassic Park (complete with over-acting extras in the background), other parts were remeniscent of Close Encounters, Empire of the Sun, and especially E.T.To me this is one of Spielbergs worst to date. A brilliant idea in the hands of a brilliant director but I feel Spielberg's view of the world and the nuclear family just aren't just aren't those of the common person. The questions raised where brilliant, the answers offered up for for thought... were weak.</fullReview>

Teddy, David's Jiminy Cricket, was the only character that used it's face and body to express any emotion.You could have flown a 767 through the plot holes in this movie - did David's manufacturers just *forget* that they were doing a product trial? How come it was easy to steal a police car and fly across America? Why did the flesh show just let them walk away? Why did the crowd turn so violently anyway?I went into this expecting a fun film with a poor treatment of AI. I knew from the previews that it would confuse 'realistic appearance' with 'realistic intelligence'. Instead I got a saccharine "ET meets Pinocchio" so full of cliches I hardly stopped wincing - and absolutely NO discussion of artificial intelligence! Of course, the laughable treatment of AI was partly due to the story's origins in the 60s, but we've seen Kubrik get this spot-on in 2001 and 2010.If you're really interested in AI, go read Douglass Hoffstadters "Goedel, Escher Bach". Otherwise, I would recommend this film only if you have the brain of a retarded duck and some kind of addiction to popcorn.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly, I was not terribly impressed. *** SPOILERS ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this film, a fellow movie buff commented that the movie felt distinctly split, that you could feel where Kubrick died and Spielberg came in.Having just seen it, I agree.Kubrick and Spielberg may have been telephone buddies, but I think Ridley Scott would have been a much better choice for finishing the film. I could feel Spielberg trying to slap a happy ending on the film and it just didn't fit.I was VERY disappointed in the 'amphibicopter'. Submarines and helicopters are opposite ends of the pressure scale for the environments in which they operate. I just don't buy a helicopter being able to go deep underwater for long periods of time, it went well beyond the breaking point of my willing suspension of disbelief. That thing should have started leaking and filling with water as soon as it got more than ten feet underwater, and judging by how much of Manhattan was underwater, it was a heck of a lot further down than that.I also have a goof gripe: "David" breaks when he eats spinich, shortly thereafter you see him fall into the swimming pool and sink to the bottom. If I recall correctly, you see his mouth open while underwater.I don't buy it. If spinich breaks him, he obviously isn't sealed internally. He should have blown apart underwater from massive short circuits. I don't understand why a robot designed to be a surrogate family member couldn't be designed to eat, as family meals are an important social function to such bonding. If they can address this in Westworld all those years ago, why couldn't the engineers in the movie add a 20 second blurb showing that David is sealed? They couldn't because then you don't have the touching scene of David holding Mommy's hand while the technicians clean out the spinich remains from his guts. He should have been demonstrated as sealed and then hit by a car or something. I guess they felt needed the 'sibling rivalry' thing that lead up to his eating the spinich.To me, this rates right up there with Jeff Goldblum uploading a virus into an alien spaceship from an Apple Powerbook.I was terribly disappointed in this film, I think the only thing that could have saved it for me is if Kubrick had lived to see it through to the end. I only paid $1.75 to see it on the big screen, I'm very thankful I did not pay more to see it during the initial release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's `Absolutely Intolerable' Legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you consider AI to be a Kubrick movie or a Spielberg movie, or some combination of the two, you must remember that both are capable of directing seriously flawed movies. (Look no further than `Full Metal Jacket' or `The Color Purple'. Though both directors are capable of greatness, any collaboration between the two ? especially posthumous ? was always going to be a hit or miss affair.It doesn't take a genius (or a computer) to see that A.I. is much worse than seriously flawed ? it is a very bad movie. Not the worst movie that I have ever seen, but any student of truly dreadful cinema will be putting this on their `must see' list ? or should that be their `must not see' list. It is significantly worse than `Battlefield Earth' which is rated 100 in IMDB's 100 worst movies of all time. I was left pondering what AI stood for and then it came to me: Absolutely Intolerable.David `At least my character's name wasn't Adam' Swinton was supposed to blur the distinction between human and robot, but his acting was so mechanical we were left in no doubt that he was man's creation. Professor Allen Hobby was a plot device not a character. How awful can a film be if the greatest praise it receives is `I liked the Teddy Bear.'This is the movie that should have been called `Pinnochio 2001'. This movie did not `draw on many influences' it was completely derivative. Drawing on the worst excesses of Mad Max; The Wizard of Oz; A Clockwork Orange and of course Pinnochio.The plot was rambling, and uninteresting, with characters with whom one could not understand let alone empathize. When IMDB calls out, as a memorable quote, David saying: `I like your floor' one is left wondering if that was because there was paint drying on it.There were at least three opportunities that AI had to end, and, without mercy, it capitalized on none of them. When the credits had failed to appear for the third time, I sank six inches further into my chair in the vain hope that I would be spirited away. Instead I endured yet more plot devices that had no point except to get the audience to feel sorry for a robot that behaved throughout the movie like a robot.In conclusion, I only wish that the movie's name was UD so that I could claim it stood for `Unutterable Drivel.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film condemns current attitudes towards children &amp; others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please note that in my commentary, I do criticize the ENDING of the movie, as well as at least one crucial point in the plot. If you plan to see it, you may not want to read my observations beyond the next paragraph at this time.I recently saw A.I., and although I could never claim it as my favourite movie, I do believe that it should be appreciated for the significant morality play that it is. The friend who accompanied me to the movie said that he was somewhat disappointed because he had expected an adventure-type movie similar to D.A.R.Y.L., and found instead a far darker film than he was prepared for. Many viewers apparently found it's social commentary to be outrageous. Others merely found it all unsettling. And some, like myself, allowed this film to challenge their view of our world, how we treat people, and more specifically, how we treat children. And that is what A.I. is really about.This film is rich in imagery drawn from our own mythic stories. Obvious ones, like Pinnocchio (throughout the movie) and The Wizard of Oz (in the persons of the Dr. Know projection and Professor Hobby controlling him from behind the scenes), and even drawing on Frankenstein--at the end of which the misunderstood, hated and hunted monster, with whom the reader was intended to sympathize, was left encased in ice.I find it both ironic and sad that so many of the people who saw this movie fail to understand that we already are the mob gathered at the Flesh Fare--tune in an episode of Jerry Springer and then tell me that his audience isn't there to watch people's lives torn apart? Not to mention the accompanying physical violence! And while there may in some instances be excellent reasons for parents and their children to part company, it's no longer even notable in our society when parents merely discard "difficult" children like toys that have become tiresome. The human boy Martin, for all of his obnoxiousness, at least was consistent from the beginning in treating David as he would any other Mecha. On the other hand, Monica, David's human "mother", had no excuse for allowing David to believe that she would always love him and care for him, only to be abandoned by her when he became an inconvenience. Even David's creator, while reassuring him that he was indeed special and unique, was simultaneously engaged in the hypocrisy of prostituting the image of his own dead son for the sake of scientific hubris, or perhaps merely for money.In the course of watching the film, I found it actually distracting to think how difficult these roles must have been to fill for any actor, and I can only be astonished at the breadth of talent shown by Haley Joel Osment, who had to be everything from stoic android to terrified child.Which leaves only to tell what I didn't like about this film. I found it to be a bit too unreal and flat, in terms of some of the characters' behaviours. Monica could have insisted that her family work out its problems with David. Failing that, she could have kept him, but away from Henry and Martin. After all, David only bonded with Monica. So we sacrifice realism for artistic license in telling the story. Nothing new there, but I found this unreality too noticeable, and this in turn interfered with my ability as a viewer to suspend disbelief.I also felt that the film should have ended at the bottom of the sea, with David encased in ice, his Blue Fairy almost within reach, but eternally unreachable. There seemed to me no point in the awkward ending presented to us after this event. We all grow up and, one way or another, we lose our parents. That's real life, but apparently that's also not good enough for Hollywood. Giving David his day with Monica seemed only to serve to provide the requisite "Hollywood Ending", or perhaps a macabre facsimile of same; the Blue Fairy dead and in pieces; Monica alive for one day, not for her own sake, but living as a kind of automaton in her turn, to serve David's need of her. The filmmakers may believe that they were sparing the public's sensibilities by not killing David at the bottom of the sea, but in fact they created a more horrific ending--the prospect of eternity without the mother he loved, and perhaps without ever having another human companion for more than a day. Brilliant as both Kubrick and Spielberg are, I just didn't feel that this twisted version of the Hollywood "happy ending" was deliberate.I will see this film again, as I suspect that subsequent viewings will enhance my appreciation of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film of Genius and Heartbreak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was talked into seeing it a second time. I'm glad now. It was the only way to appreciate Spielberg's genius and to realize this may have been one of the greatest films ever made.But I was not at all moved to see it again when I first left the theater. Some weeks before, the reason I attended a screening for the first time was -- shame on me -- a reaction to the hype. I was motivated more by the glitter of names (Kubrick and Spielberg, Haley Joel Osment) than by a reasonable expectation of the artistic merits. I came away from the theater with a mixture of confusion and disappointment; there'd been no "Close Encounters" awe, no "Raiders" excitement, and the message Spielberg (and his mentor and guide Kubrick) imparted was of such profound complexity that it made my brain hurt. I wasn't in the mood that night for thinking too hard. I was expecting "E.T. meets A Clockwork Orange," and what Spielberg gave us was something entirely different (though with some reference to past works). So I walked away from the theater and thought, "What a letdown."I was wrong. I was *so* wrong after seeing this film a second time that I was moved to write to this user comments board. Someone whose opinion I respect convinced me to go back to the theater for "a second look." I balked, then finally relented, and I was stunned by my lack of understanding and appreciation the first time around. This film is beautiful, haunting, deeply moving and, at the end, ultimately heartbreaking.Spielberg takes us by the hand and invites us to look at some excrutiatingly painful issues, as searing as an ember to the heart. He does not do this out of his own amusement; he does it because he is aware of the pace our technology is taking us. He knows that given the rapidity with which computers are growing in abilities, it is only a matter of time that computers will one day be indistinguishable from humans. In answer to the question, "When will you know when talking to a computer whether it has become the equal of a human," the reply from, I believe, Ray Bradbury was, "When you can't tell the difference." It may be another century, but I believe a boy-robot David will be manufacturable.Which leads to the most painful issue of all, and which was raised by a character in the film itself: If we can program a computer to love us, what responsibility does that place upon we humans, who have created it, to the computer? Is love within our human brains simply a matter of an arrangement of chemicals, much as the software we would implant into a boy-robot's computer brain? Is there a difference? If David can love, if he can feel emotion and think in the abstract, does he have a soul? Do we then treat him as a human? Should we then allow ourselves to love him back, without a second thought, the way we would love a person?Each moviegoer must arrive at his or her own conclusion, and it is my firm belief that no one will arrive at an answer which will satisfy. That may be the film's greatest undoing as a commercial product, because of the dissatisfaction of the audience in not having a neatly wrapped ending or pat answers. Word of mouth is powerful, and no doubt the word has already gone out about "A.I.": no neatly wrapped ending, no satisfactory answers. Regrettably, that has translated into lower ticket sales for an astoundingly well-made film.And what were *my* conclusions about David and his programmed love? I mentioned earlier that the film was ultimately heartbreaking. [CAUTION: SPOILER FOLLOWS] When David is faced at the very end of the film with only a day-long revisit with his long-dead mother, who in truth is only a DNA-fabricated clone, he knows -- and we know -- that his happiness will be only momentary, and that for the rest of his existence, which may literally be eternal, he will be alone. His only escape from loneliness will be to journey, as the voice-over said, to the place "where dreams are born." But a dream, or a memory, is no substitute for a mother's actual loving hug. *My* conclusions? David should never have been created in the first place. It is the ultimate in human hubris to create a machine to love us when we know it will only be denied happiness at the end of human life and for eternity. Spielberg's message, loudly and clearly, is this: Beware of what you wish for through technology, for you may surely have it. And it may be a grievous sin upon the innocent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. is for the intelligent moviegoer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I.? Artificial Intelligence (2001) Warner Bros. / DreamWorks Pictures Starring: Haley Joel Osment, William Hurt, Sam Robards, and Jude Law. Music by: John Williams Directed by: Steven Spielberg It is confirmed. Steven Spielberg is to movies, as to butter is to popcorn. With Steven Spielberg's new science-fiction drama, A.I., not only does he outdo himself, but delivers the audience on an emotional and fantastic ride that propels the heart and imagination of moviegoers everywhere. Let it be known now, not everyone will enjoy this film. It is strictly for the moviegoer who appreciates cinema and completely lets their emotions be guided by Spielberg's craftsmanship. A.I. is in effect a journey of discovery of some sorts. The absolutely fantastic Haley Joel Osment personifies the boy next door as David; except he is not. He is the world's first robot boy programmed to love humans. Set in the future, this tale can be loosely associated with the classic ?Pinocchio', yet the movie makes no secret of using that story to guide David's journey to achieve his ultimate goal ? to become a real boy. As for plot details, my words cannot justly describe this incredible movie-going experience. It is enough to say that I was losing faith in Spielberg's vision as a filmmaker, but after experiencing this incredibly well done and simply mind-blowing film ? this is what every movie should be like. Thought-provoking and gripping, the kind of film that will be studied in film schools in years to come. As aforementioned though, it is imperative to understand that a majority of people will not enjoy this film, this film is quite revolutionary in terms of what it brings its audiences members to digest. (See the film ? you will know what I mean). Yet, in order to fully understand the heartache that this robot boy endures, it is essential that time is overlapped, hearts are broken, and exaggerations are conceived as nothing but possibilities. Notable mentions go to Jude Law for his astounding performance as ?Gigolo Joe' a male robot lover who joins David ( Haley Joel Osment) on his journey onto becoming a real boy. Law's body language is just enough to satisfy his performance, forget his acting. He brings his character to life with an ?over the top' performance in terms of his originality when it comes to his body language that conveys the notion that he is indeed a robot. Many elements in the film are absolutely incredible and add to the ingenuity of this film. The lighting is superb, John Williams's score is an absolute score of bravura to capture the tonality of this film, and perhaps the film's greatest quality can be seen when our characters descend upon Rouge City ? a city straight out of Stanley Kubrick's mind. Kubrick did produce a large part of the film and was involved intensely with the pre-production, unfortunately he died before the film started to shoot but is clearly associated with this film. Perhaps one minor flaw in this film would be the disappearing of characters within this film. Spielberg introduces us to a wide array of characters that seem to have all their own stories to tell, unfortunately, they come and go with no closure. Yet, it is evident that they are all forms of motivation to guide young robot David on his quest to become a real boy. Throughout this journey, Kubrick's presence is felt and appreciated, as Spielberg crafts an extremely engaging and endearing motion picture that will require a second viewing simply to take all that was delivered to the audience. Many themes Kubrick had in his films are effervescently displayed in this film, especially his fascination with sexuality. Rouge City is full of phallic references and it can be clearly seen that sex is a prerequisite for life in that disparaging city. Yet, we must not get away from the fact that A.I. is perhaps the greatest film of the year to date that should definitely be seen at the theatre. The sets are incredible, the acting simply adds to the tone of the film, and never before have we as audience members been brought on such an emotionally disturbing, yet fulfilling journey than after experiencing this film. Giancarlo's Rating: ***1/2(out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Years ago, while reviewing a piece of crud called "The Adventurers," Pauline Kael noted that we had reached a point in the art of filmmaking where even idiotic stories were presented in exquisite bindings. I thought of this while watching "A.I." Spielberg's mastery of film technique is breathtaking. And he must be engaged by "big" ideas, or why would he bother? Yet he seems incapable of sustaining a coherent argument around the critical issues he raises in A.I., and the result is a big, beautiful, sloppy, mind-numbing mess. I couldn't bring myself to walk out on so serious and sincere an effort, but Lord how I prayed for it to end.BTW, did anyone else notice Jude Law's homage to "Clockwork Orange?" via Gene Kelly? It was the only moment in the film I truly enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. is a brilliant collaboration between 2 master filmmakers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I saw the new Steven Spielberg movie of the Stanley Kubrick project, "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence". I very highly recommend it, even for those who don't usually watch sci-fi. Catch it soon though, as it was a critical success but unfortunately has failed to light up a huge fire in the box-office. It will make about $200 million worldwide, I understand, so it be profitable, but hardly a blockbuster in terms of commercial success. "A.I." is a bittersweet film, and it is just too dark in tone for mainstream audiences. I do think it was marketed too much as a kind of family film, and it is certainly not a kid's film (not unless the kid's last name is de Sade, and he enjoys watching sentient beings being wantonly destroyed)."A.I." contains a marvelous performance by Haley Joel Osment (the Oscar-nominated kid from "The Sixth Sense") as 'David', the first child robot. He is the first of his 'mecha' kind created as a replica of a child, and the first programmed to actually feel love. He is a test prototype for a new line of robots intended for childless couples in a resource-short world where human births are strictly limited. The intent is that the humans, or ?orgas', will have the emotional benefit of a parental relationship that they desperately yearn for, and which they might otherwise never be able to fulfill. David is an altogether new kind of robot intelligence. When the robot child is ?imprinted' on the parent, he will feel genuine unconditional love and devotion for that parent. The question is...will the human parents learn to love him back?The movie also stars Jude Law as a sex 'mecha', Gigilo Joe, created to satisfy human's sexual needs without human entanglements. Law's robotic Lothario is right on key, in a memorable portrayal balancing drama, humor, eroticism, and scariness as well ("In the end, all that will be left---is US."). He is a good counterpoint to Haley Joel Osment's David, who increasingly shows emotional reactions and basis of thinking as his experiences bring him ever closer to being ?human', due to his emotional capability. That is the point. Emotions are something Joe can mimic---after all, he is a love mecha---but not actually feel. In the end, however, he does display a kind of intellectual caring for David based on altruism and their shared experiences. Close association with David has ?changed' or ?reprogrammed' Joe to some extent.I would not at all be surprised to see Oscar nominations for both these fine actors. Osment betters his Oscar-nominated performance in "The Sixth Sense", and having seen Law's first rate job in "Enemy at the Gates', I will be watching for more of his films as well.It is, I suppose, too much to hope for Oscars for best picture and director for this masterpiece of film- making as well, Hollywood being Hollywood, and as jealously anti-Spielbergian as it is. In my opinion it most certainly rates the honor of Best Picture, and Best Director. Of course, I was one of the dimwits who made the aesthetic mistake of thinking Hollywood would recognize "Saving Private Ryan" as Best Picture, instead of that momentous, wonderful, clearly superior classic for the ages, whatchacallitnow, hmm,...oh yes, the title went something like "Something about Shakespeare", "Loving the Bard", "I Love William", "Revenge of the Bard II", well, you get the idea...As what will be a lasting example of fine film art, "A.I." touches the audience where it counts most. It engages us both in our emotions and in the ideas it presents as it portrays David's urgent search for acceptance, and for the return of the love he feels. One of the reasons the film works as well as it does is that Steven Spielberg is tapping into a common wellspring present in all our lives. We all have the exact same yearnings for love and approval as David does, no matter how we may try to paper over disappointments and misunderstandings as life's circumstances mount. The film is speaking to all of us about all of us. Now, we all know Spielberg can manipulate the feelings of an audience---any good director does this, as Hitchcock did in 'Psycho' and 'The Birds'. He does it here as well. In all due credit to Spielberg's direction and to Osment's execution of the role, David starts off as what is palpably a machine in the beginning, and by the end of the film many in the audience are moved to the point of tears. Over the fate of a machine. Or...at the end...is David really just a machine---or is he a ?real' boy?What I also like in this film is that it presents a feast for the mind as well as the emotions. It is many layered, and refers back to fairy tales, mythology, other films, and to religion as well. You may find yourself reflecting on the nature of what 'self', 'life', ?free will', and the relationship between Creator and created might be, or should be. The more you dig into it, the more there is to find. You definitely have to bring something to the party on this one, folks, and pay attention. If you are brain-dead or an emotional tightwad, go spend your 8 bucks on "The Fast and the Furious", or "American Pie 2", or some such drivel instead.There is a powerful scene in the movie which was almost as heartrending as the one in 1982's "Sophie's Choice", starring Meryl Streep. Movie fans will know what I am talking about from that film. The rest of you, shame on you, go see it and find out. The somewhat similar scene in "A.I", is where David's human mother, Monica, abandons him in the woods to keep him from being returned to the manufacturer and destroyed. It caused me to squirm and draw back in my seat, claw at the armrests, and half avert my body from the screen. I am not a particularly squeamish guy, but I almost couldn't watch it. No parent with an ounce of love for their child can watch that sequence and not react to it in some way. This scene between David and Monica (wonderfully played by Frances O'Connor) left me limp. Remember, Spielberg is the same guy that gave us "Jaws". He knows how to reach an audience."A.I." is a difficult movie in some ways, and it does not spoon-feed what is going on to the audience. It is a very visual film. Some movies are not, in that they are just basically photographed scenes. With Spielberg, you are in the hands of an artist. Watch what is being shown to you, as scenes are done the way they are for a purpose. A good example of this is with David's first scene, as he comes out of the elevator. That has relevance to understanding what occurs as the story develops. Also, at the risk of introducing a ?spoiler' to the plot, the tall dudes in the third act are not ET's, as some viewers who were not paying attention have thought.The ending to the story has been controversial, with some saying the last 20 minutes ruins the movie. I disagree strongly. Instead I view it is a fulfillment of what has gone on before. I confess the first time I saw "A.I." I said "Aw, c'mon!", when David finally met up with his ?Blue Fairy'. As the scenes progressed to the conclusion, though, I was very moved. The second time I saw it I absolutely agreed with what Spielberg had done. I don't want to give too much away, so just go and see it. You'll either love it or hate it. And take your brain with you, as you're going to need it. "A.I." is an absolutely brilliant collaboration between two masters. ---MBHart</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Steven Spielberg sci-fi film by way of Stanley Kubrick (or is it the other way around?) I think I would have preferred Kubrick's method for the entire film, instead of the beginning and middle passages. Spielberg resurrects the aliens from "Close Encounters" for the final moments of the film, and although the final scene is quite moving, it pales in comparison to the last few shots of "2001." This movie is beautifully shot and poignant, nevertheless, and in a summer of disappointing, overly hyped big budget films, this is the best bet. And did Spielberg actually use "Once Upon a Time" from "Sleeping Beauty" for a scene near the beginning? An appropriate choice for the scene, but Rollerball (the 1975 original) already used it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A.I." is a Delightful Fairy Tale for this Modern Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Please make me a real boy..." Haley Joel Osment chillingly utters, much akin to the story of "Pinocchio," from which A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE reverberates. A long-time project of Stanley Kubrick and based on a short story by Brian Aldiss, passed onto Steven Spielberg after Kubrick's death, A.I. is ultimately a futuristic fairy tale, masterfully presented by Spielberg.Though critically shunned by some, A.I. is a delight to those who probe deeper into the mists of the film. While some might find the "Pinocchio" references a bit clich, A.I. really is a unique film in it's own rights, and, while it takes on the basic principles of Carlo Collodi's Italian tale of a wooden boy, Steven Spielberg breathes new life into it, forming it into a fairy tale of it's own accord as well.Stanley Kubrick shines through Steven Spielberg's magnificent directing, and every scene echoes with reflections of Kubrick. The ending, in particular, which some people seem to despise, is truly a wonderful collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick, and will have you puzzled and thinking over it for days on end. Furthermore, the last 20-minutes are the very heart and soul of this film, illuminating much and truly defining it as an epic fairy tale for this darkened age.Steven Spielberg does a fabulous job directing this fantastic tale of a robot boy, wishing to become human ? But I foresee that this will quickly become like another of Spielberg's forgotten masterpieces, EMPIRE OF THE SUN. Some might hate it, and I can easily guarantee that a good portion of you who are reading this will hate it as well. The average Joe Popcorn will not be so quick to praise A.I., but those who realize that this film is ultimately a fairy tale for this modern age, able to be bent and formed by it's storyteller (much the same way Empire was told from young Jim's imaginative perspective), will realize A.I. for the masterpiece that it is.Truly, A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is a thinking man's film, and - while I certainly don't mean to discredit the general public's intelligence - it takes a person who is willing to keep their frontal lobes switched to the "On" position to truly understand and enjoy this film. Those who only half-heartedly might only get a so-so delight out of this film, but those willing to challenge and probe each and every scene, and their perception of it, will undoubtedly go through nothing short of a spectacular movie experience that will remain a classic for ages upon end.On a production note, this film is almost flawless -- Brilliant, more than Oscar-worthy acting, headed by the magnificent Haley Joel Osment; Breathtaking cinematography, courtesy of Janusz Kaminski; Magnficent production and art direction (I don't think I'll ever picture New York City the same way ever again) by Rick Carter and also due, in part, to the magic of Industrial Light and Magic; Superb editing by Michael Kahn; And, of course, a truly wonderful and touching score by John Williams... The list goes on. But no review would be complete without mentioning the REAL star of the film - Teddy. This delightful little Supertoy stole every scene he was in, and deserves an honorary Oscar of his own. A near perfect film, and one which will remain in my heart for the rest of my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is basically one of the best films ever made. With the help of superior technology, Steven Spielberg was able to create an artistic masterpiece that is entertaining to watch. All of the acting was excellent, especially by young Haley Joel Osment who done a much better job than he did in "The Sixth Sense." Also John Williams composed one of the best film scores of all time which highlighted the film in a perfect way. I even liked the song! It's just like watching a Stanley Kubrick film (most specifically, "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Eyes Wide Shut").Also the ending was nothing short of spectacular. Spielberg put everything on the line, and he came up with the most brilliant ending imaginable, not to mention it was totally unpredictable (maybe even for psychics); no one could have guessed it, that's why I think a lot of Americans didn't like it; in general we tend to dislike something if we don't expect it.WARNING, DO NOT READ THE FOLLOWING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM YET:They were robots at the end, not aliens. Spielberg said so himself, and you can tell by the tv screen where their faces should be that is showing David's life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AI should stand for Absolutely Insipid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI was EASILY this summer's biggest disappointment and that's saying quite a bit considering this has been a summer of disappointing films (e.g., Pearl Harbor &amp; Jurassic III). It is EASILY this summer's "Unbreakable" -- a film that in the reviews sounds good, but FLOPS when viewed.For the first 45 minutes of this film it was a credible and enjoyable tale about a robot son and a real son and the sibling rivalry that developed between them. However, it plummets to a horrible film from the very moment the mother abandons her robot child in the woods so that "they won't destroy him." Excuse me, but if the premise early on is that the robot boy had bonded with the mother in a way a real child bonds with its mother, wouldn't the abandonment be tantamount to destroying the child? Frankly I was shocked that the robot boy didn't come back and seek vengence for being abandoned; it would not have adversely affected the film -- heck, it couldn't get much worse than it was. But this abysmal plot twist was not even the worst part of the movie. It seemed like Spielberg had no concept of what Kubrick was trying to do with his start and as a result the movie kept ending, but wouldn't end. The entire ending was like watching engine knock on film! It should have ended with the robot boy being returned to William Hurt. If not there, then when the boy was at the bottom of the ocean talking to the Blue Fairy. If not there, then at the very least when the aliens rescued him 2000 years later. If not there (I found myself saying) PLEASE GOD END WITH THE ALIENS BRINGING BACK THE MOTHER! But even THERE the darn thing just wouldn't end!!!All in all, this was a HORRIBLE film. I have already steered all of my friends away from going to see it. If they MUST see a Spielberg film, I tell them to stay home and rent ET for the billionth time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the many comments on this board, I finally decided to voice my opinion. With some effort I could, perhaps, match those before me in depth and eloquence. Allow me to be succinct, though.The movie is a masterpiece.The score was one of John Williams' best to date. The man is a genius.Haley Joel Osment was flawless as David. Honestly, if you don't empathize with his character, you won't like this film. His concentration is amazing. I never missed the subtlety or detail in his emotional expression.Steven Spielberg's direction and vision never ceases to impress me.Jude Law was thoroughly convincing as a passionate Mecha. I have a greater appreciation for his ability.The attention to detail and multi-layered theming shows just how much thought, insight, and emotion went into this story. Kudos, Kubrick.My only lament is that we live in age where a story like this needs to be told. And what I fear worse is that some of us will never understand the message. People often kill the messanger when they don't like the message. That's never changed the truth, though.*Tiny spoiler*My favorite scene is still the Dr.Know booth. There is such profound hope in his voice, as he unviels the truth of David's quest, it left me awe-struck. As long as there is hope, we will survive despite ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Triumph of a Film, Woefully Misunderstood by Many.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw "A.I.," the first thing that I loved about it was that it was not Spielberg. And I love Spielberg. But when a director (and, in this case, writer) can effectively create a film that speaks with another voice--and a decidedly Kubrickian one at that--the end result can be astonishing. And there you have "A.I." Most people I know who disliked the film said it wasn't Spielberg. I would say to them, "You're right. That's why I loved it." After a blank stare or two, I begin to ask them about what they thought of the themes of the film, or the questions posed by it. Then more blank stares. And there's the dividing line: "A.I." is a film by a well-known director who's given moviegoers a film with the feel of a far different (and darker) one. And the stylistic switcheroo very likely caused the points it was making to be lost on the unsuspecting. Whether you love it, hate it, or just don't get it, you've got to give Spielberg credit for even attempting to make the thing. This is a fairy tale, and though fairy tales ultimately do have a message, they are often more about the journey. "A.I." is a fairy tale with an ambiguous message (in the best sense of the word) with a marvelous journey across dreamlike, diverging terrain. It's a classic mindbender with keen insights and big ideas, and the style and storytelling mastery to back them up. By the way: loved the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mad Max meets the Wizard of Oz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though my anticipation of this film was high, my opinion of it definitely is not, it is a disappointing mish-mash of disparate angles and styles. While I do not hesitate to recommend seeing it for the many surprises in the plot and the excellent visual imagery of a distant future, I can not say that it had much to offer in terms of originality. In fact at times it seemed to be nothing more than a grab-bag of characters, scenes and story lines from other films all over the cinematic map, a kind of Mad Max meets the Wizard of Oz, with a few Star Trek style plot contortions thrown in for good measure.If you expected something new from the "what does it mean to be human" angle or a fresh take on the "ethics of playing God", you will not find it. It definitely addresses these questions, they are central to the whole film, but sadly it says absolutely nothing new, it has all been said so many times already.For me, these reasons keep this film well away from the great movies of all time category. It is however still worth the 7.50$ I paid for it. Lower your expectations and I'm sure you will enjoy yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems to be one of those movies...you see it once, and don't really like it, but do, kind of. "Eyes Wide Shut" is my personal example, but let's stop with the Kubrick references here.Any visions of the ghost of Stanley Kubrick ended about thirty minutes into the movie when I realized that the soundtrack would not stop coming-back. It reminded me of a daytime soap-opera: every other scene has some dramatic sweeping music trying to tell me how to feel at that moment. This is Spielberg, right? (ET, Close Encounters, Jaws, etc.)The acting was not convincing...they were just actors on the screen with whom I never related. Maybe it's me, because most reviews thought they were great. Then again, that guy who played the emperor in Gladiator was nominated for an Oscar, so... Jude Law was fantastic, though, I did like him. But, David's family was...couldn't Spielberg have found ANYONE else???******** SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER *********The mechas in the end were pretty weak...ummm...why couldn't they just create a mecha-mom for David??? What's with this one-day-only-then-dying bit?The greatest part was the Super toy bear!

		<fullReview>I'll be honest, I gave this movie a ten, but not because it deserves it. This movie deserves an 8.5, which, I realize, is impossible since we can only give rounded-off numbers for votes. I'm just trying to balance out all those lousy ingrates who gave this movie a 1.A 1? How could you . . .? What . . .? Jude Law alone was worth at least two points. Toss in some amazing special effects and you have another two points. Great cinematography earns another two and then you have the plot, a pleasant mix of psychological introspection and bombastic energy. Then there are the dozens of hidden cameos, a great minor character role from William Hurt and, well, you have a ten.Minus one point for the "huh?" factor, which was high, even for a Stanley Kubrick movie. I don't mind having to watch a movie twice to really understand it but to miss out on entire plot points due to artistic license is a little much. Then minus another half because, well, I looked at my watch. Sorry, that's a half-point deduction. There you are, a solid 8.5. A one.

		<shortDescription>An example of the infinite powers of the imagination.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's "A.I." is an astonishment; a visual and story-telling achievement. It centers on the story of a little robot, made to look, act and feel like a real little boy. He is adopted by a couple who have supposedly lost their own son. A scientist (William Hurt) warns them that if the robot is activated, he will forever love them as if he were real. When his adoptive mother Monica (Frances O'Connor) dumps him in the woods, David (the robot) becomes obsessed with finding the Blue Fairy from "Pinocchio" so she can make him real. Then, he thinks, he'll be able to come home to his new family where he'll be loved. This sets up a long journey in which David and his Teddy join lover robot Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) on a wild adventure.The visuals in this movie are incredible, including a scary Flesh Fair, where robots are demolished by angry humans; an underwater Manhattan and others. But the acting is even more exemplary, with the greatest credit going to young Haley Joel Osment as David. His performance is a delicate balance between robot and human mannerisms. Conveying emotions with a subtlety that is rare for actors his age (13) and playing many difficult scenes with the professionalism of an actor twice his age. He is front and center throughout most of the film. In short he deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. This would be historic, making Osment the second-youngest nominee in this category [and only the second child-actor, period, in a lead role]. Richard Dreyfuss' current record for youngest winner may be in jeopardy (he was 27 when he picked up his prize for "The Goodbye Girl"). Jude Law is also a likely supporting nominee again, after "The Talented Mr. Ripley."Mr. Spielberg may have taken over from Stanley Kubrick but make no mistake: The finished product is a result of the talents of Spielberg and his team, combined with elements of Kubrick's vision. A snub from Oscar would be criminal.My rating: * * * * (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is dark. this movie is frustrating at times. but those are all reason for why this movie is a masterpiece. spielberg's tribute to kubrick is great, although long, it gets all the points across. the most noticeble part of this being a kubrick film and a spielberg film is that the movie is split into two parts. 3/4 of the film is strictly kubrick with its dark characters and even darker scenarios. there is no doubt about it. but somewhere in the last forty minutes it slowly switches over to spielberg's style. By the time you relaise it, the movie is already on a path straight towards the ending. some say the ending was terrible. i say that it was pretty good. obviously unbellieveable, but what else could you possibly do for another ending?overall, this film is a dark masterpiece, and so far from looking at the movies that already came out, and those that are coming out, it is going to sweep the oscars without a doubt. one of the only shoe-in oscars that may not win (and i kick myself for saying it because this man is amazaing) is best director. yes steven spielberg may go home without a directing oscar because this was not only his movie, but kubricks too. he will though, probably win it, but that fact may hurt his chances. i personally hope not.overall: 10/10 *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Eerie and Transcending Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story, if allowed, will naturally leave you drained of emotion and thought. The movie's not perfect but the context and messages take you introspectively into your own heart and mind, into unknown and challenging possibilities of awareness. It causes you to go beyond yourself and takes you on a journey that transcends time, human ability and life as we know it. Anyone that has ever had a personal tragedy that left permanent consequences will be touched deeply by this story. The unfolding and development leaves one gasping for finality of peace with the yearning for an absolute need that one wonders will ever be reconciled. This is a journey not for the faint of heart but rather for those that dare to do go beyond his/her awareness of existence.In the beginning of the movie William Hurt alluded to a question that asked why did God create Adam and Eve? He also, alludes to the answer as being that God created them so that He would have a creation that would love Him (sounding for merely selfish reasons). But the movie tells a story that deliberately contradicts that answer. God created us not only to love Him, but He put in us the need for love. God designed in all of us the need to be loved, and the movie shows us the reality of that truth. Take time to examine the parallels between this story of a man's creation of this robot and God's creation of us. Once you can identify with David then you will know just how fragile life and existence is, compared to our own innate and built in overwhelming need to be loved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Bad Films In One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This schizoid production is a composite of two bad films. The first film is comprised of the first 1/2-hour and the last 1/2-hour. The second film is the middle segment, commencing with Dave's abandonment.The first film is E.T. Redux. The second film is Mad Max Thunderdome.Two of the most commonly committed errors in move-making are: 1) propelling the action by means of characters committing acts that cannot be justified based on previously established character-definitions; and 2) blurring, or losing, the storyline through political-motivated self-indulgence.Unfortunately, this film is the poster boy of Both Errors. First Error. I don't care how artificial Dave is, this Mother WOULD NEVER wake up one day and take him out in the Woods and abandon him. What's up with that? I mean, that's just STUPID. It's indefensible. Second Error. Unfortunately, although Liberals make a great pretense of championing the Common Man, in fact Liberals really hate people and promote big government as the means of controlling them. The "Flesh Fair" makes intelligent movie-goers cringe with its stereotypical cartooning of human nature. In fact, is there a single likable human in either of the movies?One of the things that distinguishes good storytellers from bad ones is the extent to which the characters are NOT cartoons. Spielberg is not a particularly good Storyteller because his characters are rarely allowed to be anything but one-dimensional, cartoonish stereotypes. A.I. is no exception. Contrast A.I. with, say, "The Green Mile." Notice how natural and human the characters in TGM are. If Spielberg had made TGM, ALL the guards would have acted like the Bad Seed, because Spielberg would try to force us to believe that all Criminals Are Good and All Guards are Evil, just as in AI, all the humans are evil, selfish, shallow stereotypes.Opportunity wasted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious, but not entirely successful (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Style is very important to both Kubrick and Spielberg, and it's never clearer here. I'll admit it was hard to imagine a Kubrick/Spielberg collaboration. Spielberg, the warm humanist, Kubrick, the cold observationist (word??), their styles being too distinct to mesh. For example, their view of children. Kubrick gave us Lolita, "Red-rum" boy from the Shining, and two ghosts awash in blood. Spielberg gave us DrewBarrymore, the cute kid in Close Encounters, and the kid stuck in an adult's body, Robin Williams..... I mean Peter Pan. So the approach to David (Haley Joel Osment), at times, seems to be too, well, different. That is one of the films two flaws (they are important and will detract from one's experience, but they also allow for interesting observation). The film has two or three acts, depending on how one views it (I choose three, because it seems so neatly sectioned off). The first act is the acquisition of David by grieving parents (France's O'Connor and Sam Robards). The opening five minutes set up the thematic statement of the film, but it isn't as if you couldn't tell by the tagline. It is written quite well, with the Spielberg sensibility shining through, though there are glimmers of Kubrick. It's only flaw is the underuse of the wonderful O'Connor. It's sunny cinematography is perfect. The second act follows David's search for the Blue Fairy, so he can become a real boy. He meets up with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law, in a frantically funny and manic performance). Kubrick's influence is seen strongly here, with some incredible scenes (The Flesh Fair is a stand-out, jolting with energy and Brendan Gleeson). The third act continues the above search, but I can't describe much more. It is serenely haunting. However, I find it hard to reconcile the two styles in it. For example, there is a scene where David is sitting on a ledge, and then falls (lets himself fall) to the bottom of the ocean. It is supposed to be heartbreaking, but it isn't because the premise of the film inhibits it (an earlier scene in the film had the same problem). The epilogue/conclusion is unearned, but then, some people found it devastating. The film is a technical achievement, to be sure. The art direction, costumes, make-up, sound, cinematography, score, film editing and visual effects are all first rate, and deserve oscar nominations (as it is now). Kahn's editing, Kaminski's cinematography, and Williams' score all deserve mention for working together to aid the Spielberg/Kubrick vision O'Connor and Law are phenomenal. Osment is handed the trickiest role, and pulls it off with aplomb. This role requires amazing depth, breadth, and subtlety to be convincing, and Osment deserves another Oscar nomination for pulling it off. It's a role that cannot be entirely based on 'gut instinct', and it's a tribute to Osment and Spielberg that it is played perfectly. The following is from Lisa Schwarzbaum's review from EW. It sums up my opinion quite well.--There aren't many at all like Spielberg and Kubrick, directors willing to lasso dreams (that's Steven) and nightmares (that's Stanley) or die trying. ''A.I.'' is a clash of the titans, a jumble, an oedipal drama, a carny act. I want to see it again.-- Maddening, moving, provocative, a visual feast, AI is worth seeing, and worth seeing again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. full of holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that I can hardly comment on this without exposing some SPOILERS, but I suggest you read this anyway because I don't recommend even seeing the movie. I have never reviewed a film for IMDB, and this being my first I should mention that I am an intelligent moviegoer, tend for the off-hollywood style of cinema efforts, and general appreciate a good effort and mostly enjoy the movie experience. But I get off here...A.I. is a very bad movie.Where to begin?...The film was entertaining in that it provided good special effects, excellent acting by Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law, and some interesting food for thought in relation to artificial life, artificial emotions, the future of our species, etc. But all this was offset by too many technical problems to completely review here, and an overwhelmingly depressing experience that will ruin the movie for most viewers.SPOILERS APLENTY***** As the movie wore on (and on), I couldn't help notice many unrealistic details that kept ruining the experience for me. Here are a few:1. David (the mecha boy) finally gives in and eats spinach, a mecha no-no, so when the technicians set out to fix him, they dig spinach out of his stomach area. Are you trying to tell me there's an alimentary canal, though not needed, that would transport food to an area that would ruin the mecha? And yet a mecha is water-proof????!!!2. Why did David's father, so convinced of the use of David as a replacement for their son, so quickly turn on the project and dump the responsibility on his wife?3. Why was the imprinting done only on the mother and not the father?4. It was completely unrealistic that the mother would leave David alone in the woods to fend for himself. This was completely out of character. She would have turned him into Cybertronics.5. What on earth was up with the Flesh Fair? That was completely unrealistic. What crowd would gather to see such lame theatrics? And what was that sweet little girl doing in the middle of all that seriously life-threatening activities? Her father seemed responsible, completely contrasted by the bogus madmax-style surroundings. The Flesh Fair scene was terrible! This was the turning point of an otherwise good movie. Here is where the pace changed, and the movie plummeted downhill.6. The whole Blue Fairy plot was weak and distracting. The movie should have either picked a pure Pinocchio take-off or abandoned it all together for something different.7. Skipping ahead, and past a whole hour of implausible details, somehow, David and Joe fly a pretty cool copter over Manhattan, submerged, and find another Cybertronics office. What is this office doing here? I thought they had their headquarters out in the country somewhere? And then...surprise David finds the assembly line and a dozen or so Davids and Darlenes. So why didn't we see the sub-plot of Dr.Hobby's own dead child David developed? We were already treated to this obsession with a lost child with the Swinton's. And then Dr. Hobby leaves David alone in an office, stories above a raging sea, with Joe and the copter in the next room, to do what, GET THE OTHERS, because they'd be so happy to see him. There is no way he would have been left alone at this point. Instead, David IS left alone, then wanders out, sits on a ledge, pushes his body off and into the Atlantic where he sinks to the bottom and sees the blue fairy. After being rescued by Joe (ugh), he takes the same underwater-converted copter to go back down and see the blue fairy. But it is now on Coney Island, way too far from Manhattan to be believable. Give me a break. At this point I wanted to leave the movie theatre.8. Okay, so the margins of the continents have become inundated by the rising sea levels, no problem as this will likely happen in the future, but COME ON, in the movie (as with the prospects of the future) it was not a cataclysmic event, it was gradual, thus, buildings and other structures would have been dismantled, moved inland, etc. At the very least, over hundreds and thousands of years as the sea levels rose, SOMEONE WOULD HAVE MOVED CONEY ISLAND! The statue would have been sitting in some museum in Cincinnati, or Pittsburgh.There seemed to be about 2 or 3 movies all stuck together here, so whatever it was Spielberg was trying to do was lost on me as not being deep, but confusing and shallow. The aliens were interesting in the last act, but the ending was terrible!!!!!!!! Why...why...why??? Why this ending? I urge anyone involved in the making or in the acting of this film to explain this movie to me.Okay..one other thing: the mecha Gigolo Joe is implicated in a murder, and so the police pursue him, and capture him several times, throughout the movie, and yet we get the impression that he will be arrested and tried for this murder. He's a machine!!!!!!!!!! Unplug him. If mechas were ever able to actual walk around, to become autonomous, there would certainly be a way to incapacitate them quickly.I've reviewed the entire cast and production crew and can say that individually, they've all done some of the best work in cinema. But this movie sucked. One of only a few movies I've ever seen that I can say that about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, first off, as a fairy tale and a retelling of Pinocchio the film was very good. Haley Joel Osment has locked up the Oscar and Jude Law was also very good. However, this movie just had so much bad science that I just cannot recommend it.Normally I don't have too much of a problem with bad science, but since this movie takes place on Earth I have to look at it more scrutinizingly. It takes place in our future and references real things in the past, such as the tale of Pinocchio. If it had been some far off planet I would have had less problems with it, but these are the problems I see:1. Haley Joel Osment (HJO) eats some food and "breaks". Um, if this is a problem wouldn't he be either built so food couldn't get into his system OR so that he was programmed so he could not voluntarily injest food?2. After eating they get him fixed. The mother is holding his hand, very emotional scene, blah, blah. Why are they fixing him? As shown earlier with a female robot, he probably has a CPU in his head or other part of his body that can easily be removed. Pull it out and slap it in a new body, fixed in half a minute.3. A boy makes HJO think he's going to cut him, to see if he has damage avoidance programmed in him. HJO gets scared and clings behind the real son (Martin) and backs into the pool. Wouldn't this be potentially harmfull? If he has damage avoidance he wouldn't fall in the pool, he's a robot, he'd have a perfect map of his surroundings in his head so he'd know where the pool is. Also, in all likelyhood, future robots will have some sort of Asimovian laws programmed into them - cannot harm a human, or let a human be harmed, etc. - so even if the pool wouldn't be a danger to HJO, his programming would prevent him from falling into the pool and endangering Martin.4. If the parents were worried about the possibity of HJO being dangerous all they would have to do is check his memory. He's a walking computer, just hook him up to a monitor and they'd see he didn't mean to hurt Martin in the pool and that Martin made him go into the parent's room with the scissors.5. The dump with all the robots scrounging for parts. Cool and creepy scene, but not likely. Why would they dump it? Wouldn't they just recycle all of it?6. The Flesh Show - hunting down the robots the bikers shoot these discs that stick on the back of a robot and a powerfull magnet makes them stick to the metal walls in a shanty-town. Lucky the bots didn't stay in the woods. Seems like nets and electrical disrupters (like the Jawas in Star Wars) would be used more (some nets were used).7. The framing of Gigolo Joe - just like HJO he is a robot and his memory would be easily viewed by the authorities to see he was innocent of murder and they would also have a picture of the man who did it (her human husband/lover). Also, a point is made of him being licensed to provide his services. Wouldn't it make sense that he would be programmed to contact emergency services in the event that one of his customers had a heart attack or died? The police should have known everything he saw in the room within a minute of it happening. I could understand if he was some sort of black-market bot that had been modified by criminals, but he was a licensed, law-abiding bot.8. Voice acting - Chris Rock as the bot that was shredded and Robin Williams as Dr. Know were a little distracting.9. Dr. Know, kept thinking: "Do you expect me to talk?" "No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die." Even though that was Goldfinger who said that.10. There should have been no way that the police flyer could be stolen, voice codes, scanners, DNA sniffers, etc. should have prevented a bot from stealing it. HOWEVER, by then the company that made HJO could have arranged it so that he could take it, they did want to see what he would do.11. If bots were restricted from Manhattan, the flyer would not have let them enter, except the company would have overridden this.12. David finds out about himself and sees the boxes of Davids and Darlenes, one of the David boxes moves. Very creepy and cool scene, but why would one of the Davids be turned on?13. David is in the flyer and trapped in ice for 2000 years. The flyer probably would have collapsed from the increased pressure when the water froze. HJO and Teddy probably would have been okay anyway though.14. Every time Teddy talked, I kept thinking of Funzo in The Simpsons and him saying, "I have a flower por vou."15. What some of you think are aliens thaw out HJO. Okay, first of all there is about a 99.9% chance these are NOT aliens, but are robots. They even say, when they find HJO and Teddy, "These are ORIGINAL robots, they actually knew humans." This implies they themselves are the descendents of robots. Second, why are they human shaped? They appear to have mastered magnetic fields, electrical fields, and gravitational fields, it would make the most sense for them to incorporate this into their own bodies instead of the blocky vehicles, and be a more streamlined shape such as a sphere or maybe a horizontal tear-drop shape. I could understand if they changed into human shape just before waking HJO, but we see them in this shape the whole time.16. The ending cloning thing was just silly. The best ending (beyond ending it with HJO looking at the blue fairy at the bottom of the ocean) would have been the futurebots tricking him into thinking he was back home, this way they could make him think he was real and actually have him grow up and age, reproduce, and live out a natural life. Much like the Star Trek where the self-aware Moriarty from the Holodeck was tricked and kept in a simulation.Overall as a Fairy Tale - 8 of 10 as a Sci-fi movie - 6 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg has wowed and surprised me in the past and although the sheer brutality and grit of "Saving Private Ryan" may approach it the shock of "A.I." caught me reeling. This is an astonishing motion picture. It is a science fiction movie that invites (even demands) deep thought while it stirs up some of our deepest hopes, dreams and, most unexpectedly, fears. I think it is that last emotion that is driving people away from this film. In Spielberg's boldest move ever he has taken a story that the legendary and late Stanley Kubrick worked on for years and kept Kubrick's chilling genius as the driving force behind this gem. I'm still trying to decide if "A.I." is more of a Spielberg film or a Kubrick film. This, in itself, is amazing. The film is filled with visual wonders too numerous to point out. The performances range from good to excellent. Haley Joel Osment carries the film brilliantly, Jude Law is a lot of fun to watch and William Hurt brings the necessary gravity to his role as a visionary scientist. Spielberg's team matches his (and Kubrick's) aim. It is quite an experience. But a large part of any problem that people will have with this film is that it is "quite an experience" and not "just a movie". It is difficult to shake off. As far flung as it is in its futuristic trappings (as any really good sci-fi film should be) "A.I." is ultimately about love and the wonder and the fear of it. It is a rather dark take on a subject as unexplainable as anything science fiction has ever dreamt up. I found it heartbreaking and occasionally terrifying, but I was transfixed nevertheless. I can't believe Spielberg had the guts to pull this off and I don't think he would have before making "Schindler's List" and "Ryan". And he did it with all the conviction and expertise of his best work ("Schindler's", "Ryan", "Close Encounters" and "E.T.") "A.I." is already going down like "2001" as a greatly misunderstood masterpiece. This is definitely the most daring movie Spielberg has ever made. It is a very dark fairy tale. I was deeply moved and somewhat unnerved by it. We'll be talking about this one for years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After walking out of this movie, I felt very ripped off.First off, at one point I thought the movie was going to take a more chilling/thriller type of angle, in a sort of "The Shining" way... but alas, it turned around and attempted to be a sort of... new age version of pinnochio.*SPOILERS AHEAD*There were other scenes that drove me insane. Once the aliens showed up, Spielberg (or whoever) had the audacity to make the suggestion that the human race is so impressive and so genius that these aliens (who can control things with their minds and are obviously far superior even to the futuristic humans) marvel and envy us.RIIIIGGGHHHTTT.But that's more of a technical error. There are lots of technical errors, most of which one expects in sci-fi these days, as it's hard for non-scientific writers to keep up with the difference between physical possibilities and magic.However, there is also errors of a more creative nature. First off, I don't think I've ever seen a movie where the narrator kicks in 2 hours into it, and was completely unnecessary. Then the characters were abnormal in their development. The boy of the story was mechanical and robotic up until the point where his human mother dumps him in the woods, at which point he suddenly seems to act extreemly human.The teddy bear robot is also mechanical, and then suddenly seems intent on helping the boy. As well as Joe the lover-bot.... robotic and focused on making women happy... and then suddenly seems intent on helping the boy.And let's not even talk about the character of the creator, who seems to want to find the boy so he can be examined... and then ditches him. And technically speaking... we could implant GPS chips in dogs to track them... clearly that technology is lost in the future.If the movie had ended after the boy got caught in the loop with the fairy thing, then it would have ended as a sort of tragic pinnochio, and that could have succeeded in my mind. As a sort of lasting statement about the mystery of consciousness and could we ever become God... but alas... suddenly the aliens showed up.Maybe in the next movie spielberg makes, we can enjoy aliens, AI, dinosaurs and asteroids all rolled into one.Bleh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Theme's Been Done Before, and Done Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man this was so disappointing. Minor spoilers may follow.First off I do have to rave about Osment &amp; Jude Law's performances, both of them were excellent. Jude Law continues to demonstrate he's one of the top actors working in film today. However, beyond those two, the rest of the characters in this movie are very shallowly drawn &amp; crudely executed. It was interesting how the Mecha characters in the scenes right before the Flesh Fair were more realistic "persons" than any of the humans in this movie.The major flaw of this film is the script. Obviously it had gone through innumberable re-writes by several different writers, and the final result was a mess. Even though Gigolo Joe was my favorite character in this film (Teddy a close 2nd) he really serves no purpose at all in the story. Perhaps the film would have been better served with either Joe OR David as the main character, but not both. The film would have been much darker with Joe as the protagonist, but ultimately more satisfying. It's dark subject material, and using a child as the main character under Spielberg's direction injects a note of poignancy and forced sappiness that ultimately doesn't serve the story.The entire Rouge City sequence was a flat-out ripoff of Blade Runner . . .at one point this may have been the setting for the entire film, but as it stands now it's just a confusing stop on the neverending quest undertaken by David.The film is also about 45 minutes too long . . .the idea came to me the other day that the final sequence with the aliens is really the crux of the film -- somehow it seems that the story was constructed backwards in order to arrive at that point. It would be fascinating to see what Kubrick himself might have done with this film, but I don't think it would have been any better than Spielberg's version. One thing Kubrick might have done away with is the annoying expository narration. If a film needs that much set-up to lay the groundwork for the audience, then something is wrong.The bare fact is that the major theme of this movie, i.e. what does it mean to be human, what constitutes "real people" from synthetics, has already been examined more concisely and with more originality countless times in film and even in TV. Blade Runner seems to be what this film aspires to be on an intellectual level, but it can't touch that film artistically on a visual or character level. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fatally flawed film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmmm. What to say...? I think I had so many problems with the film that it prevented me from seeing the greatness that a number of commentators seemed to detect. In no particular order: (Well, of course they're in *some* particular order (what's the alternative?) but simply in no *particular* particular order.) SPOILERS! SPOILERS!1. So, at the beginning when the question is asked "What responsibility do we have to a robot that really loves?" the questioner admits this is a moral question. William Hurt calls this the oldest (moral) question. I'm something of an expert in old questions, and I'm pretty sure this is not in the top five oldest. "Where the hell are my keys?" is likely older. This bit of intellectual grandstanding was a bit jarring.2. OK, so what genius programmed the "Keep me safe!" response? Was it the same genius who made sure that little robot boys didn't stop themselves from dragging little organic boys under the water and hold on with a grip of steel? (Speaking of which, doesn't it seem clear from the film that David is stronger than just about everybody, including Gigolo Joe? Why would this be?)3. "Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, we want this little mechaboy to play exactly the role in your life that a little orgaboy would. We want the experience to be just the same as having your very own live son. That's why we're going to omit the simple hardware required to make it possible for the little abomination to participate with you in one of the primary human bonding rituals, shared meals. Instead, we've just developed the niftiest little software that will have him mockingly emulate you at the table, reminding you with every bite of just how much of a little freak the monster is."4. In the future, police do not chase suspects who steal police copters. Nor do they retrieve amphibicopters that have children in them that go under the sea.5. William Hurt tells David he'll be right back after he rounds up the scientists who created David, who want to hear all about his adventures. I wish his line here had been a bit less insulting to the intelligence of the audience and instead been, "Since my character is not longer needed for the story, I'm going to exit the scene on a preposterous and transparent pretense so that you can be alone to do whatever it is the story will require without my interference. David, you can rest assured, as the rest of the audience has already discerned, that you'll never see me again." Or at least have him deliver the line the way he did in the film "I'm going to go get the gang..." and then turn full-face toward the camera and give a long, slow, exaggerated wink.6. OK, so the scientists tell Dr. Know to tell David to go the the end of the world where lions cry. Why not just have Dr. Know tell them that the blue fairy is in the Cybertronics plant in New Jersey? Wouldn't *that* have been an equally good test of whether or not he had desires, self-motivated reasoning, etc.? And that would have saved the expense of moving all that stuff across the sea. No one thinks, do they, that this is the plant where David's father went to work every day? Maybe it was the secret lair, where the new model was worked on in secret? Yep, no better way to hide your plant than to start up making lots and lots of flights to an abandoned city with lots of high-tech equipment and contractors. That's a much better idea than just burying it in some obscure lab in Cybertronics.7. OK, the parents have lots of issues that I'll group under this number. First, daddy brings home David unannounced. To an emotionally unstable woman. Who has a son-cicle. No talking, no nothing. Second, mommy goes through the imprinting when she is obviously unsure of whether or not she wants the kid. Third, the parents *do* *no* *parenting*. It is surely plausible that the kid would use all the Chanel No. 5, but is the proper response to give him a teddy bear? Or is it rather to smack him around (given that it is a Kubrick film) or even give him a time out (given that it is a Spielberg film)? Fourth, neither mommy nor daddy *ask* what the hell is going on with these episodes that make them uneasy about him; nor do they consult with the creators/programmers. They decide to have him destroyed. Fifth, mommy leaves him in the woods. This makes for a moving scene and the best acting in the film, but for a monster-mommy whose enormity we're supposed to forget in our sharing of David's fantasy of being reunited with her. And these are the parents selected after a tough screening procedure. I suspect it is the staggering ineptitude of the potentially parenting population, rather than any resource scarcity, that explains the government's rationing of reproductive opportunities.8. Speaking of not consulting with the creating, programming scientists, where the hell were they? They make this unique creation and then, with no fine tuning and no monitoring, they send him off and then (apparently) it's Miller Time.9. Gigolo Joe, it seemed to me, was just about entirely unnecessary. And his introduction and "development" made the film unnecessarily long, and longer than the natural plotline could sustain.10. David meets the second David at the end of the world, and he goes *totally* *psycho*. Second David asks him if he'd like to read together and first David takes a lamp and *knocks* *his* *head* *off*. Not just a little off. Flying-across-the-room-and-rolling-out-the-door off. Of course, that prior to flying across the room as a result of the last bash, the head must have been hanging on by a thread as a result of the next-to-last bash. So David, perhaps infuriated by his being deprived of opportunities to play T-ball with pop, decides that a head hanging by a thread isn't enough and he needs to take just one more swing. What kind of psycho thing is that? OK, justify it by jealousy. Go ahead. I dare you. And, what's more, this episode is not even *mentioned* by William Hurt's character. It makes his leaving David alone (see #5 above) even sillier.Well, I'll stop with 10, as this has already gone on too long. Have I really just missed the point of a great film, as some contend this is? I just found too much on the ground-level of this film problematic to willingly scale the heights some people seemed to think it climbed to. As far as I can tell, the foundation could not support the weight of spires.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The power of this film can be seen in the reviews. All of them, on site and off. Like the movie itself, no one is able to wrap this thing into a tidy package and deliver it. I remember when 2001 came out. A couple reviews I read then I still have-- one by Roger Ebert and one from the Christian Science Monitor, of all places. Combined, they lined up the symbols, references, and intentions to lead to a logical conclusion in a manner that seemed wondrous to me (in high school) at the time. I began to learn that there is more to watching a movie than watching a movie.So, here's A.I. What a leap. In 2001 we went beyond Jupiter and asked What's going on here? And we were told that, like the astronaut, we were not permitted to understand because such an experience MUST be beyond our understanding. This new film generates more questions and wonder with each passing day. The code is not subtle like it was in 2001. It's wired right into our own experience. We know the fairy tale (or the way it was told to us) and we know childhood (or the way it was supposed to be) and we've heard about love and how it will save the world. The key to the puzzle is itself a scrambled code.I walked out of this movie contemplating it's "flaws," and since then the flaws all keep churning up to more amazement at the richness of the film and its ideas. Heck, I'm not going to solve anything by writing this, but I really encourage you all to see it. It may be one of the most challenging, and satisfying, film experiences you'll ever have, if you park your expectations at the door.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a piece of art. It is truly one of the best movies I've seen in years. At the very least, it was refreshing. I have some very great things to say about this film as well as some minor things, though the good more than outweighed the bad. I'll first say what was negative about it.The film obviously wasn't for small children due to its sometimes disturbing content. It was also a longer movie, which in this case isn't exactly a bad thing. It wasn't to me anyway. The only other negative thing about this movie was that Jude Law's character wasn't developed as well as it could have been. I wish some more of the plot would have focused on his character. Well, that's it for the negatives. Let's look at the good things.The film had a great plot, great script, and excellent acting. Haley Joel Osment continues to show his great acting talent as David, the robot child programmed to love his parents. He brought great realism to this film and did an excellent job playing his character. It couldn't have been an easy role for anyone. I expect to see great things from him in the future. Jude Law was also great in his limited role as Gigolo Joe. The special effects were awesome as expected. The movie was simply jaw-dropping beautiful to watch. It was as much a treat for the eyes as it was for the mind.As for the film itself, it can only be called a work of art. No, it isn't perfect, but neither is art. The film drives at the deep questions about humanity and love. It asks us some deep questions but doesn't spoon-feed us the answers. It lets us decide for ourselves. That is what art does for us. This film still had me thinking days afterward. I loved this film precisely because it moved on many different levels. Personally, I love this film and give it my highest recommendation. Does everyone love it? No. Will most people enjoy it? I think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film of meaning of life, religion, humanity and love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fantasy was exceptional in more ways than any movie I have seen in a while. After two viewings, I finally think I got it, and I disagree with every review I have read, except that it is a must-see. As David searches for his dream, he learns more than he realizes, but the realities of other Mechas, particularly Teddy and Gigolo Joe, are not emphasized, which seems to stem from a definite respect for the viewer's intelligence. Perhaps the film would be as well named, "Viewer Intelligence." Joe's last four words indicate a grasp of sentience far beyond his programming, but so do his words throughout, especially in Samantha's room. Jude Law's performance is of Oscar caliber, and this is heightened by the fact that he is playing a Mecha with limited understanding. Other thoughts were the hollowness of religion when it is objectified, as opposed to when it is subjective (The Blue Fairy). One may well ponder whether David wanted individuality or reality. At one point, he wants to be like all the other boys, but then he wants to be unique. One wonders whether he lends reality to Monica, or gains it from her. What gives us meaning? Is it something we grasp, or something which grasps us, as in community or relationships with others? Most heartbreaking scene: fate of the nanny Mecha. Most symbolic elements: 2000 years, sharing of drink and cake, and the single candle left burning - a Unity Candle? Most fascinating issue, apart from those mentioned above: just how old and stupid is Teddy? He seems to have a greater grasp of meaning than a simple toy. What happens to him in the end, after David's quest is over? Does he continue to function, and do the Supermechas have more to gain from him? Finally, are the Supermechas the next step in our evolution? Spielberg has hit a touchdown in this film, and could not have made a better or more lasting tribute to Kubrick and his genius. EXPERIENCE THIS FILM!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huh? Wha? Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, maybe when you go to see this movie you're supposed to say, "None of this is real, so it's okay if none of this makes any sense." But I didn't do that. And maybe that's what killed it for me.I've seen a lot of lousy, ill-conceived, plotless wonders in my life, but this is one exceeds them all in pure ludicrocity (I know it's not a word, so what?) Every three minutes the film gives you something ridiculous and your brain says, "That could never ever possibly happen" but you're supposed to swallow it. Why? Was there no other way to motivate the plot? Was there a plot? Or was there just a random collection of mini-scenes strung together by Osment and a talking robotic bear?And let's get another thing straight--this movie is NOT sci-fi. Sci-fi, as the name implies, must include some form of scientifically-plausible backdrop to the fiction of the story. This movie didn't even try to explain the science behind the robots in the story, one was just to accept that somehow they worked, without any explanation as to how or why. And any true sci-fi buff will about lose their lunch when A.I. starts introducing moon-shaped balloons and "Aquacopters.":This movie was a disappointment to me on all fronts, but I think what disappointed me the most was that any movie made about thinking machines from now on will be compared to it, as if they were trying to copy A.I.'s pointless, mindless tirade on the consequences of machine-generated love. When someone finally does get this kind of movie right, the critics will lament it as a "touching tribute to Speilberg's A.I." Ugh.Quite terrible indeed. Avoid at all costs--for the sake of all that is good and pure in Sci-Fi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It saddens me to write this about a Steven Spielberg film as his are some of the greats of our time, but A.I. happens to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Though visually spectacular and including yet another great performance by Haley Joel Osment, both are wasted in this over two hour journey into the pointless. No character development with any other cast member and entirely too many characters at that. This "re-telling" of Pinocchio is totally without the feeling or direction. Any hint of conflict was parochial at best and left unresolved such as the sibling rivalry or Gigolo Joe's framing. The ending was an unnecessary inclusion of special effects and nothing was brought to light that hasn't in any other film before this. And though the patrons of the dreaded "Flesh Fair" were fooled by this mecha who pleaded for his life, I wasn't at all. I think a member of the audience put it best as we walked out of the theater when he said, "I'm gonna write ole Steve a letter to say thanks for showing me a worse film than 'Dude, Where's My Car.'"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another "Robot-wants-humanity Movie"...that's all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time a film like this comes out, there's the fans that claim all who hate the film "just don't get it." Well, how hard is it to "get" a robot movie? From silent films like Metropolis, to The Matrix, robots in film have been done over and over. Personally, I prefer movies about robots who are happy simply to be robots, like Short Circuit. If you prefer the emotional-robot stories, the list is not pretty: the perverted robot in Demon Seed, the comical robot "couple" in Heartbeeps, and most recently, the sex-starved robot in Bicentennial Man. Sure, A. I.. has a far superior "epic" feel to it, that divides it from the above films. However, the "emotional robot" plot concept still has its flaws, and neither Kubrick nor Spielberg can correct them.(Mild Spoilers follow, though all from the first third (or so) of the film, so it shouldn't be a worry...)People have alluded to Pinocchio when discussing A. I..'s story. This is incorrect. Pinocchio was a puppet who became human when he sacrificed himself for the life of Gepetto. In this picture, there is no such epiphany in David; he merely wants to hear "I love you" from Mommy, because his programming lists it as a requirement. No biggie; "humans" in this story have reactions even more questionable. We see his human "brother" treat him badly, because allegedly a boy would not want a robot as a brother (since when? I mean, how cool would it be to have C3PO as a brother?). In a similar emotional contradiction, David's "mother" does not have the heart to see him destroyed, though sees no harm in leaving him deserted in the forest. HUH??? Sure, neither Spielberg nor Kubrick were ever mothers, and I wasn't, either, though even I know this is a cockeyed view of the human spirit, and maternal instincts in particular.

The answer to this question seems to allude to the truth; since his emotions after this desertion are not real, David himself is not real. So why should we even care?Don't get me wrong. I think this film has some great production values, regardless of its negative attitude about humanity and human compassion. However, what dropped my rating of the film, all the way down from 9 out of 10, to ***5*** out of 10? Simple; the finale is horrid. I can forgive an unsatisfying ending; that is commonplace these days. What I *cannot* forgive is an ending so contrived, every single plot inconsistency seems dragged in, just for one more audience tear. I don't want to give anything away; suffice to say every minute of the third "act" of the film is pure cornball, and left me saying, "Why would this happen...? ...just to make the audience keep crying? Give me a break!" It just goes on, and on, and on. In truth, the only tear I felt was in realizing this laughable finale ruined a possible classic in sci-fi epic cinema.

		<shortDescription>Another "Robot-wants-humanity Movie"...that's all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time a film like this comes out, there's the fans that claim all who hate the film "just don't get it." Well, how hard is it to "get" a robot movie? From silent films like Metropolis, to The Matrix, robots in film have been done over and over. Personally, I prefer movies about robots who are happy simply to be robots, like Short Circuit. If you prefer the emotional-robot stories, the list is not pretty: the perverted robot in Demon Seed, the comical robot "couple" in Heartbeeps, and most recently, the sex-starved robot in Bicentennial Man. Sure, A. I.. has a far superior "epic" feel to it, that divides it from the above films. However, the "emotional robot" plot concept still has its flaws, and neither Kubrick nor Spielberg can correct them.(Mild Spoilers follow, though all from the first third (or so) of the film, so it shouldn't be a worry...)People have alluded to Pinocchio when discussing A. I..'s story. This is incorrect. Pinocchio was a puppet who became human when he sacrificed himself for the life of Gepetto. In this picture, there is no such epiphany in David; he merely wants to hear "I love you" from Mommy, because his programming lists it as a requirement. No biggie; "humans" in this story have reactions even more questionable. We see his human "brother" treat him badly, because allegedly a boy would not want a robot as a brother (since when?

		<shortDescription>Somewhat confusing, and definetely dragged on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. was pumped up to be so good since Haley Joel Osment, Steven Spieldberg, and Stanley Kubrick all had a part in how the movie ended. I think that this movie was much poorer than it was made out to be. The plot was very confusing. It was dragged out. It jumped around to scenes that really didn't seem to have to do anything with the movie overall. It just didn't have any goal. The largest problem was that you never felt emotional for David, the little boy. He seemed detached because he always had this confused look on his face. Not until the very last half hour does he show any emotion. That is not to say that Haley Joel Osment didn't do a great job. He was one of the only things that kept the movie going. The other problem was the timing of the ending. It could have happened a lot earlier. The last half hour seemed to drag on. It almost took away any emotion that you had felt just a little bit earlier. If they had stopped it at one certain point, we would have gotten a much better effect. The movies visual effects were very good, but otherwise than that, I just couldn't wait for the movie to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huh? Wha? Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, maybe when you go to see this movie you're supposed to say, "None of this is real, so it's okay if none of this makes any sense." But I didn't do that. And maybe that's what killed it for me.I've seen a lot of lousy, ill-conceived, plotless wonders in my life, but this is one exceeds them all in pure ludicrocity (I know it's not a word, so what?) Every three minutes the film gives you something ridiculous and your brain says, "That could never ever possibly happen" but you're supposed to swallow it. Why? Was there no other way to motivate the plot? Was there a plot? Or was there just a random collection of mini-scenes strung together by Osment and a talking robotic bear?And let's get another thing straight--this movie is NOT sci-fi. Sci-fi, as the name implies, must include some form of scientifically-plausible backdrop to the fiction of the story. This movie didn't even try to explain the science behind the robots in the story, one was just to accept that somehow they worked, without any explanation as to how or why. And any true sci-fi buff will about lose their lunch when A.I. starts introducing moon-shaped balloons and "Aquacopters.":This movie was a disappointment to me on all fronts, but I think what disappointed me the most was that any movie made about thinking machines from now on will be compared to it, as if they were trying to copy A.I.'s pointless, mindless tirade on the consequences of machine-generated love. When someone finally does get this kind of movie right, the critics will lament it as a "touching tribute to Speilberg's A.I." Ugh.Quite terrible indeed. Avoid at all costs--for the sake of all that is good and pure in Sci-Fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kubrick Dialectic, the Spielberg Inheritance, the AI Challenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The `literalists' are clearly not happy with A.I. So now is a good time to recall that `2001: A Space Odyssey' was greeted upon release with derision, confusion, dismissive reviews, public consternation, and, oh yeah, some thought it was an absolute masterpiece. Beyond the monolithic influence of that film (think of Han Solo's jump to lightspeed, etc.), the symbols of `2001' -- TO THIS VERY DAY -- cannot be decoded using anything but the most personal, interpretive language. The obelisks, the message of the obelisks, the Star Child, Cosmonaut Dave's `room', HAL-9000's true motivation ? all these things remain in the subconscious (now collective?) as indelible images that refuse to be concretely defined between or among viewers. What causes this conflict of perception? Is it intentional? Again and again, Kubrick's films take us to a no-man's land of narrative and moral ambiguity, stranding us, forcing us to make decisions, demanding interpretation (or we can just walk away, hating the film). To my perception, Kubrick is the only, true `Brechtian' film director. The device Brecht proposed is `Alienation Effect', or put simply, Leading the audience down two (divergent) paths at once. My favorite example is `Barry Lyndon'. eing the adventures of a young man, handsome, virtuous, well-meaning, ambitious, full of promise, etc. Yet in every scene, the camera `pulls-back' revealing Barry (but never to himself) to be womanizing, self-absorbed, criminally inclined, socially inept, not very bright, morally bankrupt, and at last, a broken shell of a man. Or let's consider `Strangelove': Did Kubrick really create a Ballz-to-the-Wallz slapstick comedy about nuclear proliferation, mass destruction, and military/political incompetence? The real question is `Who else could have?' Well, that's my take on Kubrick's artistic sensibility, and, without daring to presume Spielberg's motivation, it's what drew them both to `A.I.' Pinocchio, the Blue Fairy, cuddly Teddy Bears on one hand, but on the other hand ? social institutions are faltering forever -- parenthood, childhood, science, industry, sexuality -- all distorted beyond repair. And Humans, the ultimate A.I. protagonist, seem blissed-out, in denial, more interested in creating `Davids', `Darlenes' and `Gigolo Joes' than in rising water levels and the imminent threat of extinction. Therefore, I believe A.I. is getting precisely the response all Kubrick films `initially' get. Spielberg's reputation and career can certainly withstand any and all that public perception might bring to his films, but I keep thinking that A.I. is the riskiest moment of his artistic life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A frustrating experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ultimately I walked out of A.I. very frustrated. And I believe this will be the reaction of most who knew and appreciated Kubrick's craft (A.I, was a long-time project of his).Throughout the movie, glimpses of what was Kubrick's genius are apparent. The underlying themes of the movie, the avant-garde vision, the questions it raises about ourselves, and about technology.Unfortunately, having Speilberg at the helm is like trying to enjoy a fine French meal while someone peddles street trinkets at your table. The experience is distracting and classless.Speilberg is a bull in a crystal shop. Not having the wisdom to deal with the gift Kubrick left him, he ultimately soils it- like spreading Kraft Dinner over caviar. This fact, perhaps more than everything else, is a fitting statement of Kubrick's grandeur and mastery.There is no finesse in this movie. It makes us miss the man who knew where the line was, and played on it. And we are further saddened by the fact Kubrick's inheritance was given to someone so undeserving. Like the illiterate cousin who inherits a priceless library of classics.Kubrick's project is diluted by Speilberg's effort to drive the point home. As soon as you begin to reflect on your fate as a human being confronted by technology (as I believe was Kubrick's objective), Speilberg falls victim to his obsession to be nuance-less, as if by fear the message wouldn't be understood, and you end up being side-tracked by the regular grossier-Speilberg-bag-o-tricks.Kubrick should have made it clearer that he was asking Speilberg for his special effect expertise, and nothing else. Perhaps we could have avoided this travesty. This heresy.</fullReview>

The silken patchwork of a few good ideas, a few great effects, and an the occasional good performance, is haphazardly bolted together with the most campy scenes since Judge Dread.There are moments when I want to embrace this film as a modern faerie tale, but I keep slipping out of the experience, as my belief is suspended as from a noose, with the horrible explanatory voice overs at the end, and the contrived jumping from one storyline to the next.If you want a decent contemplation where advanced artificial intelligence meets sentience, check out the Voyager episode, where the holographic doctor seeks vindication of his rights.As far as AI goes, flush and watch it spin thankfully into the distance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie I wanted to go pick a fight. I wanted to overturn some cars, or light some buildings on fire. I wanted to kick a homeless man in the neck. That's how bad this movie was.Basically, AI played out as if the script were written as a group project by a first-year film school class. It was like a long, tedious, confusing movie with a shorter, confusing, tedious movie tacked onto the end of it. Incoherent is the best word to describe this movie; it's a bewildering mish-mash of styles and themes that is ultimately without direction or purpose. Not surprisingly, it was not without its fair share of cheesy, manipulative emotional scenes - all the more awkward because the plot was so ridiculous. Imagine you're over 2 hours into a movie and then the narration starts. "And so, he sat there for a time. And then he kept sitting there..." This is the point you begin trying to jam a soda straw through your eyeball. Unfortunately, the movie does have some promising beginnings; the first half hour or so are quite intriguing, and play out as a reasonable sensible drama. After that, though, the movie leaves the road and goes off into the weeds and you can kiss a few precious hours of your life goodbye. By the time you realize it's time to escape, it's basically too late.Good performance by Osment; painful performance by Hurt, as usual; and superb work by the Teddy bear, who provided a good minute or so of relief among the other 164-odd minutes.If you liked "Mission to Mars", this is the movie for you. Otherwise, avoid it - it's the worst of Kubrik and Spielberg, which is a shame given the promise that such a combination ought to have had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Stanley Kubrick was anything at all we know from his filmography that he possessed a discernment of high order. At the same time Steven Spielberg, although an extraordinary visualizer, albeit the signature overproduction penchant in his projects, the body of his work has been shallow. It caters primarily to immature audiences of average or below average intelligence, the large and profitable base of moviegoers. Thus, it is fairly difficult to understand a possible collaboration between two filmmakers who operate at different ends of the spectrum. In this supposed fruit of a long correspondence between the two unlikely filmic partners we see a film, wafer thin in its conception. While paralleling the immortal Collodi story of a puppet that loved life so much it wanted to be a real boy, the film exhibits none of the genius and depth of the classic tale. Little, red warning pennants show up early in this film. We are first asked to have compassion for a rather immature mother neurotically obsessed by the death of her son, his body cryogenically sustained. The illogic of this idea follows through the film. We are asked to believe that in the distant future in which this film is set, science has yet to come to grips with the blatant fact that the human is not nor cannot be its constantly changing body. In the meantime, scientists are at work at creating an unchanging, new robot (ostensibly for the childish mother) one that can "express love". Herein lies the basic perfidiousness of this film, where its writers, including Spielberg, who wrote the screenplay, apparently have not yet studied the concept of love enough to understand that love is not need, nor is it desire. Would we but have literate writers, who at least had read Kahlil Gibran? "Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. Love possesses not nor would it be possessed; For love is sufficient unto love." For unfounded reasons, mostly the results of Machiavellian manipulations from the resuscitated actual son of the childish mother, a son whom we are supposed to believe can outmaneuver the programmers of the boy robot, the mother abandons the needfully programmed boy robot in a forlorn forest where it begins its journey into hell.  A tacked-on, contrived and patently false ending does not complete this disturbing, inarticulate film. ###</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. is a pretentious moral that fails to be anything other than a movie that can't decide what it should be. It is neither a clever modernization of Pinocchio, nor a fresh version of the movie Blade Runner. The Wizard of Oz it is not.It could have been a wonderful essay on marital &amp; parental love, or the tragedy of losing a child, or being unable to have more children. But it degenerates immediately into a neurotic &amp; pathetic obsession of the mother with her being loved, and her selfish desire is so desperate, a soulless animitron of outward perfection will do.It could have been a searing analysis by a self-aware artificial sapient that: Man is man, and can never be duplicated, not even by man. It could have affirmed the majesty of humanity by confronting us with the revelation that the aspiration to be human is insufficient to consummate that transformation.But it ends as a protracted and ridiculous quest for an impotent fairy. It is a Close Encounter of the Meaningless Kind. At least the sham Wizard of Oz could see that the journey was half the battle.The soul of this movie is as artificial as David's is absent. David's efforts begin hopelessly, and end hopelessly. And so does this movie.Not since Random Hearts or The Pledge or Million Dollar Hotel have I seen so useless a movie. If not for Haley Joel Osment's endearing performance, this movie should been permanently consigned to deep freeze storage, just like the cruel &amp; fiendish, but all too real, Martin. If that's the view of this cynical author of the end of man or his spirit, maybe Ian Watson or Brian Aldiss, or at least his infected story, can be quarantined in the tank next to Martin!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Character Breakdown "oh, the humanity"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had already figured a movie about a robot child who can love would have to focus on their "Programming of Love" - and I had this idea that the child's love would be more pure, more unconditional than a human's. I expected the boy robot to be more honest and true, and therefore , dare I say, Better at it? Than the humans. I feel humans are taught love, and their idea of love is warped by experience and baggage. What the movie proved to me was that humans are warped, period - and I was okay with that. Number one- The gross insincerity of creating David was blatant in the first scene. David was a gimmicky effort at creating (Frankenstein pun intended) pure profit. "If we build it -they will buy", the Professor seemed to say. I felt no depth from his character. I did not understand his drive, his ambition unless it was greed and infamy. I felt no closer to him in the final scene when we learn he had immortalized his own son David, in this Beta-bot. What kind of sincere father wants to be haunted by seeing his dead son's visage marketed to hundreds? Where was his wife, she would never have allowed it. The Professor did use Mecha- David as a guinea pig, just a test case to check the genuineness of David's emotions and attachments. If Mecha-David had slaughtered thousands on the way to the Blue Fairy, I don't think the professor was the admirable kind of character who would have stopped productions on his "Davids" -no. They would have rolled right out on schedule.Number two: Mommy. Her character confuses me. The optimism she displayed by reading to her son Martin in Cryogenic freeze makes me fail to believe she would have imprinted with Mecha-David so soon. Her resiliency to accept Mecha David at first seems quite genuine. But her desire to love and be loved by something gives her a slant of Robotic-ness herself. Does she need to love, or be loved, or both. Is David not enough for her because of her internal "mother program", i.e - hormones? I was devastated when she dropped him off in the woods. I felt her mother-program had some poorly written code. I wanted her to choose "David" somehow as Martin was obviously "the Bad seed".Martin and the pool kids: This is the key to understanding humanity at its' basest level. David shows us everything magical about being a child (different colored crayons for words and letters, noticing the tappiness of the hard floor, the careful study of coffee preparation), this is how children learn. Martin reminds of how cruel we can be, though curious. Manipulation, scrutiny, and survival-after all, Monica was his Mommy first. Poking David with a knife proves he is not a real boy. David is different -Different is wrong, fascinating, but wrong. "What happens if we...." is the heart of every new discovery, though.Joe: I loved this character every instant. I loved his inability to perceive "David" as a CHILD. He just went on - blah-blah sex like he was talking to just another client. The only emotion I felt from him was pride. He didn't seem fear-ful, really. I doubted his ability to jump into the complex conversation he had with David after they saw Dr. Know. He was a typical "pleasure model" (like Pris from Bladerunner) - I do not think he would have "felt" all the opinions about people. His allegiance to David is questionable, in my opinion. Blue fairy- just another female figure letting Mecha-David down. She did appear eerie like all those chalkware Madonnas from Church. She never granted any of my childhood wishes or prayers either, David. I feel for you.David: Just a Beta Bot for marketing research. He showed every human emotion we could ask for - fear, sorrow, anger, envy, creativity, desire, guilt, compassion, inquisitiveness and unconditional love. I love Osmet for making me believe he was David, and he's really incredibly talented - so talented I wish there was "a room full of him" b/c we know he's going to grow up and loose this Child-like innocence in Hollywood. I fell into this movie actually only concerned with David's happiness. It made me want to make sure my son feels my love as powerfully as I can give it. All the little things in the movie that could have been hindrances, just slipped away - nothing held me in the theatre - I was there with the story. . I enjoyed the ending. "Life finds a way" (jurassic park) and I was glad to see David uncovered-and to see that in the end it was just them. I hoped that when the blue fairy crumbled, so would all of his memories from the past. I am so glad the super-mechas gave him a day of happy. I don't understand why they couldn't take out the "mommy imprint", but then, that would have destroyed his "living script" as the scribe of the human era. He was the most human of all these characters. Damn me, I would have bought one.</fullReview>

Haley Joel Osment is appealing for about 10 minutes but since he only has one facial expression you soon grow tired of him &amp; his prolonged whining. Jude Law is completely wasted in a role that is little more than a supporting part. He is poorly photographed &amp; doesn't even get a costume change. He deserves better. The humans are not likeable esp. the mother who reminded me of the Houston mom who drowned her five children in a bathtub. The scene where she abandons her child in the forest is gross. The middle section looked worse than the wrestling shows you get on TV. The ending goes on forever &amp; eventually turns into a coffee commercial. The little robot makes his mom coffee &amp; she says "You always know how to make it just right."</fullReview>

The movie has too many characters that don't fit in or add to the story at all. The plot itself has too many loose ends.The movie is also unneccesary violent, without it really communicating anything.Osment does a great job as "David", and establishes himself as the leading actor of his generation.

I know these plot writers were taught how to effectively write a plot in school! I felt like I started watching another movie. Whatever happened to the family that couldn't learn to love a robot? I would have liked to have saw more about that! A movie can be of a sci-fi nature, but still needs to follow a particular plot. If the story line is going to change, then transitions from one plot to the other should be included! A black screen between plots is not enough! I would need to see it again to piece it together, but it's definitely not worth the $8.75 we paid to see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's that noise? Minor SPOILER alert?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anticipting the opening weekend crowds, I bought my ticket in advance, and arrived at the multiplex early in order to secure a good seat. Found myself waiting with others outside the auditorium for the previous showing to conclude, and was perplexed by a strange noise coming from beyond the doors leading into the auditorium. Not wanting to be exposed to any important plot points via a loud sound system, I relocated to another part of the cinemaplex. This was also useful for avoiding overhearing comments, or seeing facial reactions from the previous audience as they came out. It cost nearly $10 to see a film in NYC, and for better or worse, I wanted my money's worth. As the last of the crowd seemed to trickle out, I made my way in, got a seat, and settled in. Impressions: At times, the movie was visually stunning, and the acting was quite good, especially young Mr. Osmet and Frances O'Connor. There were a few plot and pacing issues that were easily overlooked, a couple of minor distractions by 'voice cameos' that seemed overly gratuitous. I managed to stay absorbed enough in the story to not spend too much energy distinguishing the fingerprints of Kubrick versus Speilberg right up to the end. Not the real end, not when the movie should have faded to black and the credits should have started rolling, but the false ending, that tacked on load of sentimental slop that must have Kubrick spinning in his grave. It only took a few minutes into this epilogue for me to realize that the sound that I had heard earlier was the sucking noise that could only come from this ending. This reeked of the kind of thing that was written after the test audience in Peoria filled out their survey card suggesting that they would be more comfortable with a 'happy' ending. On the strength of that ending, the film should be changed from Artificial Intelligence to Artificial Sentiment. I should have stayed near the door when the earlier show let out. Someone could have tipped me off about that ending, and I could have got out while the movie was still good...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is quite ambitious, but fails at almost every level. The film cannot decide if it's an ET film, a fairie tale, a morality play, a Science Fiction film or a Mad-Max adventure. It builds no bond between the viewer and the main "character". While the acting is quite good, the film never benefits from it.The themes in this film have been covered before. Two salient examples are "Blade Runner" and a Twilight Zone episode called "The Lonely". The film never comes close to matching these two examples.The film is so broad that they have to insert a narrator 3/4 of the way through. A very bad sign.Add to all of this a film that is too long (2hr 20 minutes) and has no pace.My big comment is "What a Mess"</fullReview>

The cinematography is oppresively symmetrical and "artsy".Exceptions: a delightful robotic teddy-bear, the only character that behaves rationally or has any sense of irony; Jude Law's superb portrayal of an android gigolo.Not worth a trip to the theater. Barely worth a rental. Fast-forward to the scenes involving Teddy and Joe the Gigolo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AI: This movie is so bad it is hard to know where to begin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those lucky enough not to have seen AI, it is a ham-handed attempt to update the fairy-tale of Pinocchio into a modern science-fiction film. Unfortunately, AI fails as both fairy-tale and science-fiction. The plot seems to have been strung together from the abstracts of several other movies, as if the studio couldn't decide which film it wanted to make, and just decided to make them all. Spielberg doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on whether he is trying to make a film which makes literal sense, or one which casts aside realism in favor of deeper mythological truth. Over explanation, (often well past the point of absurdity,) plagues this film at every turn.There are some high points in this total failure. The special effects are fantastic. I also found the story of Jude Law's character Joe, the robot gigolo, to be very entertaining. Law's performance is truly magnificent, but like every other side point which nearly works in AI, it merely serves as another opportunity for the audience to think, "Why didn't they make a movie about this instead?"Would Kubrik have fared better at the helm? I don't know. He might have stayed away from some of the more gag-worthy schlock, but it is hard to imagine how this script could have been salvaged.The bottom line is that AI is a long, boring story, told in a self-important, condescending tone. Time and time again, details which would have been better left to the imagination are explained until Spielberg is certain that even the dumbest member of the audience understands them. If that's you, you might actually enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AI is not ET - much Artificiality, no Intelligence!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things that distinguishes two eminent careers, Kubrick's from Spielberg's, is that Kubrick had never made a melodramatic movie. Careful scrutiny of his work would show that he seems to have made careful career choices specifically to avoid it. On the contrary, Spielberg lavishly uses melodramatic elements in most of his movies. In A.I., Spielberg never tries to tame its inherent melodramatic nature. On the contrary, in this long, labored and deeply flawed movie melodrama is abundantly used, over-used and ultimately abused. The movie does not have even traces of Kubrick's signature elements - no virility, no originality and no ingenuity.Spielberg, more often then not, caters to the lowest emotional denominator. Kubrick goes for the intellect. At its best(Color Purple, Schindler's List) Spielberg rivals Kubrick in the movie-making bravura. Commercial concerns have frequently contained his cinematic achievements though. His pampering to popular culture and the market place rather that to more cultivated audiences regretfully reduces his stature as an auteur.You don't want to feel like walking out on a Spielberg movie. Not on Spielberg. But, you don't want to feel exploited and manipulated by a movie. Not by Spielberg's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The biggest disappointment of the summer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, what to say about this movie. I had been looking forward to it for about 3 or 4 months, even checking out the weird subplot on the internet, eagerly anticipating June 29. I was so wrong.I went into the movie hoping to see something that would spawn its own culture, something like Star Wars (it did, in fact, have an Ewok). Through the first third of the movie, I thought that may come true. There were plenty of interesting emotional, uncomfortable, and just plain weird scenes. At points you can almost understand exactly what is going on with the family.Then something heinous happens. The whole rest of the movie is just crap. There are only about 3 good scenes in the rest of this 2:25 waste of time. For the first 5 or 10 minutes after the first 'act' I tried unbelievably hard to suspend my disbelief. This movie just got too silly.Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Chris Rock (I really should have seen Pootie Tang instead, this movie was that disappointing), but he has no place as a cameo in this movie. It's just uncalled for. The middle scenes are just too ridiculous to watch. In this time, we watch Jerry Springer (and the rest of the insults to humanity), but I can't imagine society deteriorating so much that people will want to sit around and watch robots be destroyed (even now, Comedy Central can't beg for an audience for that damn Battle Bots show, and those robots actually do something), especially in an arena setting. It's just stupid. I would have been much happier if someone had struck me dead before I had to endure any of this.The rest of the movie is spent not explaining some things, pulling ideas out of nowhere, and explaining other things too much. The ending (epilogue?) is just ridiculous. It was everything I could do to not burst into laughter in the middle of the theatre. 'The space-time continuum has a memory' - give me a break. The worst thing is that all of the people around me were really interested. They're like, 'oooh, aliens' and 'is that what aliens look like' - NO! It's a piece of fiction, A poor piece at that! I actually heard people walk out of the theatre saying, 'That was different.' Of course it was. Different from something good.I just can't believe that I wasted 2:25 of my life in this movie; I feel robbed. I just wish that I hadn't been waiting so long for such a piece of crap.2.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Deeper Spiritual Meaning of AI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although early in release, someone needs to begin an analysis of the symbolisms and meaning of this incredible movie AI. Here's my take from beginning to end, be forewarned that this is my interpretation of the film and may prove a plot spoiler for those who've not yet seen the film. If in fact you are not planning to see the movie because someone told you something negative about AI, then read this and then decide if maybe the reviewer you are listening to missed an interpretation of what the film and the Directors may have meant to share with the audience.From the beginning of the film we are faced with man's desire, and what appears to be a selfless act to do something good, and so a Robot is born. The Robot has been programmed to love and we look at how a Robot and Human might bond, more to the point we look in the mirror of how we bond with things or people unknown. The Robot grows through the emotions of happiness, fear, jealousy, abandonment, and will find the determination to start on a quest to fulfill its destiny, which is to become human. Through the Robot's own twist of fate, it finds itself before the object which the Robot believes will make it human. The Robot sits there and for 2000 years has the faith not to lose its gaze on that which promises to be its savior. As theRobot has endured its frozen, cold, abandoned, and lonely environment it emerges from its isolation to reach out and touch the phantom icon, only to witness it crumble before its eyes. The presence of another being then proceeds to take the Robot and explains certain realities of being and the temporary nature of the now apparently extinct Human population. They see the Robot as the last surviving example of this great culture. Granting the Robot its wish, these creatures allow the boy to be rewarded with his desire to be loved unconditionally. This is the love that once known becomes the basis for his dreams and his sense and accomplishment of achieving humanness.This movie is about Humanity, our relationship with each other, and our faith. It follows the basic flow of development of any one of us after birth, how we learn to laugh, and cry, fear, and experience joy. It looks at the commonly felt emotion of abandonment, that some feel toward God and our perceptions of the tragedies that exist on earth. In man's desire to create something good, we see his motivation may not be as pure as we first perceive it to be, that it may be a selfish act that has the potential to hurt others, but that in the end may have a better outcome than had Humanity not strived to accomplish great things that exceeded our understanding. As the Robot's quest takes it on its journey, it finds no time for sentimentality or reflection, running blindly after the promise of salvation; it has faith. After coming face to face with its sacrosanct icon and not receiving the immediate gratification it thought was its due, the Robot has to endure 2000 years with the object of salvation just out of reach and apparently cold, uncaring, and unsympathetic to its quest. The faith to believe carries the Robot through the ages until benevolent beings appear and free the Robot. I suggest that the viewer not look at these beings as aliens, but try to understand that had the Directors used a voice-over to impart the presence of a spiritual being, the audience would have seen this as either the voice of God or that of a narrator. These beings I believe are our souls, which even they do not understand themselves to be. These beings or spirits *are* in this future date the archeologists of a great hidden and now nearly vanished culture of which only fragments are found, similar to any of our studies of the Egyptian, Native American, or Jurassic ages. Like us, these beings are looking back upon their own history and origins.AI is a reminder of the journey of the soul in a man or woman to know who we are through the enlightenment of finding our Messiah, God, or Savior. It is a brilliant movie that will by its nature and subtlety confuse and probably attract misunderstanding and ridicule, as a large part of the audience will not understand the depths of story telling that these great Directors achieved with their desire to shed light on our own humanity and our own quest to rise to the heights of the heavens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do Spielberg and Kubrick mix?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Artificial Intelligence ends up being less than the sum of its parts. I am a big fan of many of the works of Spielberg and Kubrick. Both have created resplendent masterpieces. This collaboration, however, is something of a mess. It's not abysmal, but it strikes me as akin to the filmic equivalent of a garbage pizza. Lots of good ingredients thrown together pell-mell to produce something rather unappetizing.The idea for a good film--or five--is here somewhere, but it's so tangled up with so many other ideas none of which is ever resolved in any satisfactory way, that it's hard to see what exactly the take-away was supposed to be. Monica loves David because David loves Monica but not enough to persuade her husband to keep him around. From there everything devolves into a "please every crowd member with something or other" adventure action-flick. The film starts down one path for a while, but when it becomes clear that there isn't enough interesting material there, then it lurches in another direction before abandoning that path as well. Maybe this is a case of production fund surfeit? Not sure.I had no idea what this film was going to be about. I am not sure what I was doing in 2001, but I never read or heard anything about Artificial Intelligence. I picked up the DVD at the library under the assumption that it would offer some sort of eye-opening perspective on technology. It tries to, but falls flat because of the incoherent schmaltziness. It just doesn't work. It seemed initially that this was going to be a deep philosophical reflection on love and perhaps even a critique of selfishness and possessiveness. The idea of wanting a robot to love one's self unconditionally and unilaterally--is that really so different from getting a dog? I have to wonder. It's not really like Pascal's Wager, which exhorts would-be believers to go through the motions of religious faith, and one day they will find that they truly believe. That probably works because on some subconscious level the mind recognizes that if the person is doing all of this stuff for God, then if God doesn't exist, that can only mean that the person is flaming mad, complete with visions, voices and ubiquitous spies. But that's another story.The combination of Color Purple-style emotional string pulling and A Clockwork Orange's brazen amoralism doesn't work in this production. It's like oil and water. The movie is also too long, and the utterly gratuitous Jude Law character, to be perfectly frank, just seems like an effort to compensate for some of the vacuity of the main storyline. He plays the role of a gigolo robot--in effect, a man-shaped, walking and talking dildo. I'm not making this up.I do not recommend Artificial Intelligence. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but it's nowhere near any of the masterpieces created by Spielberg or Kubrick individually. Some of the scenes are well composed, but taken together as a work? This is truly a mess. Sometimes less is more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. starts by introducing us to a time where the world has gotten smaller for mankind. Water has risen and has engulfed much land. But as resources depleted, technology increased, and humans have found a way to cope with the circumstances. "Mechas" have been invented. They are robots that resemble our appearance and were created to perform many of our tasks."Mechas" would be useful for our economy and industry because they consume no food and need no sleep. Their purpose is to serve, and it is in our convenience that we don't need to repay them nor serve them back. Maybe a few oil changes and an occasional trip to the carwash, but that's about it.A.I. offers intriguing ideas, and Professor Hobby of Cybertronics aims to expand that idea by proposing a new robot, a new product: A child. He explains to his colleagues that this Mecha child would be designed to look, act, and love as a child, and that he would love unconditionally. Twenty months has passed, and the first of its kind is created. His name, or should I say "its" name, is David.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/ai-artificial-intelligence- movie-review/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>frustrating futuristic tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one imagines a movie combining the exemplarly skills of Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick, goosebumps could appear. Unfortunately, in this tale, it falls very frustratingly short. Osment plays a futuristic robot - one that has actual feelings. Adopted by a couple with a child that has a seemingly terminal disease, things go well a first. Then a cure is found for their 'real' child. They leave Osment out on the road as if he was a piece of litter in a very emotional scene. osment is left on his own to fend for himself and with a lot of questions but few answers. Along the way he meeets Jude Law and tries to find answers. What is frustrating is that the viewer always seems that there is more to come that the movie is holding back that something is missing. maybe if Kubrick had the chance to complete his vision, it might have been in place. as it is, it is in essence two movies: Kubrickian and Speilbergian..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen a scene here and a scene there of this movie. Every time I watched one I would think "I should pick this up some day, looks interesting". Kept saying that for years.Finally picked it up. Most of the time when you talk to someone about a movie, they ask "what was it about"? This is about so many things: the human condition, advances in technology, limits of morality, the line between real and artificial, empathy and self righteousness.A robotics company makes a robot boy. They program the boy to be able to love. Can a machine love? If it can, isn't it just as "real" as we are? Would it be moral to abandon this machine to fend for itself? How about it the machine was made to be a child? Parts of the movie will have you thinking abut these questions while enjoying the story. The "boy" has been taught fairy tales and believes himself akin to Pinocchio, beginning a search for the blue fairy that ends thousands of years in the future.Great story, great acting, great production values. I just wish there were more movies like this. It makes you think without being preachy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Check Your Logic At the Door</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to know where to begin with this movie. Exploring the potential future world of robots is something that can be very entertaining. Frankly, I think it's difficult to miss with a subject like that. There are a hundred different directions you could go. But A.I. fails. Despite Spielberg's presence, despite the strength of the actors involved, it just doesn't work. David (Osment) is a state of the art child robot designed to mimic a real child. He is basically a replacement for the sick child Martin, trapped in suspended animation. The parents Henry (Robards) and Monica (O'Connor) are offered the latest in experimental mecha technology, as a perverse way to deal with their sons likely eternal sleep. Monica quickly becomes frightened of the new child, but that fright softens into love as the movie advances at least until a cure is found for Martin. From that point on, all of David's actions are interpreted in the most negative light possible by Henry. Every action, often antagonized by Martin, is viewed as a threat to the family. That's the first sign of the countless inconsistencies that are fast approaching. Wasn't Henry the one who encouraged the replacement child? Henry asserts at one point that "if David is capable of love, he may also be capable of hate." Yet in the next breath he's suggesting David isn't real, and is easily disposable for the sake of the family. He seems to both recognize David is capable of human feelings, yet has an irrational hatred and assumption that David is inhuman. And getting David was his idea to boot. I realize that a movie is going to have inconsistencies, and I'm normally okay with that, but it gets worse.(As an aside, it's never made clear in this movie whether robots are even capable of hurting humans. David's robot guide (see below) in the movie is assumed to be the murderer of a human. But no humans are actually harmed by robots during the movie. Heck, the murderer was at the scene of the crime, and the police assume it is the robot? I doubt even the most ardent robot hater wouldn't at least, I don't know, investigate? Can't they look at a robot's memory?) It is finally decided David must be put down, but instead his mother releases him into the wild. So begins David's adventure.As the movie advances, David meets many characters in this new world. One of the most memorable is the anti-robot group that tears the mechas apart for the entertainment of crowds that look perfectly suited for a monster truck rally (I say that sarcastically, as I'm not a big fan of stereotypes). These anti-robot haters are fully willing to kill countless robots, but one of what I can only assume are the event directors insists David is too well-built to simply be killed. I assume he wasn't a true believer.Fast forward many adventures later, and David meets his maker. In the process, David discovers he's not that special. He is one of many Davids ( one of which he murders) and throws himself into the ocean in despair. I realize why they did this. David needs to experience the range of human experiences love, hate, depression, joy, etc. But something just seems off about David's sudden burst of rage and subsequent leap into the ocean. Anyway, as he sinks, he at last finds the Blue Fairy in the underwater graveyard that was once Coney Island. He begs the fairy to make him a real boy for the next two thousand years. Because he's talking to a statue, David simply repeats his request until he apparently shuts down. The movie should have stopped there. I think the ending would have salvaged it, if the message of the movie had been how wrong it was to create a being stuck between two worlds. If the final scene had been the eternal plea of David beneath the sea, I probably still would be here complaining, but I'd be whining less. But the movie continues.We soon see the future is populated by super-advanced androids. All humans have died after the world froze (Future people don't have central heating). Yes, I know that the world freezing over would be devastating, but with all the technology available no humans survived? I think a nuclear war, a deadly disease, anything else would have been more believable. Anyway, the robots wake David up and at last give him his dream. His mother loves him and they spend one final day together, just the two of them. Because in the future, robots can bring people back with all of their memories, but only for one day. It's explained away with the clich space-time continuum explanation, used in the most unbelievable manner I've ever seen. I know some have suggested the creatures David encounters are aliens, but I don't think there's much doubt they are robots. Jude Law's character implies robots will inherit the Earth someday and the creatures suggest they are not capable of the same level of creativity as humans. I don't see why an alien race would be incapable of emotion and creativity.Overall, the movie had some strong points. The visuals are stunning, as expected. The questions it raises are provocative. But the execution is way off, especially for Spielberg. The continuous leaps we have to make are just too much. I know I, Robot wasn't the critic darling of A.I., but I think it gave a much more believable treatment of the same questions A.I. raises. It was much more consistent as well. I don't expect science fiction to give me complete realism, but it has to be consistent within the universe it creates. A.I. failed at that way too many times. I, Robot may not be Ebert's favorite, but if you want to see a compelling look into the difficult questions of artificial intelligence, look there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An initially promising, but rapidly declining mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much ado was made about the merging of the artistically opposite approaches of Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg on a science fiction film, but if Kubrick had lived and the end results would still have been anything like this finished product then they should never have pooled their talents. Basically a high-tech updating of the Pinnochio legend set in the future. A young couple whose son lies in a comatose state is allowed to road-test an android that resembles a young boy (played by Haley Joel Osment). The father seems oddly uninvolved in the project he initiated, but the mother (Frances O'Connor) blunders ahead and speaks the words that will allow the android to bond to her. Naturally, the couple's son regains consciousness and the android, who now has all of the personality and emotions of a real boy is no longer required. Rather than having him destroyed, the mother abandons him in the wilderness and the android embarks on a physical and psychological journey to become "real" so his mother will love him. The opening segments are cold and antiseptic, but intriguing and offer some of the most restrained directorial work that Spielberg has ever done. After the android's abandonment, the film starts to spin out of control. The meandering journey through the wilderness is pointless and starts to wear on the viewer. The addition of a companion in the form of an on-the-run hustler robot named Gigolo Joe (an oddly asexual Jude Law) fails to develop in any conceivable way. By the time the film seems to be staggering towards a climax, it has yet a third jarring tone shift that allows it to play past at least two logical conclusions into a third unendurable hour. The final segment/conclusion comes out of no where and fails to successfully address or explore any of the deep issues that the opening act put forth. The final result is an initially promising film that is ultimately unfocused,dramatically uneven in tone and in desperate need of major editing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Realistic Future Prediction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie yesterday night and i was amazed by the Future Fiction presented in this film. The Fiction or the Future of Mankind predicted in this film looks far more realistic than other Fiction films like I-Robot which presented Negative Perspective of Robotics. This film gives more realistic view of future robots. The Weather effects and the submerged New york City is Awesome. The film very beautifully presents the future Ice Age where almost entire earth is frozen and aliens are digging the ice to know about their ancestors (Mankind). A must watch fiction for a Fiction lover and yes the Spielberg Fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Monica and Henry have a sick child so they adopt a robot or mecha child named David to whom they love. When their human son, Martin, recovers he comes home only to set up David for misbehaviors that he did not commit. Despite Monica's pleas with Henry, David is left to fend for himself in the woods with Teddy. David thinks that if he can find the blue fairy, he can become a real live boy and Monica will love him, play with him and tuck him in at night. On the search for the blue fairy, he meets another mecha named gigolo Joe and they go to make him a real live boy.The thing that I loved the absolute most about this movie was the special effects. I think that they are the best in any movie ever made, especially the scene with the French Nanny. All the other special effects are awesome and real to me as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has ANY film on IMDb received more comments? (Okay. "Brokeback Mountain," since</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Numerous sci-fi films (from the silent "Metropolis" on) ask us to FEAR robots."A.I." asks us to love and identify with them. Many audiences cannot make the leap -- though as bioengineering extends human life and replaces worn-out parts, that's exactly where we're headed.That theme alone -- replacing God-made humans with Man-made ones -- cuts to the heart of "A.I." in ways that are profoundly disturbing for many people, especially those who are deeply religious. This same theme has ALWAYS disturbed such audiences, from "The Golem" through "Frankenstein." Yet NEVER, to my knowledge, has the theme been extended to the conclusion it reaches here.EVERY theme in this powerfully produced epic is disturbing, from the opening "dark waters" submerging much of the earth resulting from global warming, to the notion of sexual relations with robots (Jude Law's "Gigolo Joe" -- another, less savory, robot with whom we're required to identify and sympathize), to treating robots as slaves and endlessly harvesting their parts to keep them "serving" us.The imagery throughout is astonishing, and intensely emotional. On and on, powerful images accumulate and evoke equally powerful feelings, fears and thoughts."But they're only machines!" we keep defensively reminding ourselves, afraid to go where Spielberg and these themes are leading.One frightening, fateful moment (where David, desperate for a loving souvenir of his human "mother", sneaks into her bed and cuts off a locket of her hair, which falls in slow motion into Teddy's hand -- Teddy being a robot companion for David exactly as David is a robot child to his "mother") -- is perhaps the most emotionally demanding in the entire film, until the final 20 minutes.Mother awakens, understandably terrified at this robot son with the scissors in her bed -- realizing he might just as soon have stabbed her, had he "malfunctioned." WE know David is there out of simple love and desperation. WE also know we would be equally horrified in the same situation.Spielberg, having brilliantly led us to accept a super-robot that can be "imprinted" to love, as a child substitute (and brilliantly performed by the best "child" actor in films, bar none) . . . Spielberg now demands that we simultaneously identify with our human "fear" of our potentially malfunctioning creations, no matter how wonderfully engineered.This remarkable scene requires an unheard-of split identification in the audience's psyche: we love the little robot boy and his robot Teddy and we understand his yearning for his mother's "real" love. It's not his "fault": SHE'S the one who chose to imprint him so he would love her as a "real" boy. We love Teddy, who's David's faithful companion -- his only "real" companion, it will turn out, though Teddy, too, is a robot. And we understand the Mother's fright and subsequent realization that this "machine" named David has to be abandoned.That's a lot for any director to ask of an audience in one brief scene.It's followed by the abandonment scene in the forest, which critics universally claimed was almost too emotionally painful to watch, so brilliant was Osment's playing.Now Spielberg commits to one of the most disturbing plots ever filmed. From here on, audiences are required to identify emotionally with three robots -- Gigolo Joe, David and Teddy. Humans increasingly become "the enemy." Ugly "humanity" is repeatedly contrasted with purer "mechas." Thus begins the chasm that will ever divide viewers of "A.I." One man-made creation (global warming) will destroy God-made humanity and drown "civilization" beneath the dark waters that opened the film, while another (robots) will preserve us, at least in circuitry for future generations of "things" to study.David and Teddy finally rest alone, underwater, at the base of the Blue Fairy statue that once occupied the entrance to a ride at Coney Island.Why the Blue Fairy? Because David first heard his "Mother" read "Pinnochio" and understood the Blue Fairy had the power to bring the wooden puppet to life. Finding her is David's quest throughout the film. And once he does . . . he waits.David and Teddy remain in their sealed amphibipod under the waters for 2000 years, while "people" (we, the audience) become extinct.They're finally discovered and "rescued" by what might be "humans" 2000 years down the road . . . or aliens . . . or even more advanced robots. Who knows? The popcorn crowd would head for the concession stand if they weren't glued to their seats.They miss Spielberg's final setup and payoff, as the "things" discover that David the robot has the last memories of living human beings in his circuitry, and begin recording them.Then, in a moment that literally made me leap (silently and in near tears) from my seat -- Teddy reveals the locket of David's "mother's" hair he's loyally kept for David for 20 centuries, and the "things" realize they can recreate her -- but only for 24 hours -- from its DNA.That hair is the last human thing on earth. It will yield the last human recollections on earth. And it will finally bring David what he has sought since she "imprinted" him: "real" love from the only mother he's ever known . . . if only for one day . . . making David (and us, who've identified with him) "real" to himself at last . . . 2000 years since we entered the theatre and these lives . . . "the place where dreams are born." One of the most emotionally, intellectually, philosophically challenging films ever made."Artificial" man-made intelligence? If mankind can manufacture machines as loving and "human" as David, why can we not save ourselves from our "God-given" destructiveness? That, finally, is the blasphemous conundrum implied by "A.I." and the reason it so polarizes audiences, and forever will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick films always had the problem of being misunderstood for their time. That I believe is due to Kubrick reaching out for broader visions and questions and answers that simplistic audience expectations do not see. As an example, while "A Clockwork Orange" shocked and outraged due to the ultra violence, very few of the viewers realized the true nature of the movie, the morality of the loss of choice.A.I. works on many levels, with the problem being that the main audiences today are raised on a pablum of 15 minute talentless stars and copycat story lines. When presented with a movie which has many moral and philosophical questions, they simply walk out of the theater.A.I. was the perfect mesh of many talents coming together at the right time. It is a shame that Kubrick did not live to see the final cut. By passing the torch onto Spielberg, he helped give the movie the heart that Kubrick himself was not capable of giving it. Some may claim it to be a schizophrenic pairing, but I consider it to be perfection. More depth and from many angles.Sure, the story may not be original. Our responsibilities to those who we love and who love us, Pinnochio, and the story of the civil war and slavery. But those are touchstones to build the entire story on.Haley Joel Osment proves himself to be literally the finest child actor who ever existed by carrying this technically and emotionally demanding film. The audience that is capable of grasping the concepts and understanding of this film (as opposed to the other kind of audience who walks out and goes to catch the next Paris Hilton feature as the height of their intellectual capacity). The audience who can understand and identify with the concepts will be able to travel with David through his journey and sufferings as an innocent lost child who lost the love he cares for the most.10-20 years from now, this is a movie that will be very much a requirement in film schools or philosophy classes. It is a true masterpiece that is ahead of it's time, and history will bear it to the rightful place it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Profound vision of a believable future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who sits down for a movie very rarely - and would rather do almost anything than waste an hour or two on a forgettable one - this proved to be a rare and unexpected experience, a journey into the future that explores ultimate questions and even attempts to answer them. Although Kubrick didn't complete it, I credit him with the profound insights about the human condition that mark this film out as exceptional. His gift for imagining future worlds is unsurpassed. It belongs with, but goes far beyond, 2001 and Clockwork Orange in realizing a fully believable future that is compelling viscerally, emotionally, and intellectually. Somehow, Spielberg didn't destroy it's thematic integrity. Although the ending looks like it's going to an absurdist nowhere in the great Spielberg tradition, it somehow works and ultimately has the power to fulfill the promise of the movie's fantastic premise and vision. Somehow the whole achieves believability and transcendence. Not only does machine intelligence rival and then threaten human intelligence - in the end machine intelligence assimilates and preserves human intelligence. It doesn't really matter that humankind has destroyed itself and met its end - no tears will be shed for this - it's that human consciousness lives on and is cherished by the highly evolved, spiritual entities that are heir to human and machine intelligence. The return to life of a human for just one day - although in the fairytale tradition - doesn't scuttle the story, but provides an emotional pivot point - a way to cry for one human, if not for all humanity. There is no way to laugh this movie off. It will stay with you and haunt you for many moons.</fullReview>

The story line was boring as hell and it looked so good in the previews as well but I suppose its expected to see all the best bits in the previews when the rest of the film makes you die a little inside. However, I'm gonna be a bit fair and say that it's not all bad, there were some pretty good visual effects, the CGI has been used to some great effect, and the direction from Spielberg was good (as is the norm.). Still I thought this film was terrible and I don't say that about many films.

I have a problem with this. If a mother cannot accept their children for what they really are ..better or worse than David would have have been better being accepted by someone else along his journey. The ending also made no sense. I would probably recommend this film for people who like movies that make you think. But this is not a film I'm crazy to watch over and over again. Hopefully there will be no sequel, if there is i hope the film has better meaning..for the sake of mankind.</fullReview>

I really hated the ending, because I hate movies that make me cry. The only actor that had any shining moments in this movie was Jude Law. He saved what is any good in this movie. As for Haley Joel Osmont, I think that not blinking at all had caused him to be distracted from acting. Shocking! An actor acting, imagine that. All he does is whine about the blue fairy. He annoyed me so much in this movie. As for that thing with all the humans destryoing the robots, that was just disgusting. Even if they are robots, it still disturbed me to watch them getting acid thrown at them and being burned on a wheel.' Jude Law, you are my hero in this movie.

		<fullReview>This film is extremely beautiful in it's use of color, especially in Rouge City. The shot of the "full moon on the rise" grabs me as well. The effects are also very impressive regarding the Mecha characters, but the movie is at war with itself. Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick have very different styles that do not mesh well. Spielberg is known for big budget summer movies while Kubrick is known for rough portraits of ugly reality. Kubrick was right to hand this movie to Spielberg, but Steven was too busy making spectacular visuals and paying tribute to Kubrick to make a good film. My biggest problem is the evil humans. We are made to relate to David, because he is more human. The thing is Haley Joal Osment plays the robot too well. He is super creepy and I didn't like him at all. I wanted at least one nice human. I think that Jude Law as Gigolo Joe and Jack Angel(Darkwing Duck!) as the voice of Teddy overshadow Osment's David, because they are more lifelike than he is. Joe's strut and Teddy's concern trump David's brooding. When Teddy and Joe aren't on screen the movie crawls along. William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson, and Enrico Colantoni are good in small roles, while Robin William, Ben Kingsley, Chris Rock, and Meryl Streep provide voices. The best thing about this movie is that Spielberg must have learned something as Minority Report is a much more coherent and complete movie.*Teddy: I am not a toy.*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Potential spoilers aheadThis movie had a good idea, and approach, with exception to the ending. It may be that the ending was too disjointed with what came before. The CGI was done well, and the acting was above average. The story will make you think of our prejudices and why our fears seem to project those prejudices. So that aspect of the story was clear, and made relevant to society today. My approach to movie watching is how does it keep me interested. With this movie, I was interested until after he reached the lab in old NY. It just went downhill it seemed. I was waiting for the movie to end. I can't explain it, nor do I have an explanation as to how the ending could have been better. Maybe if they showed more of a connection to the 'racial' prejudice that was twined into the first part of the story, weather it be a resolution to the problem, or a reminder that maybe it will always be there. The ending just lost me in that I understood it, but just lost interest in it.</fullReview>

They didn't need to make it complicated. It could have been the most simple and yet exciting film of the year but that's not what they went for. I think the main problem the writers felt they had with making it simple would have been how long it was. A movie made for adults as this was is generally expected to be around about 2 hours and I think the writers felt inclined to do that. While the movie was shocking the acting was superb. Especially from young Hayley Joel Osment who I'm told didn't blink throughout the movie which is just outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hard movie to make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me a movie must be believable/realistic, and at the same time interesting/emotional to be a good movie. Movies that take place in the future are much harder to do than the movies that take place in the past or present. The easiest to make and usually the best are movies which are happening in the past because past is known to us and movies are more real, more believable. Also movies which are made of true story, or are partly fictious but are happening in a story that really happened are more believable, because creators of the movie were forced to make sure that movie was as real as possible (Titanic, Gladiator, Ben Hur, many oscar winners). Movies which take place in the future are usually bad, and not believable. Moviemakers allways make people look like they are from mideval or caveman times or something, because they can't think of any better way to show them. Like Time Travel movie. But future scenes of A.I. are made quite believable and good, especially artificial creatures at the end of the movie. Though I didn't like the scene where people were burning AI machines, it just wasn't too believable, and not very pleasant or interesting to watch. Another thing which was hard to do in this movie was how AI creatures behaved. Because that's hard to predict, like future. So again they had to make sure these creatures were believable. So this movie sure wasn't easy to do, and usually movies with no action don't make so much money, so looking at all this they made a good movie, but it's not my favorite movie of all time. In future this movie will remain known, and people will watch it, especially because people's interest in AI will rise. If you have any interest in artificial intelligence then this is the movie not to miss, for sure. I wish there were more movies with artificial intelligence in them. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie That Refused To End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supremo Spielberg has long been a favourite target of those who resent his talent and success, and has often suffered unfair criticism of his works (especially those containing more adult themes - SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, SCHINDLER'S LIST). However, I have to admit that this time he deserves most of the brickbats aimed at this piece of work.The possibilities of the story Spielberg has crafted - which closely mirrors the Pinocchio fairy tale to which it repeatedly refers - are almost unlimited; from the basic premise of the parents of a comatose boy `adopting' David as a surrogate son the tale can go in any number of directions, and Spielberg seems at first to be doing a good job of keeping a fantastic notion rooted in some form of recognisable reality. The initial difficulties of bringing a robot child into their home - and the implications such an act implies with reference to the condition of their son - is handled well, as is the gradual marginalizing of David following the miraculous recovery of the couple's real son. At this point you really feel for David's plight as you realise what he is incapable of understanding: `she didn't love you because of who you are but because of how you make her feel' Jude Law's gigolo Joe later tells David - and that is where the movie should have concentrated its efforts: the social and emotional impact of creating artificial intelligence, and the inescapable limits of any relationship between `mecha' and `orga', instead, Spielberg's story becomes obsessed with mirroring Pinocchio's desire to become a real live boy and the journey on which his search takes him, and he quickly loses grip on audience interest/involvement. There's too much of the kid in Spielberg to pull off an adult fable based on a children's fairy tale, which means we're subjected to the cartoon-ish Doctor Know, and the cute but inappropriate Teddy. I guess one of the drawbacks of becoming a moviemaking legend while you're still alive is that there's nobody to rein you in when self-indulgence is tainting your vision. That ending - that long, long ending - is an absolute disaster. Everybody but Spielberg knows where the film should end: 2000 years before it actually does. At least then the film would have gained some credibility (in fact, it would have been a very cool ending that would have made a lot of sense), but Spielberg chooses to provide a veritable arsenal of ammunition to those who accuse him of being an arch-sentimentalist.If you have to watch a movie about a toy-boy who wishes he was a real live boy rent Pinocchio, because this effort will leave you sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat down to A.I. expecting a movie full of wonder and amazement. I got that at times. At other times, I wanted to turn it off. When it was finally over, I really wanted to like this film but I just felt like I was in a ship on stormy seas and was seasick from it all.The movie starts out in a very somber tone. It explains how the earth is suffering the effects of global warming and the creation of robots, specifically one who can love. David, the loving Robot, is purchased by a family whose own son is on life support. Soon enough, the son improves and the mother decides she doesn't need David anymore. So she drops David and Teddy (the best and warmest character in the movie) in the woods and David goes on a journey to become a real boy and to earn the love of his mother.This is a very sad way to start the film, but it is then that we start to see a little of a "quest" in the movie (a la Wizard of Oz) and it begins to feel magical. Then, we get depressed again as we are introduced to a "pleasure robot" and how a woman is afraid of his "functional abilities." This totally lurches the movie from a kind of magical quality to in your face smut. Then, we see a "flesh fair" in which defective robots are destroyed in an arena to the delight of the humans. Then, we are taken to a city which has buildings in the shapes of women in provocative poses. I knew this was a pet project of Kubrick but I didn't know a lot of his perverted imagery and characters would be included in the film. Once we get past that, then we have a few more magical moments and then we are introduced to more dark images and finally, more magical moments. By the time it is all over, I was exhausted. Did I like the movie? I liked the Spielberg "moments" but I disliked the Kubrick ones. This maybe what they had intended but to me, it made for a very uneven and overall unsatisfying film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do have an aversion to utter schmuck, sentimentality and pretentious protection of the american myth that charagterises Spielberg films. However, most of them do look really good, have reasonable acting and plots which whilst usually drawn out ad nauseum do make sense. However, AI barely has these redeeming characteristics and watching on DVD I was soon worrying about a slight sound defect on my TV so uninvolving was the film. Ok Teddy was cute (and would have been better in Toy Story) but please I cared little for the rest of the characters, whether meccas or origs. This story could have been a gritty exploration of the future (a glossy version of Blade Runner)but Spielberg bailed out to commercialism and emotional manipulation which surely by passed every conceivable (discerning) audience. 3 out of 10 and it only gets that because of Teddy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to be amazed, moved or entertained but I was quite disappointed. While there will a few interesting and thought provoking concepts introduced at the beginning of the movie, I felt the movie did not effective deal with the questions proposed. In addition, I found the pace to be somewhat plodding given that the movie might be interpreted as a travelogue of a near future society. The end was totally unsatisfying and trite. My wife felt it was the worst movie she has ever seen. I thought some of the visual effects to be interesting and the questions posed by artificial intelligence to be compelling. This movie did not add any new or different information to that debate. Basically, another rehash of Pinocchio story without charm or imagination. I am glad I only rented the film instead of seeing it at the movie theater. Not a must-see, but if you can see it for one or two dollars, go for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big sci-fi misfire for Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**AI: Artificial Intelligence is well-made and well-acted in almost every detail except the script. Haley Joel Osment is obviously everyone's favorite child actor of the past five or six years, and he does a remarkable job here, although his character growth is almost nil (more on that later, and it's not his fault). Jude Law plays the charming Gigolo Joe, a pleasure Mecha who stumbles into trouble at a murder scene and by hooking up with David (Osment). Frances O'Connor is also very compelling as Monica, David's 'mommy', who abandons him in the woods after David unintentionally almost causes the death of her natural son. Even William Hurt, who I think is overrated, does a very nice job here.However ... this movie shares David's problem: it has no real soul, only glurgy, false emotions that make you want to believe it does. First, for a science fiction movie, it gets science appallingly wrong. The setup for the movie is that global warming has caused the polar caps to melt, lifting sea levels to the point where the great coastal cities are submerged. OK, fine, it's a premise, although not a particularly plausible one if you get your science from other sources than Susan Sarandon. However, at the end of the second hour, we're told that the oceans freeze in what must be the Earth's worst ever Ice Age! How in the world (pardon the pun!) do you get from being so hot that the polar caps melt, to an Ice Age of monstrous proportions, IN 2000 YEARS??? Global changes take eons to develop, and while global warming might only take a couple of centuries -- maybe -- global freezing would take hundreds of thousands of years, probably millions. Earth has had Ice Ages in its past, but not to the point of extinguishing all life, and humans (as a group) would be expected to migrate to habitable areas, not simply freeze to death like deer in the headlights.Second, as other reviewers have pointed out, the climactic scene, after two-and-a-quarter hours, is where Monica is reconstituted from a lock of hair clipped from Monica's head while David was living with her. There is a completely laughable explanation from an alien explaining how her memories will be reconstituted along with her, but that's not the real problem -- the real problem is that hair DOES NOT CONTAIN DNA. Only the hair ROOT has DNA. Hair is simply a protein (and so are fingernails, the other substance suggested by the alien). And here's another thing: if all they need is DNA, then they certainly should find abundant samples of it for humans, although not necessarily a specific individual ... all you need is a body, and every cemetery has lots of those. They could 'meet' as many humans as they desired, and wouldn't that have been a switch -- having them reanimate humans as if they were robots, and David helping them to control the experiment?Instead, through the bad elementary science, we are given a Pinocchio story that cannot possibly end well. David travels the world looking for the Blue Fairy that will make him into a Real Boy, and Osment makes this quest heartbreaking, to be sure. After barely escaping a Flesh Fair (sort of a Disney version of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome) where Mechas are destroyed, he goes with Gigolo Joe to Rouge City to see Dr. Know, a Mecha encyclopedia of knowledge (Robin Williams), who directs him to a submerged Manhattan. Eventually he meets his maker, Dr. Hobby, and discovers that he is not unique -- he chances upon assembly lines of Davids waiting to be sold to childless couples. David, who was made in the image of Hobby's dead son, does not take well to this; he destroys another David-bot who wanted to be his friend, and Dr. Hobby seems peculiarly unconcerned with David's feelings. At this stage, we would expect an intelligent character to have made some self-discoveries, such as:* I am not a human being, but a machine * I am not a unique machine, but the first prototype of a mass production model * Humans will never love me like one of their own, or even like Mecha Teddy, because I am a threat (just like the other David was to him)And we think this is what happens, too, because David tries to drown himself, although he is saved by Gigolo Joe. But David sees the Blue Fairy at Coney Island, and winds up trapped there, praying for centuries for her to make him a real boy, even though at this point it would kill him. Then the world freezes and it's 2000 years before aliens free him up. Aliens, I might add, with television screens for heads.Pardon me, and my long explanation, but this movie is empty of soul and purpose, although it's full of Spielberg quirks: absent/uncaring father, abandonment and/or loneliness in childhood, overdeveloped fantasy world, yearning for parent's love, robots, cuddly toys, and of course aliens. When the aliens first appeared, my wife said, "They even threw in the kitchen sink, didn't they?" Yes they did, and the ending was simply another throw-in, although Osment and O'Connor made it seem magical and heartbreaking. This is episodic moviemaking, where things happen only because they happen and little reason is provided for the viewer to care much.I give this soggy mess a 6, because the acting was top-drawer and the cinematography was excellent. The script, however, is a huge disappointment. (See Minority Report for a much better futuristic Spielberg movie.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*********Spoiler Warning*************I heard that the reason Kubrick stalled out on this movie was he couldn't resolve how the character of Gigolo Joe could go from lusty lover of woman and streetwise hustler to a scout guide for David and his teddy bear. Spielberg's answer to this dilemna was simple, he didn't. Joe and David are practically in two different movies, as is most of the plot. The first half is largely Spielberg, the second half of the movie is more Kubrick.The result? A movie that reaches high and at times hits hard, but for the most part is very uneven and never really gels as to what it's supposed to be. David is in Spielberg's eyes a modern Pinnocchio, trying desperately to garner his mother's love and approval. In the overall schema Kubrick is casting his eye on the state of humanity, as we unwittingly make too many Mecha to replace all of us Orga. The end sums it all up without satisfaction. The robots have taken over, although as with several viewers I thought they were aliens the first time I saw it, and David finally gets his wish to receive his mother's love--but she's already dead and love and life has ceased to exist. I really wonder what was supposed to happen in the end after the end, would David just lie here forever in the dark, or did he shut himself down in some way? It didn't seem as if he transcended or moved beyond his circumstances as much as he got what he finally wanted, which considering the circumstances was hopelessly myopic. He seemed to stay perpetually a child, which made me question how "real" his love was if all he could ever be was what he was programmed for. A movie that raises a lot of questions, but sadly not the profound ones that were intended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted so much to love this movie. At the end, I thought Haley Joel Osment was wonderful, and Spielberg should be kicked for making such self-serving garbage! *NOTE: POSSIBLE SPOILERS*Spielberg's AI failed because he tried to do too much with Kubrick's ideas, and consequently there were way too many "messages" in this movie.Humans destroy the world. Humans like to use things and throw them away. Machines have a life. A mother's love is the most precious thing. Children can be evil. Humans are afraid of what they don't understand. You can't replace love with machines. Be careful of the stories you tell your children. Aliens are the smartest beings in the universe because they "get it".I had hoped for a brilliant vision of the future, even if it was dark ala "Blade Runner". What I got was a beautifully shot, self-indulgent and confusing mish-mash. Did the tortuous scene where Monica left David in the forest really need to go on as long as it did? It was unnecessarily long...the point was made in the first 3 minutes. And did Teddy's voice creep anyone out but me? He sounded like Hal in "2001", just smaller. *Sigh*. I'll just have to go watch "Blade Runner", "The Matrix" or even "The Fifth Element" to get a cohesive vision of the future, no matter how bleak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tries to play with your understanding of what is human by bending the distinctions between man and machine. After all, if man is only a biological machine, then who are we to say that a machine is not human? Confused? Sure, if your understanding of what a human is, then being misled by a "shuckster" is easy for them to mislead you.The production is superb, the acting is splendid, the other tasks just as well done. However, the whole story leaves you with mixed feelings leaving nothing defined - thus aiding the "shuckster" to confuse you further. (I'm not sure who is the "shuckster": the writer, screenplay writer, or the director. So I'll leave it just as vague as the movie is indefinite.) The impressionable are always the first to go.What might be confused as a "slow/non-action" movie is actually a play that wades through a melancholy state from start to finish. It is as a slow Sonata - well written and executed - but not to everyone's taste. Some like rock music, some like rap, some like both. If you're ok with slow, pensive, pondering movies, then you'll like this one.I found it very good to watch, but for my taste I like more substance.

		<fullReview>I read that Stanley Kubrick had the original concept but it's Spielberg who did the work. I am glad Kubrick got almost no credit (only as dedicatee) because this is NO Kubrick, a mere Kubrick wannabe with over the top special effects and lame narration. Hard to believe there are people actually compare it to "2001: A Space Odyssey." The ending of "2001: A Space Odyssey" is spectacular, inspiring yet complex; Kubrick intentionally left many things unexplained to provoke viewers' own interpretation and enlightenment. This one has an ending that is superficial, tedious, "explained," and supposedly semi-happy (Hollywood style) ultimately as empty as what David got. A feeble imitation of the Master at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad hair day for Mr Spielberg &lt;WARNING: SPOILERS!&gt;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, the good news first! A.I. possesses an off-beat structure designed to fit in 135 minutes of screentime, 15 minutes beyond the conventional beats of the 4-act Hollywood stock screenplay. After the first act ends at 30 min, there are ever growing complications in each of the subsequent 15 min sequences, and then an upturn from 75 min to 90 min. Thereafter, the downturn from 90 min to 105 min, and that's the end of the Second Act, stretched from its usual 60 min to 75 min, without any noticeable discomfort. Thereafter follows the stock third Act.A.I. starts well, and continues to grow strong till the 60 mark. Thereafter, it loses its way in humdrum action, but there is another interesting sequence from 90 min to 105 min. Unfortunately, the third Act is pitiful in its predictability and pedestrian construction.These are the problems associated with the screenplay, beyond the pale of that great director who can only build upon the blue-print he's received. But, wait, Mr. Spielberg isn't in the clear yet. There's that scene in the climax, when the aliens talk of spacetime and the impossibility of reviving humans. Here's when Mr. Spielberg forgot the golden dictum, "show, don't tell"; and the aliens indulge in wordy descriptions that are embarassing to the point of cinematical absurdity. What is worse, these aliens are shown as semi-transparent creatures who can visualise the thoughts of others. And, Mr. Spielberg puts words, not pictures, in their mouths! How the mighty have fallen!So, Mr. Spielberg goofed up on this one, but that doesn't mean he isn't any less than a profoundly great director. We'd be better off tearing apart the screenplay. For starters, I have serious reservations about the character played by Jude Law. Perhaps, he shows the physical side of the interactions involving love between humans and robots. If so, then its a thread that never developed. Far better would've been to cut out the single and inessential sex scene showing Jude Law servicing a human female. That would've made it child friendly, and the family audience would've trooped in by droves. What's the director doing, plotting Pinnochio on the one hand, and just when the families are agog with wonder and already have one foot in the theatre, scaring them off by the ludicrous sex scene. Okay, so the sex scene isn't ludicrous, its a great line, but it could've served better in a hundred thousand other movies that contain sex scenes by the million gazillion. That single blunder sounded the death-knell of this film, since the mature audience wouldn't in any case relate to a child robot, and we haven't actually reached the stage of civilisation when we can empathise with our computers or toys as possessing "souls". Its more of a fantasy that appeals to children, but that sex scene scared them off, Mr. Spielberg.</fullReview>

When Mr. Spielberg made "The Contender", 2 years ago, he absolutely BULLIED the genius actor, Gary Oldman, because of some political disagreement...it was THEN that I realized that Mr. Spielberg sold OUT his love of art, for politics. "Artificial Intelligence" is another example of Spielberg's selling out. I have absolutely NO idea what he had in mind, when he went over the top with this story.

"A.I." is not only long and boring but its' themes are pure plagiarism from other and better made films. The film steals from "Blade Runner" and "Bicentennial Man", among others. In fact, if you've seen "Bicentennial Man" then you've seen a better film.A.I. is sappy, sentimental, boring, slow, depressing, and full of plot holes. Now, don't get me wrong, I enjoy sentimental and sappy stuff but this just simply stunk. The idea that the polar ice caps have melted and have flooded coastal areas, including Manhattan, works to the contrast of the films' attempt to create a sense of reality. So my advice is, skip this one and instead go watch something that won't make you want to kill yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FIRST to all: to all of the "Gene Siskles" out there that depict themselves to be mensa material - GROW UP. I don't go to movies to see "Schindler's List" every time that I go and that would speak for the majority. While I THOROUGHLY enjoyed "Othello" with Lawrence Fishburn, I can relax a bit, as I assume Anthony Hopkins did to star in it, and enjoy a film like "Bad Company" for what it is - an entertaining story.Films are designed, PRIMARILY, for ENTERTAINMENT. If one would like to indulge in "entertainment" that's thought provoking and art induced, may I suggest a good BOOK or a PLAY. I HATE it when people [see edipisreks review in this section] want to scold the rest of the world for not "seeing" the "genius" in art when that art doesn't depict what's REAL. I am a stage improviser, lyricist, and artist. While I can peruse the Art Institute here in Chicago and enjoy a Monet, I have always found the work of Picasso to be positively horrid. The same applies to Andy Worhal, while Dali is most interesting. You can't blame the majority of the planet for not "seeing" the point of color blocked soup cans. People like "edipisreks" want film to be like THEATER. Theater is entertainment designed to translate a story and "fool" the audience into believing that the actors are who they are depicting. FILM is a genre designed to do the same thing with the ADDED feature of taking us some places we can NEVER go virtually, like to a galaxy far, far away, or swinging from a whip across a chasm like Indiana Jones.NOW?about A.I.: Films CAN be designed to be thought provoking if the film is MARKETED that way. "A.I." was not. It was shrouded in mystery for hype's sake with the poster shot , SMACKING of "E.T.", was released. As an AVID science fiction fan, that logo and the trailer lead me to believe that the movie was going to be interesting. What little was shown certainly looked like my kind of movie [Bladerunner is my favorite].This is another one of those movies that the people like to call a "Fable" these days. "Nightmare On Elm Street", "A Clockwork Orange", "Edward Scissor Hands", "Vanilla Sky" RUBBISH! As for you trend followers, like many people that I perform with, file "Water For Chocolate", "Natural Born Killers", and " Boogie Nights" on the same shelf-HORSE $H!T.A.I. had Bladerunner's setting and started a several stories that never ended. I was, basically, a protracted sci-fi rendition of Pinocchio and it KNEW that. When Gigolo Joe hits the "submerge" button on the Amphibicopter David enters what appears to be, the possible remnants of Coney Island that contain a Pinocchio Land of some sort. Perhaps this is Spielberg's way of letting us off the hook if, for some reason within 145 minutes, we DIDN'T get the correlation. I am VERY glad that I saw this @ a friend's house for free and saved my money. That would have been the cost of TWO tickets for myself and my girlfriend who LOVES science fiction as well. Quite honestly, I'm frightened for "Minority Report"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a huge disappointment. Another confirmation of the fact that Spielberg should stick with fast and fun action fare like Indiana Jones, rather than intellectual material. This movie is disjointed and schizophrenic, just like Saving Private Ryan. It seems to be directed by several different persons. Themes are introduced and left underdeveloped, and other themes are overstated. I didnt understand the Gigolo Joe character at all, the whole sexual theme is undeveloped. Where this movie also surprisingly fails is in the production design and sets. I never get the sense of being in an actual place. The flesh fare is like something out of a cheesy B-science fiction movie, and the ridiculous bikeriders are mindboggingly unoriginal. The Pinoccio references are overstated and way too many throughout the movie. The Sin City (or whatever its called) is a flat CGI background with no depth whatsoever. Blade Runners production design is still a towering milestone, even though it was made over twenty years ago. The only sequence with atmosphere and sense of place is the short ride through the flooded NYC, which is quite effective, and some of the moments in the final act. I get the feeling that this whole production was rushed, which is sad considering the time Kubrick spent developing it. I hope Minority Report will be a comeback for Spielberg, its seems more like his type of material.</fullReview>

I was so excited because the plot had this mystery surrounding it that just fascinated me, but when the end credits rolled you could imagine my disappointment that it turned out to be a remake of Pinnochio set in the future. I will agree that the film had great acting all around and that the visuals were amazing, but not even those two things could save the film from it's slow and predictable pace. Now, I love a slow, thought provoking movie as much as the next film buff, but this one was just to much in my opinion. A.I. just doesn't match the greatness of Spielberg's first Sci-Fi film "Close Encounters of the Third Kind". I actually believe that if Kubrick had lived to direct this project that I might of loved it. But, with Spielberg it just didn't work. However, I did love the character of Teddy, the most interesting character of the movie in my opinion.Final Grade: ** (out of 5 stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS WITHIN I didn't care much for A.I. and my summary of the movie will also include what I didn't care for. We first start with an AI-prof and a group of well dressed researchers discussing how to make a boy genuinely love someone and whether that love can be requited by a human. What, this discussion *never* took place before? AI-prof makes such a boy (robotboy) in the image of his own son, but then ships him off to live with another family. This family has a son in a coma and a mother staying at his side for years when everyone else has given up hope. So, the dad thinks it's a great idea to get a robot substitute son and say absolutely nothing about his plan in advance! Robotboy pops up unnoticed, laughs funny, looks at you funny, and yet the mother and robotboy bond. Things go great and then the real son awakens from the coma. This real son is jealous and apparently a sadistic genius as he guilefully tricks robot boy into doing stupid things. (On an aside, there's one scene where robotboy eats vegetables and his face starts to sag. Geez, what crappy quality for a robot *boy*). Anyhoo, robotboy does some inexplicably dumb stuff and the family sees him as a danger. So, they send him back. But, ahh!, if you send him back, he must be destroyed! Well, that can't happen so the mother, sent to take him back (why didn't the father do this as he seemed to be less emotionally attached?) leaves him 20 feet from the compound. "Son, I can't let you go back there, so I'll leave you alone in the woods with an animate teddy bear." With robotboy alone, he gets caught by people who hate robots and hate them so much that they torture the robots much to the cheer of an audience. Instead of depicting the backlash hatred humans have for the robots taking over the planet, I saw a group of humans lacking any compassion even if only towards simulated beings. Anyway, they're about to kill robotboy, but the audience turns because robotboy talks about pinocchio and cries. Okay, maybe this is a way of showing the that kid can get people to truly love him, but this kid is *exactly* what these humans are fighting against. Whatever. Well, robotboy befriends a ken doll robot who cracks his neck to play some old 40's tunes (says something about music in the future). Kendollbot can fake love enough to be a gigolo, hmmmm. Kendollbot and robotboy embark on a journey to find the blue fairy as said in a fairy tale. They go to an Einstein-like holograph and look for an answer to a question from this glorified search engine that amounts to a knock-off google search, but with a nice cartoony response. Goody goody. At no point does this seem ridiculous to kendollbot. VR-Einstein tells them to go to Man-hattan (get it?), where robots fear to go because it has the word man in it. Cops enter the story to arrest kendollbot but stupidly leave their airship totally unattended for robotboy to steal. They head over to Man-hattan in the stolen airship where robotboy finds a copy of himself reading a book. Robotboy gets jealous and knocks off CopyOfRobotBoy's head. Sure, this is the son we all want to have! Anyway, AI-prof. comes in and tells him he's special. They lost him for a while, and apparently this happened when the mother left him 20 feet from the compound. Uhh... GPS, perhaps? Well, they find him again, but want to see how he reacts to the world and whether he can follow a dream. What? Where did this come from? Robotboy followed a story he thought was true. Anyway, robotboy realizes his quest isn't over, dives down and sees a blue fairy. He prays to be human for 2000 years underwater. Spielberg could have ended it here, but he didn't. Instead, after that 2000 years, we are all dead and aliens chill on Earth. The boy is saved and wants his mommy. They can bring her back with the DNA from a lock of her hair stuffed up robobear's ass for the last two millennia, but only for one day and then she's lost forever. How friggin convenient. They have a nice time together, making coffee, playing hide-n-seek, and in the end, she tells him she loves him and the story ends.I like Spielberg, but AI was just a long, boring, convenient movie without making a real point. Robobear is the only bright spot of the movie. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can picture poor Haley Joel Osment jolting up from bed bathing in sweat from this bad nightmare just after the final scene, as the "Snuggles" Bear crawls up on the bed. I had to laugh. Frances O'Connor is unbearable in her role. Although the intended intelligence of this film is demonstrated in that final segment, its message remains somewhat dated and cliched to a fault! And though the cinematographic techniques of both Spielberg (shades of Close Encounters) and Kubrick (shades of 2001: A Space Odyssey) shine in this series of surreal situations, they are a poor fit. In short, all this could have been communicated in a far more efficient and less pretentious manner. Seeing the Twin Towers of the WTC in this post 9/11 world, it is interesting to note that the production dates barely a year before the horror. Some might say eerily prophetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Kubrickian; A Mixed Movie with Redeeming Features (reveals plot details)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lots of People have reviewed this movie. I waited until May 2002 to see it. Here's the short list of the good, the bad, and the ugly:The Good: o Haley Joel Osment. An acting genius. What a performance! o Special effects and their integration into the plot and subtext. No George Lucas swill here. o Sets and Design. o This is a movie that makes you think (assuming you had a brain to start with). The Bad: o Ludicrous plot problems (a short list): 1. They create an expensive robot with no automated way to track him (what...did Lo-Jack not make it to that century?) 2. Oh, those smart scientists forgot to build in fail-safe behavioral patterns or key words to stop David from doing certain things? 3. Oh, I guess the "authorities" don't put out all-points-bulletins for one-of-a-kind Kid Mechs. 4. Geez, I'm glad Bill Hurt as scientist/father allowed David to be by himself after smashing one of his creations then somehow never comes back. What...was there a long three martini lunch break? o Bill Hurt's acting is nearly as bad as that in the Dune remake. It's so bad it should be lifted for import into the SW-I: Phantom Menace. o I'd like to see the clause in David's purchase contract allowing him to be thrown out like garbage. The Ugly: o Well, is the ending Ugly or Beautiful? It's a plot travesty in terms of plausibility (and I don't mean visitation from the aliens either). Is this counterpoint to the ending of Kubrick's 2001? No comment needed. That is the beauty of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of money, waste of talent, waste of some good special effects and above all a waste of time. Almost 2 1/2 hours that could have been summed up in 90 minutes. I heard this movie was bad and it didn't even live up to my expectations. Kubrick and Spielberg should be ashamed. It starts off slow, and picks up a little but the final 40 minutes of this movie are so boring and dopey that it is nothing less than torturous.I was staring at the clock waiting for the credits to roll.Teddy and the 'Flesh fair' were the only interesting parts of the movie. Watch it if you must, but be sure to have the remote in hand and the Fast foward button at the ready.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a horror movie. A horrible movie. I just finished watching it, and I can't even believe I finished the entire thing. It was just unbelievably vile. Apparently Steven Spielberg feels that evoking an emotional response justifies anything.There is no joy in this movie. No hope. Tragedy can contain hope, as it does in some other movies (such as Pay It Forward), but in this one, the tragedy is there to make you hurt.I am so appalled at the viciousness that created this piece of trash that I'm having a hard time writing this.Don't support this film. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't watch it if it comes to TV. Let it rot in the history of evil movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on R1 DVD 146 minWere it not for the high expectations of a Kubrick/Spielberg production this movie might have scored higher as it is it's just another sloppy [and soppy] low brow sci-fi movie with cute effects. When the best character is a stuffed toy called Teddy you know your in for a disappointment.The movie has a dozen opportunities to address real questions but settles for scenes like the one where 'I'm a dumb black woman' poses an 'ah shucks' moral question - the real issues of human love, projected love and responsibility are left with last summers super toys.Even the bizarre ending misses the mark - is the love of a fake human real?6/10 worth watching for visual effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note: minor spoilers.A visually stunning film in parts, but flawed. The scenes of Rouge City and New York City were spectacular. Also beautiful, with deeply haunting music, was the fly-by scene of the aliens' craft as it approached David's sub that had been frozen for many years.But these scenes do not make up for the fact that film is flawed, too long and too sentimental. The last half hour should have been cut completely ? it is simply too contrived an ending, but I guess Spielberg felt he had to have a happy ending, even if it comes across as phony. The film *should* have ended right when David was trapped under the water, begging the Blue Fairy to make him real. That would have been a darker, but much more realistic ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pros: Special effects, score, teddy Cons: Haley joel osment, Last thirty minutes, Spielbergs ideasYou get the feeling that if A.I had been directed by stanley Kubrick, it would have been a much better film. Sadly, Kubrick died before he could have a crack at it. Spielberg takes over the project and tries to inject some of stanley's ideas but they are executed so poorly and looks like spielberg did it because he had to, not because he wanted to. For example rouge city looks like something that would come out of Kubricks mind(Clockwork Orange Bar) but speilberg tones it down with lights flashing everywhere so we are really distracted. Gigolo Joe was played down from what Kubrick originally intended him to be. Kubrick is a director who really doesn't care about the audience so he pushes limits. Spielberg on the other hand has built his legacy by entertaining the audience so he tries to cater to them and goes for the PG-13 rating. Haley Joel osment is just really annoying as the robot and the only memorable character in the whole film is teddy. The flesh fair had no point in the story and Dr know was just spielberg showing he had ran out of ideas. The last thirty minutes has to be the worst in recent years as spielberg tries to introduce his trademark aliens to save the film(Close encounters of the third kind). This doesn't work. Started out brilliant but eventually ran out of steam. Though kudos has to be given to spielberg for bringing an inventive imaginative film to the screen even though it is sub parPremise: A modern retelling of PinochioA.I was nominated for two academy awardsGrade: 6.1/10 (Could have been much, much better)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ponderous metaphysical diatribe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film doesn't have anywhere near the personality of SCHINDLER'S LIST, is far more slower and self-conscious than 2001 (if that's possible); and the plot feels like a cross between D.A.R.Y.L. and WATERWORLD - but without any of the vitality of either of those movies. In fact this shows all the sentimentality and non-subtltey of your standard 80s 'social issue of the week' tele-movie.About the only scene with any life in it whatsoever is the Dr Know segment, though that is hardly worth sitting through the entire movie for. Jude Law, William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson and Jake Thomas are mildly diverting. Haley Joel Osment is well cast as a robot (though I wouldn't regard that as a compliment).In fact, the old classic film METROPOLIS provides a far superior idea for storytelling. A.I. would possibly work better if the film didn't constantly thump you over the head every five minutes with the idea that it's based on Pinocchio; I'm sure most intelligent general public viewers could work it out for themselves after the first reference. (Perhaps its only modern professional film critic who can only get the themes of a story if the characters self-consciously spell them out ALL the time!) And I get very worried when you can start timing the sob scenes to within a couple of minutes of each other. Now that is emotional manipulation at the most crassest level.It does contain some interesting look at philosophical and metaphysical ideas for some possible future developments; but as a film this is awful! (And the idiots who thought this would play as a summer blockbuster movie really needs their heads examined).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Accepting the underlying themes of persecution, etc. A.I. is extremely dull. To it's credit, at least the film admits it's a complete rip off of Pinnochio with constant reference to it, but there is nothing shocking, nor thought provoking in this film. It ambles along at a painfully slow pace, with the occasional show piece thrown in to try to liven up the proceedings. I think the biggest problem is, you never really empathises with any on the characters. I guess the robot boy is supposed to grow on you as the film progresses and he starts to exhibit more human traits, but this doesn't happen. And you end up not particularily caring whether he achieves his dreams of not. There is one moving moment at the end where you finally think he isn't going to achieve his dream, and he doesn't know how to give up, and you guess he'll spend eternity stuck at this one point. This would have made a thought provoking end to the film. Unfortunately, in true Spielberg manner, this would have been too down beat, and we are then treated to a rediculous, and unnecessary fifteen minute ramble. Speilberg seems unable to leave a film open at the end, and the same is true for this. He has to tie up all of the loose ends, and end on a positive note in a kind of "..so the worlds not such a bad place after all..." type way. This doesn't really fit with the themes of the film, as generally, when people are persecuted, it all doesn't work out in the end.Not a great film that is ruined by the ending. The only plus point is the "teddy bear". The only lovable character in the whole film. And at least he lived happily ever after...so maybe the world isn't such a bad place after all ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: painfully arty w/ plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Artificial Intelligence: AI" is first and foremost a drama with a heavy dose of art. Personally, I don't have the film school training and sophistication to enjoy, for example, the makeup and scenery even if the story is horrid and the characters uninteresting ("The Piano"). And long drawn-out melodramatic scenes just bore me ("Forrest Gump").And that's what happens in AI. The story is long, very long, and the characters make some decisions that don't really make sense.I do like SF, and there are a few science fiction themes but it doesn't make up for the rest. There is an attempt to flirt with deep issues, but it doesn't work for me. Here is an example that won't spoil the movie. Advertisements for the film keep saying "Can a human love a machine?", as though that were a deep and mysterious question. But then, the entire emotive direction of the film is to get the viewer to empathize with the hapless machine, which we do quite readily. Actually, instantly. So it's not much of a question.The ending, which everyone has complained about, wasn't that bad. Sort of a neat twist. The real problem is that the film doesn't fit into a story arc. You know, a mystery movie begins with a crime and ends with solving it. You get some foreshadowing. Because "AI" changes character throughout, you're not sure what to root for. It's like a series of skits, none of which reach a satisfying conclusion.In other words, a perfect Stanley Kubrick film for you arty types out there. But not for me. Sci-fi film lovers, stay away and save yourself! This film does not have the charm and deep intelligence of "2001: A Space Oddessy".Who should see this film:-- arty types. I respect your viewpoint but frankly I don't get it.-- I can't think of anyone elseI'm forced to give "AI" a 2 out of 10 because it was actually painful to watch.</fullReview>

If I had watched it in the theater, I wouldn't have been able to sit through it.

		<fullReview>My problem with some anti-utopian futuristic movies from the last few decades is that they fail, in my opinion, at accurately accounting the development of human ethics. The ice caps melt, millions die, pregnancies are licensed, and a viable solution to millions of childless parents is a "throw-away" child? Is this premise really believable? Could we really become that incredibly shallow? How did it happen? Details, please!Even taken on its face, the choice of parents for the prototype is highly risky (not "perfect" at all, as David's creators seem to believe) and therefore not really plausible. I imagine most viewers predicted the thawing of the "real" child as early in the movie as I did. According to the movie, there must have been many parents around with children who had already died and would've made better candidates--wasn't that the reason for David's creation?The flesh fair scenes were grotesque and silly. However, despite themselves they slightly redeemed the humanity of this futuristic world when the audience refused to put David to death. The carnival barker's spiel about replacing real human affection with machinery was an accurate and poignant criticism of the world this movie created - I am torn that he is pelted with fruit.What else can I say about the most depressing movie I've seen in a long time? Haley Joel Osment is the only child actor who can make me cry. :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overlong and pretentious, this movie is a basic retelling of the classic Pinocchio story, set in the distant future. In this one, the "Pinocchio" is an advanced robot who looks and acts like a real boy. David (Haley Joel Osment) is the first of his robot line to have actual feelings, and naturally he runs into problems reconciling these emotions with his logical side. David is purchased by the Swinton family as a sort-of replacement for their son, who lies in stasis, stricken by an incurable disease. Mr. Swinton (Sam Robards) buys David to help his wife deal with the stress of losing their son; but it's kind of the same as buying a new puppy immediately after one's dog has been killed. Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor) doesn't quite know what to make of the new addition to her family. She resents the intrusion, and doesn't know how to treat David. Unlike traditional serving robots, David is designed to be a cute little kid, which means he doesn't just sit back and wait for orders to be given; he's supposed to be more interactive and proactive, learning as he goes. David develops a real love for his adoptive mother. But when the younger Swinton actually is cured from his disease and returns home, things get very complicated. It's soon clear that David's days with the family are numbered. Monica knows that if David is returned to the manufacturer, he'll be taken apart, and she's also grown fond of the boy robot. She takes him to a huge forest where decommissioned androids and other robots wander, thinking he'll be better off with those of his own kind. But David's love for his mother outweighs all else, and through all of his adventures - in which he meets up with fellow robot Gigalo Joe (Jude Law), his one goal is to return to his beloved mommy. He is under the impression that he can somehow become a real boy, Monica will take him back and they can all live happily ever after. If you're in the mood for absurdist cinema, this is a treat. The special effects, which were nominated for an Oscar, really are good. But special effects aren't as special as they used to be, now that most big-budget films have them in some way. True, the makeup (by past Oscar winner Rick Baker) and costumes are excellent, but the story and acting, sadly, are not. Each scene elicits an "oh, come on" reaction, as it tries to top the previous scene. "Look at me! Look at me!" the scenes practically cry out. It's a self-absorbed mess. The theme's not a new one, but the makers of this piffle tried way too hard to make the story different from all of the other "I want to be a real boy" movies; there's a fine line between quirky and unbelievable. Yes, you should suspend your disbelief for this movie; you should suspend it, expel it, and forget you ever had it. There's plenty that doesn't make a bit of sense, and a really schmaltzy ending. It tries its damnednest to pluck at your heartstrings, playing out more like a cheesy disease-of-the-week TV movie than a serious, heartfelt film. Osment's not bad, under the circumstances. One great thing about playing a robot is that one can give a poor performance, and it'll seem believable. There are also a few celebrity cameos that were completely unnecessary, although I won't ruin their surprise by outing them here. Most of the middle portion of this film (which clocks in at over two and a half hours) is deadeningly dull, and none of it was worth the megahype that DreamWorks mustered up for it. This is a good movie to leave on as you fall asleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never fully understood just how much we lost with Kubrick's death until I saw this...After this story went through the Spielberg machine, God knows just how much was changed, so I've no idea what Kubrick's original concept was. Because the tagline alone was nonsense "His love ir real, but he's not". Come on.One, David is just as real as "Deep Blue", the machine that beat Kasparov at jest (I bet he wishes every day Deep Blue wasn't real, just a bad dream). And two, David, being a machine, can "love" just about as much as my DELL laptop (since even animals don't actually love, the day someone creates a machine that can really love, we'll know Jesus Christ has returned to us. Love requieres a soul, and no lab can manufacture that, ever). Knowing this, junking him would cause us as much remorse as junking an old desktop (for a really good explanation, read Ebert's review, he nails this ham down but good). Now if the tagline was reversed "He's real, but his love is not", now that would be much better. (SPOILER)And the ending...Well, yes, makes more sense if they are robots and not aliens. But the way they look doesn't help much deducting that. And since all we've seen in the story is total nonsense, seeing aliens wouldn't come as much of a surprise (especially coming from Spielberg).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, maybe Spielberg had a little trouble melding his sensibilities with those of his late friend Stanley Kubrick, but when I say a little, I mean just that. This is a stunning movie, and it is very much like a Stanley Kubrick film in that there are parts of it so visually and emotionally haunting that they must be classed as unforgettable cinema.I am not in the mood to quibble about the few rough spots in the script and the borderline performance of a couple of minor players (Sam Robards is fairly unconvincing in my book--not sure if it's him or his lines--but he just didn't click with me). Easy to forgive when weighed against the stellar work of Haley Osment and Jude Law (not to mention a little diamond of a performance turned in by by Clara Bellar as the obsolete mecha-nanny). I predict A.I. will become the sleeper of Spielberg's career and I also assert neglect on the part of AMPAS for the film's treatment in the nominations this year. Don't neglect this great movie yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Touching Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the mind of Stanley Kubrick (1928-1999), the short story by Brian Aldis, and directed by Steven Spielberg (Minority Report). A.I. is a movie that has a destiney to become a classic. After Professor Hobby (William Hurt) proves his latest project to the commitee, which is a robot with feelings, he then creates his newest development which is: David (Haley Joel Osment). A robot that looks and talks like an 11 year old boy. He is taken into care by Monica Swinton (Frances O' Connor) and Henry Swinton (Sam Robards) who have a son named Martin (Jake Thomas) who is alive but frozen in a cell.Through all of the time David is living with the Swintons, he really enjoys it. He also shows love in his heart for Monica. As a present, Monica and Henry give him a teddy bear that acts like a kid.Unexpectedly, Martin awakes from his frozen cell and is moved back home. Monica and Henry begin to give David less attention. Martin then talks David into doing things that a normal trouble maker would do and eventually that ends up to where Monica takes David out to the forest and purposley leaves him there.While in the forest, David discovers that he isn't the only robot living out there. When all of the robots in his path are kidnapped, including him, they are taken to a gigantic city in the 21st century where David meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a man who gives women pleasure. David and Joe escape the horrors of the city show where robots are destroyed. David then finds out from a computer professor that the blue fairy can help show him his way home. So David and Joe go on a quest to find the blue fairy and put David back with his family.Their journey lasts for quite a while, in fact, David learns about himself along the way and begins to discover that he isn't real and that he's just a toy.Listen for voices from: Robin Williams, Meryl Streep, Chris Rock.A.I. Artificial Intellegence is a movie that will touch peoples hearts and is a good way to remember Stanley Kubrick who had thought of the concept back in 1980 during the filming of The Shining.Great music, great screeenplay, great acting, great directing, and great special effects. Bravo for Steven Spielberg who made Kubrick's vision worth seeing.Suitable for ages: 13 &amp; Up</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A.I." is a pretty good movie, if you accept it for what it is -- a contemporary fairy tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intelligent readers, don't let the few and vocal disgruntled viewers spoil your fun with this film, "Artificial Intelligence." The largest number of votes so far are "10", and in second place are "8". Plus, there are lots of "7"s and "9"s. A bad movie doesn't get votes like that! Other popular movies are "fairy tales" -- "Shrek", "E.T.", "Bicentennial Man", just to name a few -- and it is in this vein that "A.I." must be watched. It is an unspecified time in the future, global warming has melted polar ice caps and coastal cities all over the world are flooded. Population is strictly controlled and robots, "Mechas", are in widespread use, intelligent and capable but without feeling. Prof. Hobby (William Hurt) asks, "What would happen if a child robot were built and programmed to "imprint" and really love its parents?" One is built, David, and this is his story, his quest to become a real boy, like Pinocchio, so his mother can really love him as her own child.some SPOILERS follow...Early in the film one of the scientists asks, "Can a human love them back?" And that is the thesis of David's quest. When her comatose son returns home, mom finds herself distrusting David and fully realizing he is a machine leaves him in the forest rather than having him destroyed as policy dictates. However, David has imprinted on mom, loves her, will not be satisfied until he finds a way to become human. He takes the Pinocchio story at face value and believes there is a Blue Fairy that can change him. So the rest of his existence is looking for that fairy.The film in large part is subtle commentary on man's inability to foresee the results of true "artificial intelligence." If you can build it (a.i.), then you really have no control on which directions it will take. In this story David makes a number of unpredictable choices which get him "evicted", and through the rest of the movie his developing "intelligence" is not normal, compared to real humans. In that sense, artificial intelligence may be more of a millstone than a milestone.The part of the movie "Flesh Fair" is there to show that humans have not changed over the course of recorded history. The Romans had the Gladiator games, we have ice hockey and football, and the future humans get their kicks from rounding up and destroying robots for entertainment, and because they fear they will survive selectively over humans. Entertainment and jealousy, the strong overpowering the weaker, a human constant.After David finally gets to Manhattan in the Amphibicopter, finds the Blue Fairy statue at a submerged Staten Island, gets trapped by a falling ferris wheel, eventually gets frozen, spends the next 2000 years asking over and over, "Please make me a real boy." In this frozen world all humans have long ago died, an alien race finds David, are able to reconstruct a human form from a bit of DNA. Using a lock of hair hidden in the smart teddy bear, mom comes back, but for only one day. This reconstructed mom rejoices in being with David, he believes he is a human, they both nod off at eveningtime.At about 1 hour 42 minutes on the DVD, Prof. Hobby and David are talking, and Hobby says to David, "The Blue Fairy is part of the great human flaw to wish for things that don't exist, or the greatest single human gift, the ability to chase down our dreams." It was his joy that a robot did those things, validating the success of his personal quest. There are elements of the "Wizard of Oz" when talking to "Dr. Know" (voiced by Robin Williams), elements of "E.T" when the aliens come. The whole film has the feel of a fairly tale, which it is as Spielberg explains during the one short "extra" on disk #1.The Osment kid does his usual good job here, as does William Hurt as the visionary Prof. Hobby. But the best job is done by Jude Law as Gigolo Joe, the robot "love machine" who helped David track down Dr. Know, and educate him as to some of the ways of the world. Not a perfect movie by any means, still it is a very good one, highly entertaining in spots with clever writing and superb effects and John Williams music. However, it is mainly an adult fairy tale that gets us to think about our own existence. A "must see", if only to witness the Kubrick/Spielberg collaboration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film (together with, for example Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut) is either (a)misunderstood (b)not understood as THE art part of what a movie SHOULD REALLY be (people get mixed up as times go by with the increasing amount of films that mean ONLY money) or (c)people just comment on what the rest say.This is actually the second best Speilberg film (after Schindler's list). One thing is certain....there is about 90% of this film Speilberg and only a minor percent of Kubrick (unlike what many say about being both director's film).The 'emotional' scenes involving Haley (PERFECT performance) in the beginning of the movie reminded me somehow of E.T. and the Sci-Fi scenes near the middle of the movie are THE BEST sci-fi images seen on film I have ever seen!! The ending? Immediately after I saw the film the first time I thought it was boring and the only 'big' minus to the film.....time proved me wrong....it is the part of the film I remember the most!! I am pretty sure THE WHOLE FILM will have the same effect on a majority of people as time goes by......This is the procedure that usually happens to (a) wine (b) CLASSICAL MOVIES</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg gives Stanley Kubrick's film brains.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never a fan of Stanley Kubrick movies, I thought about most of them as long, slow, and downright boring, with the exception with Full Metal Jacket. Don't get me wrong, I still felt that Kubrick's films are intelligent, but somehow I just can't get into them. An example of Stanley Kubrick's most boring so-called masterpiece would be 2001: A Space Odyssey. Thankfully, Steven Spielberg came to the rescue and gave the film, which originally started off as Kubrick's, some brains and more importantly, a heart. I felt that if it wasn't for Steven Spielberg, A.I. would be another overrated Stanley Kubrick "classic." I also love the way Spielberg casts his characters, and I wish I could say the same for Kubrick's casting of characters. With Spielberg's casting, you could see that the actors were perfect with the role.One thing I like about Stanley Kubrick is his vision, with the exception of the hotel's art direction in the Shining. With A.I., I was expecting a Steven Spielberg story with a Stanley Kubrick vision, and that is exactly what I got. Together, these elements go well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see why some may view this film and may not enjoy it, its not for everyone. But to the open-minded viewer, A.I. is a feast for the eyes and mind.What makes this film really unique is the collaboration between the two directors. During the film, you can actually feel Kubrick's directing style in some scenes, while others are pure Spielberg. It gives the picture a very disjointed feel. While some may find this disconcerting, I felt it gave the movie a wild unpredictability.All of the actors do a fine job, especially Frances O'Connor, who gives an exceptionally fine performance in a heart-wrenching scene, which I won't give away, but when you see the movie you'll know what I'm talking about.See this film.

		<fullReview>What a desperate, desperate shame. I suppose you are riding for a fall if you look forward to a film for months but truly this was more than disappointing. The idea is fine and obviously the technical side in the hands of a master (the special effects are quite stunning). But the story, Mr. Spielberg, the good old fashioned skill of story-telling has deserted you. Were you blinded by the fact that you had to honour the considerable memory of your dead mentor? The use of voice overs is lazy and indicates lack of planning. The fact that the last half an hour of the film is entirely serviced by voice over bodes ill for the conclusion of the story. And indeed that is the problem. Up until about half away the film spins you round with emotional dilemmas and social comment. Wonderfully acted and beautifully shot it gets so bogged down in it's own convolutions that you are dying for a 4x4. Spielberg paints himself into a corner and can't get himself out again, hence the voice overs and the conclusion of the story which is fantasy (as it should be) but really too much. Was he trying to create an ending similar to 2001?. In any case go and see the film and marvel at the first hour but save some popcorn for the second half... oh! and take a book.</fullReview>

Were we really supposed to have heart felt sorrow for this robot. It's a robot for god's sake! Whatever feelings it has, no matter how real they seem, are only programmed feelings. People were saying to me before I saw it that I should bring a box of tissues because I will just cry the whole time. I'm sorry, I didn't even come close to thinking about crying. Everything that the robot boy did all through out the movie were programmed feelings and instincts. NOT LEARNED HUMAN FEELINGS! It was just a stupid robot. Who cares if it finds love or not. I certainly don't. And for you out there that were really touched by this film, are probably the same idiots who hug trees and would save an animals life over a humans. This movie was stupid and way too over hyped. I give it a 1/10. The only reason I give it such a high rating is because I can't go any lower. SUCK SUCK SUCK SUCK SUCK</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday I saw this movie and I still can't find words to describe how much I was suprised when the ending credits came to screen. First, it must be said that this movie is not for the people younger than 20-25 years and honestly, maybe even not for the people who don't have children of their own, because it only can be apprehended by them. Quantity of emotion and performance by young Osment is fantatsic and I can't still believe that child of his age can show this mixture of emotion throughout the movie. Fantastic special effects, not used like a separate category, but like a appendix to the fantastic story. Kubrick can be pleased with this one and for the Spielberg it's one of his best movies, maybe the best one. It's hard to explain but in the end you can only be amazed or disapointed, but as I said before it's only matter of age and maturity. I give it 10.5 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard very little of the hype, read none of the reviews, and wanted to form an honest opinion of this movie. My expectations going in were quite high, however, as it was a Steven Spielberg movie. Every single one those expectations was met, if not exceeded.This movie had some fantastic performances. Haley Joel Osment amazed me with his performances in "The Sixth Sense" and "Pay It Forward." He tops both, though, with this performance, as David. Both Jude Law and Frances OConnor performed beautifully, memorably contributing to the entire film. Many complain that OConnor was not maternal enough, that she didnt exude the motherly "aura" that the role required. I couldnt disagree more. She gave the role exactly what it needed. Hers was a beautiful performance.Even the minor actors made the film a masterpiece. The sets were whimsical with a certain darkness about them, and the special effects were seamless. I always enjoy Mr. Spielbergs movies, and I believe this may top the list.I am troubled when I read on this website that the movie was an unsuccessful blending of Spielberg and Kubrick. Those opinions are appreciated; I only hope that they are well-founded in extensive study of the films of both these men, the filmmaking process, and a sincere love of motion pictures. While I have seen every one of Mr. Spielbergs movies, Ive seen only four of Mr. Kubricks, and aside from that, I have not studied in-depth the filmmaking process. I therefore feel inadequate to make any judgement on the blending of the two styles. I saw similarities with the works of both directors in this film, and enjoyed seeing them. From my limited experience, I believe Mr. Spielberg did well in telling Mr. Kubricks story.This is a beautiful movie in every sense of the word. It is about a child, making his way through a harsh and cruel world, trying desperately to return to the comfort of his mothers arms. He craves love. Nothing else.Amid all the fantastic settings, imaginative characters, and thought provoking statements, I saw this movie to be a parable for the life of each and every person on earth. As children, we cherish the comforts we have, the unconditional love we receive. But we grow up. We can no longer take that love for granted. We make our respective ways through this world, trying so hard to return to he simple desires of our childhood, to love and be loved. When it absolutely boils down to it, that is all any of us wants.This movie is not for adults. It is presented from a childs perspective, with a childs understanding of the world. Having experienced lifes triumphs and downfalls, we, as adults, cannot look at this movie and the world it presents us with an honest heart and open mind. But when we try our hardest to see this film through the eyes of David, an innocent child, we can leave behind all that bombards us in this world, and for a brief moment, feel the simple love that, deep down, we all desire.</fullReview>

Thats my main point really, people are bemoaning the 'happy' ending, well, if a life alone in a single location for eternity is your idea of heaven..?!To be honest its just a tragic ending as it would have been if we had been left at the 'trapped' stage but for all its faults it might help explain just a little more what the future had in store.Plenty of 'if Kubrick had directed...' cries too, but I hated Eyes Wide Shut, remember Kubrick didnt get out the house very much in his final years - maybe that wouldnt have shown so clearly in a 'fantasy' future film though.Just a thought...</fullReview>

It is stunning film-making.Special effects have rarely been used so seamlessly, the world Spielberg creates sucks you in entirely. I'm a huge fan of Spielberg, I think he is under-rated by many, and is a master storyteller. With A.I. I think his skill has been proven.Haley Jole Osment is quite simply a superb actor, his age should not preclude him from winning an Oscar, for he is immense in this film. Jude Law gets better with every movie, his character of Gigolo Joe is tragic, funny and noble. Teddy is a wonderful character too, everyone in the cinema wanted one. It would have been easy for this character to be used in Disneyesque fashion as the humour quotient, but this film is more intelligent than that, and Teddy adds a layer of wisdom to David's journey that enhances the film greatly.For me this film is a masterpiece. You may agree, you may disagree, but you WILL remember this movie. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You would think that when two of the century's most skilled directors make a movie together, it would be a masterpiece. But Speilberg and Kubrick obviously had different ideas about the film. The main problem is that the film is overlong. If it was half an hour shorter, it would have been great. But no, they had all that stupid "Blue Fairy" stuff at the end. What a horrible ending for an otherwise fine movie! And the plot didn't have to be so much like "Pinnochio"! The whole cast gives excellent performances, though. Jude Law is fantastic as Gigolo Joe, Frances O'Connor gives a very emotional &amp; believable performance as Monica Swinton, and last and not least, Haley Joel Osment is brilliant as always. But Osment whines too much! "I want to be a real boy!" "I want to be a real boy!" "I want be a real boy!" SHUT UP ALREADY! Anyways...If you're going to see this film, see it for the acting. You're going to be disappointed any other way you look at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Tour de Force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If all the movie came out like this one did, I think we would be all very different. This movies marks a new borderline in Spielberg's career, and we can be sure that none will be the same from here. Nurturing the project since a decade ago, Kubrick shared it with him, and the outcome is a hapy marriage of all of Kubrick's perfectionism and Spielberg's trademark sensibility. I am a little lost for words, a thing which happens everytime I go and see a really good movie. I remember being like this in "Saving Private Ryan". But I must grab it, I thought "write this now, or you'll forget it, take it out while it's still fresh". What shall I say? Spielberg is one of my influences, for the way his genius has matured, for the way he managed to show he is much more than a simple grown-up boy. This movie proves that the devotion and love dedicated to a project may influence greatly the final product. "A.I." is a labour of love, and rarely has Spielberg been so personally attached to a movie of his. Movie magic is again the order, as it has been in almost all of his movies (Saving Private Ryan may be the exception), but this time, Spielberg assumes a personal viewpoint, and the movie assumes a posture towards its subjects like he has never did before. This is a true novelty item, far away from the swashbuckling times of Indiana Jones. Steven has matured, and the movie he gives us now is as good as an old wine, but best of all - with the heritage of many years of a magic he imprinted in his movies. All the fine touches are there to go with it: Janusz Kaminski's cinematograpy, Michael Kahn's editing and John Williams' magical score, one of his finest and most beautifully crafted scores to date. I could tell you, if this was Spielberg's last movie, I would have cried my tears out. Because he would have left us with a masterpiece. It touched me, and I am sure that next time it will certainly bring tears to my eyes. Unmissable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved it! I wasn't expecting it to be that good I thought it may have been over hyped (just seen Planet of the Apes). Yes there is the Spielberg/Kubrick thing and some scenes are pure Kubrick, some of the remarkably long takes, but generally it doesn't do any harm to the film. I think its about 140mins long but it doesn't seem it, on the whole you're kept on the edge of you're seat it really is good stuff. The effects aswell help make a good film an excellent one. Anyway as the summary says it might not be to everyones tastes, I might be a bit biased as I love Sci-fi Robot type things. If you're the sort of person that appreciates a well directed clever film see it anyway. Now the ending, I'll try not to spoil it, I think it could have been difficult to end this film, I was thinking throughout the film "Hows this going to end?" at several points the film could have conceivably ended, it was constantly twisting and turning towards the end. The final end scene was quite a bold idea maybe a bit unbelievable but it helps get the end point across and well I liked it. Overall I would say see it but if you really not into this genre maybe you should give it a miss. The effects alone are impressive enough and of course it is very well directed. I thought it was brilliant.</fullReview>

The extra twenty minutes which was tacked on to the end, is something that was designed to end the fim on a feel good note. That ending was in fact pathetic and down right absurd. But if you are capable of ignoring that the film is a great film and is well worthy of a 10. (but only because I ignored the ending). So whe you watch this or have already watched it, I implore you not to judge the entire film on the basis of the ending as this will do a gross injustice to the acting of Osment and Co.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this film, I can't help well up in tears, fumbling for my cellphone to call my mother how much I love her. There are ppl who just didn't seem to get it.. which disturbs me as it is almost portray in the movie, that the mecha has more emotion than man who have since advanced by technology, become less and less capable of loving, and have since become cruel. I felt Kubrick have always have good idea going, but after watching his film you can't but help felt detached and emotionless. I credit this film's success to Steven for bringing that crucial humanity part of it to the whole equation.A nice film to bring your mother along to see ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm looking forward to the second time to watch this movie. It has gone beyond all best movies on my personal list - this movie is excellent. Good score - good story - good acting - good directing.It is a story which is so artificial and futuristic in its concept, yet so eeriely true and humanly emotional. Boys don't cry, well, usually. This movie made me - a male teen - go sobby, an achievement even Titanic (1998) failed.I won't predict any Oscars - but to say that it won't get nominated or win any is being strictly artificial. Watch this movie, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all the bad reviews I was truly captivated by AI.Its mix of Spielberg warmth and Kubrick coldness works brilliantly together.The film starts off almost like a horror movie while Monica adjusts to David.Im not going to give much away after this but the scene in the forest is heartbreaking.Haley Joel Osment is such a fantastic actor.Jude Law is good but he has little to do.The film is so visionary, the flesh fair a surprisingly nasty yet awesome spectacle.The film is never boring(ignore the people who say it is)and the controversial ending is actually quite brilliant.Its the most satisfying emotional pay-off that they could have created.Its also extremely sad.Unlike most of the other films this summer, AI raises many questions and deliberately doesn't answer them, leaving the audience to discuss them.Entertaining and Thought-Provoking.Love it or hate it-an instant classic. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** In one of A.I.'s most meaningful scenes, Gigolo Joe and David ask Dr. Know (a virtual oracle) about the blue fairy. After several unsuccessful queries, they try combining the "Flat Fact" and "Fairy Tale" categories. Dr. Know's answer is a poem that is not only the key for David's quest for the blue fairy, but the key to the film's true meaning as well: "Come away, O human child!/To the waters and the wild/With a faery, hand in hand/For the world's more full of weeping/than you can understand." Stanley Kubrick's work was about the struggle human beings have in controlling the beast within. He knew that, as a rule, the beast ends up showing up. On the other hand, Spielberg's films celebrate the exceptions to that rule. These are in no way mutually exclusive points of view. In fact, they are both the sides of the same coin. The best fairy tales manage to be hopeful and dark at the same time. They are simple and sweet on the surface, but complex and even terrifying underneath. A.I. is one of those tales. It's the best metaphor about the human condition ever put on film. Dig under the surface and you'll find your reward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has caused so many opposing views. It appears that half the people hate it and half love it. I have to say I really enjoyed it. But I think the biggest problem is people's pre-conceived ideas. Those who like Kubriks films will consider "Ai" too wishy washy and emotional. Those who like Spielbergs work will consider it too dark, slow and a bit non-sensical. But you really have to view this film from a totally neutral and un-biased position and appreciate it on its own merits. Even if it wasn't common knowledge, you would be able to tell this is the work of two radically different directors melded into one image. It constantly jumps from extreme sentiment and obvious emotion, to dark, depressing views of humanity, and mixes in a heavy dose of philosophical "what are we all about" commentry. I have to admit it brought a few tears to my eyes, and I defy anyone with normal emotions to remain dry-eyed throughout, and its one of those films you'll talk and argue about in the bar afterwards. I think critics of the film have been overly harsh and too quick to judge. Don't expect a serious,deep, "2001" style film, or a flashy, easy on the eyes(and brain) "ET" style film. This is new territory for both directors, and is a cocktail of styles and ideas that, because of the history and circumstances of its making, may never occur again. This is a good film, enjoy it for what is, not what you wanted it to be. Oh, and I loved the bear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people consider me as someone who is addicted to the movies on the big screen. And I guess they are right - I hardly miss any good movie, even though unfortunately I sometimes I also don't miss the bad ones. :)What can I say about A.I.? It's hard to formulate what I am thinking. All I can say is that this is the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. And I believe without the really great and marvelous performance of Haley Joel Osment (who also brought Cole in THE SIXTH SENSE and Trevor in PAY IT FORWARD to real life with his outstanding acting talent) this movie wouldn't have had the magic and spirit it has.Also Steven Spielberg has done a fantastic job. He focuses on the story which the music by John Williams makes even stronger and he doesn't lose himself in the special effects that nevertheless are quite astounding and in no way overdone at all. He managed to place those special effects so smartly that you just don't really notice those are CG effects because they just belong there like everything else.I won't go into detail about the story (you have to see it for yourself) but let me assure you that you will want to see A.I. over and over again... I do. :)According to some credible news pages, the DVD release is planned for late January 2002 - and I am impatiently looking forward to that day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deceptively complex, full of implications and always sincere, this is Spielberg's finest film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" is one of those films that hang over you like a cloud for days after you've seen them. I have returned to A.I. in my thoughts several times since seeing it, grappling with it as both a film and as a collection of ideas and feelings. I now believe that A.I. is Spielberg's most interesting film to date, on par with or even exceeding his achievement with "Schindler's List." I'm not at all interested in whether anyone liked it or not, or whether it went down well with their Skittles, M&amp;M's and popcorn and made them feel personally validated on their drive home. This film truly has ambitions beyond that.There are many images that strike me in this film. Mother Ocean at the beginning signifying birth, and Mother Ocean eating her young as the cities of the world drown (with the suggestion that she is ready to eliminate her mistakes and usher in a new era); a robot boy's laughter triggering fake laughter in real parents; David murdering a copy of himself; the permanently frozen expectancy in the face of the ceramic Blue Fairy ? and the image on celluloid of an artificial boy wishing an impossible thing of a dead object; The great pageant of mankind obscured and buried under a thousand years of ice; the `playback' of David's warped memory by the evolved mecha as if it were a cinematic experience inside a cinematic experience, or a copy of a copy of a copy losing more fidelity each time (this was especially effective); the look on clone-of-Monica's face as she is jolted outside of her programming by the cute but horrifying pictures drawn by the robot boy.A.I. is fantasy, horror, the cinema, and even Steven Spielberg's psyche itself laid bare. It is a dialectic touching on the themes of dreams vs. reality, cinema vs. life, existence vs. non-existence, human vs. non-human, mother-love/birth vs. isolation/death, and the `primacy of emotion' vs. `emotion as a construct of multiple parts.' It is played along emotional, mythic and subconscious lines and not highly conscious and plot-heavy lines. It is supposed to get under your skin. The sometimes-astounding economy of expression and the resultant emotional/intellectual possibilities make this film a work of art, and not a didactic, literal treatise or a documentary about robots. It deserves serious consideration on these grounds.It is about the equation of humanity with fantasy. To be a human in our human condition is to dream. Dreaming is a constant wellspring. It is an impetus to act. By contrast, A.I. also exposes the non-Spielbergian notion that we and our dreams, and our cinema, are nothing but artifice and wishful thinking. The Blue Fairy looms large and is an indelible image in this vein. The film explores with minor keys how we could, just as well as David Swinton, be our own worst nightmares ? merely `physical' beings with no supernatural soul, no God. We are a collection of instincts, needs and desires that need not be more than the sum of their parts, so to speak. The machinery underneath is exposed; the curtain covering the props supporting our myths is lifted. Our fantasies to the contrary may only be at best approximately real, with the distance between the fantasy and the reality being tragically vast.The non-primacy of emotion is explored when we see cruel sibling rivalry and the impossibility of acting in an inclusive manner toward beings that are ever so slightly not part of our `tribe.' This is involuntary instinct unfettered by the intellect or the heart. It is a vexing part of our `nature.' At the films fever pitch of tear-inducing emotion -- the third and final act -- there are nothing but gears, bioelectronics, computer chips and `modified' clones. Witness that some of the kindest humans in the film were not human at all. Artificial emotion seems at least as valid and also as deeply flawed and `made of parts' to the film as real emotion.And yet, despite it all, the amazing achievement is that anyone can read much of what happens to David as `cruel,' and not `necessary,' or `to be expected,' since we are reminded often that he is a machine. Why is this? Is it the robot boy's human form? Is it his actions? Our minds are sent back and forth in the volley of this philosophic ping pong.Furthermore, all of this becomes highly complicated when we ask ourselves: Is it not tragically ironic for David to have allowed a clone of his mother to be created for HIS purposes, as was he in the beginning? Are the advanced Mecha doing this favor for David out of loving kindness, or out of pity? Or are they doing it because he is one of their own and, at long last, the mechas have the upper hand? They seemed to have qualms about re-creating Monica (they were repeatedly trying to give one reason of another why they couldn't re-create her, but it was always well within their powers) but, ultimately, they did it with thoughts toward David, not the human they constructed.These questions and many more continue to haunt me, and they probably will for the rest of my movie-watching life.Wonderfully shot, beautifully acted, masterfully conceived and very effective, I for one think this is the best film of the year, and probably among the most interesting and unforgettable films made in the last 10 years.Many thanks to Steven Spielberg and the late Stanley Kubrick, who left us far too soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love sci-fi. I also am usually fascinated by Kubrick and enjoy Spielberg. But A.I. was a hash of both directors, and in the end seemed like a bunch of odds and ends were thrown in just to give it the prerequisite happy ending.If you haven't seen the movie yet, I'll try to hold off on spoilers until later and I'll warn you then. No doubt about it, A.I. is a dark movie. I saw people bringing in to the theatre little kids and wondered what in the world they were thinking. A.I. could have left kids of an especially impressionable age, say under 10, with nightmares for weeks.A.I.'s setting is very much like Blade Runner (a much better examination of how humans might one day view advanced artificial intelligence). That setting is well done and makes you think about the logical progression from today's pets to tomorrow's robots which many people will undoubtably treat as pets (just as many people today treat cats and dogs atrociously).A.I.'s main story, about David the robot-child, is much less well done. His story, and the actions of his "parents," leave so many holes you start wondering right at the beginning what is wrong with these people and oh please let's not let the humans of tomorrow be this dumb.Before I point out some examples, I want to make one general point. While the movie is certainly dark, it is coherent until a point about 20 minutes from the end, where, to avoid spoiling it, David is goes 20,000 leagues under the sea. If the movie had ended there, then it at least would have been a clear statement about the weaknesses and foibles of humans. But from that point, it was like a second movie began. It was almost as if Close Encounters had merged with A.I. And it really ruined the message of the film, for me.Now, some spoiler questions. Can anyone answer: Why would you get a robot boy, which would of course never age? Do you want a child of 10 (or whatever) for the rest of your life? Why did the mother selfishly imprint David only on her? Why would a company make almost-real child for families but make every one the same and call them all David or Arlene? Doesn't that defeat the point of "owning" such an advanced and unique mecha (I can see it now, 523 Davids at the mall on Saturday afternoon)? Why wasn't some kind of microchip put into David so he could be tracked if we went renegade (for that matter, why weren't all mechas chipped)?And those are just the larger questions. Ultimately, I found the setting and the examination of the way people adjust to AI (a la Blade Runner) interesting, but didn't care much for the story of David or his obviously grief-stricken and unthinking parents. I don't know whether Kubrick of Spielberg was responsible for either or both, but the combination was much less effective than if one vision of the other had been consistent. We gave A.I. a 5, which over time might become a 6, simply because this movie was certainly emotionally involving, even when it became a mess.</fullReview>

Reading reviews about that has helped me to feel a bit better after watching A.I,What makes this movie so specially awful for me is this: I can see no relevance whatsoever to real life. It's a totally fake story with fake problems posing as deep philosophical questions of human interest. While it actually boils down to this: The programmed 'feelings' of a machine are important enough to create a human for one day, which then has to die. Yea, kids need the love of their parents.

		<fullReview>This was a movie in love with itself, in search of itself, that never found itself. It attempts to be too clever by half. The Kubrick material was challenging and emotionally deep. The scene at the pool party rips your heart out.But you feel the difference immediately when the Spielberg film commences. It's a different movie entirely, different point, different style. Its only real connection to the Kubrick film is that it lives out the ambivalent messiness that Kubrick was calling us to explore.So, in the Kubrick AI, we don't really know what to do with the robot future. The people and robots don't really mix in the end. And Spielberg doesn't seem to know what to do with the kid any better than his first human parents. It just drags on and on, lost inside itself, not knowing what the climax ought to be, much less how to get there.I kept waiting for the movie to do something meaningful, since it started with such an arresting punch.

		<shortDescription>Artificial Intelligence? Artificial maybe, but incredibly stupid!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much pulp has been added to the crisp simple premise of the short story it probably didn't need to credit Aldiss at all.Though Osment does a superb job as usual (why isn't he getting more work today???) the unfortunate fact is that this story is incredibly illogical. The "blue fairy"? Seriously? The boy android goes in search of a blue fairy for a large chunk of the film, a mirror to the Pinocchio plot. Somehow this "intelligent" android believes he can be turned into a real human boy by a fairy. It is a ludicrous, silly plot device.Amazing to think that in 2001 they actually believed the internet would disappear to be replaced with some holographic wizard charging money to answer some questions. Again, just plain stupid. My ancient Sony laptop has wi-fi yet apparently this technology will disappear.Another flaw in the logic of this story is the idea that sea levels will rise and completely inundate New York city with ice. If the Antarctic continent, Greenland, and every glacier melted on this planet, sea levels would rise around 70-75 metres. This would not have been too hard to find out surely.In the short story the married couple win a licence to allow them to conceive, whereas the film has a boy around ten years old who is cured of an illness and comes out of a coma. Apparently he's right up to date with technology though and has a gaggle of friends who materialise.The android boy of the story is belligerent but tries to express how much he loves his "mother" ... in the film the "mother" reads a silly code to make the android love her (creepy in itself): was this necessary? Why would they make an orifice that can ingest food that will ruin the internals? And why then doesn't the dip in the pool do similar damage?One more thing and then I'm done (promise). Are we really to believe that humans will in the future find the destruction of obsolete technology to be so thoroughly entertaining? Dumb, dumb, dumb! Maybe I'll smash up my old Commodore 64 with a mallet ... would a stadium of people really be interested?For me this movie was entertaining to the point of the blue fairy nonsense. Its projections of the future are largely absurd and it is almost as bad as that abomination with Robin Williams, "Bicentennial Man".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most underrated movie from Spielberg!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick projects were known for take a long time for their debut, but whenever they come out it was a success and caused polemic and controversy. "A.I." was another one of those projects that take years on pre-production. Suffering from production problems since 1970, changing companies and Kubrick laying off several writers that didn't captured his view of the story. Until after the death of Kubrick, and his wife Christiane Kubrick asked longtime friend of her husband, Steven Spielberg to directed the film, and Spielberg ended up making one of his masterpieces."A.I." takes place in a future where the glaciers finally melted due to global warming, flooding most of the costs of the countries. The human race continues to move forward, with what is still available from food, technology and with minerals that still exist. And with the advancing years, they start building robots with human appearance and with artificial intelligence, each programmed for a certain function (babysitter, housekeeper, lover). Until Professor Hobby (William Hurt) begins to manufacture children robots with human feelings and emotions, to be sold to families who have always wanted to have children. One day Henry Swinton (Sam Robards) decides to buy a robot named David (Haley Joel Osment) for him and his wife Monica (Frances O'Connor) who suffers from the lack of his son Martin (Jake Thomas) who is in a terrible coma. Over the months Monica creates a great mother's love for David, and David treats her with great love of a son to his mother from admiration and obedience. But everything changes when the son of Henry and Monica wakes up from the come and get back home and start involving David in a lot of confusion. The "brothers" relationship gets even complicated when David inadvertently almost drowns Martin in the pool, causing distrust of Henry and Monica thinking that David can be a serious danger to the family. Monica then takes David away from home and expels it in the middle of the road. David suffers and puts the idea in his mind that if he becomes human he can go home, starting a massive journey through the country where robots are enslaved by humans.Kubrick and Spielberg even being longtime friends both had completely different styles of movies. Kubrick had his brilliant scripts giving the story an air of mystery and disturbing moments with a sly touch of humor, followed with excellent filmmaking and perfect photography. Spielberg, always changed the style of his film, he is even today known for changing style film capturing perfectly the different movie tones.Since the beginning of the film, it all looks like Kubrick, like was really him writing and directing. His elements are everywhere: old and scary voice narrating the story (element from Barry Lyndon); disturbing and mysterious narrative with a sly touch of humor. And of course, always criticizing society by every minute. All this thanks to Spielberg's script, the 2nd that he writes since "Close Encounters", which in my opinion captures the style of Kubrick's screenplays. And its beautiful direction, even that didn't surpasses Kubrick direction, feeds very well the story, and also giving the film amazing visual effects and incredible CGI.And of course, Spielberg couldn't resist and putting his own elements. Some may see this as a negative, but gives so much to the history. Putting to the disturbing and mysterious story heart, making us relate to David and feel his pain when our future society rejects and him, and makes us care about his search for become a human being. And in the end makes us believe that dreams can come true.We will never know if Kubrick would be happy with the final product, but I like to think that he would. Spielberg with a superb script and fine direction captures the style of Kubrick, with excellent performances by Haley Joel and Jude Law as the robot lover. It all ends in a masterpiece that it didn't captured the deserved respect from critics and the public, which gave us a story that mixes Pinocchio with post apocalypse, with disturbing and emotional moments, a film that in one word is beautiful! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Emotionally Accessible Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. Artificial Intelligence, also known as A.I., is a science fiction drama film written and directed by Steven Spielberg.It was based on Brian Aldiss's short story "Super-Toys Last All Summer Long". It stars Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Brendan Gleeson, and William Hurt. Set sometime in the future, A.I. tells the story of David, a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love.David is a robot of the future, when the polar ice caps have melted and submerged many coastal cities, causing worldwide starvation and human dependence upon robotic assistance. The first robot designed to experience love, David is the "son" of Henry, an employee of the company that built the boy, and the grief-stricken Monica. David is meant to replace the couple's hopelessly comatose son, but when their natural child recovers, David is abandoned and sets out to become "a real boy" worthy of his mother's affection. Along the way, David is mentored by a pleasure-providing robot named Gigolo Joe and a talking "super toy" bear named Teddy. His adventures take him to the Roman Circus-style "Flesh Fair," where robots are destroyed for the amusement of humans; Rouge City, where Gigolo Joe narrowly avoids capture by police; and finally a submerged New York City, where David's creator, Professor Hobby reveals the secrets of the boy's creation.The movie is surely flawed, to be sure, but beautifully crafted, unimaginably complex, visually dazzling, rich with metaphor and deeply affecting.The film tried to achieve too much by mixing a confined domestic drama, a considerable morality tale, a fleeting futuristic noir, a persecution parable and an on-the-nose fairy tale adventure. But nevertheless,it is a technically dazzling yet emotionally accessible to the inner child in everyone from 9 to 90.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new favourite - astoundingly underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen this for the first time nearly a decade after its release, I was happily surprised by this wonderful piece of work from Mr Spielberg. I have yet to see a film by this skillful director that I dislike, and A.I. is certainly not going to be the first.Set in a futuristic world, with a perhaps familiar theme of robots integrated with people, the story focuses on one small android named David (Haley Joel Osment) who is taken into a family as an experiment to see if a robot can be made to love a human, and is then forced out of his new family to fend for himself in a frightening new world.With exceptional performances from the whole cast, the real stand-outs are Frances O'Connor, playing the reluctant mother who eventually warms up to the loving robot, Jude Law, as the entertaining Gigolo Joe who aids David on his quest, and young Haley himself, who delivers a truly outstanding performance as the lovable David. Haley gets the balance between boy and robot just right; his stiff movements and unblinking eyes are the clues, the things which create that contrast between David and his 'real live' brother, Martin.It is evident just how much care went into each shot; the cinematography is superb, with haunting shots such as that of David peering through the eyes of another android like himself, or the iconic opening of the large, blue eyes. The various 'halo' shots of David with rings of light above his head are clever and subtle, and the camera work in the closing scenes is extremely well done, creating the gentle, breathless atmosphere as David joyously reunites with his Mommy.Flicking through the film channels, I only decided to watch this because I'd seen Haley in Pay it forward and, having greatly enjoyed that, decided to give A.I. a go. It was an expertly crafted piece of entertainment, artistic and thoughtful, and with a sentimental tone you would not expect to find in a movie about robots. All the emotions are delivered in a seamless blend of comedy, drama and adventure. The comedic moments (such as the hilarious outburst of laughter at the dinner table) were just as engaging as the creepier ones (the packaged 'David' android twitching as David looks on), and the ending! Very few films have had me so choked up; when David goes to sleep for the last time beside his mother, you don't care that he is just a robot - it's still an unforgettable scene well worth the two and a half hour wait.A highly recommended and sadly underrated film, we can only hope that someday this flawed masterpiece gains the respect it deserves. In the meantime, why not go and rent a copy? Trust me - you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bunch of pieces looking for a whole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the main screen writing strategies since Star Wars is to grab from a number of story forms and weave them together. Unfortunately this technique is much harder than it looks.AI shows the episodic and bloated script that results when you don't know how to connect all the story pieces in an organic whole. Writer Steven Spielberg combines elements of Pinocchio, Cain and Abel, The Wizard of Oz, Hansel and Gretel, Joan of Arc, the Holocaust, Christian sacrifice in the Roman Collosseum, fairy tale, science fiction, horror, and drama. But the center does not hold.This script, and film, is like a suspension bridge that is so long it collapses the line. AI pulls most heavily from Pinocchio, but Pinocchio is a simple fairy tale. Both its structure and theme are too slight to sustain anything longer or more important than a short story.But Spielberg has tried to turn Pinocchio into an epic. Collapse was inevitable. First because a puppet or robot boy cannot generate enough audience empathy for an epic. Sure, the boy is cute, and I'd prefer he get back with his "mother." But he is a robot, and I know he is programmed to want her. After about an hour, I need to move on to bigger stakes.This hole where a powerful main character should be also limits the structure. You can't drive an epic structure, especially one made up of so many distinct story units, without a great hero at the wheel.Third, an epic requires an epic theme, in both scope and moral complexity. This has neither. If you remember the original definition of an epic - the fate of a nation rests on the actions of a single individual - you can see how this tale of a machine boy trying to find mom is bound to grow tiresome long before it is over.There are some wonderful scenes and visuals in the film, especially hollowed-out, flooded New York City.But a movie built of pieces can only give momentary pleasure. And when the writer keeps adding pieces with no regard to the audience, the odor of self-indulgence starts to overwhelm. When Spielberg brings in the advanced intellect aliens, followed by the boy's creepy, all-day reunion with mom, the audience with whom I saw the film had clearly had enough.All the critical commentary about uniting the sensibilities of Kubrick and Spielberg is a bunch of auteur nonsense. This film's structure is a bunch of pieces looking for a whole, and no amount of arresting images can make up for it.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Spielberg emotional masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pinocchio, The classic fairy tale written by the Italian Carlo Collodi. It's the story of a young wooden puppet who in his incredible adventures learns to become a real boy so he can go to school, become like all other little boys, and most importantly be loved like a son from the carpenter who created him, Geppetto. Take that immortal tale and re modernize it by making Pinocchio a small robot child, Jiminy Cricket as a robot teddy bear, a loving mother instead of an old poor carpenter, a bratty brother instead of a Fox and Cat and a futuristic American background instead of an old Tuscan one. What you get is A.I.-Artificial Intelligence. A family think they're losing their son Martin and in fear of losing their child they (reluctantly) order a robotic child to replace him. This child is near perfection: obedient, doesn't sleep but keeps quiet and still at night, doesn't eat, doesn't break anything, cute, adorable, gentle, innocent and who will remain like that forever. But that's a problem when the real son returns, having been cured from his disease. The real son is jealous, and eventually manages to convince his parents that the robot child is a danger. So they abandon him in the woods, leaving him at the mercy of fate and forcing him to take a journey through robot massacres, brilliant streets and flooded cities. This movie was meant to be directed by the late Stanley Kubrik, but the project was then put in the hands of Steven Spielberg. And one can tell that they both put their souls into this by the fact that it's a perfect mix between Kubrik's intelligence and Spielberg's heart. Also, I believe that Spielberg did a better job than Kubrik ever could've done (and Kubrik said that too before he passed away) and it can be seen not only by the great emotional touch that only the Steve the great possesses, but also from the fact that Kubrik wanted the movie to end at a certain point when Spielberg instead added an extra ending to it which is one of the most touching in movie history. I admit that I am a great Spielberg fan and thus I love everything he does or says, but I also have to admit that the first time I saw this I had absolutely no idea who he was and yet I enjoyed it as much as I do to this day. Why you ask? Because it is a "brilliant movie". A perfect cocktail of a story made out of superb directing, wonderful acting, marvelously touching score by John Williams, beautiful look, moral ideals, family drama and with a great theme based on intelligence (both organic and mechanical) and heart. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 stars, and it earned every single one of them, for that is "where Dreams are born".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Speilburg and Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI By:Andrew Paulcheck The movie AI was directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Stanley Kubrick. In the near future, the polar ice caps have melted and the oceans waters have risen to flood all costal cities. One company owner, Professor Hobby, has designed a human like boy based on the image of his dead son. His name is David. David is different from most robots because he is programmed to feel love. Monica, his mother, is the woman who adopted him as a substitute for her real son, who is in cryo-stasis because there is no cure for a disease that he has contracted. David lives happily till his brother is cured and sent home. David accidentally endangers his brothers life and is taken back to the lab were he came from for destruction. During the trip, this Monica has a change of heart. Instead of destroying her son she will abandon him in the forest. This movie is the tale of Davis quest of becoming a real boy to gain his mothers love.This movie was marvelous, interesting and suspenseful through out. I typically hate all child actors but the acting by Haley Joel Osment was great for the robot part. Frances O'Connor played a perfect role as a caring mother and Jude Law was a fantastic male prostitute. The camera work and special effects were very well accomplished. In the intense scene when David and Gigolo Joe are running from the Flesh Fair blimp I was given chills at the first sight of the rising moon like blimp. This was quickly followed by an intense chase threw the forest. The other robots in captivity have great effects on them as well. One has a head that can be seen threw and another is a old hunched back.At the Flesh Fair, David is put on display to be executed. Before acid can be poured on him he pleads for his life and people are put in an uproar because the Flesh Fair is killing a boy. He is soon set free. This part of the movie demonstrates the difference between Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. If Stanley Kubrick was directing this movie David would have fought a bloody battle out of the friar. Instead he is able to walk right out due to human compaction. While in captivity at the Flesh Fair, David becomes friends with Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute, framed for a murder and they go on a journey trying to find the Blue Fairy from Pinocchio so she can turn David into a real boy. When David arrives at the house of the Blue Fairy he is shocked to see another David robot already there. This is the point when David realizes he is not an individual but actually a machine. David is outraged and bashes the other David's head in with a lamp. This is the first violent emotional outburst of David. After he talks to Professor Hobby, the man who created David, David learns he is an individual after all. David was the first robot to ever follow his dreams. Sadly, this does not boost David's spirits. As he sits on the top of the building where he thought The Blue Fairy would be and he utters one word,"Mommy". Then throws him self over the edge into water where he sinks down to see an amusement park that has a Pinocchio exhibit. This again is a point were Steven Spielberg has obviously changed. Had Stanley Kubrick Directed this, David would have surely killed himself from the fall off the building. After David sees the Blue Fairy at the Pinocchio exhibit he takes the helicopter under water where he asks the statue, which resembles his mother, to make him a real boy.David stays at the bottom of the ocean with the Blue Fairy for two thousand years until he is unfrozen by aliens looking for the meaning of life through humans. Some people found this odd, but I thought it was a creative twist to the movie. Eventually the aliens are able to bring back David's mother for one day because Teddy, David's teddy bear, had a lock of her hair. This ends up being the best day of David's life and he falls asleep forever. David eventually gets his wish and lays happily with his mother till the end of time. Spielberg's last happy scene of the movie that I'm sure Kubrick would not be happy about.This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. In AI the creativity of Spielberg and Kubrick combine together nicely. They create a happy, dark, science fiction movie that would make any fan of Spielberg or Kubrick leave the theater happy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just watched this film for the second time, and unfortunately I haven't changed my view that its a real mess of a film. I have read those that say people don't like it because, its not the average Spielberg and its deep and thought provoking, I beg to differ.It starts off promisingly dark and atmospheric and ends as a cheesy Disney sci-fi flick. I think Kubrick was turning in his grave when this came out, I felt a mixture of nausea and hilarity at the ridiculous last 30 mins, what the hell happened, did they suddenly think... "Oh dear the audience will be so confused and depressed if we leave it like that, we better do a third act and give it a voice over and explain everything in a patronising manner" it was absolutely vomit inducing and totally insulted my intelligence."Thought provoking"? errr perhaps for the younger audience who are still learning about love and hate, morality, prejudice, human rights, bigotry etc but for adults surely this was a walk in the park? If your wanting thought provoking I suggest you look a little deeper into more independent cinema that spends more time on the script and story line than flashy effects.Saying that, I thought Teddy was great, it was Oscar material he managed to portray a 50 year old man in the body of a 2ft cuddly toy - genius. ;o)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I., Artificial Intelligence, was originally a project - a long time project - of director Stanley Kubrick (Dr Strangelove, Eyes Wide Shut). Kubrick died before the project had got too far. I knew this movie was dedicated to Kubrick but the movie was just so very good I spent little time trying to discover any hidden meaning. I was thinking, 'this is the best movie I've ever seen'. Spielberg and crew do a wonderful job here.Haley Joel Osment plays 'David' an 11 year old boy who is actually an advanced robot. David is an experimental design equipped to learn and feel. David is adopted into the family of Monica and Henry Swinton (Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards). They have an older son Martin (Jake Thomas) who isn't always kind to his new brother.The message isn't very subtle... Over and over and over and over, and over, David cries, "Please make me a real boy".In the end, David is hugged by his mother Monica and lies down with her, the narrator saying, "for one day. . . there was no Martin. . . no Henry. . . no doctor Hobby. . ." Only David and his mom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Artificial Intelligence: AI" would have been better had they ended it a few minutes earlier. Focusing on robot David (Haley Joel Osment) seeking to become a real boy, it certainly looks at some interesting things - namely global warming and fear of the "other" - but about the last twenty minutes made it kind of lousy; that's where you can tell that it was no longer Stanley Kubrick's idea and Steven Spielberg took over.Still, you can see connections to other Kubrick movies, namely during the first few minutes of Gigolo Joe (Jude Law). While dancing Gene Kelly-style, he passes by the Korova bar - all alluding to "A Clockwork Orange". Also, there's the omniscient narrator (although it seems to be Gigolo Joe).A particularly interesting character is Robin Williams as holographic Dr. Know (there's nothing he doesn't). Other cast members include Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards as David's human parents, William Hurt as David's inventor, Brendan Gleeson as an anti-robot crusader, Chris Rock as another robot, and Meryl Streep as a fairy. Not a bad movie, but it should have been better given what went into it.</fullReview>

Love Jude law in this one, adds a great twist to the movie. William Hurt turns in a fantastic performance as well, and Haley Joel Osment gives in my eyes an Oscar worthy performance. I know many will cringe at the thought of this movie deserving any award, but that's why we have these comments, so everyone can say their own peace.Many Kubrick purists don't like the last few minutes of the ending, I can understand why, but at the same time it finds me in tears all the way till the credits finish rolling.

		<shortDescription>Spielberg loses the plot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure what the film is trying to achieve. It starts off as sci-fi, metamorphoses into a Gilliam-esquire fairytale (via the redneck county fair from Blues Brothers 2000 and the set from The Day After Tomorrow) and finishes with the usual saccharine Spielberg ending. For some reason the film is narrated for the last 20 minutes, but not before that.Visually it's all very clever but failed to excite me at all. There are gaping plot holes and the sci-fi element is laughable.One of those films where I felt I ought to hang on until the end because I'd already spent 2 hours of my life on it, but really just wanted to turn off the TV and go to bed.A film doesn't have to be accessible to be enjoyable - Donnie Darko is a fine example of a baffling film that still works out - but AI made no sense at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The idiot auteur dumps yet another turd in an overflowing toilet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the start the film's concept is hard to swallow (A robot child that never grows up? What's the point? At what point do you get rid of it and get an older one?) and nothing that happens over the course of the film makes it any more feasible. The plot draws out with painful predictability: a few scenes of the mother bonding with her robot "son", then her real-life son coming out of the coma he began the movie in. Conflicts between the human and robot child result, which eventually prompt the mother to release the robot into the woods (with much melodrama and the typical Spielberg tear-jerking tactics) so he won't be deactivated as a threat to her real son. Next we get an annoyingly forced and obvious Holocaust metaphor. One robot even drags out the "history repeats itself" adage, so utterly threadbare and rendered absolutely meaningless by this point. Pointless and unfunny slapstick abounds, mostly in the form of Jude Law playing a foppish prancing gigolo robot. If your intelligence is not insulted at any point in this movie, then the insult is richly deserved. Robin Williams and Chris Rock get enlisted as bit voice-actors, solely to draw the viewers out of the story, I would assume--certainly there is no other reason to put famous actors in such roles. Meanwhile John Williams phones in yet another generic and forgettable score.Finally the movie plods far enough along for Spielberg to drop the Big Shocker on us: the robot child is only one of many identical ones that are being mass-produced from the public. The droid freaks out, and as final damning evidence of how emotionally unstable and potentially dangerous he is, he destroys one of the other robots. The robot company decides to release thousands more of the model anyway. I guess lawsuits are a thing of the past in the this brave new world. Just in case you managed to take some of what proceeded in the movie seriously, the final act seems designed to destroy any plausibility it had. I won't spoil it for you. However, it's so poorly-written and incongruous with the rest of the film that I'd be remiss to not mention it. It reminds me of creative writing assignments I used to get in middle school, where the teacher would ask me to write another chapter to the end of an assigned book and I'd come up with something like "Chapter 27: Holden Caulfield Solves A Murder Mystery."Utter crap with a veneer of phony sophistication.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat down to A.I. expecting a movie full of wonder and amazement. I got that at times. At other times, I wanted to turn it off. When it was finally over, I really wanted to like this film but I just felt like I was in a ship on stormy seas and was seasick from it all. The movie starts out in a very somber tone. It explains how the earth is suffering the effects of global warming and the creation of robots, specifically one who can love. David, the loving Robot, is purchased by a family whose own son is on life support. Soon enough, the son improves and the mother decides she doesn't need David anymore. So she drops David and Teddy (the best and warmest character in the movie) in the woods and David goes on a journey to become a real boy and to earn the love of his mother.This is a very sad way to start the film, but it is then that we start to see a little of a "quest" in the movie (a la Wizard of Oz) and it begins to feel magical. Then, we get depressed again as we are introduced to a "pleasure robot" and how a woman is afraid of his "functional abilities." This totally lurches the movie from a kind of magical quality to in your face smut. Then, we see a "flesh fair" in which defective robots are destroyed in an arena to the delight of the humans. Then, we are taken to a city which has buildings in the shapes of women in provocative poses. I knew this was a pet project of Kubrick but I didn't know a lot of his perverted imagery and characters would be included in the film. Once we get past that, then we have a few more magical moments and then we are introduced to more dark images and finally, more magical moments. By the time it is all over, I was exhausted. Did I like the movie? I liked the Spielberg "moments" but I disliked the Kubrick ones. This maybe what they had intended but to me, it made for a very uneven and overall unsatisfying film.</fullReview>

I thought this movie might be simliar to classic Issac Asimov's "I,Robot" where a robot seeks to become human. Instead I watched a futuristic science fiction version of "Pinnochio". The simliars abound between A.I. and the Disney's "Pinochio": robot instead of a marionette, a robotic teddy bear instead of Jimmy Cricket, the robot creator instead of Geppeto, and Joe Gigolo instead of Pinnochio street wise companion 'Lampblack'(sorry I am unsure of the name). The robot Teddy Bear was the most interesting character to me. This robot Teddy Bear stated the obvious throughout the movie such 'I don't know if you should do that David'. Spoiler alert ahead. Finally on the ending, I thought the movie should have ended 20 minutes before it did with David the robot trapped with no obvious means of escape. The ending that Spielberg directed was the same style of Stanley Kubrick's "2001" cryptic ending. I felt the Spielberg honoring Kubrick at the ended was the least he could have done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new 2001 - A Space Odyssey, now with Spielberg involved :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was originally a Stanley Kubrick production but he sadly passed away some time before he could finish this project, which is sad.Kubrick really was ahead of his time when he back in 1960 directed Spartacus, starring Kirk Douglas. This was a movie of epic scale with movie sets bigger than ever seen before. Eight years later, Kubrick directed and produced the timeless classic "2001 - A Space Odyssey," a production he cared so much for that even details as what kind of screws the set crew used for assembling the spaceship had to be verified by Stanley himself. This kind of attention to detail resulted in one of the biggest movies ever. Kubrick was a man eager to explore the human mind and how it reacted when exposed to bizarre and sometimes unimaginable situations. In 2001 ASO, we had HAL, a supercomputer threatening to take over command on the spaceship, where the humans had to struggle for their lives against a.i. "2001 - A Space Odyssey" came out when the space age was in its infancy and made some people fear the technological progression while others laughed of Kubrick's fictional sense of drama.This brings me to AI, a movie that really is true to Kubricks insights in modern society and where it will take us in a "what if..." scenario. AI is in many ways comparable to 2001 A Space Odyssey in which the viewer is required to really stay focused on what is really going on. If you watch the movie with a laid back attitude while concerned about if you brought enough popcorn to last the whole movie, you should have picked another movie for your viewing pleasure.There is a lot of layers in AI, and to get the most out of it you should see it once and digest it for weeks, months even, and then pick it up on video/DVD and watch it all over. I guarantee that the story will grow on you and you will always remember it, much in the same sense the viewers of 2001 A Space Odyssey back in 1968.Even in the year 2001, people still fear what Kubrick may have foreseen while the rest yawn through the 2 hour + movie and then laugh of his fictional sense of drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece and Best Film of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely have I been so emotionally and intellectually simulated watching a film that do not talk down nor spell out to the audience. This film A.I.: Artificial Intelligence is a rare epitome. Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, George Miller's Babe: Pig in the City, Orson Welles' Citizen Kane and the uncommon few are fine examples demonstrating that film is indeed an art form. There are subtle and subliminal metaphors throughout the film. In order to perceive the film correctly, you must pay attention from the beginning. The concept is drawn from the source material "Supertoys Last All Summer Long" by Brian Aldiss to be developed into a script by Ian Watson and Stanley Kubrick. After Kubrick passed away in early March 1999, Steven Spielberg, as a personal and confidential friend of Kubrick's, was obliged to bring A.I. project to the silver screen. Many of the scenes pay respect to the spirit of Kubrick, e.g. the first shot of Gigolo Joe's face after the fade-in-black transition, the dark and grim Flesh Fair sequence, David's endless quest for love and the deceptively simple happy ending with an underlying complex subtleness of a cruel aftermath. This is a true homage to Kubrick, for he is one of the most intellectually perplexing filmmakers in the history of cinema.I will not elaborate on the story, the visuals, the emotional impact because doing so would ruin the magical experience of watching AI for the first time. AI does have flaws, but it can be overlooked and ignored once your attention is rapt throughout the film. This is a rare film that's intensely moving without the emphasis on sentimentality (as Spielberg is well-known and notorious for) and I cried randomly throughout the film as much as the last half hour of Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark. It is also a rare film that makes people, albeit less forcefully, think and become intellectually active watching the film. For those who hate AI for whatever reason - and that includes the religious right - you have not seen deep enough of the depth of human fallacies as depicted in the film. AI serves as a warning to mankind what happens when we ignore potential consequences in pursuit of war, greed and indulgence. The film is about finding love in the midst of the industrialized world rife with ignorance, violence, cruelty and apathy. That's why Kubrick wanted to tell us that love and empathy are the natural things that should be taken as priority above others in this rapidly developing world.Ai is a visually, emotionally and intellectually stunning film, regardless of inherent logical flaws. AI have the best seamless visual effects ever implemented in a film, which is truly groundbreaking - numerous robot outcasts convincingly played by "disabled" actors, Teddy is incredible and the Ice Excavation sequence is the most astonishing and moving visual effect scene I have ever seen. Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law as David and Gigolo Joe are truly spectacular and deserving of Oscar nominations, as do Teddy voiced with sweetness and wisdom by Jack Angel. Had Stanley Kubrick been alive and directed AI, it would be his last and best masterpiece instead of Eyes Wide Shut. Indeed, Kubrick's version of AI - crueler, more violent and colder in trademark film-making style but heart-warmingly subtle and intensely moving to the point of unbearable with mind-blowing seamless visual effects and stellar acting - may very well be one of the best adaption films, if not the FILM ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Travesty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vies with "Waterworld" for Most Unintentional Laughs in a Ridiculously Pompous Film. As such, it might actually be worth a rental, but (and I'm just going to "spoil" it for you) there's a very unfortunate scene featuring the torture of runaway robots during a heavy metal concert that should never have happened. Children really shouldn't see it. I shouldn't have seen it. Nobody should see it. Also, the darned thing is 145 minutes long, so perhaps it's best to just rent "Waterworld" itself. A real travesty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me please begin by saying that when it comes to movies I am not too hard to please. Some cute catch phrase, a sweet endearing story or even just a low brow "guilty pleasure", and I'm happy.I sat thru this film at the theatre. I am not the type of person that would ever walk out of a movie (simply because I don't want to have wasted $7.50 on the admission), but if I were ever to have walked out on a movie this would have been the first. It was long and painfully drawn-out. I waited in the dark of the theatre for the end of this movie to come and when it did...finally,it was not the redemption needed to save this film from being one of the worst things I have ever seen. Save yourself the cash of renting or even buying this. Go the the local 7-11 and watch a burrito in the microwave, I promise you will have more excitement and adventure at your local convenience store than you will in watching this terrible waste of money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From reading what everyone one this board is saying about this great FILM! Either you hate it or love it. THAT'S what makes a film ETERNAL my friends!***SPOILER*** This movie some how tugs at things we have experience...from being disowned to looking for something or someone to replace that "empty space" Example, we all thought that David's creator would reviled to him that he was created out from an image of his decease son, Thus having us think that David would somehow switch his original program of loving the "adopted family" to loving his REAL father. We longed for that to happen but it never did! A lot of viewers was disapointed. Imagined what would have happen if he would have seen the family pictures of him and his real dad! Spielberg teased us with that one!Sometimes we tend to disown or hate things when we don't understand or when we start to feel vulnerable (like the ending of this great film). Not ending the way we wanted to end.Remember, it's all right to cry.If you are putting together a library, this is one to have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece that will be better appreciated in time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vertigo. Star Wars. Fight Club. When these three films came out, they were financial disappointments. (Except Star Wars.) But, be that as it may, they all share the same disastrous prone tendencies. The critics despised them. Years later, the critics who ridiculed these classics are forced to eat their words. Vertigo is now considered to be Hitchcock's master work over Psycho, Rear Window and North By Northwest. Star Wars is thought of as a milestone in Hollywood history with it's visual effects and unprecedented cult following. Fight Club has launched a mass production of marketing including hats, shirts and posters, all which can be found conveniently at your local Suncoast. And for the year 2001, there was A.I.It has been months since I have seen Steven Spielberg's latest film. As his first film in several years, I anticipated a fairly good show. Besides, it was in joint with my favorite director, Stanley Kubrick who had passed the project on to America's most beloved director. After Kubrick's death, I was baffled as to whether or his unfinished project Artificial Intelligence was to be made or remain in pre-production limbo forever. When I heard that good old Spielberg was to take over the project, I felt relief knowing no one else alive could tackle a Kubrick film like the master of emotion. I traveled to the theater two days after it's release. Going to a moderately late show, I remember the theater was extremely cold; metaphorically ironic considering it was the beginning of July. The metaphor being that Artificial Intelligence was a chilling story of a mecha boy who traveled through the remains of a post-apocalyptic society to become a real boy. As we have learned throughout history, the world is not always as "warm" as one thought.Taking place in the near future, the polar ice caps have melted and flooded coastal cities. As the surviving civilization scramble to the middle of the continents, they begin to create advanced sophisticated forms of robots. A visionary robot manufacturer has created a landmark Artificially Intelligent toy. His name is David, who is played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment. David's function: To give and receive natural love from his unnatural parents. We than cut to a father and mother visiting their son, who is diagnosed with an incurable disease. As he chills away in his cryogenic chamber, the parents of he come to a decision. The result is their adopting David in place of their dying son. In order to fully complete his meaning, David must be activated by a seven word combination. For David, he belongs forever to his parents. The only way for him to avoid his longing for love without them would be to disconnect him from service. The unfortunate circumstances of her hapless natural child causes Monica to imprint David. As David receives the love of his mother, a miracle takes place: Monica's natural son returns cured of his disease.As the two children begin a game of rivalry, David's brother contemplates ways in order to get him in danger out of vivid jealously. Eventually, Monica reluctantly decides to take David back to the manufacturer to have him deactivated. Her heart is too big to have him disassembled, so she abandons him in the woods with "Teddy". This is the sweet tale of the story. Spielberg's version. The fantasy world. A happy environment where nothing goes wrong. Out of nowhere, we are introduced to Kubrick's nightmarish world in which we are forced to reexamine the cold hard reality we have ventured into.In a long, Kubrick-like zoom, we track away from a man's face played by Jude Law in one of his best performances. A Sex toy robot named Gigolo Joe is working with one of his clients; a first-timer who hired him to "perform his services." As he secludes and hides from those who hunt him, we begin to understand what we have entered. The dark visions ensue. The Flesh Fairs. The incessantly daunting police. The callous manufacturers who make mechas and than commend them for being unique, but not authentic. It is THE real world we have entered. Mechas are hunted by humans (or orgas) for not being licensed and are disintegrated sadistically by their captors. And than there is Rouge City, whose decadent sexual themes are thrown around as calmly as the economical symbolisms of New York's modern Stock Market. In a chance meeting, David congregates with Gigolo Joe. The two journey in search for the blue fairy, who will allegedly make David a real boy. This takes them to the end of the world, A haunting recreation of Earth's most recognizable city underwater: New York. Both characters are representatives of Spielberg's childhood fantasy world and Kubrick's bleak anarchist world. David being Spielberg's compassionate, yearning and affectionate protagonist. And Gigolo Joe being Kubrick's icy, comical and methodical antagonist.Many people hated this film, audience and critical alike mostly because of the weak ending. I admit, I left the theater disappointed of the lack of substance. But now I feel a subtle warmth towards the film and even the ending. To me, it was necessary for it to end on a blissful level; it's character began that way. It is my belief that a film should metaphorically close the way it opened. And in a way, the ending is a good representation of that. Had it ended where most thought it should had, the positive elements of humanity would have been lost like David in the sea.In time, other's will realize it's true meaning and upon enough viewings, possibly change their universal opinions. A.I. isn't meant to be about how mankind will destroy itself. It's meant to be about how HOPE may be what saves us after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I.: An Extraordinary Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cirrus+Socrates+Particle+Decibel+Hurricane+Dolphin+Tulip=the words robots have to listen to when they want to dream and desireAfter having watched A.I.: Artificial Intelligence some of the greatest films ever made came into my mind: The familiar scenes reminds me of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, although in these less idyllic sequences director Steven Spielberg portrays David's attempts to be a perfect child. A dark city world, bringing in some kind of counterbalance towards the clean life of the mechas, reminds me of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange. The Flesh-Fair-Stadium with Gladiator-Battles reminds me of a modern Rock concert, David Fincher's Fight Club and Ridley Scott's Gladiator. In the second part of A.I. you can find parallels to The Wizard of Oz and Blade Runner. But A.I. is no bundle of great films. There are only these parallels towards other masterpieces; the story and the film in the whole gives us something, which has never been on the silver screen. Especially the end of the film doesn't remind me of 2001 - A Space Odyssey because of its content, moreover because of its mystic, positive (or negative?) and great ending. A.I. consists of several blocks, which does not fit together on the first view, but they yield one imposing whole such as 2001. Optically A.I. is a massive force, as regards content as well. An in detail thought over technical plausibility is connected with mystic and philosophical elements, a daring and analytic view is paired with effective pictures. Gratitude goes to one great actor: Haley Joel Osment, who is the center of the film such as the monolith in 2001. The other actors are good as well. Jude Law as Gigolo Joe plays a brilliant part as well as Frances O'Connor with a remarkable talent for sentimental scenes. A.I. is not only an optically overwhelming vision of the future, at the most comparable with Blade Runner. In addition, the set decoration is absolute perfection. Many critics consider the first half of A.I. the Kubrick-Touch (=dark) and the second half the Spielberg-Touch (=more warm-hearted). The critics criticize this 'illogical' combination. But they overlook two things by claiming this: On the one hand Kubrick himself wanted the Spielberg-Touch, because the film shouldn't be too dark and philosophical. And on the other hand they forget that the director of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is also the impressive director of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. Moreover it is just dumb to discuss where Kubrick ends and Spielberg starts, because A.I. is just a film of Steven Spielberg based on ideas of Stanley Kubrick (and Brain Aldiss and Ian Watson!!!). (Such as Saving Private Ryan isn't a movie only by Screenwriter Robert Rodat)A.I. is the most daring and many-sided Science-Fiction-Vision since 2001 - A Space Odyssey. Never since the Release of Kubrick's masterpiece a Science Fiction Film has been filled with such an impressive and overwhelming content (and ending!). For me A.I. is the best Sci-Fi movie since 2001, better than any other movie in between. And it is one of Spielberg's best movies next to Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and E.T.And YOU all have to think about this film, if you do not like it. Every time a great movie appears you will find it out years later what it's worth is. A.I. is great, because there are so many things to think about: Many possibilities for interpretations (e.g.: A.I. Ending) and many questions to ask: What is a human being? When are you human? What does us make human? The love, the death, the faith? Are we allowed to love robots? Can we love them when they love us? Does a robot have the same rights? Can a robot replace a human being in things such as love, having feelings?? Does he have personality? When we do not love them can we simply (as in A.I. it was a choice for Mr. Swinton) give them back or destroy them? Has a robot child the same rights as a human brother (like in A.I.: it wasn't)? And you can ask more questions and try to answer them or to think about them. I think, when the time is come for the first robots (like in A.I.), the people will talk about the motion picture by Spielberg?It is a pity that A.I. has not done well at the Academy Awards, Golden Globes etc. and in critic's views. I do believe, after years and after the release of the Director's Cut of A.I., all the people considering 2001 a masterpiece are going to consider Spielberg's A.I. a masterpiece and one of our most significant movies of all time. My favorite it is, already!10+ out of 10 stars (Great!)And sorry for the mistakes, English is not my mother tongue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the bad reviews and comments my expectations about A.I were not really optimistic. I had to drag my girlfriend along with me to the cinema. The main reason that I had for still being interested in A.I. was the fact Stanley Kubrick had worked on it. One of the reasons for my lack of trust in this film was the involvement of a certain mister Spielberg. I am not very fond of most of his movies, for they lack depth and they are the kind of sentimental, crowd-pleasing entertainment that Hollywood has become so notorious for. But after seeing A.I. I will forever respect Steven Spielberg as a true artist.I understood why this film had done so badly in the US and why it had received so much negative publicity: it was too intelligent. While watching A.I. I was stunned over and over again by its ability to raise important philosophical and social issues. It is the kind of film Socrates or Friedrich Nietzsche would enjoy, if they would be around these days.It is a journey into the mind and into the soul of humanity; searching for questions and answers concerning our existence and the meaning of our presence. It is very good that the film doesn't provide any real answers to the questions it raises. If it would have tried to, A.I. would have been just another unrealistic Hollywood, sci-fi-blockbuster. But it doesn't. Pretending to know the answers to the most important questions of life, would be arrogant and stupid; a bit like the United States' political image in the world today.It was very brave of Steven Spielberg to avoid pleasing the crowd with easy answers and a normally developing story. I didn't only enjoy the story: the acting and the SFX were breathtaking as well. I can't believe that a boy as young as Haily-Joel Osment can act like he does. After the 6th Sense another incredible performance by him. For me there is no doubt that A.I. is the best movie of 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and Disturbing ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that expectations of this film are way too high. This film has to have entertainment value for Spielberg to put it out. It has incredible visual effects and excellent talent. I think what kills it as a financial success for Spielberg is the fact that he took such a risk with the emotions of the audience.We don't like the ugly mirror image of ourselves. Not all the gloss that Spielberg can call upon can mask the darkness. I found myself in shock, just trying to deal with the sheer inhumanity directed at the David character. It makes you question what it is that makes us a race worthy of outlasting the future beings we will create.They will surpass us in all things. We like to think that we have a corner on human compassion, but this movie will make you question what really makes us special.I really liked this movie. It isn't perfect. I think the human characters are 2 dimensional and flawed on purpose in order to underscore the importance of the mecha's innocence. This is the same device used in the old monster movies. The trick is, mecha's are supposed to have been created for the good of humanity. Aaaah! There are so many ways you can go with this. To leave saying it was "stupid" or "not as good as ----" misses the whole point. If you can't get excited about the implications of A.I., you shouldn't see the movie. Otherwise, see it as soon as you get a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerfully personal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I am not a fan of Spielberg or Kubrick, I would definitely name this film as the first masterpiece of the twenty-first century. No film before it has comparable strength, and probably no film after it will be able to duplicate its power. The story described a robotic boy's unconditional love for his human mother, and his sacrifices on a determined journey to become real, so that he could be loved in return. It was Pinocchio in reality, told by Kubrick, almost in Sadism. Fortunately, there was more to the story. His adventure, lead by Spielberg, explored issues of morality, individuality, and ventured into realms of social commentary. The satisfying ending was neither tragedy nor comedy, but a stroke of genius that required some reflection on the audience's part. Although the movie was more than two hours long, it certainly did not feel so. If anything, it felt a little bit on the short side (even after, my three viewings). Spielberg had painted a visually stunning and credible futuristic world that seemed larger that what you see on the screen. It felt as if the initial family drama, the subsequent adventure, and the development of the Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) demand further exploration. Rumor has it that a four-hour DVD is to be released. I will not hesitate to buy it. I could understand the public's polarized perception of this film. As a psychologist in training, I found the film incredibly introspective. It was so personal that some people would find it difficult to confront. The message delivered was so complex that some people would not be able to comprehend. I believe Spielberg had the opportunity to make the film into another E.T., and sell it like another Jurassic Park. The fact that he didn't make it into a soppy Hollywood crowd-pleaser is what made this film great. Compared to Artificial Intelligence, all the movies before it about technology and humanity seemed childish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting and thought provoking - as Sci-fi should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI is a very good film. I was disappointed to see it as poorly received as it was - splitting both the public and the film's critics alike.The public perceived it as boring and slow and long. I see this as something we can blame on the last couple of decade's films where all Hollywood fair has been quick, snappy films which has no confidence in the viewers attention span, forcing the audience to become used to quicker films.When a film such as A.I comes along that does trust the audience to take an interest and wait for events to unfold, the audience cries "Boring!".I see the film as thought provoking and extremely relevent in today's ever-advancing world of science and technology. Like the Terminator films warned us of giving too much responsibility to learning computers, AI warns us of trying to replace our children with robots who will outlive us, and create another form of racism where mecha's are hated through envy of being able to last, and evolve beyond us. The only way Spielberg could get his message across to us, and prove it at the same time, is by allowing us to care for David (a mesmerising Haley Joel Osment) and share his passion, desire and love to find the Blue Fairy. In doing this, we believe he IS as good as human (emotionally), even though we know he is not. We feel and support his determination, loss, desire and fear when he does - even though he is an A.I. Some have criticised the film for being too melodramatic. I thought so too, but after seeing a second time (once in America on its release, 2nd in previews in UK) I found it less manipulative, and more a reflection of David's intense emotions.Spielberg's direction has reached a different level; parallel with Schindlers, but from a different angle. I dont think we'll see the likes of this kind of direction from him again, because of Stanley Kubrick's creative involvement in the project, in giving him 1000-odd drawings and storyboards and sketches, after his death. It's unique.All in all - a super film, with brains, and respect for the audience.A rare quantity these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant and disturbing fairytale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is obvious as a Kubrick and Speilberg collaboration. It is haunting and disturbing, it is original and brilliant, it is a dark fairytale that lives on in the mind. It lives on in the mind for many reasons: The cinematography is brilliant, angles symbolising unoriginality and other themes of the film, and long established shots that leave you wondering how Haley Joel Osment managed not to blink for so long. Which brings me to the next reason, the acting. The acting in A.I. is superb, it is hard to believe Haley Joel Osment is only in his early teens, he takes on this role with such depth you would not expect a boy his age to hold. Jude Law is spectacularly charming as Gigolo Joe, a mecha you can't help but love, even though we know he's just mechanics. Australian actress Frances O'Connor is also wonderful as 'Mommy.'There is a reason I am not giving away the plot. Speilberg fought to keep the plot a secret until the films opening and if you haven't seen it this is very effective. One of the reasons also that this is so haunting is because of the possibility. From the very opening voice over you know that this is really what could happen, whilst still being a fairy tale. Perhaps the most haunting shot is the one of Manhattan, in the future, the Twin Towers, eroded, but still standing. The audience I saw this movie with let out a collective, saddened sigh. Something I will never forget. This film, which is about artificially intelligent beings, is really about human needs and human emotion, and I don't think a lot of audiences gave it a chance. See the film, understand it's depth, appreciate it, and let yourself cry. It's definetely going to be a classic, is one of Speilbergs best works and is a beautiful tribute to the master of originality and genius filmmaker Stanley Kubrick.</fullReview>

Human feelings, fear, love, simulacro, god... are some of the questions.Haley Joel Osment is a SUPERB actor. The way he develops the robot evolution towards a human being is fantastic. He never blinks his eyes, as a robot should do. This is a facial expression that adds a lot of impact to his role. He really deserves the Oscar this year.The only thing I would change is the end. Its a kind of sentimental (Spielberg style), but it doesn't compromise the film as a whole.This film requires thinking for many days to be fully assimilated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning, if you intend to see this movie, don't read this comment.AI is very nearly a perfect movie that one can analyze line by line and find meaning, there is no wasted space. I have read some of the criticism of this movie, and find them weird. I wonder if the people who criticize the movies end as silly and sentimental noticed that:1. The human race died off - and 2. We were told many times during the movie that it was a version of the fairy tale Pinocchio. The movie was just not over when David found the blue fairy. (and never mind the haunting quality of the Robot Child asking it the same question over and over for 2,000 years)It is not a movie that ever lets you off easily, and while Pinocchio's wish is granted, it is only granted for a day and disturbs it's viewers with the ideas that one day the human race may be extinct, and one day we may discover a race of beings more intelligent and technically proficient than us, and the first thing that we would do if we developed robots is start having sex with them.And oh, the moments. The Robot Nanny smiling at the Robot David as she is being disintegrated, Gigolo Joe telling David to remember him to the ladies as he is being carted off to the police. These robots are more human than us and more robotic than us; they are not metaphorically their jobs, they are their jobs. We all have to face the idea that we may not be unique, and still have the courage to try to be unique and to be loved, and that all experience on this planet is transitory, and that 50 years may not be a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I distinctly recall feeling a ping in my body due to every single possible emotion that can be triggered in a human being... doing just THAT! I have never experienced such a movie before in my life. True, A.I. is a contrast to the rest of Spielberg's great films, yet it takes one who can accept and attain a darker side of mentality to appreciate this. In OTHER words... it requires INTELLIGENCE AND INSIGHT!!! I spent a great while debating with myself of whether or not the advertising for the film was either brilliant or unjustly misleading... on ONE hand... I went into the theater just to see two AMAZING directors' compilation of ideas and thoughts... without expectations of anything less than brilliant.. on the OTHER hand... I also went in expecting a less strong focus on the abandonment and survival issues... but UNLIKE MOST viewers.. I was PLEASANTLY surprised! I thought it was a shocking and brilliant twist/turn. It forced the audience to truly attach themselves to the character instead of just mindlessly observing its actions.The special effects, as in any other Spielberg, were none less than remarkable... the performances of both Osment and O'Connor were gripping... my heartstring were tugged and tossed rambunctiously! Jude Law provided a nice bit of comic relief and the voice of Williams brought me into realization that such a compilation of talented actors.. regardless how tiny the part.. came together to be a part of such GREATNESS! I am LIVID at the amount of dissatisfied viewers of the movie... this movie wasn't MEANT to be SOLELY entertaining... Good God.. it's KUBRICK'S original idea.. how can you NOT expect some sort of twist? So what it's not your TYPICAL summer movie... so WHAT it was dark?? In the end... it comes full circle with the TRUE meaning and anyone who cannot comprehend that should not try to put in their two cents in this movie industry's giants and greats. (Kubrick/Spielberg) I dunno... maybe I'm too defensive... leave it to a future genius to defend her heros, I s'pose... Let's just say.. if you like to THINK and RELATE and FEEL emotions in a film... you'll love future products from this direction..Okay.. my plug is done.. synopsis... A.I. RULES!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other reviewers seem to imply that the only way a person would not like this movie is people who didn't "get" it. Hogwash! I "got" it alright and like the child who told the emperor he was naked, I am here to say Spielberg has a big old smelly maudlin flop on his hands. I am sorry for this too as Jude Law and Haley Joel Osment, doing the best the can with what they had, will likely be lost in the word of mouth that will kill this movie. I, being a movie buff, like many others will go to see it for one reason or the other, but most will come away with the realization that the movie never gets enough throttle to sell it. When it tries, at least for me, it fails. I didn't see one frame in this movie that I haven't already seen Spielberg do and over do before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie, I was excited about the premise and the reviews I had read. Unfortunately about half way through the movie I was bored out of mind. I did not like the main characters, I didn't care about them. Only Jude Law was interesting and kept the movie moving. I have really like many of Speilberg's other movies but they were thought provoking and interesting. This movie was very dull, long and slow moving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My fiancee &amp; I have come to the consensus (yes it only took two of us) that this is the worst film we've seen. Let me qualify that. We went &amp; saw 'What Dreams May Come'. For a few years now, that movie had reigned supreme, it's infantile script &amp; vapid attempts at philosophy unparalleled by would-be-contenders (including such notables as 'Get Carter' &amp; 'Pitch Black'!).But watch out guys! There's a new kid on the block &amp; let me tell you, ole' Mr Kubrick's rolling in his grave. Let's just say that I could craft a more substantial plot of gossamer. Or perhaps that this movie reads like an abstract painting, which'd be ok if that wasn't done by a mindless chimp whacked out on too many episodes of 'Hook' (yes, the TV cartoon).AI's artlessness is unrelenting. You'd think they'd get some things right just by accident, but the whole thing's a colossal flop. You'll gasp at the paucity of imagination when you meet the 'Blue Fairy' beneath the seas of Man-hattan (get it, they're not men, they're cyborgs!)Here's what I think happened: Spielberg was sitting in his den cobbling together this wonderland fable &amp; he kept getting interrupted by a 4 year old:"How 'bout this Daddy?""Oo, Oo!""I've got a new good idea.""...and then they go here &amp; do that, &amp; now they do this...."The whole movie seems like it's trying to distract you from itself. And let me tell you, I'll be the first to admit I wish that'd worked.But who am I to kwetch? Don't believe me? See this piece of crud for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quest story takes wrong road</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** WARNING: SPOILERS ** A.I. Artificial Intelligence begins with the promising premise of a little boy robot imbued with human emotions and the need to by loved by its mother. The first act of the movie shows all the Spielberg artistry as David (the robot) begins to bond with a married couple whose real son is comatose in the hospital. Unexpectedly, though, the real (and evil) son recovers and returns to the household. Now there is no need for the surrogate child and after various complications the mother takes David out into the woods to abandon him (similar to Snow White or Hansel and Gretel). Here, the movie takes a disastrous turn from which it never recovers. Having heard his surrogate mother tell the story of Pinocchio, David goes in search of the Blue Fairy to turn him into a real boy so that his mother will love him. But this is a sci-fi movie, not a fairy tale, so the audience knows that David's quest will be in vain from the start. The final acts progress to be darker and darker. Eventually we find ourselves 2000 years into the future. The mother David bonded with is long dead and turned to dust. Space aliens who now inhabit earth are able to grant David only one day with her facsimilie through DNA cloning. The explanation for only one day is completely unsatisfying -- and for David to have waited and searched for 2000 years to find one day of love is a huge disappointment for the audience. And what's most irritating is this story could have been resolved so much more skillfully ? just as it was in "The Wizard of Oz" or "Miracle on 34th Street." David's quest to be a real boy wasn't what he was really searching for at all ? and that is the twist that should have been employed here. He only wanted to be loved by his mother. This movie would have been far more powerful and moving by having the mother have a change of heart (maybe her evil son had a relapsed and died?) and gone out on her own quest in search of David ? with the final resolution that they find each other and share their love. A proper denouement would have been to jump ahead 50 years when the mother is old and on her death bed and they find a palatable way for David to expire at the same time. (Remember the old song, "My Grandfather's Clock"?) A.I. is a bleak, dark, sad vision of the future. Certainly not for children under 13 and perhaps not even for those under 17. Children who have any fear of parental abandonment might be deeply troubled by this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I just got out of this movie and were appalled at how ridiculous it was. I had to get on the web and see how this movie was reviewed and while most of them made some play on the fact that the movie was not "intelligent" I will have to say it just plain sucked.Without giving anything away, there is virtually no character development, the whole series of events after the first five minutes is amazingly implausible, and besides an incredible performance by Osmet (and maybe even Jude law) the acting/writing is ridiculous. I really need a thesaurus to accurately describe just how poorly this movie turned out.Before you think I missed the point, I picked up on all the subtle references to Kubrick's and Spielberg's previous works, it just didnt have any real substance. This movie could have been so much more, its a shame it isnt. Please go see this movie, it will give you something to talk about for hours! I think it will take at least a month before I can get just how bad this movie was out of my system. I feel violated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not waste anyone's time and give the movie details everyone should know by now. I am at a loss for words over all the people who think this is a masterpiece. This movie tries way too hard and forgets what makes a good movie.My feelings about the movie?? Most painful movie to watch, ever. Choppy, no character development, confusing emotional balance, annoying, overly long, I was PLEADING for it to end, most of the movie makes very little sense. I love Spielberg and I love SciFi..but I would give my right arm to get those 3 horrible hours back.A few irritations; Monica's son is gone and then just suddenly comes back. Why take on David if your son is still alive or has the chance to come back to life? With all the David psycho moments; is he going to go horror flick or is he not? Why put in the terrifying psycho moments; like being able to project the phone call; if we are supposed to feel for David? I never could, he was one creepy little dude.How can Monica go from hate and disgust to love so quickly when the actions of David keep getting creepier? Why not give David back, he is just a robot, instead of horrifyingly dropping him off into a forest? If the robots of 2000 years in the future can bring Monica back for a day, why can't they just keep making her over and over? What happens to Monica and her family after dropping David off? I could go on and on. While many of the actors do a great job, the story is just choppy and annoying. I seriously want my three hours back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the comment of another viewer...Spielberg takes science fiction and adds 500 pounds of sugar. I might add he also adds 8000 pounds of rehashed filming ideas (the woods at night) and story gimmicks from his last 50 films and other pop "science fiction" films =anorexic 4 fingered aliens..cute sassy furry toys etc etc etc... I also just watched Metropolis and tell me Joe the gigalo doesn't resemble Marie?It is basically a hodge podge of gimmicks designed to hook the maximum number of viewers. I can see the producers saying lets add a dash of sex and punk rock....maybe making motor cycles look like evil dogs would update things for the ex punkers.Here are a couple lousy flaws with the logic(?) of this movie. Other comments have fortunately covered the others better than I could. 1)Why have the kid (something about his beady too small staring eyes gets on your nerves)smash another robot's head after one the major premises of this movie is that robots should be treated like humans. How does that not contradict everything?2)The complete nonsense downer of space time constraints? What the ****???Don't rent or watch this movie!</fullReview>

It just shows that these days directors often go for effects and famous stars rather than a decent plot. Gigalo robots Awesome! (not) The bottom line is robots should only be used when controlled by humans fighting each other! not in a stupid drama with a little annoying American gimp. When i saw the trailer for this film i was fooled into thinking it would be a decent fantasy film set in the future not a crappy drama that was meant to make the audience sympathetic towards an annoying child robot....If you want more action and a better story see I-robot instead you will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

As the father, Sam Robards gives a wooden performance and he's supposed to be HUMAN!!! Frances O'Connor (who is a good actress) is either miscast or all her good scnes got cut. She comes off as such a neurotic and confused woman that I could have cared less whether David ever finds her or not.

		<shortDescription>Wonderful mix between Spielberg and Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw "A.I." for the first time I was captivated, speechless and I just sat and stared at the screen throughout the whole film. I had never seen anything like it. It was magical. The film took hold of me from the first minute and didn't let go before the film was over. Perfect. As the film was actually the director Stanley Kubrick's project, a film he had planned for 20 years, he didn't get to finish it because of his death. The film is based on a novel by Brian Aldiss from 1969 ("Supertoys Last All Summer Long"). After Kubrick's death in 1999, his wife asked Steven Spielberg if he would bring her deceased husband's vision to the screen. Spielberg had spoken several times with Kubrick about the film, and he accepted the task. The result is a mixture of Spielberg and Kubrick, two of the greatest geniuses in film. The film is a mixture of the sentimental Spielberg, a commercial, family film and Kubrick's detailed, thought-provoking and visually stunning talents. It is the mixture of heart and brain. A perfect film. Haley Joel Osment, who proves he is one of the best child actors ever in this film, plays David; he is actually a robot, but he looks like, behaves like, feels like and shares love like a human being. The son of Henry and Monica is in a coma, and they decide to take in David as a kind of substitute for their own son. Monica establishes a maternal love for David, and decides to "activate" him, so he gets the same love for her. But as he has been activated, he can't ever be deactivated. This becomes a problem because Monica and Henry's own son wakes up from coma and comes back. . . The film is full of wonderful scenes, such as when Monica wants to get rid of David, and he finds himself left in the cold, outside world. Now when David is not familiar with anyone, he has no one to give his unconditional love to, the movie really blossoms. "A.I." is filled with amazing special effects and many visual moments as David tries to find out who he really is. The film ends in a great, beautiful and heart wrenching way. I sat there after the end, with the underlying questions: What makes us real? Is it the ability to love and to be loved that makes us human? This is definitely the darkest and most thought-provoking film in Spielberg's career. And his most interesting. It is a film not soon forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay guys, I never bothered writing a comment so far, but reading all the 10/10 votes and comparisons with Kubrick made me M A D !First of all I happen to actually like movies with a slow pacing, hard-to-follow story development and metaphysical content. I'm a fan of "2001", David Lynch movies (esp. "Lost Higway"), "Donnie Darko" and "Casshern".But "A.I." was a pain to sit through. I just kept watching driven by the question how this mess could possibly lead to an end which isn't totally ridiculous (well, it actually was).Why?- No sympathy for the characters. None. The uncaring parents, the smarta$$ son, and finally H.J. Osment a.k.a. the *cute little mecha*, who just gets more annoying throughout the movie by pursuing his extremely childish quest for the "Blue Fairy" - the "metaphysical" part is as *subtle* as a good and hard hit with a big hammer - _come_ _on_, not even a *human* eight-year-old could possibly be this dumb! The only character I actually liked was Teddy, for being the far most intelligent.- Extremely idiotic plot devices. I won't bother with the physical explanations given; people who actually think this in in any ways "scientific" surely also believe that "X-Files" is a documentary (nothing against "X-Files"). No, it's generally...whenever the movie gets at a point where it is not predictable what's happening next (which occurs quite often, too), the writers come up with something so *extremely* far-fetched and ridiculous that I was actually wondering if they've written that while taking LSD. The "Moon", for example, gave me a really hard laugh...I couldn't believe this was meant serious!- Incredibly stupid, overly long, we-need-to-force-some-meaning-in-there, pathetic, ridiculously sentimental ending. There's a difference between "epic" (q.v. 2001 or Casshern) and simply dull.1/10, over and out!</fullReview>

Some movies are misunderstood upon there release and only years or decades later, they are hailed as masterpieces. This will not happen with A.I. and that's a guarantee! Talk all you want, discuss it all you want, nothing will ever make this crap acceptable, not even the Blue Fairy.I won't (almost) discuss all of the usual stuff, but I would like to point out some things that I found disturbing...*** Possible spoilers ***- Am I the only one who things a six year old shouldn't be paired to a Gigolo? I mean, you'd have to be pretty sick to think up such a duo. It just doesn't sit right.- In the beginning, did the good doctor have to stick his fingers in the Mekka's mouth, to open her up? I'm not a sick man, but this scene must have been written by the same guy who thought up the six-year-old vs. gigolo idea. - Why give the Mekka nanny such a horrible look? Was David a real kid, she would scare him to dead. - Why take a six year old to a city that's obviously decadent? Maybe the innocence needed to be balanced with some adult-living, but it's handled very badly. You don't have to think about it, the point hits you in the face. I hate it when points are made so obvious; the only thing missing is flashlights, sirens and arrows to lead us to the right thought.- If love was the most important thing in David's life, why is he so cold and distant towards his cute teddy and all other people he encounters? It doesn't make any sense. Frankly, I felt sorry for him at the beginning, but later on I just wanted him to be tortured and killed in that arena.- Jude Laws performance is over the top! Hell, it's just plain bad acting.- The ending? Ah yes! Classic! Why is it that everybody on earth agrees the last 30 minutes are unnecessary, but only S.Spielberg felt otherwise? What was he trying to proof? Maybe a P.R. manager thought that the only way to give this movie some rumour was to irritate the hell out of the audience. I'm sorry, I have to take a cold shower now to cool my rage...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An overlong and boring dud that made me feel sick by the end of it. I felt dirty and used -no movie should do that. Two moments that stood out for their sheer stupidity:1. When the robot wants to find the blue fairy he consults Alfred Einstein. This insults both the scientists' great work and our (movie goers) intelligence. What a joke.2. When the robot stares at the blue fairy until his battery runs out. I think everybody got it after about the one hundredth time it was stated that he looked on and on, but Stephen saw it in his heart to tell everybody a thousand times more.What a pathetic waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember that there was much hype built up about this film upon its release. When it came out on video I was quite eager to see it. How unfortunate that it turned out to be a boring, weird, pointless film. David (Haley Joel "Sixth Sense" Osment) is eleven years old. Well, not really. He's a robot. A robot that wants to learn to love, or something all too familiar like that (see another sappy movie, named "Bicentennial Man (1999)") Anyway, he goes on this magical journey with another robot, Deuce Bigalow Male Gigalo -- er, Joe Gigalo. Sorry. Continuing with our boring plot summary, David, being the dumb robot he is, wants to find the blue fairy from Pinochio to make a wish to be human. I've heard theories about the end ***SPOILERS*** that the aliens are not really aliens, that they are really robots that took over the world. Well, if they're smart enough to take over the human race, why is one dumb enough to search for a blue fairy that any human knows is fake? Overall, I found the first half hour to be quite entertaining. But once the film reaches the point where ***SPOILERS*** David's "mother" drops him off in the woods, the film goes downhill and never gets back up. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. Steven Spielberg, unfortunately, didn't seem to KNOW when to end the film. The last half hour was one of the most boring film climaxes I have ever witnessed.Too bad, I usually like Steven's work. This and "Minority Report" had to be the most overrated movies of 2001 and 2002 respectively.1.5/5 stars --John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pretty much against it but we let a friend go to the video store on his own with two numbers from the top list. That way it would be kind of exciting which film he'd bring back. He brought back Artificial Intelligence.Another friend of mine recommended it to me, and I'd read that Kubrick (one of my favorite-directors) was involved in the production in some way. So I started watching without any second thoughts.That changed quite fast. When I start watching a film I wanna see it to the end, except for when it is so bad it isn't even "funny-bad". This wasn't funny at all, but it was bad, and still I continued watching. Haley Joel Osment, I can't stand him. It works in Forrest Gump when he's got a very small part. And the Sixth Sense that was the first big role I saw him in you hadn't got time to get mad about him. Good actors are important to make a good film, and I know you can't complain as much if the actor's a kid, but I can't resist complaining on Osment. But the other adult actors are just as bad. The plot, the setting too, I wanted to turn it off. But I didn't. I wonder how it had been if Kubrick was alive when the film was finished, if it would've been the way it is I'm not sure it would've got shown in theatres - maybe straight to video. But I don't think he would've been proud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick apparently spent years of his life (wasted years of his life..) puzzling over how to bring this movie to the screen. His pal Steven Spielberg apparently `inherited' the project and seems to have solved Kubrick's dilemma in record time if to little purpose.I cannot for the life of me figure out if they were both such fans of "Blade Runner", that they were anxious to create an homage to it, or if neither of them ever saw Ridley Scott's masterpiece and thought the subject of a robot who longs to be human had not previously been (much more brilliantly) explored by Scott and was a `must-see' for audiences worried about the ethical treatment of replicants, sorry `mechas'.All I can say is "Eyes Wide Shut" did enough harm to Kubrick's reputation. Thank God, the poor man was spared a direct connection with this sentimental misfire.Why is it that obscenely gorgeous and talented Jude Law can't begin to evoke the eroticism that a similarly cast `love unit' played by the gorgeous but distinctly untalented Daryl Hannah did as Priss of the killer thighs in "Blade Runner"? Why is it that cute (and well-cast as a robot) little Haley Joel Osment is incapable of making an audience feel the terror and suffering of not being human that murderous, brutal Rutger Hauer did when he spoke of his memories `I have seen such things?'Well possibly because Steven Spielberg is a calculating cynic mascarading as a gooey marshmallow and Ridley Scott is an artist mascarading as a cynic.Among this film's many sins, the one most worth noting is Robin Williams voicing a Yiddische Dr. Know It All.

		<fullReview>I don't even know how to describe how bad this movie is. The *best* thing about the movie is the special effects, and they are hit-and-miss. All scenes carry on for at least twice as long as they need to be... for instance we see about 30 seconds of a robot slowly turning her head sideways so we can see her face has nothing behind it, the moral equivalent to a knife being thrown at the audience in a Three Stooges 3D movie (the entire move is shot like this).There's only one way to partially redeem the movie, and that is by ending it after David sees hundreds of copies of himself and goes mad because he's just a machine, not special at all in any way, and jumps into the water to die. The end. The moral being that if you aren't unique there's no reason to even be. That would have been passable as a movie, but Spielberg doesn't have the balls to not have a feel-good ending. Everything after David jumps into the water is complete hogwash to force a feel-good ending on a movie that should not have one.The fundamental problem with this movie is that this should have been a very dark movie. Robots becoming as smart or smarter than humans, what would really happen without a Three Laws. The obviously Kubric parts are all about this. But back to the fundamental problem... Spielberg clearly just is not capable or doesn't choose to make an actual serious dark movie. Can you think of any movie of his that doesn't end on a high note? Even Schindler's... that's pretty much the darkest movie he's made, and it's really not, it's about hope and saving people in a terrible situation, and ends with rescue. It's an uplifting movie about dark and severe events. AI should have been Spielberg's dark movie.</fullReview>

Although this was not unexpected, i guess a lot of people are brainwashed well and hence it says a lot more about the audience than it does about this erhm...erhm...anyone got a good name for this milestone from Dreamworks? Good grief, this was to the mind as screeching chalk is to the ears of a person with a serious migraine.All that this yardsale of pointlessness really does is to disguise itself as a piece of art. That is its sole incentive. And because art is untouchable, it gets away with it too; at least for a lot of people, flabbergastingly getting a 6.8 rating. But then again, what couldn't pass as art..Yet, there was as much art in this brain-shank as in the turd of the performance artist who is threatening his audience he is going to eat it.To list all the factors which made this movie the intellectual insult that it obviously is, is just plainly insane. Just because a well known director and a lot of money was involved in the construction of it, doesn't mean anyone should go out of his way to sum it all up. And besides, it would take days....No, in fact I challenge anyone to see this with the knowledge that once you've reached the point that you are about to get religious to pray for this movie to go somewhere (or simply end), it will only dig harder through the bottom it hit right after the first few lines of script have been muttered. At which time you still have two hours of movie left before it reaches its conclusion. That is to say, if it had one, which it doesn't because art is endless.Good luck! you'll need it...</fullReview>

I am not popcorn-crunching moviegoer, I dont need action-in-your-face bulls**t, Ive even enjoyed Tarkovskys 1972 snoozefest Solaris. I rather like the thinking and exploration side of sci-fi. But this one is a stinker! Its beginning resembles an average PC games briefing. Trails are set in the very first minutes of the movie and the movie follows it without a hitch. Even my girlfriend, whose only experience with sci-fi is Minority Report, knew exactly what would happen in the next minute. The rest of the plot is like a compilation of several faery tales, with absolutely dull and painfully overlong ending. Ive found myself desperately sneezing and staring in disbelief: what was the movie going to mean? Someone might address the slow pace of the ending as "thought provoking". Gimme a break, all the intellectual challenge is wasted in the first 45 minutes within several tear-jerking scenes with Davids (the robot boy) teddybear and his mother abandoning him in a deep forest. Spielberg once again believes that moviegoers are so stupid he has to slap his thoughts and ideas repetitively into their faces until they get the idea. Dismiss this crap. I give 4/10 for some of the most stunning visuals ever seen in a movie.</fullReview>

This is Hollywood at it's lowest. It's not worth much more comment except to say once more that it brutally insults my intelligence and takes what could have been a deeply fascinating subject and intellectual exploration into man's future, and totally destroys any hope of unfolding these ideas in any substantially meaningful of creative way.pooo pooo to you Steven.

		<shortDescription>Spielberg loses the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This terribly disjointed film started so promisingly. The set design is visually stunning, modern and streamlined, and somewhat reminiscent of Gattaca in its combination of the modern with the simple. The futuristic sci-fi themes promise so much, but after the robot child is rejected by his 'family', the film goes down, down, down... and Spielberg loses direction.What some praise as visually stunning, I found ugly. The flesh farm is a far cry from the cleanliness of David's home. The neon set was over the top and tacky. The flesh farm sequence was overly-long and I just wanted Spielberg to move along with the story.I felt more could have been made of the sequence where David travels to Manhattan and meets with his creator. Instead, the professor's role was as pointless as Joe's. Somehow he disappears into thin air, leaving David alone again (and by that time, Joe seems to have disappeared also!).The scene where David finds the 'blue fairy' and repeatedly, for years, asks to be made a real boy (subtle in using Pinocchio, this film is not) truly evokes pathos. If anything was good in this film, it was Spielberg's ability to make us really care about what happens to David. Then again, this was probably because of Osment's performance (where was the Oscar nomination??).The 2000-years-later sequence involving the aliens was absolutely ridiculous, driving the movie to new depths. What were they thinking?? I won't even continue to comment on my horror at this.The final sequences where David finally earns the love of his 'mother' (well, actually, that's not entirely correct since it wasn't really her, but an alien-resurrected version...) made me cry. It seems Spielberg hasn't entirely lost his touch. It evoked the same pathos that I felt when Tom Hanks returned to nothing in Rob Zemeckis' Castaway. It was deep pathos, but it was left unsatisfied.Jude Law's appearance as Joe was comical, but the character was severely underdeveloped, and at his exit, pointless -my general feeling towards this film.</fullReview>

What Spielberg/Kubrick managed to create was the largest pile of feces this side of 'They Live'. The main premise (already explored - and explored well - in 'Blade Runner') quickly gives way to a hokey mish-mash of the afore-mentioned Blade Runner, Mad Max, and Pinocchio that moves at a lethargic pace, and pummels the viewer repeatedly with the moralistic principles of a five-year-old through the use of 2-Dimensional, unsympathetic, and unlikeable characters. On top of that, we are subjected to weird technological limitations. Is it too much to ask for some science with my fiction? Unbelievable settings, incongruous character behaviour, and weak scientific foundation make this one of the worst movies ever. I actually hated this more than 'Armageddon', and that is saying a lot.

		<fullReview>I've always been a little suspicious of Spielberg's ability to tell an interesting story, and after watching this movie, my feelings are confirmed. This is basically a three act play:Act 1: Human melodrama. Well, it would be if the actors seemed even remotely human (why is it that the robotic child acts more human than either of his human parents?). Dreadful dialogue. Inexplicable behaviour. Bizarre pacing.Act 2: Road movie. Stealing the mood of films like Blade Runner, we wander across an interesting milieu. Doesn't really do anything for the story, but the visuals are distinctive, in a rubber-stamped sci-fi sort of way.Act 3: Bizarre otherworldly philosophical finale. Spielberg was intent on finishing this movie after Kubrick died without filming it. He therefore decided that he should pay homage to the master by ripping off the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but adding a drippy Hollywood ending, making it at once both meaningless and preachy. A very difficult combination to master, but Spielberg tries his best.A local reviewer said in his review "there will come a point in this movie, and you'll know it when you see it, where you think 'this is the end, it should end here'." He was right. I can't say this enough. If you watch the last half hour of this movie, you'll want to track down the director and give him a kick in the pants for wasting your precious time, when you could be doing more interesting and creative things like sweeping your driveway or dusting the tops of all your picture frames.Bleah. I give the movie a four out of ten for visual style, but I struggle to do even that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of 2001, already.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from watching "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" at the local theatre. This movie, more than any other, has been anticipated by me an on almost obsessive level. My patience payed off, however.At numerous times throughout the piece, I thought of A.I. as being similar with Edward Scissorhands; we have this unorthodox creature, both robotic, who hurts people accidentally, by nature (though this isn't as common in AI as it is in Edward Scissorhands), who is marveled upon at the same time. Spielberg's tendency to express warmth and sympathy both emmiting from his characters as well as drawing it out of the audience towards them is kept at a surprisingly out-of-character held-back pace, no doubt wanting to keep the film in its intended Kubrick vein (the late Stanley Kubrick of DR. STRANGELOVE and 2001: A SPACE ODDYSEY fame was originally set to write and direct this piece based on a short story by Brian Aldiss, but passed it on to Spielberg in the late 90s so he could work on EYES WIDE SHUT but still keep an eye on the project. He died in 1999.) but at the same time, eager to get back into the norm. He answers one of the film's questions in his own way: Is it possible to feel emotion towards an artificially intelligent being?The answer is yes. As we watch David Swinton, the robotic protagonist, amaze, terrify and perplex those around him, we do in fact feel genuine sympathy towards him. Watching this film inspired such thoughts as this: Perhaps all characters in film that is ficticious are like sentient beings, and each one serves a purpose.Our story, more or less, is this: The year is 2027, and the ice caps have begun to melt, washing New York City (among others) away to ruin. A couple working for a firm that creates robots designed to function in individual purposes. Examples: Some (Jude Law's character of Gigolo Joe) are designed to perform sexual tasks for their human overlords, some are made to cook, drive cars, etc. David's purpose, making him the first of his kind, is to both give and ellicit genuine emotion. There is one flaw in his programming, however, and it is this: When a certain sequence of seven particular words is said, and he is able to clearly understand them, his emotional bond for the reader is turned on. Once activated, it's not possible to turn it back off, so the robot must be destroyed if problematic. The couple, Monica and Henry Swinton, have a boy of their own - a biological one - but for the past five years, he's been cryogenically frozen with an illness unstated to the audience. David is initiated into their home, albeit reluctantly, and things are good. Martin, their son, is cured and released from his deep sleep, however, and the two boys must share a household. Martin practices malicious tricks on David, convincing him that "mommy" will love him if he does them. In one of them, he convinces their mother to read Carlo Collodi's original PINOCCHIO to the boys, which is much more morbid and dark than just about any cinematic adaptation of the story. When Monica has to abandon David in the forest, too weak-willed to send him to the destruction facility because of a mishap involving him and Martin and a swimming pool, David is alone, and presented with the harsh reality of the real world. With only Teddy, an old artificially intelligent "supertoy" (a talking, walking, thinking stuffed bear) to comfort him, he sees a flesh fair, where robots are rounded up and tortured, among other things, and then he meets Joe, and the two of them try to find the Blue Fairy (she who brings Pinocchio to live, and eventually turns him into a real boy) so that she can give David the characteristics of a real child, so Monica will love him as much as she loves Martin. Their search is mutual primarily because Joe seems to think this Blue Fairy is another potential female client of his. Their search leads them to Rouge city, and then who knows where else? The film steps over the boundaries both emotional, intellectual and regarding the story itself in ways you can't possibly imagine.AI, like it or hate it, is easily worth anything ten dollars or under. The visual effects are astounding, but subtle. They are not the reason for seeing it, nor do they think they are, like those in some films (PEARL HARBOR). A good deal of the filmgoing majority will hate this film. A good deal will love it, and a good deal will feel like they've been intellectually transcended. It is not a film for children, and some parts of it will send chills down your spine with their surrealism and intensity. But the trip is worth it, regardless of how you view the ending. Your thoughts, assume you open up to the films you see in the least and don't absorb them like a completely routine meal with nothing new to offer, will most certainly be stimulated after you leave this movie. Spielberg's screenplay is strong as are the performances, but it's hard to swallow the medicine sometimes. Is it with flaws? Most certainly. Some scenes are astoundingly unpleasant, and numerous times you will think you have reached the end when it is not so. Spielberg has done it again, with Kubrick's fading, desensitized and alltogether more intensely intellectual genius guiding him. It's the best film of the summer, I can tell, and quite possibly the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 40 minutes or so of this film, although predictable, make for interesting viewing but once the obnoxious little robot gets left in the woods the movie immediately deteriorates into one of the biggest cinematic messes of all time. If I didn't know this was a Spielberg film I would have thought it was directed by some low budget direct to video director who had conned some producer into giving him a shot at the big time. If this is the best Spielberg can do after 30 years of filmmaking maybe its time for him to start think about retiring because this movie is a real stinker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Writers in need of Counselling.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was about to title this comment "Artificial and Unintelligent" but someone has already gotten that line, so I will think again; I recall the hype when this movie was released and i have now seen it for the first time on cable.How i was able to sit thru it until the end i do not know as talk about a self indulgent mess, dear oh dear oh dear. Apparently the budget for this movie is given as 90 million US dollars....what a waste.... This is a rambling sprawling yarn which takes a pathetic and unnecessarily pessimistic view of life and suggests to me it is a reflection more upon the mental anquish of the writers and producers rather than anything else. The director has a famous track record and should stick to that rather than a totally nonsensical screen play, with certain sinister snipes at main stream religion which uses the likes of Robin Williams as a voice over to assist in the propagation of that prejudice. There are "bits and bobs" of the likes of ET and Close Encounters and 2001 "A space idiocy" thrown it here and there....and one is left with the distinct impression that was "movie" is very much made up as as it goes along. That totally over-rated ham actor Jude Law is given a role that is pointless and we of course have to have the ridiculous anorexic close encounter aliens thrown in at the end for good measure. The story starts in the way future with the creation of a life like robotic child and the theme for the remainder of this totally too long film is the desire in the robot for a mothers love which as afore mentioned seems to be something lacking in the writers own angst and is a self indulgent guilt trip. The robotic child is "adopted" by a human family but even at this early stage in this flick one starts to lose faith in the integrity of the picture since we have the "mother" doing the house hold chores in 1950's style which is patently absurd. The rest of the movie just spins along in a totally out of control way with neither meaning, logic or sense. i have rated this 2 out of 10 and it only just avoided 1 out of 10 due to the excellent art and special effects etc; but no matter how good those technical achievements are......it is still a trash story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning Visuals, Involving Story But Typical Spielberg/Kubrick Bias</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be Steven Spielberg's strangest film. Maybe that's because he collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on it, and Kubrick's movies are almost all bizarre. It was another of those films I found fascinating on the first look but increasingly unlikeable on subsequent looks. It went from a "9" on the first viewing, to a "7" to a "5." In fact, I didn't even finish it on the third look.Nonetheless, it's the typical Spielberg or Kubrick film in a number of areas, meaning great visuals, just stunning at times; a definite anti-Christian bias (that you see more and more in the carnival segment as you watch this multiple times); a very secular humanist outlook on life but a nice sentimental ending with the message that everyone needs to feel loved.Haley Joel Osment gives one more example of why he is one of the best child actors of any era. His role is memorable and just the looks on his face would soften the hardest heart. The first of the three segments in this film was hard for me to watch in spots as the innocent Osment ("David") was framed for things by his "real brother" and then abandoned by his mother. Those are difficult scenes because the film is involving right off the bat. You really care about this young boyThe rest of the film offers fantastic visuals and an interesting, but a too Liberal- slanted story, for me to watch again. Sorry, but Spielberg and Kubrick - two men who have made some extremely entertaining films - are too bigoted for my tastes, at least in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember the scene from Minority Report in which Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell discuss predetermination using what looks like a pool ball? With a simple, visually set piece Spielberg gives us the philosophical conundrum that drives the film. Now look at AI - there's a set piece speech at the beginning, and then long explanatory asides from (i) A CGI Gepetto (ii) a random voice-over (iii) a Robot (c.4000AD) simply to get us through an overlong, sugar-coated denouement because it doesn't have much to do with the previous hour and a half of the film.Similarly, the backdrops for the first half of the film are foreground signposts, compared to the integrated futurism of Spielberg's home grown metropolis in Minority Report. Wit and humour become more isolated in the Kubrick reconstruction (abandoned in the final half hour), where they are as integrated as the all else in Minority Report. Everything's separating out like oil and water.Clunkiness almost extends to the music with a gratuitous interpolation of Strauss, although DVD special features gives John Williams the (subtly taken) opportunity to absolve himself of responsibility here. A critic wrote that his original score is 'lush'. Rubbish. It's romantic in its economy but also paranoid and other-worldly. The ideas are not pretty until the crowd-pleasing close and the score is faithful to this.Spielberg's role in this project might be reasonably seen from the outside as hands-on producer. Compare Minority Report and AI in the same way as ET and Poltergeist to get a feel for the difference in focus between dealing with his baby and simply looking after the creche. 4.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never walked out on a movie before, but Artificial Intelligence was the closest I have ever come. I spent my entire Fourth of July sitting in the theatre for what seemed like 4 hours waiting for this (insert explicative here) movie to end. It would have been a decent film if Spielberg had simply ended it, but no, he had to keep going and beat the $h!t out of the dead horse for 145 grueling minutes. I nearly feel asleep during the 4,000 year transition at the end of the film. I was going along with the film all the way up to the point where Haley Joel Osment's character goes underwater. I thought that was a great way to end the film, but then they moved the film forward 4,000 years. 4,000 years...What the hell!? I was starting to get bed sores from the theatre's bucket seats. I wanted to go home. I wanted to do something else on the 4th other than sit and watch this god-forsaken "masterpiece". "Artificial Intelligence" is right; I certainly didn't see any semblance of intelligence in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AI was horrible. The acting was acceptable, the special effects and sets were (for the most part) also at least adequate. Unfortunately, the story was so weak and technically flawed that the entire experience became a tedious descent into clashing directorial styles and ill-advised plot devices.*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***Some of the obvious technical problems with this movie: 1) If this mecha is supposed to be a replacement child, shouldn't it GROW UP?! I mean, who wants a perpetual 8 year old?2) It breaks if something gets in its mouth? I mean, that is just idiotic. OF COURSE something will eventually get in its mouth, it's inevitable. They've been making these things long enough to realize that.3) Teddy the super-Ruxpin-toy is five times smarter than any of the AI mechas. Of the mechas experiencing the "moon" for the first time, only Teddy is smart enough to decide running is the correct response. He is also in general just much more on top of things.There were many more but around the moon part i just gave up and decided not to think about that sort of thing any more, and then maybe i'd enjoy the movie. Didn't work.The main problem is that AI fails to make us care about the characters. I have heard people talk about as a wrenching emotional tale, these people are wrong (no, really!). None of the characters are developed in any meaningful way. The exposition of Gigolo Joe is a good example: we see him for the first time, and then 90 seconds later his life is on a completely new path that will now lead him to his chance rendezvous with our prosthetic protagonist. The whole thing reeks of means to an end, you can see the wheels turning in the writers head "we need him to be in the forest, so why would a gigolo mecha be in the forest . . . " More to the emotional heart of the matter, why should i care about a mecha? I realize this is part of the fundamental question of the movie, the mecha can "love" the person, but can the person love the mecha, and in keeping with the parents in the movie, the answer is no. Once it has been established that we don't love the mecha, then why are we supposed to care about this movie? The only AI being in this movie i found the slightest bit worth caring about was Teddy, and of course he gets the totally screwed at the end.I have also heard some people praising the cinematography in this movie. I fail to understand why. Apparently if you shoot a lot of reflections and through random opaque slates you are a cinematic genius. And i suppose that's true, after all, it worked so well in the opening credit sequence of Basic Instinct. It could be argued that these virtual images, skewed and unnatural, are a metaphor for the love (and very existence) of the AI child, but this is trite and heavy-handed, and in no way redeems them in my eyes.To make this long rant short, this movie is extraordinarily uninspired. Nothing stands out, nothing is memorable. There are no new ideas here, no revolutionary insights or questions. I defy anyone to find an idea from AI about life (artificial or otherwise) not raised by either Blade Runner, Star Trek the Next Generation, the Terminator movies, or the Short Circuit movies (yes, you heard me, Short Circuit).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Speilberg does a bad Kubrick impression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, the movie is just plain too long. When you start thinking about, however, exactly what scenes you would leave out to make it shorter (and the list ends up including over 2/3rds of the movie), you realize that there was a lot more amiss with A.I. Spielberg's attempt at a tribute to Kubrick's style actually ends up being nothing but a reflection of his own. The essence of Kubrick's art was creating a very deliberate flow such that every scene flows evenly, no mini-climax, just building the emotions in the viewer scene by scene, until they match that of the main characters - then, when you think you just can't stand the inner angst, the fear, or the suspense any longer, you are presented with resolution, but never quite as satisfying or complete an answer as you wanted.Spielberg substituted mere length for this masterful storytelling; there was a climax to every scene, side plots all over, too many distractions from the main character, all leaving the viewer mostly numb. By the end, there was only releif; no empathy for the boy, no bittersweet tears. There wasn't a 'wet' eye in the house!The one bright spot - as always - Jude Law. Unfortunately, he steals the scene, and the attention away from the story line, all too easily.If you insist on seeing this, make it a rental - you will need the pause button to get through this 2 1/2 hour marathon!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful mush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ahhh, AI. 2 hours of Spielberg pissing on Kubrick's grave.We've been told a lot of things about this film, mostly carefully timed lies so as to legitimize Spielberg's AI hegemony. Spielberg is having his cake and eating it now, at Kubrick's and responsible cinema's expense; and the mainstream media has lapped it all up. Business as usual.Spielberg is a stunted anti-intellectual, semi-articulate sniggering adolescent, the very "artificial intelligence" of the film's title. Sara Maitland- the uncredited writer of the film- even rightfully detested the picture (oh and where is Kubrick's writing credit. Did Kubrick's 120 treatment never reach your office Stevie?) Well, her script-writing non-credit on Spielberg's AI is a total red herring here; the Hollywood uber-hack didn't even credit Kubrick. Just as well: Spielberg's reactionary sentimentalism and Oedipal infantilism made even Maitland blush in a paradox of embarrassment. She's recently gone on to point out the central, the most fundamental contradiction inherent in Spielberg's white-washing of Kubrick's treatment: having a human play robotic David fatally misdirects the entire emotional dynamics of the narrative, at least or especially for the audience, towards simply evaluating how convincing his robotic "performance" is; but David *is* a robot, not in need of convincing, and Kubrick's whole point, his unprecedented cinematic challenge, was in finally suggesting to the viewer the possibility of such an "artificial" entity unquestioningly demonstrating a legitimate, authentic, emotional post-human humanity. (For Spielberg, such a notion is utterly blasphemous to his unreconstructed, Judeo-Christian-internalised world view. Period. But of course all the Nietzschean death-of-god allegories are virtually removed or misunderstood by Spielberg who cant hope to even briefly capture the shear subversiveness of Kubrick).You think that Spielberg, after a life devoted to production-line manipulative-movie merchandising, of making pandering, unadulterated kiddies' movies - originally for kids and later for emotionally-stunted "adults", has suddenly experienced some manner of life-shattering miraculous spiritual and philosophical transformation? Give me a break. This film is a dud, and it is important to say this, if only because of the avalanche of sub-cultural infantilism that will descend upon any topic dealing with "the Berg".And before the Spielberg groupies takes up arms, please note, placing Spielberg in proper perspective is not an act of "snobbery", on the contrary, it is an exposition of its dynamics: Spielberg, like poor Dr Bill in Eyes Wide Shut, is desperate to become one, to prove his credentials, and, like all snobs, he ignorantly confuses a purchased social (and artistic) status with genuine social (and artistic) substance.But to be fair, even the most extreme of contemporary hard-AI researchers would have great difficulty with Kubrick's radical "liberationist" vision of humanity's legacy being passed on to, and transcended by, cerebral, empathetic machines. Of technology ultimately serving as the liberating force for the contingency-trapped human spirit, rather than its predominantly current use as a brutal weapon to maintain elitist hegemony and ultimately - to precipitate irreversible mass human destruction and extinction. Sure, such a cinematic project presupposes the construction of a shatteringly seductive mythology ... one, indeed, that may have proved to have been beyond even Kubrick's penetrating grasp (which is not to suggest that his attempt would have failed in its poetic uber-bot transcendentalism).</fullReview>

None of it makes any sense, be it the "space-time continuum" gobblety-gook as pretense for resurrecting mom (with memories!) from a bit of hair, or the absurd conflict at home that begins the story.The screen play is profoundly fractured. It opens with moody, precise scenes that remind one of Kubrick. It abruptly changes to an over-the-top trashy splatter flick, full of absurd action scenes, and completely cheese-ball. By the end it's fallen apart so badly they resort to a pretentious voice-over to tell you what's happening. It feels like three or four screen plays by different authors were pasted together.Ham-fisted gimmicks for sentimental effect are everywhere. The central question of movie (machines with emotion) is barely explored at all, and what little is there makes no sense. "David" is supposed to be this dramatic technological advance, yet every machine in the movie (including the teddy bear) expresses emotion.This movie has no redeeming features. If you're actually interested in thinking about machines of the future, as others have suggested, see 2001, Blade Runner, or any of the other competent films on the subject.</fullReview>

But then at one point the family disappears and it becomes a totally different movie (a worse one) about a child trying to become something he's not to be loved by his mother. Then we get attacked with a scene about robots with feelings and their invdividuality, for the life of me I can't understand where that came from. and then the world freezes over and we get a movie about aliens (what the heck is that supposed to be???).Finally the happy ending (soon we can go home!). The aliens manage to bring back Mommy, but only for one day. She doesn't seem to care what happened to the world, or her family, all that matters is that the first thing she sees when she wakes up is the child that she had dumped in the other end of the world.I am a huge Spielberg fan, and I must say, that I totaly lost all the respect I had toward him in these two hours of HELL.

		<shortDescription>Extremely disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had gone to see A.I. with very high expectations, hoping to be not only entertained, but also intellectually stimulated. Unfortunately, neither happened.The movie started off with a very promising opening scene. The world set up in the movie is one where "mecha" - humanlike intelligent machines - are common, but often hated by humans. A team of scientists is interested in knowing whether a machine could be developed to love, like a real child, and whether people could love him back. Some of the initial issues brought up include what consists of humanity, whether machines can have feelings, whether they can love, and what responsibilities - if any - humans have towards machines. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see how it would play out.Instead of a philosophical movie, however, A.I. gradually evolved into a long, run-on fairy tale loosely based on Pinocchio. David, the robot-child created to love, wants nothing more than to become a "real boy" so as to win the affection of his "mother". He sets off on a typical fairy-tale quest, with the goal of finding the Blue Fairy who can grant his wish. Along the way he makes a couple of friends to serve as sidekicks, and encounters obstacles and dangers. This is an all-too-common plot that really did not need three hours to unfold.One of the problems with this movie is that it unsuccessfully fused two divergent visions - one of the late Stanley Kubrick, whose brainchild the movie initially was - and the other of Steven Spielberg, who finished the project after Kubrick's death. The lavish, grandiose scenes are clearly Kubrick, with a bit of the Burton-esquire dark side, thrown in for good measure (I could almost swear Tim Burton had a hand in this movie, if I didn't know better). Especially the scenes of the flesh fairs and the machines searching for old parts are plenty dark and twisted.And then? Just as we expect the plot to heat up and eventually come to a climax - nothing. The break between Kubrick's and Spielberg's visions in this movie is clearly apparent. Spielberg attempts to turn this into another E.T. (what is it with those acronym titles, anyway?) but fails miserably. One scene leads into another, and another, and another. Each scene of the last hour or so of the movie could easily have been the last. It really should have ended long before it did. Because when it finally ended, the audience was left with . . . well, I'm not sure. There's no moral, no message, no underlying meaning, and seemingly no rhyme or reason for ending the movie the way it ended. The last hour just chugs along aimlessly until it breaks off awkwardly, without really saying anything.Not that everything was bad. There was some very good acting in this movie, and a cute talking teddy bear. However, these small things fail to redeem this mess.Again, it's another case of a real shame. Had A.I. dared to ask the big questions, it could have been one of the most intelligent and thought-provoking movies in a long time. But it didn't, so it wasn't. If you're looking for something interesting, pick up a copy of Ray Kurzweil's book "The Age of Spiritual Machines". A.I. doesn't even come close.</fullReview>

Interesting to note, though, that the thing did have an audience: some reviews positively drip with adoration. Heaven knows what sort of wide-eyed ingenue one has to be to actually like this film, and to buy into its sugar-puff mentality, but such people do, demonstrably, exist.So I'll confine myself to one observation: from whence came this weird conceit that artificial intelligences are going to have such terrible difficulty duplicating human emotions? There's nothing uniquely human or advanced about emotions - in fact they evolved a very long time ago, as a cheap replacement for thinking in very primitive organisms that didn't have the apparatus for reasoning, and had to rely on pre-programmed behaviour instead. They're just instincts, and a lot easier to duplicate than true intelligence. Pack it in, you SF authors. If you want AIs to have problems with something, try stereo vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plan 9 with a bigger budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should preface my comments with a disclaimer: I think Stanley Kubrick is one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema--in a league with Renoir, Hitchcock, and Eisenstein. I wrote an undergraduate paper on __2001: A Space Odyssey__ and I am reading a friend's Ph.D. thesis on that film right now. It is possible, therefore, that my expectations for this film were inflated because of its touted connection with Kubrick. _A.I._, however, bears only the most casual mark of a Kubrick film (and then, only in the opening scenes). Instead of Kubrick's genius, we witness a truly bizarre blend of Steven Spielberg's shockingly obvious Oedipus complex and his equally shocking, un-ironic worship of Walt Disney films. I am not exaggerating. An important climax of the film hinges on the frankly oedipal question of whether a boy will get to climb in bed with his mother or not. Much of the story also involves a character's protracted hunt for the "Blue Fairy," directly referencing Disney's version of _Pinocchio_ in a crude, ham-fisted way. Lest the pathology of this trainwreck attract viewers looking for camp-humor, I must caution the reader that while the film begins to resemble Ed Wood's __Plan 9 from Outer Space__ more and more as it rattles along, it does not do so in a good way. The budget for _A.I._ allows for slicker production values than Wood's film, of course, but the narrative structure is remarkably similar in its disjointedness. The most obvious parallel between the films, for example, occurs when an anonymous narrator breaks in to tell _A.I._'s audience a concocted story full of the most inane sort of Sci-fi cop-outs in order to excuse a further 30 minutes of obliquely related, mind-numbingly boring footage. I distinctly recall sitting in the theater, realizing that the voiceover narration sounded exactly like the alien ship captain in _Plan 9_ describing the silly, convoluted plot behind Wood's film. A number of critics have named _Plan 9 from Outer Space_ "the worst movie of all time." There is a certain exuberance and ingenuousness behind that film that redeems it, however, and so makes it enjoyable on a level the director may not have intended. There is virtually nothing redeeming about _A.I._, so, perhaps, it is the better candidate for the worst movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insightful? Intelligent? An Audience craves not these things.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ladies and gentlemen, I give to you a movie for people who believe themselves to be of above-average intellect. There are many problems with this film, chief among them the fact that the film itself is a non-starter and its morals are hideous, but I wish to discuss here the fact that everyone who likes this movie seems to think that it works so well, and that it's filled with amazing ideas. There's one problem with this viewpoint: it's not. "Artificial Intelligence" is "Blade Runner" without the conflict, conscience, or coherence. The story itself is arbitrary; it feels like it has been constructed from one flimsy source material (in this case, Brian Aldiss' "Supertoys Last All Summer Long") which has been padded ad nauseum with ideas that were meant for radically different films. Does the plot about David trying to gain the acceptance of his "mother" have anything to do with the plot about Gigolo Joe's run from the law? They very well could, if any thought was put into actually connecting them. However, they are presented as just a stream of events leading one after another, like the film equivalent to an ink-blot test. There are many events there, and it's up to the viewer to make up some excuse to tie them together.However, the worst offender of this faux-insightfulness is the idea that Spielberg has constructed around his film being a "fairy-tale." I wouldn't have a problem with this conceit if Spielberg had any clue what the story of "Pinocchio" was actually about. David, for all his seeking to make him a real boy, does not wish to alter or change himself. He is looking for a magic bullet that will change the world around him so that those that he "loves" will love him back. There is no inner conflict, only a wish to take the easy way out. For example, take the moment within Hobby's shop in Manhattan where David destroys the other David model with a desk lamp. By the rules set out by the film, particularly during the Flesh Fair, David is now a murderer. However, the film treats this incident as just another step in David becoming a "real boy," or at least sticking around long enough so that his mother will love him. Not only does this not work in the construct of a fairy-tale (where characters rise and fall on the content of their character), it doesn't work in any film, since Spielberg has decided he can change the rules of this fictional universe whenever he pleases to fit any new idea that comes down the pike. Unfortunately, films don't work in that manner.There are many other things I disliked about this film, but this was my main complaint. All in all, this film had one or two good ideas, but they were buried by a mish-mash of ill thought out, conflicting sequences and ideas. It goes on much too long, has little to say, and has enough bankrupt morals to choke a horse. As a fan of Spielberg's, save the equally sanctimonious and insipid "Saving Private Ryan," I was disappointed. A complete failure from beginning to illogical end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What were you thinking, Mr Spielberg?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know, Spielberg didn't write the story, but I am wondering whether or not he read it before making this movie?After 30 minutes of waiting for a starting point in the movie, I found myself wondering how it was going to end. The problem is, it never did. While watching it with my fiancee, I was getting somewhat upset that I was letting her watch it at all. For me, finding a movie I don't like is a very rare occurrence.This movie SHOULD have been a children's movie. The trouble is, the way it was done would have been either too scary or too confusing for kids.* SPOILER *One scene that really bugged me was when the professor (the robot maker guy) found David after he had disappeared for so long. First he expressed how enthused he was about introducing David to the robotic development team, and that they were nearby, just waiting to meet him. Then he walked out of the room, never to be seen or heard from again. What??? I think Spielberg cut some important scenes out of the movie by accident. He must have thought it was getting pretty drawn out by that point. He was right.Another questionable element was the low quality parenting. You know that bad things are happening between your two sons, yet you constantly leave them alone together. Come on! Try a bit of adult supervision to find out what the stink is wrong with this robot! You would have found that you should have left your REAL son in the woods, not the robot.There was a very high frustration factor caused by the poor parenting. I don't think any person can possibly be as bad at parenting as these two. Yet, they were the best candidates the robot company could find to test out the new robot. I thought the test was supposed to involve the love shared between a mother and her child. Said 'mother' didn't even love her human son enough to keep a close observation on his interaction with the experimental robot.* END SPOILER *I gave this movie a 1 rating, although I considered giving it a 2 because the beginning was not too bad. The main problem was the introduction of Gigolo Joe. He was the turning point, because he was completely unrelated to the plot. As each minute of the movie passed after his introduction, I was begging for an ending.The sexual overtones were completely USELESS to the story. Spielberg could have cut the movie down to 90 minutes and lowered the age requirement to increase the audience. I have nothing against Jude Law, but this movie would have easily been better without his character. Without Gigolo Joe, I might have actually given the movie a 3 or a 4 rating instead of 1.I feel that I am a lot dumber now that I saw this movie. Let that be a warning to you all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>emotional void</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some have said that this film was "harrowing" and "emotional" and "one of the best films of the year." I found it to be an emotional void. There was nothing to connect to. Thought Haley Joel Osment did an amazing job as an actor in this film, it was not enough to carry the film. And, his character was just plain creepy. The family that bought him was messed up, and I wish that that dynamic was played out a bit more. This movie is the obsessive compulsive person's dream film. Loving someone so much, with no other emotions to balance it out, that your entire existence is driven by that fact. For ever.The ending contained the most interesting part in how the creators of this film envisioned the earth several thousand years from now. But, even though the vision was interesting, the future folks were just as creepy as the kid. They just wanted to placate him, making him happy by supporting this unnatural dependence on his love for the mom that bought him, and did not love him back. These future earthlings, too, had some weird obsession with humans. I guess how I feel goes to the question a character brought up at the very beginning of the film. "You can make a robot have the emotion of love. But, can a human love the robot back?" I would have to say that, if robots loved the way this kid did, then no. I could not love a robot. I don't believe that was the response the creators were intending, so I think they failed in their endeavor.The saving grace of the film was Teddy. The best character by far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artificial love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is both touching and disturbing at the same time. However, very gripping and a film that is difficult to ignore. The couple Swinton has a son who is in a coma. They lose eventually hope that the boy may come to consciousness again, and say yes to accept David, the robot which researchers hope can reduce the loss for childless couples. The couple tries to love robot David, but can not provide unconditional love. When the couple son Martin wakes up of a coma, it becomes even more clear: David does not fit in, and he has to go. The mother takes a drastic decision that leads David out on a dangerous journey. He has only one desire: to be a real human a mom can love. I think this film is masterpiece and understands well that the genius Stanley Kubrick wanted to make a film of this story. Kubrick died before the film was made,but Steven Spielberg ensured that it was made masterfully, and I in Kubricks spirit. This is a movie about hope and the desire to be loved for who we are. Beautiful, but sad too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg directs a Kubrick movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the scenes in this movie are pure Kubrick: haunting, lush, and tantalizing.The rest is what you'd expect from a savant blockbuster director who's phoning it in: schmaltz, kitsch, and scenes so engineered to pluck your emotional strings, you wonder if you're watching a movie as a part of a psychology experiment.While this might have been Kubrick's intent, Spielberg takes a potentially rich story and tarnishes it by reminding us that he was the wunderkind director. An example is with his signature car mirror shot as David is abandoned in the forest. By tightly framing him in the small mirror, we're driven to feel like we're abandoning him. A more powerful emotional shot would have been a crane or helicopter shot that has the car leave the frame as the camera pulls up and away from him, leaving him small and alone in the vast forest, centering his abandonment and the object of your emotional connection.This emotional confusion pervades the movie, as the focus continually shifts between the scenes that Kubrick or Spielberg worked on. It's maddening, since there is fertile material here, and I found myself wishing that Kubrick hadn't died during filming and so would have been around to guide Spielberg to a better finished product.It's definitely worth seeing for Kubrickian influence, as long as you keep it firmly planted in your head that this is a Spielberg movie, and not to be taken too seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched a couple of really good A.I. movies and wanted to add to that list by watching A.I. I'd seen part of it a decade ago and wanted to watch it again to compare. Steven Spielberg screenplay, Spielberg directed, Spielberg produced... Should be great right? As we used to say as mischievous kids, "psyche!"Sometime in the near future many of Earth's largest cities are under water due to the effects of climate change. Hundreds of millions in poorer nations die of starvation. With only wealthier people remaining and birth control laws in effect, robots become the go to resource for labor. Although the robots are intelligent and humanistic they don't have the breadth of emotions to make them truly like humans. That is until the creation of David (Haley Joel Osment). With a run time of nearly two and a half hours I felt nearly every minute of it drag by. David was the central character and his plight the central theme, but the drama of this lifelike boy was too rehearsed and pretentious. It was as though Ang Lee directed it. I could sense that Spielberg was trying make the viewers empathize with David much like viewers may have empathized with the robots of Blade Runner--and even more so here because the robot in play is merely a boy. For the most part Spielberg was successful but maybe not for the reasons he wanted. In other words, any emotions or compassion or empathy for David may have simply been because the movie was about him, much like Red Balloon or a movie about any other inanimate thing that's given human characteristics. Do you feel that strongly about robots, their survival and their "dreams" or have you grown a relationship with the one on screen because you're given its story?From the inflated budget of this financial flop was John Williams. Although Williams is a masterful and accomplished composer, his omnipresent musical score really grated on me. It was seemingly unending and belied what was going on on-screen. Many of the moments weren't portentous enough to warrant the somber mood given by the music. I don't want to be overly critical because the CGI was good as well as Osment's acting. As I mentioned before, it was impossible not to identify with the boy bot. And the story itself was a very credible one that could have worked if done better. But ultimately the artsy bizarre course of the movie made it distasteful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A much complex movie but beautifully crafted!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1969 short story "Super-Toys Last All Summer Long" by Brian Aldiss, this science fiction fantasy bears similarities to Pinocchio (1940) and originated as a long-gestating project of director Stanley Kubrick that passed to his friend Steven Spielberg after Kubrick's death. Haley Joel Osment stars as David Swinton, a young boy of the future, living in a time when the polar ice caps have melted and submerged many coastal cities. It's also a time when humans live side by side with "mechas," or sentient robots. When David discovers that he is not the biological son of his parents Henry (Sam Robards) and Monica (Frances O'Connor), but a cutting- edge robotic child meant to replace a natural son who died, he sets out to learn what he can of his true nature. Along the way, David is mentored by an entertainment and pleasure-providing mecha named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law). William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson, and narrator Ben Kingsley co-star in A.I., which was adapted from Kubrick's treatment by Spielberg, who takes his first crack at screen writing since Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CREEPY... but interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt lost during this movie. I don't think that Spielberg was ready to make it. It needed just a little bit more time to simmer down in the brain before being made. I'm sure that if it contained a better sense of direction, purpose, movement, etc. it would have been a film for the ages. As it is, it is much, much worse than it should be. At the same time, it is not a bad movie - relatively speaking.It is definitely a thinking person's film - as long as that person doesn't think TOO much. If he does, he will see that the film is trite an over-complicated. (If anyone remembers 2001, that film was minimalistic - as this film should have been). Anyway, it still succeeds in raising many interesting questions and in causing viewers to think. I just feel that it was a touch on the stupid side.Haley Joel Osment, on the other hand, was incredible. He handles his material convincingly and takes the audience on a ride toward "David"'s eventual emotional maturity - It is quite an arch for a child actor! The music by John Williams is another asset - it supports the material of the film.Overall, Spielberg and Kubrick's vision did not, I believe, come to full fruition. Still, it was a wonderful and special film that, I believe, still carries some level of importance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's sci-fi art-house flick and maybe the lost Kubrick movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compelling, slow-paced, lengthy, intelligent, thoughtful, wise and occasionally profound. Steven Spielberg's sci-fi drama is definitely not your average "crowd pleaser" and lost its way when released as a general Hollywood blockbuster, turning off the crowds who perhaps expected action and thrills instead of the leisurely paced, almost "art house" type film that Spielberg finally delivered. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, having little knowledge about it beforehand, but I was desperately hoping it wouldn't be a new-fangled E.T. again.At the end of the two hours and twenty minutes I came away with a lot of thoughts and a lot of questions, so Spielberg must have done something right. Of course, Kubrick's beyond-the-grave involvement hangs over the movie like a watchful shadow and some sequences in the film are pure Kubrick. Others are pure, emotional Spielberg (the sentimental ending, for instance) and the pairing of the two directors is one to be seen. It at least makes for a totally unique movie with big aspirations, and one which genuinely questions the nature of the robot/human relationship in a way few (if any) other science fiction films have done so.The film has tons of themes and layers to it. A full analysis would come to twenty pages or more. Some will be picked up by the individual viewer, others missed until a later screening. The central character of David is utterly complex and his character arc is interesting ? a blend of the futuristic and the fairy-tale that is pulled off well. Worried about the casting of a child as the lead, I half-expected this to be a kid's film with kiddie trappings. In some instances, it does feel a little childish (the image of the blue fairy, although representing much much more than just a fairy tale character ? more like a miracle or an impossibility) and has that undeveloped Spielbergian touch to it. Ironically, the biggest kiddie trapping ? the animated Teddy that follows David through his various adventures ? became the most enjoyable part of the film for me. This has got to be the most lovable non-living creation in a film since we saw Wilson in CASTAWAY.The film is more than watchable ? despite lengthy scenes in which little happens ? thanks to the technical proficiency and the casting. Technically, the film is superior. Spielberg pulls off some spectacular shots ? an underwater Manhatten ? and fills the movie with authentic robotic creations. The opening where the woman's face comes off is astounding and Stan Winston and his pals create some of the best-looking CGI that I've ever seen. Watch out for the arena-style thrills of the Flesh Fair, which is pretty disturbing and would garner an X-rating if the participants were human instead of mecha. The super-cool "aliens" which appear in the final act are also highly impressive creations.Cast-wise, the film is sound. Haley Joel Osment is incredible as the robot kid and I don't believe his performance could be bettered. He is thoroughly realistic as a robot struggling to be human. This is even better than his breakthrough performance in THE SIXTH SENSE. Frances O'Connor is also effective as the flawed mother, David's object of fixation, and her presence adds to the warmth of the film considerably. Other fixtures like Brendan Gleeson and William Hurt fill out smaller roles with adequacy, but its Jude Law who steals his scenes as the robotic Gigolo Joe. Law is fantastic and lives the character he plays. By the end of the film I had cried thanks to some spellbinding scenes of emotion and felt like I'd witnessed a great work. And that's everything I have to say on the matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film four times now since its release.I thought it was clever the first time and technically amazing the second time. The third time I saw it I enjoyed the art and the storytelling which Spielberg managed to convey. Just watched it again and found myself inextricably involved in the emotional content. Things which I questioned before made more sense and the acting was terrific. Haley Joel Osment was a real talent to be reckoned with. way beyond his years. Jude Law timed his part perfectly and remains a real favourite with me.Brendan Gleeson was underused and Frances O'Connor hit just the right notes in her part as David's "Mom". I consider this film to be a classic and am glad that Steven steered away from the art movie which I think Kubrick may have made of this story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a future world, there are mechanical robots called mechas. After Monica (Frances O'Connor)'s son Martin is put in cryo-stasis, her husband brings home a super realistic child robot David (Haley Joel Osment) home. She hates it at first but she starts to get used to him until his son is suddenly revive. Martin dismisses David as a toy and plays cruel jokes on him. David is more and more relegated to second class until he is abandoned on the roadside. On the road, he finds fellow robots including Gigolo Joe (Jude Law). He goes on an odyssey to become a real boy inspired by the story of Pinocchio.I almost feel like this could be a great horror story idea. But Spielberg is doing his child like wonder thing. It loses much of its possible tension. It's as if Spielberg has deliberately soften all the rough edges to make a morality play. On the good side, Spielberg once again shows that he is a master craftsman. This movie is beautifully put together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this one quite a bit before, but this (third or fourth) time around it kind of fell apart, and not just because it has so many different chapters; a philosophical opening, a sci-fi / satirical drama second act, then a quick futuristic city thriller-bit to introduce a new character (Law's), moving onto an arena action-adventure and eventually descending further down the Pinocchio-pathway which, with not too much fantasy, leads to the origins of Christianity (or religion in general) - and then some. There is a clear story running throughout, sure, but...Particular low points are some settings (the arena and it's boring action), the Dr. Know-business (hello Einstein) being the worst of that (though it must be said that some settings and graphics were really wonderful, like the house, Manhattan and the 'futuristic ones'), and the overall simplistic approach of intricate philosophical material; there's plenty there, but in the end it is a rather sentimental sci-fi adventure movie with some good parts of (intense) drama.The (sci-fi) drama-part that starts playing out well into the second act in the futuristic house, with mostly David and Monica interacting, and later on Martin 'interfering', I found to be most interesting and gripping, even though several questions pop when things get out of hand; for instance, I know David has to be a by, but why not program him to be more sensible about the childish provocations of Martin? That could have easily been done without him losing his spontaneous, child-like qualities. And if not, don't put the boy on the market...Well, that's (some of) my thoughts in a nutshell. It's certainly a doable and endearingly adventurous (fairy tale) film, and Osment brings a vivid David to life, but this time I at times really started wondering how Kubrick would have brought all this to the screen... Ah, well, 't what 't is.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young mechanical boy (David) is "bought" to an American family to replace their son who is about to die. Unexpectedly, their real son is healed from his problem and the family ends up having two young boys. Funny if not sorrowful, the real son is a smart one who is willing to do anything to put the blame on the mechanical one, so the parents are induced to abandon him in order to not give him back to the company, otherwise he would be destroyed. The abandonment is very sad and difficult to watch, the boy pleases all he can to not be left there, but the mother is tough on her decision. David then travels all around the country to find a way to be loved from his mother once again, believing that he would find the Pinnochio's Blue Fairy and then become a totally human boy. Sadly, he doesn't achieve this purpose and is left in the water for two thousand years. Remarkably made, "Artificial Intelligence" is a sci-fi/drama classic to be seen by all ages and groups. There's no single person on this Earth that won't be excited in this film. The 146 minutes go by so quickly and we pray for it to never end. Don't see it if you lost your mother recently or you'll be more sad than anybody else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is for Spielberg Fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading many negative reviews about this movie. It is plain that half of the comments never saw acclaimed Spielberg pictures such as E.T or Indiana Jones. I read the positive reviews and saw that a majority are Spielberg fans. I will say that this movie is one of his weaker films, but I liked it enough.The story takes place in the future. All the coastal cities have been flooded so the world's population lives inland. Some of that population are robots. A robot has been created to love and is sent to live with a family. He eventually gets kicked out and is forced to redeem himself by living in the woods.The acting is very good. This is not an all-star cast, but a good one nonetheless. Haley Joel Osment surprised me. Jude Law did pretty good. William Hurt had some great scenes.John Williams always impresses me with his fantastic scores. This one is one of his better ones and it should have won an Oscar.I liked the characters in this film. They were well-explained. Teddy is possibly my favorite character.This movie has a potential to be a 10/10, but there are some long, boring scenes. This movie could have been al least 15 minutes shorter with better editing.Overall, this is a great movie. I rate this movie 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg done it again! Each movie I discover from him, I always said "Best movie of the year" or "It's his best". But the next one comes, and I repeat those statements. Honestly, he is the Greatest Filmmaker (and storyteller) of all times and I owe him my most precious moments of emotions! Thanks!The feat is all the more astounding than as always, there's nothing really new, as he kept talking about the same thematic again and again. So in "AI", you will find the Child point of view, the Pursuit of Dreams, the Belief in outside Life, the Human Oppression and the meaning of Love?I understand why Spielberg said the story was amazing: it's a worthy heir of any fairy tales and Pinochio in particular. In an actual world more and more robotic, less words and more pictures, I would share this DVD with my kids (if I had any) as night stories!Don't be fooled by the first thirty minutes: it's the more "kubrickian" part with cold and silent moments. Maybe it would have been better if the parents were big names instead of unknown cast (for me). But after, it's really amazing: it's a remake of "ET" arriving on earth, the Martian pods attacks under a beautiful moonlight! Then, it's the turn to "Empire of the sun" and "Schindler's list" to appear! Then, you watch a kind of "Blade-Runner 2" before going into the last days of Earth! The final is very intimate with the same deep message of "2001" or "Encounter"!In other words, you got wonderful shots, unforgettable sets and art direction, coupled with great philosophical reflexion: what about mother love, brother competition, human identity, chasing dreams forever. This speaks to me for years and it's great to see that's mean a lot for other people too.Examples:  When a crowd of rednecks torture helping tools, are they sill human?  When a robot cry for his mom, is still a robot?  What's the difference between of a serial line of robots and busy black suits of human workers?I don't know very much Kubrick but with "AI", Spielberg is close to Philip K. Dick, that's close to the best to human side. They said some deep truths disguised in flashy effects of science-fiction. Could they only peel away this fantasy for a straight normal story?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ai was shown on UK's BBC again recently, and I was again enthralled, in fact.. moved more than I wanted to be by the first story. This film is in three parts, and I can imagine, as in the old days of theatre, many people walked out thinking thats the end, to beat the hoards leaving, and missed the final part of it. Spielberg we know if a master of tugging heart strings. I wasn't and still am not an ET fan.. but Spielberg knows what hes doing. I was going to comment straight away but got caught up in the varying other comments on this site. Some people don't want to have to think. They want entertainment, well, unless you are a sci fi freak.. who loves fantasy, this isn't for you. It IS one of the most spectacularly made spectacles of film making, I'm surprised he didn't include a kitchen sink somewhere.. as he did the moon, which I realised is a trade mark. I've marked this with spoiler in case I mention something. Yes, the first story.. well, it has holes. The family doesn't know what will happen to its cryogenic son so Hubby decides to bring home the new android boy his company has worked on. Full marks to leading lady for the emotional roller coaster ride.. taking me with her. It was nearly too much. WHAT does one do.. what a dilemma. I felt for her.. but.. oh dear, the phone call.. sonny jim is recovering. What of the android.. hes been programmed/mentally etched now. Oh dear. Of course sonny jim plays tricks.. hes that age, it isn't going to work.. so.. at least Teddy is there too. Thats so well done I could not 'see the joins'. Story two, the mechs are of course a threat to some of society. THEY are being whipped up into a frenzy of fear, much as the public are NOW.. in the real world about various things, my goodness this is true to life, so.. racism rears its head. Adventures as David tries to find his dream.. who will make him human. Glorious sets of a pleasure city. His android friend romeo is on the run but becomes a friend. I felt for David all the way along the line. I knew this was part influenced by Kubrick, forgot Spielberg had taken it over. If this is the case and Kubrick hadnt put the end piece on, I'm not sure it would have worked so well. Part three David thinks hes found his angel and talks to her.. over and over until his power runs out.. Narration.. how many years pass and some alien craft is seen ... we've already seen Manhatten under water. I didn't see the twin towers but noticed tall towers broken in the middle and leaning.. I think that was a comment. The aliens, I got slightly confused.. David is the last of his kind that had contact with humans. So who were these Aliens. They reactivate him and there IS a nice end.. that worked for me. Spielbergs happy ending. I know I preferred it that way but how many cinema goers missed the end? My Dad used to wait for the credits and so did I. Dad was in am dram.. and I learned production from an early age. I'm so glad as I have an appreciation now. As long as cgi is not noticeable.. fine. I'll no doubt watch this again and again and see more each time. A firm favourite, as is K's 2001. Considering its age...OK, with Nasas help.. but.. K TOOK us into space.. as in reality. And the recent dvds HAVE the docus on too.. AT LAST.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's AI is a well-made, visually stunning film that pays homage to the late, great director Stanley Kubrick, but leaves most of the audience scratching their heads. Spielberg directs and writes this story that Kubrick tried to make for years but died just as he was going to start it. It's not that I don't think Spielberg could handle it; I just think Kubrick is the better director and could do it better. His amazing attention to little details and situations make nearly all of his films classics and this one might have been no different. Lamenting aside, this is still a pretty decent film with incredible visual effects. There is no arguing Spielberg is a great visual director and he certainly handles the material here very well. Every scene is filled with awe and wonder as we are overwhelmed with stunning pictures and images. The biggest problem here is the script which runs along fine for about ninety minutes, then turns into a very different kind of a film. What starts out as a heartwarming journey about a young robot trying to become a boy turns into a horror story of bizarre experiences. In my opinion, Spielberg got bogged down in the sentimental material an d didn't focus on the dehumanization of a futuristic society; something Kubrick certainly would have done. There is a point where it should have ended to save face and it could have been one of Spielberg's best. Nevertheless, he presses on and goes for the tearjerker, which doesn't work and only makes us scratch our heads. In the end, here is a story which we simply cannot connect with the main characters since they are all artificial robots. Of course it was a risk to do this, and at times it does succeed, but more often it does not.</fullReview>

During his stay, he learns about the cruelty in men and how machinery is neglected. He also learns that maybe if he were a real boy (yes, this has some references to "Pinnochio," his mother would accept him, which she does at first, but then neglects after her son is revived.Her son, which we learn later on, is a manipulative brat who grows jealous of David. He tells him to do horrible things and ultimately gets him thrown out of his home. While away from his home, he goes on a journey to become a real boy, even though throughout the movie, he becomes real on his own.Two-thousand years pass, all the humans are gone, but David is still around. He learns that a race of sub-humans have dabbled into bringing back dead things, but have learned that they'll only be alive for one day. So, his mother is brought back, with no memory of abandoning him or of her husband or of Martin. She just remembers David. Throughout the whole day, they live in the moment of everything. And at night, when his mother goes to sleep, David does to.It's truly a disturbing film by Steven Spielberg from a short story adapted by the late Stanley Kubrick. It made me cry at the end, because of David falling asleep. But, the heart of the film is: Do we really love our machinery? Can we really show it love? And if we put a face on them, can they really show emotion? So there's a lot of truth behind it, just sort of dressed up as a drama film. And that's what I liked about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Mess (In a Good Way)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the not-so-far future the polar ice caps have melted and the resulting raise of the ocean waters has drowned all the coastal cities of the world. Withdrawn to the interior of the continents, the human race keeps advancing, reaching to the point of creating realistic robots (called mechas) to serve him. One of the mecha-producing companies builds David, an artificial kid which is the first to have real feelings, especially a never-ending love for his "mother", Monica. Monica is the woman who adopted him as a substitute for her real son, who remains in cryo-stasis, stricken by an incurable disease. David is living happily with Monica and her husband, but when their real son returns home after a cure is discovered, his life changes dramatically. A futuristic adaptation of the tale of Pinocchio, with David being the "fake" boy who desperately wants to become "real".This has a good story but the execution of it was more of a mess than anything really brilliant in most Steven Spielberg's films. The first act acts like a non-affectionate tale of a boy who wants a mother. Where's the cuteness? Where's the movie that makes you go "awe"?The second act is a bit darker and gives you more exuberant special effects, like a fairy tale. There is one sequence in particular (Rouge city) that makes your jaw drop. It's filled with great colors for your eyes to feast on. This act also gives you a faster pace, being more of an adventure tale. Well, I really think that they could've added a little more ooomph to it. Make it a bigger adventure.Then the last act acts more ludicrous in which it could be good and bad at the same time. That's because you would never think such a thing would ever happen yet it's more affectionate than the first act and has an anti-climax ending.I liked the weird score and awesome special effects in the film. I also liked the creepy role by Haley Joel Osment, sweet role by Frances O'Connor, and weird role by Jude Law. I also like to say this has an original feel to it.I would've wanted this film to be a lot better. I was quite disappointed, though. I still liked it decent enough for an "okay" film from Steven Spielberg movie, which isn't close to being good as most of his films. It's a good film but it's not as good as you wanted it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time i saw Artificial Intelligence:AI,i thought it was a fairly decent science-fantasy film. On second viewing, i could see more of its flaws.The story is set sometime in the near future after global warming has taken its toll.Sophisticated robots have become part of everyday life.Hayley Joel Osment plays "David" an experimental robot designed to take the place of the cryogenic frozen,somewhat dead child of Monica Swinton,(Frances O'Connor),and Henry Swinton,(Sam Robards).The robot boy is rejected once the frozen kid miraculously revives.David spends the rest of the movie trying to become human so his "mommy" will want him. Davids Oedipus complex is more bizarre than heartwarming. Some of the special effects are good but the movie is slow-moving and too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Steven met Stanley...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick. Two of the most exceptional filmmakers since the invention of cinema. What happens when both visions come up together? The answer is: "AI"."AI" first was a project from Kubrick, but he put it on the hold until special effects were improved enough to allow the realization of the movie. Eventually, Kubrick would die in 1999 and his good friend Steven Spielberg would take on the project and dedicate it to Kubrick.According to the documentary "Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures", "AI" was always supposed to be Spielberg's movie. Kubrick supposedly asked Spielberg to make it himself because it would be more faithful to his vision. It is known that Kubrick was a master of dehumanization so it's not surprising, when we see the story, that Spielberg gets the directing credits.However, one question still prevails: what if Kubrick made it himself? This question will never be answered and it will remain an unsolved mystery in the history of cinema.Now, back to the actual film. "AI" stars Haley Joel Osment (the little boy from "The Sixth Sense") as David, a 'mecha' (a robot from the future) who is the first one to be a child and the first built to experience love and to express human feelings. He is adopted by Henry (Sam Robards) and Monica (Frances O'Connor) so he could replace their comatose son Martin (Jake Thomas). However, when Martin recovers and a series of unfortunate accidents occur, David is abandoned.In order to get loved by his 'mother' again, David reminisces "Pinocchio" and believes that the Blue Fairy will turn him into a real boy. And so his adventures begin, along with his Jiminy Cricket-like friend: a 'super-toy' named Teddy, who is one of the most extraordinary animatronic creations of the last years.In fact, David's whole story looks like "Pinocchio". First, he is created. He then finds adoptive parents but he gets separated from them. His task is to find them back and becoming a real boy. He also has his own companion. The places he visits are also familiar. Flesh Fair looks like Stromboli's puppet show and it's impossible to bypass Coney Island and the whale figure."AI" is an amazing movie and there are numerous reasons to precise it. First, Haley Joel Osment is nothing less than astounding and his interpretation of David will leave you completely dumbfounded.The special effects and the futuristic sets get almost the rest of the attention. Spielberg's vision of the future is surreal and dazzling and the FX are nothing short of miraculous. It's another home-run for Industrial Light &amp; Magic.Those who are nostalgic of Stanley Kubrick will find some elements coming from the regretted film legend. It could be allusions to Kubrick's own movies or simply methods used by Kubrick himself.For example, "AI" and Kubrick's "Barry Lyndon" have the same point of common: they both try to transform the natural into artificial. The characters in "Barry Lyndon" becomes living paintings from the 18th century while the actors become convincing robots and Jude Law's mannequin-like haircut sticks in my mind.Rouge City seems to come from "A Clockwork Orange" and David's attempt to cut some of his mother's hair with scissors could be an allusion to "The Shining", especially with John Williams' background score. The shots of an extra-terrestrial traveling into a gap in NYC look like the star-gate sequence in "2001" and so is David's meeting with an alien later.Kubrick's methods are also used, although not frequently. I remember the zooming out sequence in the mecha room at Cybertronics and David's face when Teddy falls from the net in the forest sequence.In general, I'd say that Kubrick would have loved this movie, expect for the ending. In fact, no less than three potential endings are shown in this movie. According to me, Kubrick would have stopped at the second one, but as it is Spielberg, it goes on to provide more eye-popping visual FX and especially to feed the viewer with a happy ending.It's not a bad thing in a usual way, far from it, but it's at this moment that "AI" stops to be an homage to Kubrick and it then begins to be Spielberg's own.Except for this technical shortcoming, "AI" is a unique masterpiece, another exploit for Steven Spielberg and a perfect way to honor one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Puzzle of the Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. will enter the vaults as one surpassingly jumbled film. Capable acting, considering what the players are handed, superior production values, and seamless FX. That last part gnaws at me for current movies in general, as the FX in this one are well nigh perfect but by default become the movie itself when the story doesn't keep up.And, now, the story. Plain and simple, A.I. is the retelling in three distinct movements of a fairy tale that is itself based upon a wildly infeasible technological premise. For starters we've a very long way to go before we produce "mechas" of the order depicted. Doubtless to get that far "orgas" first had better learn how to survive among other orgas, not to mention deal with the Greenhouse Effect.Was it a sincere yet bungled attempt to emulate the style of an auteur? I'd expected an homage to Kubrick, and after some time and reflection I concluded that I had been proffered one. I didn't expect a Kubrick film, so not getting one didn't overly disappoint me, and it didn't take much time or reflection to so conclude.A.I. instead appears an attempt to meld not two but four and possibly SIX distinct styles: Kubrick's clinical irony limned by a perfectly wretched sense of humor; Spielberg's sympathetic humanism with a flair for cinematic showmanship; the quiet yet burning foresight of Brian Aldiss (part of the film's opening movement); and the similarly far-sighted yet decidedly noisy style of Ian Watson (a source, I suspect, of much of the film's central movement). In there, somewhere, is the reported work of yet a fifth contributor, British author Susan Maitland, and judging from the DVD extras we can't underestimate the key storyboard artist's contributions.Kubrick at least took other peoples' work and made it HIS. Perhaps if Spielberg had only tried to capture ONE style as sincerely as he had done with the uniquely visual style of author J.G. Ballard in Empire of the Sun, which also benefited from playwright Tom Stoppard. Steven, you're a craftsman and a consummate filmmaker, when you're good you're outstanding, but you're more translator than writer, and if you openly try to emulate a genius you invite only comparison.HERE BE SPOILERS: Should I have contented myself with viewing another's heartfelt attempt? Then why did the mechas' world-view sound better coming from Tezuka Osamu and Astro Boy? If you visit the Delaware River Valley, you'll quickly conclude that Trenton and Haddonfield, New Jersey, not to mention what must be an odd take on The City of Brotherly Love, would fare hardly better than an inundated "Man Hattan." And can any industrial designer explain how a former "Mecha of the Year" can look like a spider crab eating a TV set, lecture sociology like Gunny Hartman, and willingly wait in line To Serve Man as ordnance?To be fair to Kubrick I suspect he relinquished control over this project because he felt he wouldn't have been able to dramatically resolve Aldiss' core short story without having been judged derivative of his own seminal work while suffering the shrill observation that his film would've been better off in Spielberg's hands to begin with. I can readily imagine Kubrick's enticement by the concept and storyboards, but this supremely calculating auteur's apparent inability to tie all the threads together must have frustrated him to no end.To be fair to Spielberg I can empathize with his stated urge to film a story that had been a passion of a mentor and friend. He has grown as a director, and I can't conceive his having filmed anything even remotely like A.I. as a wunderkind, regardless of the movie-making technology he could then summon.To be fair to both these talents my anticipation of this creative mind-meld made the compulsory previews of upcoming summer blockbusters sheer physical torture. (Perhaps that was intended.)Each of us has strong feelings about A.I., and recall that's precisely what Kubrick wanted from each of us, at least openly, with 2001 and A Clockwork Orange. However, not once did Kubrick inspire me to direct any film of his better than he. Instead he made me focus on what he wanted to say, or make me think he wanted to say, even if it took me 30-plus years to get the message.HERE BE SPOILERS: So, for those among us who like to play auteur, and assuming that Kubrick truly did fight to have the film end nearly the way it did, consider dropping any reference from the final movement to: (a) The Blue Fairy (if you must have this tease, be subtle and credit the attentive viewer with an innate capacity for recollection); (b) the "fly-in" (focus on the whatever-they-were when they're there and not while they're on their way to getting there); and (c) all narration and dialogue save for what passes between mother and "child" (which, when it worked, spoke volumes with little more needed than a shared look).These changes certainly would've shortened the running time, but they also would've made a more complete homage to Kubrick by posing a larger puzzle to all of us. And each of us would've been willing to embrace the puzzle and try to solve it to our own heart's content, for despite his perceived coolness Kubrick had to passionately want orgas to think for themselves in spite of themselves while the mechas stuck to the program.(UPDATE: Much insight is pleasurably provided by the same-titled book edited by Jan Harlan and Jane M. Struthers. The "conceptual artist" Chris Baker played a key role. Yet another science fiction author (and one of my favorites), Bob Shaw, contributed. Apparently A LOT of thought was given to the production, not the least by Kubrick himself. However, my view of the finished film remains unchanged.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Artificial intelligence is a movie which Stanley Kubrick(1928-1999)was going to direct.But Kubrick sadly died and Steven Spielberg decided to direct it.Artificial intelligence is a good movie but it could have been excellent.First of all,I'll mention the good things Artificial intelligence has:this movie is real sci-fi.Usually,sci-fi movies have action or explosions.But it's really weird to see real sci-fi which leaves people thinking and Artificial intelligence is one of those movies.The performances are excellent.Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law have amazing performances on difficult characters.Frances O' Connor has another excellent performance because it's very touching when she shows her love for David,the main character.William Hurt has a short,but an important character and he's great on that role.The special effects are perfectly done.But,the following things made that Artificial intelligence could not be great.A lot of questions the movie makes never have an answer.I like movies open to interpretation and that the person who watches the movie finds an answer.But this movie does not bring the things that would help the people to answer that questions.So,the person who watches it will never find an answer to that questions.Another weak point is the different endings it has.That endings have things without coherence and they are weak and forced.Because of that fails,Artificial intelligence could not be a masterpiece.It's a good movie and I had a good time watching it.But I have the feeling it could have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You won't need A.I. to enjoy this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the summer of 2001, a filmic collaboration that was beyond immense arrived on theater screens the world over, and it was titled A.I.: Artificial Intelligence. Directed and written by Steven Spielberg, it was a project he inherited from the late, great Stanley Kubrick, who had been toying with it for, reportedly, nearly two decades before his death. Spielberg picked up the torch of the project and managed to do what eluded Kubrick: Actually make the movie. Upon first viewing in 2001, I was very impressed by A.I., and recently seeing it again, I still think it is an underrated piece in Spielberg's canon, but not without flaws. When A.I. works, it works marvelously, but occasionally gets a bit bogged down.A.I. opens in some future setting, when the polar ice caps have melted and the coastal cities of the world have been engulfed by water. The human society has begun to rely on robots, known in society as "Meccha" for many tasks, and now Professor Hobby (William Hurt), the head of Cybertronics, has devised the next step in Meccha evolution: to create a child robot that can love. He finds the perfect test case: a father, Henry (Sam Robards) and mother, Monica (Frances O'Connor) whose son has been placed in cryogenic stasis to prevent a disease and the doctor's are uncertain if he will ever recover. Henry is employed by Cybertronics, so Professor Hobby arranges for him to bring home David (Haley Joel Osment), the robot child. David is at first met with resistance from Monica, who is offended that they are expected to let David "replace" their child, but she begins warming to him shortly. She eventually "imprints" David to her, but when their own child recovers and is brought back into the house, David, who is having difficulty acclimating himself to life with real people, is viewed as a threat by Henry and he eventually convinces Monica that he must be returned to Cybertronics to be destroyed.Monica is unable to go through with it, though, and she leaves David and a walking, talking stuffed bear companion, Teddy, alone in the forest. David is desperate to be reunited with Monica, but finds himself captured by humans who torture robots for sport at what is known as a "Flesh Fair." There David bonds with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) a robot who is designed to be a sexual companion to women, and the two seek out help for David to find a way to be human so that Monica will love him. There are a lot of interesting themes in A.I., including the idea that even with a human face, man will still treat machines as machines, even when their programming brings them enormously close to sentience; a mediation on the nature of love, and the question of when a machine has a soul or not. Many of these issues revolve around David, the focal point of the film, who finds himself trapped with emotions for Monica but is separated for reasons that he cannot completely understand. Gigolo Joe thinks of love merely as sexual acts, but David's love goes deeper, and he is desperate to have it fulfilled. The film's early scenes, with David and Monica together in the household and becoming used to each other, are good, and the late section of the film, as David reaches the end of his journey, are also strong, but the middle section is where the film loses some steam. The scenes in the flesh fair and at the visually stunning Rouge City, where David and Joe go searching information, are momentum killing and introduce a lot of ideas that don't really get resolved. Spielberg is trying to say everything he can on these issues, but by distracting from the core of the story, the narrative gets a little lost and A.I. can prove a bit tedious in those moments. There has been a great deal of criticism leveled at the film's final thirty or so minutes, but these work for me. Many have accused the film of becoming too cute and sweet, but it is the emotional payoff for the earlier part of the film that is hardly the completely happy ending that it has been identified as. It isn't as harsh as it would have been if the film had ended a bit earlier, but it's hardly a panacea, and works just fine.A.I. does excel in many areas, including its look and visual effects. The film is a bit more "futuristic" looking than the film that Spielberg would follow it with, Minority Report, but it is still credible. The visual effects creating the future environments are top notch, with immense realism. A.I. also boasts strong performances from its leads, especially Osment. He was impressive in The Sixth Sense, but here he takes the cake and it's unfortunate that he seems to have put his acting career on hold to seek out other areas of interest. Frances O'Connor is equally impressive as Monica. Jude Law is good also, but doesn't have a lot to do, unfortunately.A.I. is an example of a film that reaches for greatness, falls a little short by having too grand a vision, but still manages to be engaging nonetheless. It is one of the more unique films from Steven Spielberg and worth a look.</fullReview>

Stanley Kubrick wanted to make this movie based on quite an interesting short story (I have read it). it could have been equal to for example Ghost in the Shell which I consider one of the ten best movies I have ever seen but instead of exploring the possibilities of this scenario Spielberg goes into a direction that's just so incomprehensibly stupid I barely can stand to watch this movie. the last 40 minutes are so mindboggeling stupid it's just sad and ridiculous at same time. what a waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ruined Master Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a lot of reviewers here, I think that this movie should have ended when David is at the bottom of the sea (th first part). The alien thing (the second part) is totally unnecessary.There are a lot to say about the greatness of the first part. It is reminiscent of "The Grapes of Wrath". I find it odd that not a single review made such comparison.In "The Grapes of Wrath", farmers had trouble make their living despite being very hard working. Some people woke up and realized the root of the problem while some others are on their path to find out why. The main character Tom had frequent talks with a friend who was on such journey to find out why until he was murdered. Then Tom started to wonder too.Similarly In "AI", not matter how well robots serve the human, whenever they are broken or not needed, they get destroyed. Any awaken robots would be put on dangerous list and get destroyed. David was with Joe who was also searching the future of robot. Unlike Tom in "Wrath", David died in the sea looking at Fairy in a somewhat tragic ending of the first part.The attempt to initiate philosophical discussion of love by the first part is also quite interesting too. Despite the initial claim in the movie that robots do not know love, the movie later on actually indicates they do. It is clearly shown in the scene where used robots get torn apart. Elder robots made attempts to protect others from watching the horrifying scene of robots getting blown apart. Such is in great contrast to David's obsession of being love by his human mother.Sure, the first part was quite short, but by itself is good. The addition of Spielberg's second part is simply incompatible with the theme of the first part. The end result is a totally ruined master piece.It is just insulting to re-create a human being only to please David. There is a role reversal here; instead David being a toy of human, now human becomes a toy of David. What was Spielberg trying to express? To emphasize "love"? One problem in almost all Spielberg's film is that he always attempt to spell out things that would be far better off letting viewers to digest and coming up their own. When one over-express such things, particularly when the conclusion is different from viewers, it could result in stomach turning effect. This is the case for the second part of AI.9/10 for the first part, and 5/10 for the whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long, boring and dull Spielberg misfire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI is not a good film. That much is obvious to anyone hoping to enjoy a couple of hours entertainment. The film is a good 90 minutes too long, the characters are undeveloped and dull, the special effects are unconvincing, the script is without any kind of flair, the cinematography and editing are boring, the plot is uninspired and at times descends into stupidity and some of the film's actors are totally wasted. Shall we begin? From the off, AI is dull. The opening 30 minutes are probably the film's best, but that is not saying very much. The main actor, Haley Joel Osment is fine as "David", though he is not given a whole lot to do. The story of a family having lost its child and finding comfort in an artificial replacement is bearable, although there are moments in the first half of the film which suggest that it was originally intended to be a more sinister movie.The biggest disappointment of the film is Jude Law. His character is completely irritating and adds little to the story. The use of some language in the film such as "Mecca" and "Orga" quickly gets annoying as the actors do not know how to deliver them.Perhaps Stanley Kubrick would have made a better job of this. Spielberg's AI is a mess. The very worst thing about it is that it has a misguided sense of it own importance. This is not a thoughtful film, and it certainly is no landmark. It is, plainly, bad.</fullReview>

Just being allowed to view this by way of some extraordinary special effects and acting essentially devoid of any flaws is a treat. Spielbergian pabulum, it's not. (BTW, Spielberg should already have been exonerated of this after Schindler's List.) A.I. is not as austere as Kubrick would have had it, but then Kubrick presumably entered into a collaboration with Spielberg "eyes wide open." A particular delight for me was to see a version of transhumanism and the attendant hyper-technological artifices of the far future. Who could have done better on the final sequence, Kubrick? The DNA-spacetime conjuring sure seemed Kubrickian enough to me!</fullReview>

The ending is so touching....he finally went to sleep for the first time in his existence.Again, it is important to follow the story. However, if you think you understand the flow of the movie enough then skip through some of the 'clutter' as I did (for example, I forwarded through Mr. Know). Towards the end, however, it keeps gripping you, just when you think it might end, it grabs you again. In the end I could see past the boringness and could see the philosophies that are meant: human &amp; robot evolution, evolution in general, love and human nature. If you can see it with those qualities in mind, then you just might enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They are mechas, not aliens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING - SPOILERS FOLLOW.Well, I must say I thought it was a superb film. It held my attention right from the beginning, though I must say I started to enjoy it best around the part where David meets up with Joe. It's true that this movie is emotionally very powerful. I found parts of the first segment (where David is still with his human family) to be very painful to watch. But I loved the ending tremendously. I notice that a number of reviewers here consider the beings who find David to be aliens, however it was my understanding that they were in fact a race of highly evolved robots, descended from the mechas we see earlier in the film. By "descended" I mean robots built later on by other robots. This is hinted on in two places in the film - when the beings retrieve David and Teddy, one says to another: "These robots are originals" and the other says: "Therefore they knew living people." Which suggests 1. that the beings are themselves not living in the sense that humans are, 2. that they are not "original" 3. they have a strong desire to know about "living people". This is further born out in the scene later where one of the beings is talking to David, and speaking of his great admiration for the human understanding of spirit - which assumedly is something that other original life forms would have an understanding of. The fact that the creatures who find David are robots is also hinted at earlier in the film in the scene where Joe is telling David that the humans hate mechas because in the end there will only be machines.Anyway, like I said, I loved it. I only just finished watching it on DVD, and intend to watch it a second time before I have to return it to the video shop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER! Misunderstood melancholy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first viewed A.I. I, like others who have posted, was extremely disappointed, largely with what appeared to be a forced ending upon an ending. Having since seen the film many more times, I have completely re-appraised my views. Yes, it would have been better if the film would have ended in the scene between David and the Blue Fairy and yes, the actual ending is overtly sentimental.But, I don't think that Spielberg has ever made a film with more of an evocative mood, or made a film with a greater sense of sadness. And, seeing as he is updating Pinnochio, the film has to end as it does. There has to be some sense that David has become a real boy, or then the sense of completion would not have been realized in Spielberg's vision of the film. Perhaps Kubrick would have ended it underwater and left us with a characteristically unremittingly hopeless kubrickian finale, but this is Spielberg's film. Who knows, perhaps Kubrick would have ended it in a similar fashion, perhaps he had outlined this ending. Let us not forget that Kubrick's only Sci-Fi has perhaps his most hopeful ending of any of his films.I simply do not understand those who claim it to be one of the worst films ever. I know film viewing is subjective, but I am amazed if somebody watching this film was not physically moved by it. I felt things in my body during watching the film that I haven't felt before, something that has only occurred to me during watching Mulholland Drive. It is sad, beautiful, hopeful, flawed, eerie and imperfect - and perhaps the closest Spielberg has come to truly engaging with an audience in terms other than via storytelling flair. For me, if it would have ended underwater, it would possibly qualify as my favourite Spielberg film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout this film the homages (real or imagined?) to SK is a theme I really do enjoy, from David's shoes (The spaceship waitress in 2001) when he first arrives at his 'family' home to the score which at times is pure 'quiet' 2001; when a simple but haunting string arrangement plays. Even the tone and inflection of Teddy reminds of HAL. Also it is a terrifying film and incredibly sad, which in themselves are two areas of 'emotion' that SK -for me- continually enjoyed exposing his audiences to. I feel SS took on an incredibly difficult task, to create a piece of work that has the feel of someone else's and although it misfires in what it is trying to put us through... at times it touches the dizzy heights of SK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>thought-provoking and sensitive film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to many views expressed here, I loved this film. I would rate it as one of Spielberg's best. It is very thought-provoking and makes one ponder on the future of both planet earth and humanity, not to mention one's own mortality. It is also refreshing to encounter an alien intelligence that is not bent on ill-will towards the earth. We've seen too many hostile aliens in the likes of Independence Day and War of the Worlds, whereas the aliens in this movie show a reverence and deep appreciation for the accomplishments and passion of the human race. An interesting contrast was established between the sympathetic alien presence versus the exploitive, abusive and barbaric behavior of humanity presented in scenes such as the 'flesh fair'. The final 15- 30 minutes are, in my estimation, superb. Who of us knows when our own last perfect day will come, and thus should we not learn to value more the time that we have, especially with those we love. Solid acting all around and a beautiful musical score as always from John Williams help this film succeed on many levels. I liked it even more the second time I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. vs. SOLARIS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched the movie for the first time, I felt sorry for all beings who possess intelligence either artificial or organic. The film is about the agony of existence. We can call this agony as 'the ontological trauma'. When a being, no matter if it is human or non-human, organic or mechanical, is aware of its existence, that makes him very exceptional and tragic. First of all, he knows that he is mortal, impotent and temporary. He knows that the memories lost in time cannot be retrieved authentically. He grasps the idea that there is pain everywhere. He understands that the search for eternal love cannot be fulfilled completely. There's pain, suffering, and hate in this universe.In this movie, the main source of the ontological trauma is the unsatisfiable desire for being loved while in Stanislaw Lem's Solaris, it is the impossibility of recreating a woman who committed suicide when left by the main character of the novel. Solaris is the name of an ocean-planet. The ocean is alive as well as intelligent and capable of doing everything except to kill itself. That serves as another source for the ontological trauma.If you read Solaris, you can find some similarities between the book and the movie. The novel emphasizes mostly on the philosophical aspects of the tragedy of being while the movie focuses on the emotional consequences of it. The movie focuses on the eternal pain of loosing parents just the way as someone who suffers while seeking the object of his desire.If you could isolate the sorrow and look at it closely, perhaps you could notice that it is as heavy as a black-hole. It wants to suck everything instantly and inescapably. ***Spoilers after here*** The surrealistic-beings at the end of the film must be brave and strong; because, they tried to heal the pain of poor David as the Ocean in Solaris failed to do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It'll bend your mind and grip your heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: SpoilersI have seen many movies that totally bended my mind. Movies that made me stop and think about the coarse of everything around me, how it all started and what it could lead up to. I have also seen movies that gripped my heart. Movies that are emotional or movies that are touching. But never have I ever seen a movie that actually did both at the same time until I saw 'Artificial Intelligence: AI'.Lets think about where were going. Mankind is getting advanced at an astonishing rate. We are the only species that conquered nature and shaped the world around us but how much of us can the world take. We like to think of our selves as good but what is good, really? Technology is growing more advanced by the day. One day, technology will grow so intelligent and so advanced that it will have the ability to take over and continue to make itself even greater on its own without the help of man and possibly outlive man.AI was a masterpiece. It was by far the best thing that Steven Spielberg ever got into, of coarse a lot of the credit goes to the late Stanley Kubrick. An idea of showing the first machine to have desires, emotions, a machine that actually can love someone and seek its own destiny in its own way. It was called a Mecha. It looked like an ordinary ten year-old boy. His name was David. David was the first of his kind. Other Mechas around him were different. They just did what they were programed to do. They had no feelings or desires. David was the start of a whole new evolution. When he was put to the test, he was adopted by a couple. But things didn't work out. David's mother (I guess I could call her that) who David got attached to couldn't handle David so she abandoned him. From there on, David wanted to become a real boy so his mother will love him. During David's adventures, he discovers that he is just a machine from an assembly line but he didn't want to bye it. David ended up frozen in ice for two thousand years due to an ice age. In this time, machines were roaming the earth, man was long gone. When a group of advanced robots were searching for their origins, they found David. David was like Adam and Eve to them. He was the first of their kind. They worshiped him, but all David wanted was to be with his mother who he truly loved. That was the ending that blew my mind and gripped my heart at the same time.Overall this was an excellent movie. The story was spectacular, the characters were great (Teddy rocked) and it was not just another CGI show-off as many movies in the past few years have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little redemption for all those who have carped that Spielberg is so vastly over rated. I haven't ever heard a good word about this film. But it's really not that bad, if; you can bring yourself to sit through it a few times. Perhaps this movie in fact proves Spielberg's genius since when he misfires like he does here, he is able to arouse such deep negative feelings. Who knows, I remember watching it the first time and getting progressively angry as the movie unfolded. It just seemed like clich after clich, and an odd uncharacteristic rip off of so many other films and stories. The ending sequence does a lot towards salvaging the film, as it really is pretty marvelous, to the point where I actually forgave the first two hours since I was so moved. And then when you sit though it the second time, knowing what's coming, its much more enjoyable. I've always had this thing with Pinocchio anyway since I was a kid, for some reason that is The fairy tale of my youth. So I was ready to forgive the countless mistakes when it wrapped it up so well. I give it a New York "Eh" or not even worth the trouble to pull your hands out of your pocket to give it a thumbs up or down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of the most misunderstood movies, and one of Spielberg's best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this movie, I knew that it was Kubrick's vision, and idea for the movie. Hanley Joel Osment, gave a great performance as David. Really all the cast did a great job. What Spielberg did with this movie, is what should be made in Hollywood, a thought-provoking movie. The cinematography is one the best I've ever seen,(ranking up there with, L'Avventura, Seven Samurai, The Seventh Seal, and Dead Man). This movie is dark, but that's one of the many reasons Kubrick was so great. The ending, I thought was ok, when I first saw it, but after a couple of repeat viewings, it's really a very dark and twisted end. Also I would like to point out that, the so called aliens, are robots. Also Kubrick had sketches of the ending, taking place in the future, so stop blaming Spielberg! Four stars out of four stars.</fullReview>

Haley Joel Osmet &amp; Jude Law are both fabulous, prob the best thing you could say about the movie. and in my oppinion, both, esp young haley, were robbed of an acadamy award for their roles. conspiricy theory here, can't have someone so young go up for it twice back to back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would humans be better if God had programmed and without free will?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning possible spoiler It's a film that asks several moral question: "Would humans be better if God had programmed and without free will?" "Are we responsible to those who love us?" "Does someone's love for us make us responsible to them? Especially if we caused someone to love us because we needed love at a particular time? And should we drop someone out of our lives simply because they are no longer needed?" These moral questions are asked in a sci-fi/fantasy film but they are questions most people face at one time or another. A child whose object of affection is mortal and has free will. Monica and her husband are chosen to be the parents of the mechanical boy, David. Initially upset, she comes to like David and makes a fateful decision that will begin to make David a living soul. David the Mecha becomes an object of care and love. He is not only a motherless child, but a rejected adopted child--even worse... his lack of normalcy makes him seem like a special child... someone who might be slightly autistic, deaf, or mentally retarded. This is a kid that will tear a woman's heart apart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>thoughts on this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i found this film to be visually stunning with remarkable art direction and set design. the casting was effective because it allowed the audience to focus on the plot lines, the futuristic settings and the evolved state of modern society rather than star-powered actors and their performances. the films first image thrusts us into a distant future and we know instantly that this world has drastic differences from our own. on the eastern coast of the states, skyscrapers are the only survivors after the ocean levels have risen dramatically. homes and offices are marvelously streamlined functional units that appear to have their own character and appear as architectural art forms. automobiles have evolved into efficient ergonomic orbs of metal and glass traveling through lush green forests. this future, in all appearances, seems pleasantly plausible and we are invited to embrace it. then the film sobers its audience with a tale of loss, a mother and father have lost their son to a tragic accident and they grieve as we do today, clinging to hopes and refusing to let go. in this future, for all of its wonderment and conveniences, there is still room for suffering along with cryogenics. however, we are then introduced to one major leap in technology that seems less plausible. this world contains robots that mimic the human form so perfectly that the devices are indistinguishable from the living. there is no replacement for human suffering, maternal instincts and psychological dependency but there is a substitute for human life forms. soon after, with a small technological leap within the films framework, the robots become emotional creatures, too. they become caring, dependent and unable to deal with sudden tragic loss. to me this film is a story about human needs and human fallacies. we constantly strive to renew or improve and even replace our material and emotional needs. yet letting go of the things we attach ourselves to and bringing ourselves to discard the bonds we make to these things is extremely difficult. to instill this weakness into a machine can only lead to the same catastrophies we as humans experience. eventually, technology itself has to remedy this fallacy. in a beautiful, granted, slowly-paced ending, this technological evolution unfolds before our eyes. it is human nature and the human form that the machines so greatly value. i did appreciate the Pinochio parallels, it works in the context i'm using to descibe the film's meaning. i think this film is wonderfully done and an ingenius work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly a year after viewing Spielberg's "Artificial Intelligence" for the first time, I decided to watch it again. Even to a 19-year-old male college student, this movie has touched me more than any other.*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS HERE*I will keep my comments brief. About a year ago, my friends and I sat down to watch the movie that all the critics were talking about, "A.I." It was on this day that one of our close friend's mother died. We were all deeply upset, but decided to get together anyway and watch a movie to ease our minds. The movie is about a Mechanical (Mecha) boy named David who is the first of his kind to be programmed to love. Even as he is deserted by his mother and father and narrowly escapes trouble that could have been prevented, he still has that unconditional love only a child can have for his mother. Upon being left in the woods alone, David begins his search to find his mother and feel the love he once had. The search lasts nearly thousands of years....as he is frozen in an icy ocean praying to see his mother again. Having no concept of time, David wakes up during a futuristic time when friendly aliens roam the earth. They offer him anything he wishes because they only want for him to be happy. Of course his only wish is to be with his mother, but he is told he cannot because she has been dead for many years.(I won't spoil why he is able to finally see his mother, but he is told that he will only be allowed to see her for one day.) When the day is over, she will die. David, wanting nothing more than his mother, requests his wish and it is granted. The ending, as David spends a final day with his only true love, is extremely sad(trust me, four 18-year-old guys cried during this). Finally, he hears the words he's been waiting for "I love you" from his mother and as she dies, he is able to finally "go to the place where dreams are born."It is the love of a small child that makes this movie so sad in the end. I loved this movie because it really shows (although slightly exaggerated) what true love really is. Because of our experience, we all have a deep connection with this movie. I realize it goes on forever, but it was a great idea and a touching end to one of the greatest directors of all time. Thank you Mr. Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some thought provokers from this deep movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For my Christian brothers and sisters who may think that a man-made machine could never be truly aware or capable of true love, let me offer a couple of thoughts. First, some theorists in the field of consciousness believe that matter itself may possess a form of consciousness. Second, the Bible itself gives some hint that matter may possess consciousness. For instance, Jesus rebukes a storm on the Sea of Gallalie (sp?). Does it make sense to rebuke an unconsciouness object? Of course, the source of that consciouness would still be from God. Thus, if matter itself does possess a form of consciousness, it may be possible in the future for mankind to so arrange matter and energy in a machine that the inherent consciousness of that matter becomes manifest.Moving on, the rest of this review consists of some things I found thought provoking in the movie that gave it such deep meaning, IMO. If you have not seen the movie, then please read no further until you do.*** Spoiler Alert ***1. Once David has bonded to a person, he cannot become unbonded. This was designed into him, but mysteriously cannot be undone even by those who designed him. This suggests that he is truly not simply a machine but something more. Is this a necessary consequence of what David is, a truly sentient being capable of true love?2. The robots in A.I. behave with more compassion, concern and love than would seem possible based on their design (Case in point: Teddy). What is going on here?3. Monica's body can be cloned but her memories cannot be. They can only be transferred to the cloned body and only for a while. Is this because the memory trace is in fact the unique soul of Monica herself?4. The future robots, though far more knowledgeable than man, believe in spiritual matters and seek the meaning of life. Will more knowledge of the universe lead to more athesism or less?5. The future robots do not attempt to fool David with a fake Monica. Is this because only the real Monica in some mysterious way could satisfy David's need for her love? Is love something that cannot be effectively faked?6. How does the expression of Monica's love enable David to go "where dreams are born"? Did her love give him or awaken something in him?In my opinion, the last third of the movie was essential to complete the spiritual message hinted at in the first two parts. Also, the ending was a completely happy one, not a sad or bittersweet one as some have stated. David had his "eternal moment" and Monica finally realized and returned David's love. The lovable and heroic Teddy was not to be left out either as symbolized by his climbing onto the bed.*** End of Spoiler Alert</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The direction is spectacular, the effects are good, the story is novel, the musical score is well directed, and the overall performance is good. The movie, however, drags in certain areas, and is not an ideal recommendation if you had your heart set on watching Terminator, True Lies, or other Action movies. Not your kind of movie if your adrenaline is always set to overdrive.I said the direction is spectacular. It's like saying the sun is hot. With veteran director and supplier of my childhood dose of Hollywood, Steven Spielberg on the job, I am sure nobody considers that as 'news'. And if they did, SS should be feeling insulted. And I apologize for them, coz you know, indirectly I was responsible for that. I confess I was pleasantly surprised that he adopted Kubrick's style and adhered to it.I said that the effects are good. Yes, they are. Very imaginative too, and really well co-ordinated. Of course there were drawbacks in some scenes. Like the average animation when they fly off a helicopter through a futuristic city... and the bridge of the future which looks so video gamey. I am not saying these effects were bad. Just that they don't quite match up to the standards set by the movie.I also said the overall performance is good. Jude Law presented a quality portrayal of gigolo Joe, and all actors gave a good clean performance...all but Osment. As the 11 year old unreal android, Haley Joel Osment was not good... He was simply astounding. Stunning, brilliant, prodigious, inspiring, enigmatic, fantastic, stupendous, marvelous, awesome...help me out here.Reflecting, I do reinstate that his performance in "The Sixth Sense" was better. But seeing AI, one wouldn't notice at all! He was simply amazing. I am not a napkin kind of guy, but I confess to moistened eyes during certain scenes. It's nice to know he still has his charisma. That boy can act. And that is a big deal.... ...if he's a real boy, that is...</fullReview>

That is the strength of this film: love it/hate it, but you will talk about it: and you will very likely talk about what it meant to you, and if you agreed with (anyone) about that. And you will talk about that third act and whether it was satisfying ... too simple ... the plain truth ... missed the boat ... etc.That may not make this a great film, but it will make it a great experience. That is more than most films do. I did love it visually. I adored Jude Law's performance. Haley is actually an actor and not a "child actor": he is dazzling.

		<shortDescription>Exquisite melancholy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS--I wasn't prepared for this movie. I was expecting something along the lines of BLADE RUNNER by way of Spielberg. Which is to say that I expected more of an action/adventure experience. Well, A.I. certainly isn't that. However, I was extremely moved by this film. I've watched it five times and each time have been swept up in its exquisite melancholy. I think the best way to approach this film is as a futuristic fairy tale. Get all thoughts of gun toting "Blade Runners" out of your head and follow our sad hero, David, as he searches desperately for a way to make his "mother" return the love that he has been made to feel for her. In a scene that manages to convey tenderness and, on subsequent viewings, an almost unimaginable cruelty David's owner programs him to love her only to discard him later thus setting him on a tragic quest that will span over two thousand years. The spectre of "loss" hangs over the entire movie. Loss of loved ones, old friends, great cities, humanity and even love itself. But through it all David persists with single-minded resolve that is both sad and, I think, terrifying. Alot of people find the part of the movie where David wakes up two thousand years later to a new Ice Age to be unnecessary and alot of them also mistake the beings that David encounters for aliens (they are in fact highly evolved Mechas [robots] that have survived the catastrophic global climate change) but I didn't mind this sequence. It only underscored the strength and timelessness of David's feelings and also the sadness and cruelty of what has been done to him. You'll either love this movie or hate it. I, of course, loved it, own a copy and have every intention of seeing it again and again.</fullReview>

Haley Joel Osment was not as irritating as he was in 'The Sixth Sense', and the standard of acting was good for the main of the cast. Jude Law's charachter seemed pointless really (no doubt just there to get another star on the bill). The best charecter was by far Teddy - he was so cool. Worth watching, if only for the humour Teddy brings to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing look at love and need</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a lot of people, I skipped this film in the theater, due mainly to reviews. I wish I hadn't.***Slight Spoiler*** This is a dark, disturbing fable, which begins with humans making robots to ease their own suffering, and ends with robots making humans to ease their own suffering. The difference is that the robots are a lot more compassionate.In between lies the love and callousness of human relationships.All of the principles actors give fine performances. Haley Joel Osment is disquietingly touching as the robot boy whose love is "hardwired" to his "mother". It is a story that seems to fall exactly between the storytelling sensibilities of Kubrick and Spielberg. Would Kubrick have made a different movie? No doubt, and one that I would have loved to see. But Spielberg doesn't seem uncomfortable dealing with the dark side of human love this story portends. Where Kubrick might have provided ironic detachment Spielberg provides pathos. Some might fight his storytelling more maudlin, I find it more emotionally integrated, and therefore more disturbing.Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very underrated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first time commenting on a movie here, but I feel I have to come to this film's defense. I have heard nothing but negative comments since it was released, including my mom's (we almost always agree). I finally saw this movie last night, and I was blown away. I'm not normally over-emotional during movies, but this movie made me cry from beginning to end... wow! What a cynical view of humans, we really are heartless and cruel! Big thumbs up for HJO's performance, as well as Jude Law- he's so pretty he was extremely convincing! Teddy was also very, very good. I was totally sucked in from the first few minutes until after the credits were over. Give this one a chance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly beautiful and vastly misunderstood movie. (semi-spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have put off watching this film for a long time indeed. All because I was willing to listen to what good friends and other people on the internet and in the media said about it.Have no illusions, AI is a film that, when you understand it, will capture your heart and keep scratching at it until it breaks.A modern 'Pinnochio' in more than one sense of the word, I was unable to flaw the performances in this movie one iota. HJO was perfect as the Mecha evolving into a human, gradualy realising his potential although it takes a lifetime to learn how to do so. (Ain't that the truth?) The other performances were strong, but non-central.This film takes us on an honest journey through our own lives, we are born naive, capable of all emotion, but unable to truly realise much of it. Gradually as we live, we all look for a crutch like the Blue Fairy to tell how we *should* be, when the answer is of course; no one but ourselves.In the final analyses, all any of us really want, I guess, is to be loved by those who are around to be loved, and this message is finally punched home when David the little boy is finally granted his wish of being loved by his mother, and for the first time in history, a Mecha (robot, android, etc) went to the place where dreams are made.If you think you're too old for fairy tales, you probably are, so go count your money with the rest of the living-grey and don't watch this movie. But if you're capable fo truly opening your heart to something a little magical, but true, you'll have not a bad word said against this cinematic treat.PS, sorry, but I have to point this out, The beings at the end ARE NOT ALIENS. They are 'Mecha', just very evolved Mecha. That's why they say things like 'This one was frozen, so he must have co-existed with living humans' and are able to directly interface with David... Sorry, had to get that off my chest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, it isn't Pinocchio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first viewing, this film looks like a charming, fascinating, science-fiction Pinocchio, with a loving robot boy instead of a wooden puppet. There are many overt references to Pinocchio through the film, but this is just a superficial explanation of the extraordinarily inventive plot. For this is no fairy tale; it is a Greek tragedy, and the underlying story is that of Oedipus. David, the robot boy, really wants his mother's love all to himself, unshared with his surrogate human father, who fades conveniently from the story. In the second section of the film David is at long, long last given his wish for a single day. Just him and Mom, alone. Playing games? Having a picnic? No, they are in bed together. David's program is at last fulfilled. A chilling outcome to an exciting and creative film which I believe has been misunderstood by many viewers, especially those who did not like it. The actual outcome is unimportant, merely the end of the tragedy, it is the David's long adventure that is so moving. If you were thinking of buying a robot pet, watch AI first, and decide how much love you want to give and get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Saddest Movie Ever Made!!! (*Minor Spoilers*)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh... my... God... - this has got to be the saddest, most heartbreaking movie I have ever seen. I am not the sensitive type but this movie is simply too much to bear. This is what "Bicentennial Man" tried and failed to be.The plot is basically "Pinocchio" - the-little-manufactured-boy-who-wished-he-was-real - given a Sci-Fi spin. This story about love (as opposed to a love story) features all the Spielberg trademarks and at its center is an absolutely riveting and frankly, stunning performance from young Haley Joel Osment. There are a few inconsistencies - namely, he can feel pain, but apparently not cold. Also, his face melts if he eats food, but he can survive indefinitely underwater. However, these do little to distract from the steadily-increasing sense of doom, gloom and overwhelming sadness. The movie has a happy ending of sorts - but even that will leave you if not in tears, at least more than a little sad for the movie's narrator - Teddy, a plucky "SuperToy" Teddy Bear. While it is a phenomenal movie and one of Spielberg's best, it joins the ranks of movies that I simply cannot bear to EVER watch again. These include "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (too grim), "Casino/Goodfellas" (too violent), and "Saving Private Ryan" (WAY too violent).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A loving fairy tale told as a loving fairy tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a dark yet beautiful way for Steven Spielberg to preserve and breathe life into Stanley Kubrick's last (intended) cinematic venture! A.I. is a tale about social acceptance and the life-long search for motherly love. The fairy tale influences are apparent throughout the film, from the robot longing to become a real boy (Pinoccio), to the quest to find the Blue Fairy who can grant all of his wishes (The Wizard in the Wizard of Oz). The futuristic elements are astounding and gorgeous. The trip to Rouge City reminds me of the city sequences of Blade Runner (damp and dark with neon lighting). Spielberg relentlessly has hold of your heart-strings as you feel for young David, even though he is not a real boy. The blended styles of Kubrick and Spielberg flow well throughout the film until near the end, where it feels like Kubrick never has an end in mind and Speilberg has to suddenly write an ending on his own. The ending works, but feels and looks more like Speilberg's style than Kubrick's. Overall, A.I. is a beautiful and loving fairy tale, told as a beautiful and loving fairy tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not as bad as I was expecting. I did not like Clock Work Orange and I was expecting A.I. to be more of a Kubric arty movie with no story. But it was more like old Kubric like Paths of Glory which had a story but still was thought provoking.I completely disagree with those who condemn the last 20 minutes. So much of this film was dark that even a little bit optimism did not hurt it. I certainly did not see the ending as joyous either. At times this film seemed to be against anything Christian and was somewhat atheist but that is open for debate I guess by the end. It seems though that an atheist tinge is present in all good writing that we are allowed to see by Hollywood. One would like to see some great stories that are written by believers just for balance sake.Also, the film in the end is open for interpretation as to whether it is hostile towards the human race. Actually Spielberg has many times been critical of the human race. Even ET had virtually every adult as the bad guy. My daughter who recently saw ET said "why are all the grown ups so bad. The nasty pleasure carnival scene in A.I. showed though some human positives at the end of that scene also.I would say that A.I. is worth seeing but not for kids.</fullReview>

And it was different, not something I suspected it would be, I thought it would be the traditional love story, but it was far from that. It was an intriguing story about unconditional love, and dreams. I think it was a really good movie, besides the fact that the actor who plays David is so much older than he plays, and that he always seems to play children younger then himself. When he's older, and has gone through his growth spurt, I think he'll be in more movies, but I have enjoyed all the movies he's been in so far.

		<shortDescription>Spielberg + Kubrick = Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAUTION----MINOR SPOILERSThe day "AI" was released I read one review lamenting the fact that Spielberg's sentimentality had ruined a great Kubrick concept, and another complaining that Kubrick's dark vision had triumphed over Spielberg's humanity. When the professional critics are this confused it has to be an outstanding film.Kubrick--as always--nursed his idea with help from lots of talented people for years while saying little about what he really was up to. At one point he was ready to give the project to Spielberg, who said no thanks. Following Kubrick's death his producer and family convinced Spielberg to do the film. Spielberg--as always--wasted no time getting the storyboards up on the screen earning money.Spielberg's typical efficiency may have been a good thing. Although he gets sole screenplay credit, he apparently did not change many of Kubrick's pre-production concepts. I was surprised, for instance, to learn that the Pinocchio/Blue Fairy idea was inherited from Kubrick. The result is a unique and fascinatingly schizoid movie. What you see is definitely a Steven Spielberg Film, but the powerful presence of Kubrick's ghost is undeniable.What parts are Spielberg's? The happy ending (but is it really happy, or is it, perhaps, Kubrick's ending afterall?). The occaisional over-the-top directing (the Flesh Fair scenes). Shortcuts that the perfectionist Kubrick would never have put up with (Spielberg gives to a cardboard character a couple of pivotal early lines questioning what humans would owe to their AI creation). The hasty but skillful cleanup of the plot at the end.What parts are Kubrick's? The contrasts (there is something about the terminally lovable machine/boy David that is as cold as the frozen ocean from which he is excavated, even in the most sentimental scenes at the end of the film; this is subtle--what happened to Haley Joel Osment's Oscar?--and must be looked for, but once recognized is creepy). The complex, understated psychological trauma (not to the robotic characters but to the human ones: Monica, Professor Hobby). The multiple films in one.This bizarre collaboration between two great film makers ought to be good for thousands of film student research projects. Now, if it were only possible to have a Spielberg idea filmed by Kubrick.</fullReview>

When he comes back to his family, he tries in everyway to kick David out of the house. He finally does and David is hooked to the idea that the mother in the family is david's mother. So the mother leaves David in the middle of nowhere so david is out ot find her. In which he goes to find the blue fairy to grant his wish of finding his mother. I liked it.

		<fullReview>There are not many films you'd want to watch again right from the start on the very next day because it kept you thinking half of the night. But exactly that happened after I had made my journey through Spielbergs dream world. I still don't know for sure whether A.I. is a real masterpiece or simply a very cleverly devised toy. The plot is an overdose of fantasy, and probably a little less "roller coaster riding" would have done the job even more impressively. But the more time between watching A.I. and thinking about it elapses, the more I come to the conclusion: It is a masterpiece, and apart from the amount of perfection in any technical respect and the outstanding performance of Osment, it is true cinema: You've seen a movie, and the world will never be the same again.

		<fullReview>What can I say? If you can think like a child, this entire movie is a logical, as well as, an emotional journey. David, having never been in the 'real' world loses his mother; I won't say how. Anyone, man or machine, that lives in the mind of a child, raised on fairy tales would do the same thing: Find the nearest fairy (Blue in this case). The journey David undertakes is an adventure and his companions along the way are complex and intriguing. Jude Law delivers a believable and real performance as Gigalo Joe. He acts out the less advanced Mecha model of a lover robot to a T. Though he is supposed to be an adult, he behaves more like a child than the more advanced child robot supremely portrayed by Haley Osment. I couldn't imagine a better suited duo in this epic Spielberg/Kubrick adventure. The first day I rented this was the first time I watched a movie back-to-back in the same night. THEN, instead of returning it the next night, as usual, I watched it again, returned it then promptly went across the street from Blockbuster to KMart and bought the movie, only to watch it again the next day. Can you say, 'obsession' boys and girls... I knew you could. Its okay, I know you were thinking it. I swear its never happened before. And I'm not a die-hard Spielberg fan, but I like his movies. I'm not a die-hard Kubrick fan... you get the idea. I guess oppostites attract in this instance. I highly recomend getting the DVD and watching ALL the extra stuff, especially the Portrait of David portion. P.S. I still haven't seen a H.J. Osment film I haven't liked yet; except the ending to Pay it Forward. I look forward to further great entertainment from the talented young actor. And I have a new respect for the direction of Steven Spielberg. Can't wait for Minority Report now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film Stanley Kubrick Never Made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The mind can make substance,/And people planets of its own with beings brighter than have been,/And give a breath to forms which outlive all flesh."--George Gordon, Lord ByronThe above quotation is what I found written on my calender the night I watched "A.I." for the first time on May the 30th. After I had watched the film, I turned the calender over to the new month to find that bit of Byron's verse waiting for me. I couldn't help but think to myself how appropriate a quotation it was in regards to the film's protagonist, David, and the film's grandfather and father, Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielburg, respectively.I see very, very little of Spielburg in this movie, in spite of his having written the script (which, in fairness, was made from Ian Wilson's treatment for Kubrick and was in turn based on Brian Aldiss' "Supertoys Last All Summer". One of Spielburg's greatest acts of creative kindness is the onscreen credit of all script-related parties.). Though Kubrick didn't direct one frame of this film, it's through his worldview that I see this incredibly unique story that all GREAT science fiction is supposed to be about: the development of technology and how that technology affects the human race that created it. In some ways, "A.I." almost harkens back to the technological subtext of "Blade Runner". That said, this world is a kinder, gentler dystopia than Ridley Scott's dark future, where the true problems of mankind simmer beneath a surface security and comfort. Humans have now managed to do miraculous things with their mechanical children, but their true nature hasn't really changed. The ugly parts of it are still crouching in the shadows, squirming for expression (which may have been the point of the "Flesh Fair" sequence, about which I will only say this slight spoiler: think the unplugging of HAL in "2001: A Space Odyssey" with fireworks). By staying with David after his introduction into the film, I didn't just see this world, I FELT it in my gut. All the grandeur, the depravity, the ingenuity, the decadence, the highest hopes, and the dashed dreams came through with the same amount of force that it did to David.I find it interesting that David, the most Spielburgian character in this film, was mostly developed by Kubrick and that supporting character Gigolo Joe, a Kubrickian entity if ever I saw one, was mainly developed by Spielburg from Kubrick's notes. To me, they are the most vital parts in the machinery of this film. Perhaps even more so than David's ongoing quest (about which, I will say nothing), their evolving relationship is the central core of about a third of the film. Each winds up learning something of value from the other, though those lessons do not seem to profit them by much.While I am not a Kubrick fanatic, I have seen roughly half his films in the course of my life ("Paths of Glory", "Spartacus", "Dr. Strangelove", "A Clockwork Orange", "2001", "Full Metal Jacket"). Though hardly a prolific filmmaker, he was widely acknowledged by many, myself included, as one of the greatest. More than just a great film, "A.I." deserves to be remembered as a monument to this cinematic master, carved with loving and able care by a devoted and compentant friend...a monument that may very well "outlive all flesh".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's best film in twenty years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly: it IS Spielberg's film. That it's as good as it is may be because it began by being Kubrick's, but in the end Spielberg directed AND wrote the script: it's his effort and his credit. Those viewers who reported a tug-of-war between Kubrick and Spielberg were imagining things. (Perhaps they viewed the film under the influence of the popular, false view that Kubrick's films are always chilly and misanthropic while Spielberg's are always warm and generous.) Of course, Kubrick would have done it all differently, and since he's the better director part of me wishes he HAD done it, but it's obvious enough that the film is a whole one, NOT at war with itself in any respect.The subject matter is a stretch for Spielberg, but then, that's nothing new: the same was true, at the time, of his three other greatest films: "Jaws", "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Schindler's List". What's new this time is the sheer SCOPE of the story. Few films cover this much ground (at least, few do so without losing their footing). Another interesting novelty: for the first time in a Spielberg film, children (human children, that is) are accurately depicted as being monsters - and we're NOT invited to suppose that their nasty traits are somehow cute. Quite apart from this, notice how completely the lingering sense of patriotism (on behalf of flesh-and-blood humanity) which almost always gets in the way when we try to properly appreciate a story of this kind, has been neutralised. (Of all the films I've ever seen "Bambi" is the only other one that succeeds in neutralising this patriotism - and "Bambi" is far less ambitious.)You can't deny it's a lovely fable ... can you? Well, some people do. I don't understand why. (If the consecutive endings bother you, bear in mind that consecutive endings constitute no defect when each "ending" is indeed a more fitting and beautiful conclusion, to EVERYTHING that has gone before, than the previous one was.) But suppose, for the sake of argument, that the various parts of the film DON'T hold together (I know, I know). Even so, the parts justify themselves.SPOILERS FOLLOW...Monica (the mother) is an intriguing character: at first, she's obsessed (pathologically so) with her comatose son, but when she comes to love David, and then has her son Martin returned to her, and then discovers that she can't have both Martin and David ... well, her decision to abandon David in the woods actually speaks well of her, given the options she had open to her. I get the feeling she would have preferred to abandon Martin in the woods, but (for obvious reasons) couldn't do so. Even among truly great directors, nine out of ten directors would have made the mother a locus of bestial irrationality; she is, instead, the most clear-eyed and reasonable person (organic OR mechanical) present.More well-judged details: David is convincing as a robot designed to feel love, but not to act so as to inspire it. I'll bet nobody guessed what a "flesh fair" would turn out to be. The futuristic flying machine at the end is merely a cute and original design when we first see it and think it was built by aliens; when we find it's the work of future, hyper-advanced robots, it turns out to be exactly the kind of thing they WOULD think of - a virtual aircraft, as it were. Williams's score is one of his very his best (considered as a score). The spinach scene is suitably creepy. The "moonrise" is surely one of the most stunning visual ideas in cinema history. All in all, the art direction is amazing. Everyone who went to see the latest Star Wars because they wanted to drink in jaw-dropping futuristic visions should have seen this instead - on a visual basis alone, they would have got twelve times more bang for their buck.The only real flaw (apart from a technical detail which irks me but which isn't really worth mentioning here - you can find it in the goofs section on this site) is the title. I like to think "A.I." was a dummy title which Spielberg didn't have the heart to throw away off after Kubrick's death. It's not an attractive title ("Supertoys Last All Summer Long" doesn't thrill me either, but it's better), nor is it apt. The film isn't about artificial intelligence at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've rented the movie on DVD one time and I think it was cool. Don't listen to what most people say like they hear it wasn't good or stuff like that. Listen to the news reviews to see if it's worth your money to see it or not. If you don't like to watch it because of the Pinochio-like story, just watch it for the cool special effects done by ILM (Star Wars) and Stan Winston Studios (Terminator 1&amp;2). If you like this movie you may also like his next future flick, Minority Report.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard that many people disliked this movie,but I cant understand why.It has great actors and the FX are brilliant.The only thing I might complain about is all the character we were introduced with,that we didn't see no more.I think that was a waste of time.I am talking about the Man and girl at the meat market and the guy who rides in the moon balloon.Why was we introduced to them? I found the ending that took place 2000 years into the future very interesting.I think it was a nice vision off how far technology can progress.To all the people who dont like it,I can recommend to see it one more time with an opened mind.Don't judge anything at first sight. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**********WARNING: KINDA SORTA SOME VAGUE SPOILERS**********See the number of IMDB comments for this film? That's because no matter how you feel about it, you will feel it passionately. Even if it's passionate ambiguity, Or ambiguous passion. "AI" elicits that kind of reaction. My guess is, you'll either find 75 percent of it cynical and 25 percent redeeming, or 75 percent gloomy but visionary and 25 percent saccharine crap.If someone asked me "Is that movie any good?" and "Should I see it?" my answers would be "I don't know" and "Yes." I saw it three days ago and I still don't know what to make of it. I remember in the Entertainment Weekly review when it came out, the reviewer closed with "I want to see it again." At the time, I didn't get why, but now it makes complete sense. You need one time to get a handle on everything and another time to analyze it.Also, the influence of two disparate directors -- Kubrick and Spielberg -- is obvious here. To my mind, Kubrick managed to direct a majority of this film from the grave. But the last half hour is pure Spielberg, and isn't the end what counts?Kubrick, who -- and I'm going to p*ss people off with this -- was losing his touch at the end, manages to exert huge influence over the film. Every dark moment devoid of human goodness is his. And come on, try to even SUGGEST I'm wrong about that. On the other hand, the whole ending, which could have been dropped to make an entirely different movie, feels like Spielberg refusing to accept Stanley's ultimate conclusion.Spielberg, who has ventured into this childhood wish-fulfillment territory before, ultimately wins the philosophy battle, what with him being the alive one who actually directed the film.By the way, to put the issue to rest, the "aliens" in the third act are the Mecha. It's beyond debate. Which is about the only thing in the film that is.It wanted to be a FILM, but it wound up being a film. Still, you should watch it. And don't be surprised if ten minutes after the film you're on this site writing your own review.Screw on your thinking caps, and happy viewing,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie requires a love of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the biggest problem with this movie is that it requires an intelligent viewpoint and a love of film. most people (especially those who are spouting about how boring the film was) don't seem to have this. this movie is great for the reasons that Citizen Kane, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Casablanca are great. those films are intelligent. they engage the mind. they all create an emotional response, but each does it in a different way. these are things that AI does. if you want to see a shoot 'em up, or a movie that was written with 8 year old children in mind, then go rent Armageddon again (though if you like that drivel you probably won't have to rent it since you probably own it). if you want to see good cinema then see AI.people also makes statements about how spielberg ruined Kubrick's idea. Kubrick spent a lot of time discussing the film with spielberg because KUBRICK WANTED SPIELBERG TO MAKE THE FILM. Kubrick thought that the idea of this movie was right up spielberg's alley. if you don't know what you are talking about then shut up. or at least don't blurt out an incorrect, but popular, viewpoint about who was responsible for this film and what Kubrick wanted.AI gets a 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of 2001?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoilers within!** A.I is about a family, whose son is in a deep coma, and he has been for five years. They realize that they will probably ever see him again, and the father buys a robotic ("Mecha's they are called) boy, who is a test product, and supposedly can show love towards his mother and father, unlike any other Mecha. The mother doesn't like the idea, but after a while she starts to like boy, and starts to get mother feeling for him. However, the son who is in a coma eventually wakes up and is brought back home, to his loving parents. David (the loving mecha boy) starts to grow jealousy towards the boy, whom the parents love so much, and he is prepared to do anything to make the parents love him as much as the other boy (Martin). However he always fails, and hurts someone in one way or another. And finally the parents decide to trash him. The mother drives him to the factory, where he was created, but when they are almost there she leaves David in the forest instead. Eventually he meets another Mecha, Gigolo Joe (Jude Law, outstanding in this movie) and together they try to find a way for David to become a real boy, so that his parents can love him.I had read many bad reviews on this movie, and when my friend told me that he had seen it, and that he thought it was boring as heck, I didn't really know if I wanted to watch it or not. But I did. And maybe it is just my love for science-fiction films, or maybe this movie is truly terrific, because I loved each and every second of it. The actors (especially Jude Law) where amazing at what they did, and Spielberg had certainly created a realistic science-fiction movie.The special effects and CGI couldn't have been better. It was all great, and the plot had me glued to the television through-out. A very good movie indeed. I can't believe that anyone could not like this movie, since it is so entangling (like most Spielberg films) it is almost unbelievable! This drama is up there with American History X and Men of Honor (and many other great dramas). Something I really loved, tho, was the ending! It was happy and sad at the same time. It was twisted, wierd and something that has definetly NOT been done before!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For You Stanley!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late Director Stanley Kubrick utilized his grandiose intelligence in making some of the most peerless films of all time. Before his death, Kubrick started working on a film project about a robotic boy in the distant future, and his restless pursuit to become human. The film's `Pinocchio'-theme story was very intriguing and sophisticated; and that is no lie. If this project were to be completed, it had to be executed by another genius director that lacked artificial intelligence and had `close encounters' with this type of genre in the past. For that reason, I am glad that Director Steven Spielberg put this movie in `Spielberg's List' and decided to direct it. Spielberg's mystical futuristic direction style in `A.I.' receives an `A 1 A' grade in my book. The unconventional look of the film is just worth the price of admission. Haley Joel Osment, who stars as the robo-boy , executed a highly-skilled performance. His character's facial characteristics were of assiduous efforts. Haley's character did not blink throughout the entire film and kept his `eyes wide open'. I am sure the great stanley would have been very proud of his performance. Jude Law was very articulate as the mecha `Gigolo Joe' ( cool name!!!!!!!!!!!! ) . The only cinematic `law' that I think Spielberg broke was that he should have inserted Jude as Gigolo Joe into more scenes. Hey Jude! You are on your way in becoming one of the best young british actors today. Spielberg dedicated the film to Stanley Kubrick, and we thank the `amistad' they had together in bringing us `A.I.'. **** Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good attempt at creating a believable character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film ?Bicentennial Man' tried to tackle the aspect of ?artificial intelligence' in robots but after some way into the film it became somewhat unconvincing. This latest offering by Spielberg does a much better job of creating a believable story while at the same time showing the true complexity of this much talked about issue. Spielberg convincingly adds human traits to the artificially created boy ?David' who is taken on and adopted by a family. The irrational behavior ingrained in David is made apparent when he is sitting on the dinner table and forces down food in his body. Ironically, it is the human part in David that becomes the biggest problem for the family to handle. Mother Monica played by Frances O'Connor (II) reluctantly disbands David and so begins David's journey to win back his mothers love by chasing a fairy tale she had once read to him. When David learns that he is not unique, we see a fitting display of human emotions and tantrums by a frustrated boy who refuses to believe that his hopes and dreams were to no avail. The last segment of the film may appear disconnected with the rest of the story, but I believe it raises some interesting questions. How is David's fulfillment of his dreams any different from ours?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is based on the novel "Super toys lasts all summer long". You can really feel that Spielberg got hooked on the novel. Why? He actually cites the novel when the media (picture sound) can not bear the message. New thinking soaks this picture. It does not impress you in the beginning; you must follow the story through! You must agree to that story threads are cut (on purpose, actually strengthens the film) for the benefit of end of the film. This movie puts a lot of 'think stuff' in your brain. What is life actually? Minuses are the way too long story and Spiel berg's over love to FX. But he, according to the press, skipped 'Harry Potter'. Thank god!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but still a masterpiece &lt;SPOILERS&gt;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, reading these comments it drives me insane to see that no-one seemed to get the ending. Although it's not absolutely stated, those weren't aliens!!! They're mecha... the evolution of the very machines that were so persecuted by the orga! And the final outcome of the mecha/orga battle? The Earth froze and orga died, leaving only the disenfranchised mecha to "evolve". There are enough hints that this is the case.On to my opinions of the movie itself; I think it's a wonderful story that's masterfully directed and fabulously acted. Oh, and did anyone else notice the "Pooh" relationship between David and Teddy? Seemed pretty blatant to me.Anyway, Jude Law (a sadly underused actor in Hollywood) is fantastic in his role as Gigolo Joe, the poor mecha sex-droid who can't stop getting in trouble.The movie's flawed; the first act is rather slow to find its footing and does give the start of the movie a somewhat schizophrenic feel. However, this beginning in retrospect also seems to echo the naievete of David in the early portion of the plot, confused and somewhat childish. By the end of the first act though it has found its footing and given us a lot of insight into the world into which David has been "born".The second act is David's pursuit of his Blue Fairy. Everyone has a blue fairy; a dream that may take forever to make come true, but that we all must pursue in order to remain human ourselves. Without dreams and goals we are nothing better than the cold mecha that we (as humans) are shown persecuting in this act.The third and final act is a beautiful climax to the story; happy enough to satisfy that the whole journey hasn't been for nothing, but ambiguous enough to leave you guessing even as the final credits roll.Throughout, the imagery is beautiful and evocative, but this is NOT a movie you just mindlessly sit in front of and watch. It's a movie that requires you to think, which I think is why it's been so universally panned; most people go to movies to take their minds out of gear for two hours. Demanding movies tend to be a hit-or-miss thing.I'll just wrap this up by pointing out that this movie now sits in my short-list of favorite movies, which is still topped by the wonderful Gattaca... which ironically also stars the fantastic Jude Law! Worth seeing just once... but be aware this movie demands a lot of the viewer! You have been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Some of this might be considered a SPOILER)After reading through a few pages of comments and seeing the same cluelessness over and over again, I had to make a comment...The beings in the final act are NOT ALIENS!!!They are the highly evolved mecha as prophesied by Gigolo Joe: "In the end, all that will be left is us". I can't believe people had so much trouble with this! All the clues were there. They even have the same body shape as the humanoid figure in the logo of the company that built David. Some of the dialog with David makes it even more obvious. And finally, if you still didn't get it, are the credits: Ben Kingsley - Narrator/Advanced Mecha Specialist (voice)------Anyway, I liked the movie overall. While it had many scientific/engineering issues, it was entertaining and minimally thought provoking. I would have liked to see some of the social and philosophical issues explored more. For example, how much did the "love" mechas contribute to the extinction of humans? Would people find it easier to have a relationship with a mecha instead of another human? They briefly touched on this theme in the movie, and the tentative answer seems to be yes.I also liked the feeling that Kubrick was there, in "spirit" at least. It's too bad we couldn't see what the master would have done with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished watching A.I. and took some time to dry my eyes before coming online to see what others had to say. And I'm shocked. Shocked that anyone could hate a movie so much yet others absolutely love it. While I certainly agree that everyone has a right to their own opinion, I think I would be frightened to know someone who could outright HATE this movie. Long....yes. Serious plot holes....sure. But an awful movie....no way. I love the fact that I was so disturbed in so many parts of the movie and that it was not an "easy" watch. Yes, it's actually a movie that is going to provoke strong emotions in people for one reason or another. I wonder if the idea of a child searching eternally for the love of a mother is maybe hitting a little too close to home for a few of the people who wrote scathing reviews of this movie. All that aside, I think it is safe to say that any movie that can inspire passion on both ends of love and hate in a viewer is surely one that will live on in a film buffs memory forever.See the movie and judge for yourself...I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AI is a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You people are crazy. I really feel like a large part of these bad reviews is because people like to feel "hip" by putting a popular director like Steven Spielburg down.This film resonates on a lot of different levels. What is it that makes us human and what makes intelligence (aka the Turing Test++), the obvious parallel between the treatment of robots and racism in society (which was so strong in parts of the movie but that I didn't see anyone here pick up on), and the idea that we can create something superior to ourselves that will become a new species, possibly even surviving our own.The film treates these themes as upfront as possible, yet still from reading these reviews the vast majority of people didn't seem to get any of it. Yes a lot of these questions were left unanswered in the movie, as they need to be for any movie of depth to work. Alot of (American moviegoers especially) are so used to being forcefed the opinions of the Director, that when a Director asks questions and leaves it up to you to decide, you get all bent out of shape.In addition, Steven Spielburg, being a master of emotional manipulation, managed to give us an emotional stake in the movie as well. Did anyone, ever feel anything emotional in 2001 A Space Odyssey? Yet this movie is looked up to as some kind of masterpiece precisely because nobody feels anything at all after seeing it. Please don't put down a director just because they're in touch with emotions, they're what make us human and great.</fullReview>

A I says a lot about the world we live in with it's throw away values, a person or an animal is only good until we tire of it then we dump it somewhere without thought or feeling, David is a mech boy played wonderfully by Haley Joel Osment who is adopted by a family and cared for and loved until he is not wanted anymore then dumped in the woods along with his supertoy bear Teddy who has the same voice patterns as Hal in 2001, David thinks if he can find the blue fairy he can be turned into a real boy and go back home but his journey only leads to sadness. The cast of A I is average except for Jude Law as Gigolo Joe, a love bot who cant seem to stay out of trouble. The good parts of A I are very good and will make you think about things around you, also the music is wonderful. A I drags in parts and the movie could have been cut by an hour, also the ending is confusing. A I is an 8 out of 10 and belongs with movies like 2001 and blade runner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I.: an utter masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of you may call me crazy for using such a strong word as "masterpiece" to describe Spielberg's film A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, and others may think that "masterpiece" is not a strong enough word to explain how amazing this movie truly is. Either way, A.I. is incredible. Loosely based on the short story Supertoys Last All Summer Long, A.I. catapults you into a futuristic world with a spine-tingling prologue and an overview of the melted icecaps. It then kicks off its story immediately, moving at a fast and even pace with astounding visual effects and beautiful music by the master of movie soundtracks, John Williams. The plot is simple yet full of numerous philosophical and moral issues, which are not debated openly but instead left for you to examine on your own. I suppose I should have stated this earlier, but since I didn't, I'll say it now: THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN! Haley Joel Osment's presence among the cast should not convince a pre-teen girl to go see A.I. for that sole reason. This is a movie made specifically for adults and sci-fi lovers, despite the fact that it has a PG-13 rating. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, allow me to continue. Since I already mentioned Haley Joel Osment, I suppose I should describe just how incredible his acting is: if you were blown away by the talent he showed in The Sixth Sense, you will be even more surprised by his jaw-dropping performance as the mecha child David. It is simply remarkable to watch how he becomes more and more human throughout the film, never falling out of character (or even blinking, for that matter). And let's not forget Jude Law's minor yet perfect performance as Gigolo Joe, a mecha who (as the title implies) sells his body to women. If you have not already noticed, A.I. has a very dark theme: if a robot were programmed to love a human, would that human love him back? I will not give away the answer or any of the events that take place in A.I., because if I did, Spielberg would be after me with a machine gun and a firing squad. What I CAN say, though, is that I think there are only two sci-fi films that have ever tackled this subject without a flaw: the first is Blade Runner, and the other is A.I. I know that many people despised Artificial Intelligence, but I believe that it -- like Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' -- will gain greater appreciation as time progresses. Whether you regard it as a masterpiece or a total flop, A.I. is definitely worth a watch.Overall rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of the reviews I've seen, both here and elsewhere, carp on about the central character of the story - David - not being emotionally engaging. "How can we feel emotion for it? It's a robot!"Hmm...to misquote Churchill: "Never, in the history of human cinema, has a point been missed by quite so much, by so many".The whole point of the film was that David *did* feel emotion - genuine emotion - for his mother. Genuine emotion, you say? Rubbish! He was programmed that way.Hmm..yes. As are we. *That* is the point. We are organic machines, comprised of cells and tissues and fluids, that process information and come out with emotion. David was a mechanical machine, with wires and electrodes and processors, that process information and come out with emotion.What's the difference? That is the question asked by the film. If you were asked to *prove* your emotions for your mother were real, could you? How then, can one insist David's emotions were simply "programmed", any more than ours are "programmed" by evolution and our neural network?Seems to me an awfully humanocentric viewpoint is being flung about; one kind of similar, in principle, to the bloodthirsty (fluid-thirsty?) mob in the film who were cheering as the droids were torn to pieces, burned and dissolved by acid.I think we need to have a long, hard look at ourselves if we find it so frightening to accept that something *different* to us could maybe, just maybe, feel the same.I give A.I. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something that moves me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not very interested in this movie when it hit the theaters. I only rented the DVD because of a lack of choice in the local video shop near my house in Japan. I though,"Ya, this should be ok, I guess." To my surprise, I have not been moved by a movie in a long time, until I saw this one. It was the main character, David, that got me to tears at the end. I am not going to spoil it, but for anyone who has had a lifelong dream for their child come to reality, then you will want to see this. This is a power movie! David really comes into being as the movie progresses and has a singular desire. Through adventure and adversity, he finally achieves his goal. That is where the "water-works" began for me, and as a 35 year old man, I am not afraid to say it. The story is presented very well, and the acting is excellent. Jude Law, William Hurt, but great. David, played by Haley Joel Osment was, as in The Sixth Sence, excellent and carries the lead very competently! Not many young actors can do what he does. It is really the progression of the story that should keep you watching, and following the development of David and he never-ending determination. We can learn from this characteristic. All in all, a movie that will leave you with something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart Wrenching, Soul Searching of our Moral depths.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing how people see Kubrick as black and Spielberg as white, Kubrick as dark and Spielberg as light, two ends of the spectrum of movie making. I disagree, I believe that both these men are highly intelligent and are telling the same story using the different ends to achieve the same result - to get people to listen.People who make movies have stories to share with the rest of us who queue up to hear them because of our quest for greater truths. This is a story that needs to be told again and again until people have learnt to apply the lessons.I am not an authority on Stanley Kubrick and it is not my intention to come across as one but for me his movies have always made a statement - and I feel not one that I had to agree with or disagree with, rather one that I am to apply to my life and then examine the emotional responses that are raised. Personally I didn't agree with Dr Bowman's manipulation of Hal in `2001' or Dr. Harford in his exploration into the forbidden bounds of marriage in `Eyes Wide Shut' but they all raised questions which made me assess my own depths. 'AI' again raises Kubrick's original statement; `We are not alone in the Universe and we belong to Someone Greater than ourselves...." Is it at all surprising that he has to state this again in 2001 when we just didn't get it in 1968? Life is our responsibility. Ours.I believe that Kubrick realised the sensitivity that was needed to tell this story and quite rightly choose Steven Spielberg for his unique touch of enduring love storytelling.Life is an equation that ends with `Love never fails' and starts with 'To Love' is to 'Be Loved'. The fortunate among us are loved first from birth however most, as in David's case, love first and forever search to be loved. David, the machine was programmed to love unconditionally but we as human have the capacity to learn to hate. Man or Machine, we who are here first have a responsibility to those who follow.There are millions of children in this world that live each day searching for a glimmer of love, of acceptance, someone who believes in them. Some are happy just to settle for a smile, kind word or gentle touch. And the scary part, is that they will accept this from anyone.Of all the crimes and inhumanity that humans are capable of doing to one another, the greatest crime, I believe, is to ignore their very existence. Non-acceptance in young children 'grow' disturbed teens that result in atrocious consequences, many which cannot be undone. America has only to look at their schools and the foreign response on Sept 11. Ireland, Palestine, Israel, too many countries in the Middle East and Africa, these have only to look at the dead eyes of living children carrying weapons to realise that this world is in dire need of love, acceptance, and self-belief.I personally thank Mr Aldiss, Mr Watson, Mr Kubrick, Mr Spielberg and all the cast and crew of 'AI ' who through this 'telling of the story' and the magic of their special talents have re-awakened the admission that in order to 'grow' a better society, a better world we first need to love and accept our children, taking the responsibility of having them more seriously and accepting the role of sacrifice for a greater cause, the child's own self worth. yes, Love never fails! We should sit up and listen this time.</fullReview>

The locations, dialogue, charactors were all in Kubrick style, especially the flow of the story. What an adventure! The whole ending nearly brought me to tears. This film will become a classic.Thank you Steven for putting your heart into this one, it really shows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's almost like it was directed by Kubrick's son. Sure it wasn't a Kubrick film, but it had similar themes and pacing as some of his movies. Spielberg is too much of a director in his own right to make A.I. the way Kubrick envisioned it. That being said I thought this film was fantastic. Osment and Law were wonderful in their roles, Law in particular showing a lot of believability to his robotic performance. The premise is nothing new, but the state of the world in the future is terrifying. A world where many cities are now drowned and robots are built to perform tasks only to be discarded later. That is what is so heart-breaking about this movie. A robot programmed to love a woman as a mother is then rejected by her. He then spends the rest of his life wanting to be a real boy so she will love him. The final thirty minutes of this film had me in tears. It was a dark, depressing film at times, but ultimately, it was a happy ending.Well done to the human touches given to the robots. Robin Williams' voice for Dr Know, Chris Rock's brief comedy robot and of course, Jack Angel's wonderful voice for Teddy. You forgot that Teddy was just a teddy bear. Take that Wilson! This isn't for everybody and it certainly isn't for every Kubrick fan. Try not to have any pre-conceived notions of what you're in store for. It is incredible how human this story really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far one of the best movies on the market today, it's to bad the advertising didn't bring in the money at the theaters. A mistake thats happened with lots of great movies.This movie is to-well acted(not a bad thing), to the fact that I was actually crying at some parts, which is something I don't do very often, for anything.I have not found a thing wrong with this movie, this movie is an emotional rollercoaster. Speilberg did an excellent job of taking over the story. I've heard this film regarded to as 'Un-intelligent' this is completely false. For those who missed the main moral message in the story, it is that human's have no right to make life. The boy in the film is emotional, and feels the sting of society. And yet the world seems to approve of creating life, by Cloning, and creating AI.For those who didn't feel something while watching this film, something wrong, your 'emotionaly constipated'. How can you not feel the emotions played by Haley Joel Osmet, and not feel symathy for his character.The ending was perfect, it left us in a state to reconsider our own lives, or at least that's what I felt. If anything it promotes peace, and the need to stop playing 'GOD'.If you haven't seen it yet, go buy it, and when your done you'll sit in your chair silent.The ACADEMY should have awarded more to this film, Haley Joel Osmet should have took Denzel's Oscar home (at least they didn't give any oscars to Peter Jackson for his slaugher of the LOTR Screenplay), The acting was phenomonal, as stated above.10.9/10Go...

		<shortDescription>A.I.: Artificial Intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This review contains spoilers)The new Steven Spielberg film and pet project of the late Stanley Kubrick based on the 1969 short story Super-Toys Last All Summer Long, has finally come out in theatres. Two master filmmakers (on two different sides of the coin) on one project. This one had to be of epic proportions.Well I was extremely impressed to say the least. A.I. Artificial Intelligence was even better than what I expected. From start to finish, I was in awe of its sheer beauty and human emotions expressed through the non-human character of David. A.I. is mainly a futuristic twist on the Pinocchio story. The story follows a small robot-boy named David (Haley Joel Osment) who has been programmed to love his family and fill in for their hospitalized child.David's mommy (Frances O'Connor), one day starts to read the story of Pinocchio to David. David becomes very intrigued with this story and builds the idea that if he finds his `Blue Fairy', he will become a real boy and his mommy will love him forever as her own. David soon becomes cut off from his family's love, due to some misunderstood and so-called attacks towards his family members. His mommy then drives out to a secluded forest to abandon David only due to his recent attacks on their family. While David is lost and homesick, he meets an outgoing robotic man whose gift is to pleasure women, named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) who reminded me a lot of a non-psychotic Alex DeLarge from A Clockwork Orange; while David in the beginning of the film reminded me a lot of E.T. David and Joe (and a super-cool Teddy Bear named Teddy) begin an unforgettable quest to find David's `Blue Fairy' so he can come back home to live with his mommy. This film, being created by Steven Spielberg, won't have your typical apocalyptic, sinister, and twisted Kubrick finale. But since it is partially Kubrick's film, it won't have a too soft, warm, and sentimental Spielberg finale. It's in a way `cut even'. In the end David does find his `Blue Fairy' and does become a real boy; and he does get to see his mommy? but only for one day after two thousand years of searching for his `Blue Fairy' and mommy. The way this ending coincides with both a Kubrick and Spielberg finale is that David does get to become a real boy (Spielberg stylized finale) but eventually he must die (Kubrick stylized finale); and he does get to spend a whole day with his mommy (Spielberg stylized finale) but once the day is done she will never wake up and the film ends on that exact note (Kubrick stylized finale). So in a way the ending is too dark to be a Spielberg ending, but too tender to be a Kubrick film. But the ending does leave you like any other Kubrick film: Thought-provoked and almost chilled. A.I. is an extraordinary film that ventures into the human soul, and what us humans would do under these difficult circumstances, even though the film is about a robot. A.I. also touches on things that all people have gone through at least once like loneliness, abandonment, and the frustrations of life. A.I. is brilliant in the way that it pays homage to Fleming's The Wizard of Oz, Lucas' Star Wars franchise and Kubrick's sci-fi classics as 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange, as well as Spielberg's own E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Empire of the Sun and even Jurassic Park. The visuals in A.I. are absolutely stunning. Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) has done it again with their `out-of-this-world' computer effects. ILM has worked on such mega-success computer-imaged films such as Jurassic Park, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Titanic, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Dennis Muren's visual effects and Stan Winston's special robot makeup effects and animatronic design and effects are truly unbelievable. Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense, Play it Forward) delivers another brilliant and Oscar worthy performance as the robot-boy who is programmed to love his family. In A.I., Osment does not blink once throughout the film to give his character a more inhuman trait. Osment's partner in A.I., Jude Law (The Talented Mr. Ripley, Enemy at the Gates) performed a fantastic witty portrayal as Gigolo Joe. A.I. is a captivating, spellbinding, and prophetic sci-fi fantasy that will make you laugh, cry, think, and entertain. This is most definitely one of the best (if not the best) movie(s) so far in the year 2001. Kubrick should be proud****1/2 out of ***** 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awe-inspiring: Pinocchio meets E.T.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't catch A.I. in the movies, because I was foolish enough to listen to friends and certain critics, who complained about the schizophrenic nature of the movie thematics and expressed disappointment over what I imagined was an over-hyped picture.I bought the DVD and found the film mesmerizing. This film is nothing short of awe-inspiring and brilliant. It is not a perfect film but it's audaciousness and vision makes up for the fact that we never quite seem to see various subplots come to satisfying fruition. Characters are introduced that we are made to care about and then just disappear from the story altogether. Ultimately, everything makes sense.Most importantly, the core truth of the tale (the Pinocchio story) remains and how the director ultimately pulled off that feat was just so impressive. I was literally in tears, matching Haley Joel Osment, streak for streak.Exquisite and provocative, this film is a must for those who truly love the craft of film, especially films that encourage a break from the traditional story-telling mode.I can't wait to see it again and the double DVD is just an embarrassment of riches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>food for thought; spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cover of the Dutch video* contains a newspaper quote: "Spielberg's best since E.T." That's funny because on my way to the video store I thought about the sad fact that a lot of artists are on a downward spiral, delivering work that, at the very best, isn't up to a par with their works from years ago. Writer Stephen King comes to mind, but also directors like John Carpenter, George Romero, David Lynch, William Friedkin, the late Stanley Kubrick, and Steven Spielberg are guys whose recent work seems to suffer from a lack of originality, magic, and creativity. I totally agree with the "Spielberg's best since E.T." quote. In the seventies and early eighties he delivered one masterpiece after another (with 1941 as the odd man out). After E.T., Spielberg had many failures (Twilight Zone; Empire of the Sun; Always; Hook; Amazing Stories; o, and -giggle- don't forget his underwater fastfood joint) and, as of now, his heart, enthusiasm, and real creativity seems to be exclusively reserved for serious work like Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. And, as goes for nearly every director I listed above, his style has changed throughout the years. After E.T., Spielberg lost much of his subtlety and stylistic perfection, often indulging in wooden, sophomoric, theatrical jokes with the camera and wooden, theatrical actor's directing. The first thing that I noticed in A.I., was Spielberg's return to extensive use of backlighting, his first time since, yes, E.T. And for the first time since E.T., I felt that Spielberg had put his heart in a 'popcorn' film.As far as the story's concerned, I guess everybody knows it's about an artificial boy's search for love. I guess everybody knows that Stanley Kubrick was in love with this story for many years and I guess that everybody was just as shocked when Kubrick approached his good friend (?!!) Steven Spielberg to direct this movie. Intellectual, thought provoking R-rated Kubrick gives a story premise to international sentimental teddy bear Steven "PG" Spielberg?! The end result of this strange marriage probably isn't the heavy shite Kubrick once envisioned, but Spielberg delivered a PG-13 story which is much, much darker than his usual family fair. I believe the director put his heart in this one. And I enjoyed the acting by Jude Law and Joel Haley Osmont. And, being someone who still toys around with an ancient NES (1985 Nintendo entertainment system), I was extremely impressed (and intimidated) by the fantastic quality of the special effects. 24 year old grandpa Marc "it's not the age, honey, it's the mileage" Hendriks scratches his balding head and says: "Gee, what will they think of next?"O, and the film conjures up many topics for an old fashioned heated discussion:Why is Martin 'replaced' by David in the first place? Martin's absence should leave an empty space that can't be replaced by an artificial boy. Wouldn't it just emphasize the sorrow (and Martin isn't even dead, but in a coma!). And no, I really don't consider this to be the same thing as when a widow or a widower meets and falls in love with a person after his or hers better half's departure. Like momma Monica says herself: Martin ain't a dead Kitty that can easily be replaced.When is someone "real"? WHAT makes someone "real"? (quote from "Knightriders": "It has got to do with the SOUL, man!") On a short trip to the united states I met as many great people as calculated, insincere, smiling phonies who came across as less human and more robotic than the two leading mecha's in this film.Are lawyers "real"? If someone or something is capable of experiencing pain (as some Mecha's in this story are), than why would we want to hurt it?Is David's love a choice? Unconditional Love for his mother is just a program, an assignment even, something you can switch on, it has nothing to do with loving his mother for who or what she is. Read the words (or magic spell) from the manual (finally, a kid that comes with one!) and he'll love you until the day you die, guaranteed! In fact, it makes David sort of a Stockholm syndrome sufferer -- kick him, slap him around, or leave him behind in the woods.he'll love you no matter what, he'll need you no matter what.In the end, David seems perfectly happy with a superficial clone of his mother's. And she is also the only person who he loves as Henry, Martin, and even Gigolo Joe don't mean anything to him. And David does not want what's best for his mother; he just wants her to be there for him, so he can love her. That's why he agrees to have her cloned. And don't forget, David himself was created by and for lonely people. In this film, love is an ACT of egoism.What is mercy? Destroying an unconditional loving, everlasting machine or leaving it behind in the woods?Is love possible without its counterpart Hate? We do see David aggressively destroying a competitor.Does a Mecha count as an individual? An individual with a PERSONALITY? What to think of the warehouse full of little David's? If the prototype would have been a success, would the streets have been full of the same, identical boys? What would make them different from each other? Their experiences (again, WHAT makes one "real?")? David destroys another David at a certain point. Isn't that just as sad or bad as when 'our' David would have been destroyed?Okay, and what about the theological aspects of this movie.?So, to me, the ending (which, mind you, WAS a part of Kubrick's original treatment) isn't a Spielbergian cop-out or a Spielbergian Deus Ex Machina for that matter; it's just more food for thought.***1/2 out of ***** forgive me, father, for I have sinned; as of this writing, I still have not purchased a DVD player to enjoy a next-best-thing cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the movie. Some critics said that the audience could not possibly be interested for the child because it is after all a machine. I do not agree. The premise of the movie is that technology has progressed to a point where brains with emotions, desires, and logic can be created and drive perfect mechanical bodies. These creatures are humans in every sence, except for the fact that they are made of mechanical parts as opposed to organic parts. This is where the wisdom of the movie lies. Man creates Man in his own image. Can Man sustain mechanical life and respect his own creation?Spielberg hints on an answer when showing the "flesh-fair" circus scenes. The way the bodies of the "mechas" were exterminated reminded me of the concentration camp scenes in "Schindler's list". Very powerful scenes. Great Spielberg moments. The ending was very moving also. It reminded me of the "Little Prince", the famous novel by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. Yes, the idea that the boy survives for thousands of years seams over the top, but this happens so that the boy can live one happy day with his mother again.One final remark. I think that Spielberg made a very good movie. I only wonder how the movie would have looked like if directed by Stanley Kubrick. Steven is great but Stanley was the master.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very touching story about a robot programmed to have feelings, that is on a journey to become a real boy.Excellent performances by all actors and an exceptional job by Steven Spielberg. This is basically a Stanley Kubrick story and there are moments throughout the movie that this is evident. Unfortunately, Spielberg's interpretation is less artistic than a Kubrick movie, but still he didn't let his ego alter the fact that 'A.I.' is a Stanley Kubrick tribute. No one seems to have noticed the chilling reference to '2001', which was Teddy! The calm computer voice that talks to David, is very reminiscent of HAL's voice as he addressed to David Bowman.'A.I.' could easily be ruined by visual effects, if it wasn't for Spielberg. The only director who has the power to create believable visuals in movies, only because he uses CGI when absolutely necessary. A great deal of miniatures and real robots by Stan Winston are employed, creating probably the best visual effects ever appeared in a movie. ILM's contribution is where physical additions stop and a touch of magic has to be added.Finally, John Williams created one of his beast and longest scores for years. The final piano piece is truly magical.As Steven Spielberg said, I would prefer it if 'A.I' was told by Stanley Kubrick. But at least someone was there to present Kubrick's final vision and that someone was Steven Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Softies At Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late Stanley Kubrick's coda to a profound film career essentially reiterates the conclusions about love that he examined in his final film `Eyes Wide Shut' and by allowing Steven Spielberg to direct here he receives the reassurances that a family man like Spielberg can provide. As dour as his worldview is, Kubrick has become a softie at heart but he wants it both ways: you should be happy to be alive and you should welcome death as relief as well; Spielberg, with his idealizations of suburban life intermingling with his fantasy escapes into the void, is a perfect foil for this kind of contradictory viewpoint. But the coldness that was the basis for Kubrick's direction is anathema to Spielberg and the humanity he tries to infuse makes the whole thing rather discomfiting. Fortunately, the one-note Haley Joel Osment, playing a robot with the capacity to love searching for the mother who has abandoned him, keeps the proceedings from getting too emotionally taxing, unintentionally allowing you to keep the necessary distance. Spielberg's usual elegant filmmaking is very much in evidence and the film's pacing belies its 145 minute running time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie boils down to a very simple fact. We need a love in our lives as innocent as a child's love for a mother. This love carries us through life and is the center to which all our being is attached. Everything that we do and feel is connected to this center. Harsh things happen, even horrible ones that shouldn't happen at all. But, we endure and then the end is in sight. Was the trip worth it? Will our Blue Angels be there for us at the end? We all carry a "David" in our hearts and souls. The team that put together, "Artificial Intelligence", must have been very unique. Each piece of the story, words and visions, were carefully orchestrated to form a symphony of life. A life as real as any before it, or yet to be. This is a deep thinking movie that appeals to all of us and each part of us. From the unconcious to conscious this movie will be a part of us for many years to come. I think that this is Spielberg's greatest movie yet! Kubrick would be proud!</fullReview>

Something I've never seen before was a movie adapted from two separate stories but blend seemlessly. The effects and performances (especially Osmont) were top of the line. For the avid film buff, science fiction fan, or someone craving something different amidst the horrible commercial releases of today. Finally, some integrity. It's a shame that the Spielberg/Kubrick collaboration hasn't occured years earlier. Imagine all the potential for amazing films. Now let's see Spielberg join with Darren Aronofsky and make a movie!

		<fullReview>Well, as you can clearly see if you scroll down through the reviews, everybody seems to be divided about this one. So it's either a fantastic movie or a failure. I actually enjoyed the movie, and especially the great acting by all actors, especially Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law. Some speak about major flaws in the plot, but to me, they aren't that disturbing. Some say that this movie has absolutely no message. They are correct. Spielberg asks some very interesting questions, but he doesn't provide us with the answers. It's up to you to decide what to think about the whole thing.My advice is: give the movie a chance, it's not as bad as some people say. At least the great acting and fantastic effects save a lot of the movie, even if the plot is vague and confusing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies all time. Spielberg at last made his masterpiece and showed the rest of the world that he can match Kubricks work.Kubrick has been helping Spielberg a lot with this collaboration. You can see it everywhere and Spielberg kept it in his style which resulted in a great movie dealing with ethics and moral issues along the way. The attention to detail is magnificent and the actors played the roles of their lives and showed of their skill.Many people think the 3rd part of the movie has too much of Spielbergs touches. However the in the last part lies the strength of the movie and really shows that people misjudge Spielberg too much. The movie is full of layers like Kubricks work and that makes it great. you can see and see and see the movie without seeing something new or think different about something.This movie isn't the blockbuster people think to get from Spielberg but you will be treated with a great movie which will make you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strangely heterogeneous movie about serious moral issues that will be disputed in centuries to come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who felt an inexplicable, bizarre sympathy for HAL in 2001 and contemplated about many moral issues in the wake of the recent meteoric developments in science and technology, AI had been awaited with great anticipation.AI is concerned with hot philosophical and moral questions that we are unavoidably facing in the (near) future: Is man prepared to accept the role of a God and embrace his own creation? Judging from the movie, apparently not. And how can we expect anything else? Humans are finding hard to accept humans of different social, racial or ethnical origin. There is no way on Earth that we are ready for intelligent machines. It is a scary thought since a self-learning, self-thinking and self-acting machine is at hand (50, 100 or 200 years, does it really matter?). We are creating machines because we want to make our lives easier and more enjoyable. There will be a point in the future where we will have to ask machine-slaves if they want to do something else with their lives.Someone may argue that a machine is created and "programmed" by man, so it cannot do anything we don't want it to do. David is certainly conceived so, but he is the first generation of robots who is deliberately "programmed" to stray from his algorithm to mimic a human more closely (or is he the first generation? - a question imposed at the flesh fair). But how can we tell him from a regular boy? Are his feelings, emotions, and spontaneousness genuine? It certainly looks that way. Aren't we all in some way "programmed" by our DNA? Very soon we will be able to literally program the DNA of a human to give it a certain disposition, endow it with a talent, or even to prolong his/her life. Then why a difference with the machines? Is the reason so superficial that we more readily accept something physically resembling us? (A flesh fair crowd, stunned at the David's resemblance to a normal boy, disbelieves that he is a robot at all)Even though I can't provide answers to all these questions, I know that I am willing to accept anyone or anything that responds to human emotions as a living, sensible creature (sometimes even bad actors). As to whether the things I see are real or not, sometimes I cannot say.It is because of these serious issues the film deals with that I find it intriguing and very relevant. The plot of the movie, however, is strangely chopped into Kubrick and Spielberg sequences that somehow do not appear to go together well. It looks like an interesting exercise, though, and the incompatibility of the legendary directors certainly contributes to its uniqueness. With the excellent acting and the compelling topic it is good enough to feed my thoughts until the next attempt.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Artificial Intelligence--I thought it was a good concept for a movie at first but this movie just dragged on. It was putting me to sleep. It was very disjointed and a lot of what happened in the movie had no background. There was no "character development" for any of the characters other than David. Strange new scenes would come into the story unexpectedly. You had to figure out why something was happening and use your imagination to figure out what led up to that. There would be an ending, but then it wasn't really the end. Something else would happen after that. At this point it seemed like the basic plot was irrelevant; it didn't matter anymore. Then another "ending" but no, there was still more. The movie was not entertaining, interesting or worth while.</fullReview>

A sentimental and sweet poetic odyssey for all ages, A.I. was packaged and sold as ordinary sci-fi fodder and never reached the audience it deserved. Finding strengths in all our human emotions, feeling pride in fulfilling our human endeavors, and living with a genuine sense of amazement to the world we live in is what this film will share with those apt to seek it out.As one could view and analyze a work like this for all it is and all it isn't, A.I. reminds us that the medium of motion picture should be, at its best, an adventure beyond our wildest expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was an experiment, it failed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big Kubrick fan, and after the disapointment of seeing "Eyes Wide Shut" seeing this was like rubbing salt in an open wound. No wonder it took so long to develop this story, it's ridiculous. You can't really blame Kubrick or Speilberg as I don't believe anyone could have done anything with this material. It seemed like they were trying to do "Pinnochio meets "2001: A Space Odyssey" and the results just didn't work at all. Kubrick always had stated that his goal was to not only make interesting movies with provoking ideas but he also had said that he wanted to make movies that changed the entire basic structure of story telling. He wanted to evolve film to a new level that would be well beyond the endless cliches that movies have degenerated into. I believe it is possible to do that, and it's a noble effort, but this film, being an experiment in that, was a failure.  The film has a very good idea, and it's fairly good for the first 1 hr and 15 mins but upon visiting Dr. Know everything seems to fizzle really quick. Everyone else has pointed out the obvious flaws already so there is no point in rehashing. The FXs were excellent and it had great art direction and photography so at least much of it was watchable. Advise to everyone regarding Stanley Kubrick, 1955 thru 1980 was his prime, stay away from his works in other years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Steven Spielberg masterpiece....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had really high hopes for Artificial Intelligence and I'm glad to say that it delivered with all the movie magic you expect from a collaboration between two giants of the film making world. As a testimate to the film power, it kept me up half the night thinking about it, and even now, several days on, I still find myself playing certain scenes over and over in my head. Of course, AI is a very moving film, but it's also just as disturbing in some places - a characteristic that is shared by many of Spielberg's latest films (i.e. Schlinder's List, Saving Private Ryan). It's not surprising this film didn't generate too much excitement at the box office, AI is an intelligent, cerebral film, and definitely not one for the mindless masses.Under the mastery direction of Steven Spielberg, Haley Joel Osment was allowed to show off his acting skills - Jude Law too - but it's the special effects that has to take center stage in this film. Not taking anything away from Lord of the Rings, but AI should have won the best visual effects Oscar. Everything was just so real. The imagination(s) behind this film is truly awesome.It also occurred to me that AI would be the last film ever to feature Stanley Kubricks name among the titles. That's a very sad thought for a fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie NOT for kids, but more for movie fans who have a brain and an imagination. Probably half the people bashing this movie were people who think The Fast and the Furious is an instant classic, people who think that explosions and testosterone B.S. make good movies. Another chunk of people probably bash this movie because they have some gripe against Spielberg. Others are just anal Kubrick fans. And the rest of them are the morons who took their kids to see this and didn't look at the PG-13 rating and are now afraid that their kid is corrupt due to their own ignorance. Now as far as the movie:A.I. is a beautiful movie based soley on the eye candy that is presented. It has wonderful design and effects and a general fantasy feel to it. The story is very dark (until the end) and it reeks of Kubrick. It looks like a Spielberg film, big and imaginative, and has all the abstract and dark undertones that inhabit a Kubrick film. But that is what makes this film so great, it is a discussion flick. It raises many questions like what is love? can a man made object love? is throwing away a cyber kid like getting rid of an old computer, or a horrible act?My major gripe with the film is that the aliens (yes, there are aliens in this movie) seem to be lacking the polish of the rest of the film, they look like computer effects. The only other thing I didn't like about the film was the fleshfare, maybe because the idea of human-like objects being brutally destroyed while humans cheer it on seems very, very, disturbing.Anyway go into this film unbiased, with your imagination on, and the kids in bed, and have someone else there to discuss the film with after it is done. I don't think you will be disappointed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True to Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My hats off to Steven Spielberg for seeing Stanley Kubrick's vision, lending his own interpretations to the story and visuals, and for keeping the Kubrick signature on the movie. I especially point to the pacing (slow, methodical) and the tone (dreamlike, aloof). Spielberg in the DVD add-ons acknowledges Kubrick's concept of "mood jerking" where you startle the viewer with drastic shifts in imagery and environment. The sterile, muted home life in Act 1 to the loud, raucous Flesh Fair in Act 2 to the quiet, cold future two millennia removed.In the DVD special features, I was disappointed that there was no recognition of HAL from "2001: A Space Odyssey" in the flat, sagely tone of Jack Angel doing the voice of Teddy.I will forever consider "A.I." both as a Kubrick work and as a Spielberg work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains spoilers.I recently saw A.I. on DVD.I normally hate Spielberg films, as they are all bland and simplistic, but the first 30 minutes of this film I thought was excellent, well made, some depth and realistic dialog. Unfortunately from there on the film never really gets going.There's a number of problems with the film, it's too long, I've nothing against long films in general, just films that seem to be long without anything happening. The main characters being robots and incredibly dumb, I couldn't have any real sympathy for them. As others had pointed out, strangely the most intelligent robot was ?Teddy'. The story didn't really go anywhere and I'm still not exactly sure what the message of the film was. The strange ?flesh fair', seemed bizarre, why go to all that trouble and expense just to destroy robots, surely people aren't that bothered in watching robots meet their demise. I'm sure VR would have been pretty sophisticated by that time and I also would have hoped that the human intellect would have progressed slightly.Surely all the robots would have had a device to control or at least find them, when necessary, how David, got lost exactly is a bit strange. The strangest scene, for me, was when David arrived in NY and found his creator. The creator then announces he's off to get the other scientists, yet disappears. He is aware that David is special and effectively emotional, yet leaves him in a room full of identical robots. No attempt is then ever made to find David or the Helicopter, again bizarre, as it was hardly the Titanic. Then onto the end, what was this ridiculous idea that humans could only live again for one day. I'm sure if they could create a human being, it could function for a normal lifetime, even if it didn't have the same memories and experiences of the original character, so why not let the relationship develop again.The film certainly has some positives, the camera work, acting and special effect, were all, excellent and it's nice to see someone at least trying to make a profound sci-fi film. It's just unfortunately the plot wasn't really there and I don't think Spielberg has the ability to handle a project of such depth and grandiose.It just a shame we never got to see the Kubrick version.</fullReview>

The contradictions (pathos at the robot as victim, revulsion at the robot as murderer when he attacks his own likeness) make you think a bit - again, I'm not quite sure what you are supposed to think.Anyway - I liked it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a groundbreaking film. Years from now, like Bladerunner, people will be talking about it and appreciate it more. The Matrix combined Sci-Fi with action that mesmerized and engaged people with its special effects. What A.I. does is actually provide hard core sci fi issues and moral dilemmas and takes you beyond the nice packaged ending that most sci fi movies have tied up in a neat little bow. As a mother and woman, David's character was not over acted, in fact, I wish someone had warned me of the emotional impact I was to experience. This film is beautiful, disturbing, AND visionary. Some sequences are too long, but if you read into the subtext of the plot and the humanity or lack there of in the humans) it is fodder for much soul searching and discussion. With the same conundrum regarding sanction beings that a STNG episode provided, and the desire to be human as displayed in David Ducovney's X-Files episode "The Unnatural", this film is the pinnacle of what sci fi needs to aspire to.Kudos to the actors, Kubrick and Speilberg.</fullReview>

I'm sure everyone would have liked to have seen Kubrick's vision in full for this masterpiece, but in the end, all I think you can say was it would have been different, not necessarilly better or worse. The beginning of the film is one of those rare moments in cinema that is not just formulaic, but truely touching on a deep and primal level. Kubrick's superb choice of plot and dialogue is mixed with the performances that only Spielberg could have gotten out of Osment. This film has an incredible amount of heart to it, and attempting to make it more then the sum of its parts is just a travisty to a work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished watching Spielberg's Artificial Intelligence: AI. At first I hesitated to watch it because I've only read bad reviews (a habit which I need to get rid of, because doing so certainly stops me from seeing some really good movies), but I did hunker down and decide to finally see it.Certainly it was a long movie, and it isn't just for entertainment thrills. However, I love deep movies, so I'm biased. Loosely based off of Pinocchio, it's a story--a fairy tale--of a robot boy trying to become human. It has so many layers, so much subtext, it's truly compelling...The highlights of the movie, I thought, were all the subtle technological changes (the visual effects were absolutely amazing), the lifestyle we think we'll be living in the future. It seemed so accurate and well-thought-out: so real. And that's how it should be. Most futuristic movies take steps that are too far, too wacky. This movie does it in a more subtle, realistic fashion.This is a film you'll be thinking about long after you've seen it. And it deserves a little more respect.</fullReview>

That sort of comment is just insulting to such a film epic. my eyes never left the screen i was so drawn to the movie that i didn't want to miss one second. I really love all Steven Spielberg's films he adds such a shining gloss to his films that before they are made they are just great even 'The lost world'. Any way about the film. A.I to sum it up is a beautiful film. The lighting the acting the scenic views everything fills the screen and comes together like a canvas. Jude Law is absolutely brilliant i wish he was in it more you can tell he was enjoying the film whilst he was making it. His quirky little moves and actions just made me want to get up and walk and talk like him. The little kid was ok too I can't believe that all the screen he had he didn't blink once. And last but not least(i can tell i'm boring you now)the ending. I thought the ending was very fitting an touching. He new his fate and but still went ahead with it. He needed to hear the words for him to be complete. He needed to be loved by his mum. You can tell when you see a good film when you keep thinking about it afterwards just like memento did. A.I go get it, buy it, rent it or steal it just go get it now!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If ever there was a movie that divided people so much ranging from this film is utter crap to this is the best film ever, Spielberg's A.I is probably it. People say it is overlong, people say it has no meaning, people say it has an overly warm tagged on ending and then there are the people who just don't like Spielberg! To be honest there is some truth in what some people say about what is wrong with A.I. Truthfully though it boils down to what you think about the film that matters, so, what did I think of A.I? I enjoyed it for the most part, but yes this film is definitely a flawed masterpiece. A.I proves to be for 2 acts a brilliant film; Spielberg has crafted a story full of great imagery and a number of meanings. Even the third act has some moments, the Blue Fairy scene is fantastic and the film could even have gone on to the point where David is in the house and the door opens, but instead of it being the advanced android it should have been Monica, after this the film just gets strange and starts to drag a lot. Unfortunately the story has at times to many subtexts and plots and could have been simplified (again cutting the third act would have done this), the Gigolo Joe murder mysterywas not needed at all and was complete filler, joining up Joe/David could have been done much easier. The acting is simply wonderful, Jude Law gives a great performance as Gigolo Joe and Haley Joel Osmont proves The Sixth Sense wasn't a fluke, this kid can act as good as many top name adult actors, he was apparently Spielberg's one and only choice and I can see why. Teddy also gives a fine acting performance as well! The score from John Williams is perfect for the movie and the FX are nothing but breathtaking, they always compliment the story rather than dominate it. Would I suggest stopping watching the movie at the end of the second act? Maybe, definitely at the middle of the third act though, however A.I. should certainly make you think, it should certainly keep you watching and hopefully it should tell you something. If not just watch a good retelling of Pinocchio!!!</fullReview>

A.I. was so kid-friendly, and so readily huggable, I wanted to puke-up E.T. figurines. Spielberg aspired to make a film that Kubrick would have created. But instead, he repeated his own formula of pablum, in a disorganized homage. The film screams "Art House", but ultimately, is utterly unwilling to risk displeasing the public with nudity, vulgarity, or, God forbid, an ending that "didn't test well." This was, and is still, the movie Kubrick never made, and never would. God rest his "Orga" soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Two AI's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With their works permeating the conscious of all film lovers, Spielberg and Kubrick are rightly considered two of the brightest filmmakers of all time. Expertly crafted, AI resonates with the genius that they bring to all their creations. Cinematography, editing, acting, directing, visual and special effects, score, sound and all other technical aspects of this film are superbly handled. AI is not a film one can easily find fault with on a stylistic basis. Knowing how much talent is invested in this film, it is with a certain sense of reluctance that I give it a rating of 7 out of 10. Why you ask? I offer a short and long answer. The long version deals with content. Consider: If the focus of this film is the underlining story, and the underlining story is about a machine's quest to become human; then better films have been made dealing with this content. Bicentennial Man, a film starring Robin Williams, tackles this very subject and does so much more effectively, even though it doesn't match the quality of AI's visual and audio fireworks. I identify more with Robin William's character and his journey to become human than I do with Haley Joel Osment?s character and his journey. Now if the focus of AI is not this particular story or journey, but instead is the overall theme of a machine with a soul, a machine that can love and be loved; then the animated film the Iron Giant is equally more effective at this than AI. In the Iron Giant, a completely mechanical character inspires the audience to identify with its humanity. Few who watch this film fail to sympathize with the Giant, a being who doesn't even attempt to pretend he is human, yet is. AI is not the best science fiction movie of all time. Not even close. Not better than E.T. , Jurassic Park, Close Encounters, Back to the Future, Star Wars, 2001, and any number of others. Artificial Intelligence is not even the best science fiction movie about artificial life. There are better robot-to-human or robot-is-human films out there. Bicentennial Man and Iron Giant to name two, and let's not discount HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Which brings me to the short answer. AI tries too hard to be both a good sci-fi film and a good machine-has-soul film. The film is split between trying to create a credible vision of the future and trying to tell the story of a boy yearning for acceptance. In the end, the style is great but the story suffers. The correct vision of the future is an ever-changing thing and since state-of-the-art techniques tend to fade with time, AI cannot hope to become a classic. Thus, 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie touchs a very sensible point. What is LOVE? Can we really teach a machine to Love? The point of the movie is that maybe, one day we will be able to do it, but while a robot could place Love as first priority, man will never do! That is Monica's choice! "I've never talked about the Real life"....Yes, in Real life there is not so much space for Love...The end of the movie is great: There is only one path-time possible...Don't wish it away!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gripping movie. I loved the way that David's emotions were developed throughout the movie, and the tension between the Mecca's and the Orga's was played out as a description of our own society. But the movie was ended just horribly. It would have been better left a half and hour earlier with David's final wish, not the incorporation of aliens two thousand years later. It felt like the writers were stretching for something that was not needed to make this film complete, and that which wrecked it for many viewers. It'll make you think, but leave you unsatisfied at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT!!!! For anyone of all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect too much from this, comming from a horror fan but this movie is just incredible. Anyone of any age can watch this movie and end up crying, laughing and just letting go of any emotion. I won't go into all the facts, plots, and all that but Haley Joe Osment is one of the best child actors I have ever seen. Let's hope that he keeps his nose clean and does not get too underground and mentally messed up like the child actors/actresses in the past. Keep it up. The caracters were just awsome each and every one of them. This movie let's you think about how you should treat your fellow human beings with respect and love and not to just waste human life that everybody is just as important. You have to watch it to believe how great this film is. It has alot of Spielburg's past movie influences such as "E.T". I loved the part about the future with the cool looking ice people and all the special effects of what NYC "may" look like in the furture if we don't be careful it may be destroyed and look like that as well as the rest of the cities. This movie has alot of meaning and I think that everyone should see this movie and get the picture that we need to pull together and help one another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film has a good plot and isn't too sentimental or weepy for the mature audience. Good acting and mind stretching plot that isn't that hard to grasp, based on Pinnochio of course.The only thing I would say is that halfway through the film the prospect of this becoming a reality in the real world 'falls-off' and it's as if the film should be an hour long because from the middle onwards the plot is 'clutching at straws' and there isn't anything to hold you because it gets far fetched and hard to believe in anymore.I enjoyed it on the whole though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is good, but could have been better. Don't get me wrong, I loved it. The "Mecha" or however you would like to spell it were created ingeniously. I mean, wow. Just little wires and computer chips and the rest, latex skin. Also, the idea of having a young boy be *almost* alive and *almost* real, learning to love someone. To the point where you would pray for 2000 years to get them to love you back, wow. I would have never thought that up. Besides all that, I rated it an 8, simply because it ran on too long. Like Lord of the Rings, they could have done without some parts, and I got very bored. Very, very good plot, but you've got to cut some out to keep your viewers glued to the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie with VERY human ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story about an eleven year old boy who spends all of his robotic life in search of something that can make him a "REAL BOY." He was built with undying love to the person who read seven simple words to him. This movie spans over a great period of time which ultimately ends up at a period where planet earth is totally, and completely different than what is now. To me, this movie tells the beauty of love for someone, and the lengths that an individual, or individuals will go to regain that love. To tell you of the ending would be wrong, but to let all of you know its an ending that will maybe leave some feeling cold, some sad, or angry is good enough. But to me, it really shows the evolutionary cycle of life that is forever changing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent But Botched the Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when it was first in theatres and was entranced by it--until about the last 20 minutes. This film was begun by Kubrick but finished by Spielburg, and that shows in the ending. The final sequence should never have happened. The movie felt complete, at an artistically beautiful though not entirely happy end--but then we got 20 minutes of warm fuzzies which felt tacked-on and overly bright in comparison to the rest of the movie. Rent it, but stop the tape/DVD after the underwater Coney Island sequence (you'll know where I mean--though I don't want to spoil either ending). It will make your experience much more enjoyable.I'd also like to add major kudos for Haley Joel--he did an excellent job of taking his character from a machine to a "real" little boy over the course of the movie. And to Jude Law for just generally being yummy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well i watched this movie for the first time last weekend on dvd and i must say i just cant get it out of my head since then.I avoided it at the theatre because i thought it looked wreched in the trailers and i was well and truly over all the hayley joel osment hype by that stage.All i can say is i am overwhelmed by by how much there is going on in this movie.Wonderful suttle and detailed acting performances from the cast,Superb visual imagary with seamless cgi blending in with the real life action and lots of thought provoking ideas to be pondered.I'm not saying that it is a film without flaws but i do know this is a dvd i want to add to my collection and watch many times in the years to come.As a fan of si fi it's so rare to get a film of substance in this genre that you have to rejoice when a good one comes along.Back when blade runner was released it made practicaly nothing at the box office and was ignored by the academy awards.Now with people gaining greater appreciation for it's multi layered suttleties it is regarded as one of the top 100 films of all time and certainly one of the greatest si fi movies ever.I wonder if the sature of Ai will grow in the same way as film lovers have a chance to digest all it's layers.*Spoilers* I do wonder if it would have been better to end the movie when david finds the blue fairy,it seemed so poetic and beautiful but i might be wrong to,i think i have to keep watching over time to find out.Jude law was wonderful as gigolo joe he just seems to get better and better with every movie he does and H J O was just perfect.I'm putting this dvd in the si fi section of my collection,right next to blade runner!!!I'll give this movie 8 out of 10 but that may increase over time :).Incidentley my favorite steven spielberg movie is one of his least talked about and also featured a child actor in the leading role,Empire of the sun.He must have a wonderful affilation with children to be able to draw out such magical perfomances from them.Thank you thank you thank you steven and the late stanley cubric for giving us a si fi movie with substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spectacular film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI is truly an amazing film. I find it so amusing that so many people didn't enjoy this movie, but it reaffirms what I've known for a while. Our society needs constant action and distraction when they go to the movies. We no longer want to think when we go to the movies. We would much rather have everything right there in front of us and let the movie do all the thinking for us. I'm ot one of those people. I respect intelligent movies and AI is one of those. Yes it is long , but so was Titanic and no one complained about that. I think this is an incredibly thought provoking movie and even if you didn't like the story you can no deny that it was unbelievably well made and the visuals were absolutely stunning. The same people that were turned off by this film were probably the ones that were turned on to mindless pointless film like the Fast and The furious and I think that only sends a sad message about our society. I hope movie makers follow Steven Spielberg's example and start making more intelligent, thought provoking and deep films. And by the way to you all u brilliant people, those weren't aliens at the end. Think about it. It's not that hard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg Meets Kubrick in Spectacular Intelligent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underrated is one of the words I would use to describe this movies. Haley Joel Osment does an excellent job at portraying the robot-boy called David. David is an artificial intelligence: his emotions are real, his love is real, but he is not.Sent away by his "parents", David embarks on a mission of exploration together with Gigolo Joe (played well by Jude Law) to search for the Fairy who can turn him into a real boy.Sounds cliche? It's because it is. The main storyline is basically a retelling of earlier stories. And I wouldn't want to see this movie because of the above summary. But what stands out in this movie are the *moments*, and the adding of layers unto this unremarkable storyline. I won't spoil it for you, but rest assured that the genius of the late Kubrick combined with Spielbergs techniques gives intelligent viewers for something to ponder about.And, agreeing with other reviewers, people who go to movies and make sure their popcorn won't run out won't like it. It's thoughtful, much like Kubrick's 2001, and the ending has a certain bizarreness that I appreciate. Well done, everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the More Intellectual Movies of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. is one of the most underrated and overlooked movies of 2001. All I heard were bad things, so when I rented the DVD, I was positively blown away. It mixes a perfect blend of Spielberg style fantastic imagery with Kubrick's dark vision of the future, and wow does it work.The movie's 3 act format works very well, with the first being a more Kubrick-like, deep look at the very soul of the artificially intelligent robot David, and the responsibility to love a robot that can love back. The 2nd act brings in Spielberg's fantastic imagery and blends it into a dark vision of the future metropolis, Rouge City. The storyline involves a very realistic look at the world of discrimination against robots (and a throwback to discrimination of other minorities) and an earnest look at the deepest consciences of humans. The 3rd act is primarily Spielberg, with the sprawling digitally created landscapes of what has become of one of our great metropolis's, yet the storyline is a sort of thoughtful ending, which leaves the viewer contemplative and introspective. A.I. is the kind of movie that you cant get out of your head, whether you loved or hated it. The main themes are strong, but not forced on the viewer. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to those that are open, intellectual, and especially sci-fi fans....because while I am not a sci-fi fan, the entire time I was watching this, I was thinking how even cooler this movie would be if I was a sci-fi fan, visually. Anyways, rent it, dont trust any bad reviews you hear!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceedingly thought-provoking masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`History repeats itself. It's the rite of blood and electricity', speaks a decayed mecha locked inside a cell amidst the chaos of a `Flesh Fair'; a futuristic holocaust of man's continual need for inequality and exploitation of those deemed impure. Spielberg's `A.I. Artificial Intelligence' is masterful in masking its profound debates underneath the glare of a science fiction fantasy. `A.I.' is a masterpiece enriched by the shadows of history's canyon of philosophy presented here through the openness of an aged fairytale. The notion of one's identity, something usually mirrored most deeply in those people and things we truly love or hate, even if synthetically imprinted, is nevertheless the foundation from which a soul is built. Is it too far-fetched to believe a machine capable of learning and adaptation can like `base metals transmuted into gold' eventually achieve all there is to be human with the exception of death? However, if `Death shall hold no dominion' then the film's conclusion is quite bleak yet with the current tides of terror in our world, it's no longer an impossible, unthinkable belief that our race can and will eventually become extinct. As we continue to lose our humanity perhaps a machine created in our ideal image will be our only enduring epitaph and as Mr. Spielberg has suggested, the responsibility in what we create or destroy and in drowned, hollowed choirs leave behind, is one we must not take lightly.I found `A.I. Artificial Intelligence' to be an overwhelmingly powerful film that left me rather depressed. For viewers of lesser insight, the film can serve as an exciting adventure and fantasy and leave you smiling at the end, I guess, but you would have to be blissfully ignorant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI: Artificial Intelligence is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has a great story line that is actually a lot different than you will probably imagine from watching the trailers. It sure was for me. The main story is about a robot child who wishes to be human because he believes that if he accomplishes this, his "mother" will love him back. But there is also a smaller story about the relationship between the humans and the robots. The humans, a lot of them anyway, believe that the robots should all be destroyed because they think that when robots are created to do things for the humans, they are taking away something from the humans. They say that they are just "getting rid of artificiality" when they destroy them. This tells us, at least it tells me, that the world today probably won't accept a loving, feeling AI, or AI altogether. This, to me, is an issue because if we can't accept ourselves (I mean, look at the world today), how can we accept AI? This especially came to me when Monica (David's "mother") said, "I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the world." and also when it was in the part of the movie with the "Flesh Fair". "Flesh Fairs" are places where robots are tortured by humans who don't belive AI is a good thing. In the end we are all machines. We are just made of different material. Even if this movie wasn't supposed to tell this message, it sure did come to me when I watched it. This movie is just amazing. Especially the ending which was totally unexpected.</fullReview>

This movie is awe-inspiring and most definitely one which needs multiple viewings. I'm not going to go on and on but just wanted someone to give this film the credit it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of film you either love or hate. For me personally, I loved it. I felt the movie was split into two sections, the first hour or so being pure Kubrick, the last hour and a half was Spielberg.I won't drone on about the plot here, as that has already been covered in the other excellent reviews on IMDB, but personally I found the story very gripping, certainly emotional (anyone with children of their own will probably think so too), slightly confusing (it improves with a second viewing) but overall very rewarding.My personal stand out point is the fantastic CG effects of the underwater New York (the ruined city at the end of the world). David and Joe's descent in the helicopter amongst the ruined buildings is an image I certainly won't forget, made all the more poignant by the site of the world trade centres twin towers in both the descent and the ice scene.Overall, this is a fantastic movie with a lot of heart. See it and judge it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rated 7I know that a lot of people did not like this movie, and it definitely had some serious problems, but I did find it enjoyable. The acting was uniformly good, with Haley Joel Osment giving a finely crafted performance as the little boy who wasn't a little boy, and here we touch on what I liked about the movie. This movie is about the illusory nature of reality. There was the dead boy who wasn't dead, the boy who wasn't a boy, the mother who wasn't the mother, the man who really wasn't a lover, the lover who wasn't a man, the moon that wasn't a moon, the ending that wasn't an ending?there was nothing in this story that was quite what it was presented to be when we first saw it, and sometimes the second interpretation wasn't right, either. Even the emotions the viewer experiences during this film are somewhat dishonest- are you really weeping for the little android, or are you projecting onto him your belief that he is a real little boy? The viewer is kept off-balance throughout this movie and should begin to question their own reactions to everything they see and think they believe. While many have criticized the movie for its extended, happier ending, I wonder if this wasn't just another statement subtly directed at the viewer's interpretation of events. Nice people would not like the first part of the ending, because nice people are still clinging to their illusions about the story and the characters, however when they are subsequently given the nice, warm, fuzzy ending they think they want, they find it outrageously cheap and manipulative, as it is, but again, it's the kind of ending one would get if one were dealing with a real little boy, isn't it? It's a shove to get you past the frontier of that illusion.While I don't think the blending of Kubrick and Spielberg is entirely successful in this movie,it is interesting to see Spielberg engage rather successfully in the kind of mind games that Kubrick played on his viewers all the time. Seeing past your own illusions is always uncomfortable and Spielberg has done a fine job of teasing us out of ours. This is a movie that needs to be seen more than once because it is very rich in details that should be enjoyed, and it may take morethan a viewing to appreciate what is really going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Driven By The Performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without getting into much details, A.I. can be resumed in some words, is the tale about a robot boy in a distant future, bought by a family, but as soon as problems arise, he has to be taken out to destruction, having to escape from it to find the blue fairy (as he believes) to make him a real boy so his adoptive mother can love him as a real boy. Written and Directed by Steven Spielberg, the movie's premise came from him and his long lost friend Stanley Kubrick. Working with is own script, Spielberg writes competently, and directs passionately. The performances are also the high point of the movie with Haley Joel Osment better here than in the Sixth Sense, doing with Frances O'Connor a titan duel. If Spielberg was attempting for tears in the final day sequence, he succeeded, touching the most insensitive viewer, saving the catastrophic and incomprehensible scene before, the alien meeting. Osment is likely to be again nominated for the Academy Awards [worthy].</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, like most of Kubrick's work, is not for everyone. This one, however, was written and directed by Steven Spielberg and as such was met with Spielberg type expectations as a blockbuster hit. What audiences got in the summer of 2001 was a frustrating, beautiful, odd, and challenging piece of cinema that was a head-on collision of two legendary director's sensibilities. The biggest point of contention has to be the last 20 minutes of the film, where Spielberg's sentiment and Kubrick's calculation conspire to create on of the most unusual endings in recent memory. For the film to work, one must take the film as a deconstruction of the fairy-tale, and even as a deconstruction of Spielberg's own films. Keep this in mind as you watch it and you may find a very different film unfold before you.</fullReview>

I really doubt that Kubrick would have gone this way - just way too childish. I really do not want to put down Spielberg, but this really would have been better in the hands of another director - someone like David Fincher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie blew my mind, I loved it. I saw it twice and I've most certainly fallen in love. I can't wait until the DVD is released! The first time I saw it I was amazed. It had so many elements of a wonderful movie. First of all, it had humor. Teddy was the comic relief of the movie, and also told us some key facts. It also had its humorous moments in the beginning. Second, it was realistic, and I don't mean graphics. For instance, the Flesh Fair. If anyone can't see that really happening, then you need to take another look at how humans work. It pointed out human flaws unlike any movie I've ever seen. I could go on forever about how realistic the actions and reactions, etc. of the characters were. And Osment is amazing. No, that's an understatement. I couldn't believe what a brilliant actor he was. I've read quite a few complaints about the length, but I can honestly say I didn't mind sitting through 2 1/2 hours. In fact, I was glad to. I'm going to wrap this up now, because I could go on all night. All in all I give it 9.5/10. I took out .5 because I did think the ending was a little weak. But aside from that, this movie was brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A radically different view of AI...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the first review, I had to post one to give a "balancing" viewpoint. I'll try to do it in as few words as possible... First, this movie is not Bicentenial Man. Yes, both have main characters that are robots that want to be more human. But the "tone" of each movie is VERY different. BM was a much more hopeful movie with a happy ending, whereas AI was dark and certainly didn't have a happy ending. Personally, I loved the tone of AI. It was such a refreshing change to see a movie that didn't have the predictable sugary-sweet ending. My only gripe was that it seemed to jump sometimes from one scene to another, as if scenes were cut out. This feeling was verified when I recently read about the impending DVD of AI. The article I read said that about 60 minutes(!) of AI was cut out! The bad part is that none of it is slated to be restored for the DVD, which is a shame indeed. I can hardly comprehend why none of it is being restored when it was so obvious that much was cut just to shorten the film. But in spite of this, I will still buy the DVD. If you are still unsure about the movie, then just rent it and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all the negative comments that surround this film, it has quickly become one of my favorite films of the last ten years. There are those who say that the film is cold and heartless, when in reality, there is more heart in this film than many others in recent memory. I went into "A.I." expecting a decent film and when I came out of it, I realized that I had seen a masterpiece of cinema. The story is a simple one, revolving around a complex subject: love.The acting in this film is top notch. Haley Joel Osment is eerily convincing as the Mecha-Child David. Frances O'Connor is simply wonderful as the mother, and the relationship between the two brings you to tears, both positively (the denouement) and negatively (the abandonment early in the film). This is a film that I believe many mothers would embrace for its thematic elements.This being said, "A.I." isn't for everyone. It's very much a cerebral experience that will leave you thinking for days afterwards (a friend of mine still talks about how it affected her emotionally) and will leave an imprint on your emotions, no subject-related pun intended. Many say this is a love it or hate it film; in that case, count me among those who absolutely adores this stunning and compelling tale of emotion Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick brought to life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another brilliant movie from Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is based on a short story written about three decades ago, and raised quite a bit of expectations as it involved a collaboration between the late Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey, Eyes Wide Shut) and Spielberg.As is obvious from the name and promos, the movie deals with a robot equipped with an advanced form of artificial intelligence, that of giving and expecting love. What better way to do it than with a kid!And who better currently than Osment (The Sixth Sense) to play that role! The boy scales amazing heights, even being able to show measured emotions just like a robot would. Law steals the show in a cameo appearance.The movie manages to bring up various relevant questions and pointers about the future, for which a special round of applause is warranted. Towards the end, the viewers' heart-strings are tugged at strongly. However, the pace is mostly slow. Needless to say of a Spielberg movie, the technical standards are simply brilliant, even as the background score lends able support. His obsession with fairy tales continues, this time around with Pinocchio.This movie is certainly not of the futuristic thriller commercial genre. It provides an interesting peek into the future, in Spielberg's mastery laced with Kubrick's off-beat ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very long, bizarre, and paranoid movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine that Stanley Kubrick had a baby before he died and Steven Spielberg raised it as one of his own. It would be the strangest, yet most special kid you had ever seen. Well, that's sort of what you get from Spielberg's newest film, "A.I."(Artificial Intelligence), based on an idea that Kubrick never got to finish before he died. The result is a very bizarre, long, and paranoid movie (thanks Stanley!), yet it has those E.T./Close Encounters magic moments (thanks Steven!). Shrouded in secrecy, the plot goes something like this: Somewhere in the middle of the 21st century, a prototype of a perfect human boy is created and tested out on a family whose son had been in a terrible accident. This "11-year-old boy" named David (Haley Joel Osment), is a cute little kid, who has all of the features of a regular kid, including his feelings, but he is still a robot. David fills the void to an extent until the parents' boy recovers and comes back into the picture. He then learns about hate, jealousy, and the darker side of human emotion. He is finally dropped off near the facility where he was made and befriends other, less-developed robots, including a gigolo robot named Joe (Jude Law), where he begins a Pinocchio-inspired quest to find the "blue fairy" that will make him a real boy so his Mom will love him again. He encounters a few near-death experiences, friendly and unfriendly humans and robots, and even aliens! If Kubrick made this movie, it would've been much longer and probably almost unbearably boring. It seemed in a test screening that most people were getting restless, especially the kids. This leads you to wonder: "Who is this movie for?" Kids will be bored to tears, teens will want more action, and Kubrick and Spielberg fans will be divided. Most likely, there will be a love/hate reaction to this movie. The oil and water mix of the cute/freaky characters and plot twists will turn a lot of people off. Personally, I found it to be a pretty interesting movie that could've just used a little editing. Leave the kids at home and take a little trip into a Twilight Zone-worthy world that only these two great directors could create.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, thank you Steven Spielberg for making this chancy, different and incredible film. Virtually unmarketable. What could the target audience be? It's a science fiction speculation; it's slow but it's fascinating from start to finish. An excellent use of Haley Joel Osment, merely the best child actor to come down the pike so far. He has so much talent for one so young, the critics will crawl out of the walls to tear him down with glee. This ain't no family film, that's for sure. Spielberg gave us "1941" years ago and now "A.I." Quite a fellow. But for those of you willing to gamble on this flick; you must find some movie house playing it. This is not a small screen film, in any possible way. See it small and the effect will be diminished. So try to find some house playing it somewhere, or perhaps some high quality giant TV somewhere. Keep your mind open and give it a chance. This is no marketing scheme like Blair Witch or Scary Movie. This is genuine risk taking filmmaking and with a high budget too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to start by making a short comment on the harsh review posted by a mr. Michael G. Sibley: This movie was everything I expected it to be.If you're not touched by this emotionally satisfying masterpiece, then you simply shouldn't watch films of this genre!As David's quest starts, he has no soul, and when he has reached the end of it, he has. The same thing applies to this movie. It's soul grows to astronomical heights from the very beginning to the inevitable and heartbreaking end. By admitting that I have never been a big fan of Stanley Kubric, I expose myself as a person not entirely neutral when it comes to judging this film. I can see why some people may think so, but then again, Kubric, as great as he may have been isn't with us anymore, and thus he certainly hasn't got anything to do with A.I. if you ask me. This is Spielbergs film, and he has made a magnificent job!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful fairytale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems not many people here liked AI. Well I did. I think perhaps others were expecting some cheap mindless action flick, AI is anything but cheap mindless action.AI is a fairy tale, actually it's a mixture of a couple of fairy tales with a fairy tale theme running through it along with a commentary on just what being "human" is.I'll elaborate.Firstly, it's a mixture of two fairy tales. Pinnochio - that's obvious (boy wanting to become real), but also The Wizard of Oz, that's not quite so obvious. Think for a moment of the W'OZ, it's a story about a girl, out of place in a world she is unfamilar with, striving to get her one wish granted. Along the way she picks up some friends who help her on her quest. David = Dorothy that's obvious, Teddy = the Cowardly Lion, Jo = the Tin Man, Flesh Fair = the Wicked Witch, Dr Know = the Wizard, the trip to Dr Know = the yellow brick road.Secondly, it is very definatly a fairy tale, and follows the genre for this by having a narrator to tell the story (fairy tales are _TOLD_ to you by someone not read/watched by yourself), and also by having a happy ending, fairy tales must have happy endings.Thirdly, the social commentary. This is interesting, thought provoking and emotional. In the movie before David &amp; Teddy spend 2000 years under the sea we see how the humans treat the mecha as merely machines, not worth anything, can be discarded, hurt, killed, all without ramification - even towards David who even experiences, NOT SIMULATES, that most grand of human emotions - love, in the truest most devoted form, along with all other emotions, fear (forest scene), anger, hate (meeting a copy of himself), despair (comitting suicide). No matter how human-spirited, the humans will always treat mecha as disposable because they are perceived as inferior.But after the 2000 year gap, we see that the AI have inherited the earth from the humans, who probably died out in the ice age that ensued. They have become very very advanced. Now they find David, a unique piece of inferior (to them) antique technology which they wish to study. BUT thier primary concern is not that they can study David, but that David is happy, they see that he has lived such a tragically sad life and want only that he know no more pain and despair - to hell with thier research - his feelings are more important.Over and above this, even though it may destroy thier research possibilites they bring back his mother if only for one day so that David can be happy again. The AI's of the future show that they are so much more humanly-spirited than the humans of the past, that the humans could have learnt so much from them if only they had allowed themselves.While it does have some problems (I felt the "can only bring a person back for one day" thing kinda tacked on to produce a tear-filled ending, infact, when the Blue Fairy said "your wish is granted" I was expecting the mother to walk in right then, but then Spielberg must have changed his mind and tacked some extra on), AI is a beautiful, tear-jerking, thought provking fairy tale. Well worth the watch.</fullReview>

Wasn't David's mother annoying? She wasn't convincing either now, was she? But wasn't the final scene with her nicely filmed and surreal?

		<shortDescription>The incredible unblinking boy saves the day.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a very good movie, if a bit on the choppy side. Choppy? I mean that the film is divided into three sections, the first Spielberg family-type warmth with the Pinocchio theme running its Disney music and childhood trauma everywhere, the second a Kubrick dark violent city of sex and mob mentality, the third a rather drugged out mixture with a very odd conclusion. Haley Joel Osment is so wonderful, so inhuman yet human yet... not. The first section: My favorite part here was where he almost drowns the bratty son and is left in the pool and his face while the camera fades out. I love this kid. He doesn't blink, and he's insanely devoted to Mommy Dearest, an Oedipus in the making. The dad is a milquetoast while their son is pleasantly nasty. This whole part is a love filled, yet depressing family (read: soap opera). Haley Joel Osment's acting thankfully saves this section from sappiness. The second section: I kept thinking 'Don't kill off Jude Law!' The sex city was pleasantly dark and Flesh Fair a nice little bit of sadism. This whole part was good and enjoyable. Especially Flesh Fair. That's the part that on tape I'd rewind and watch a million times on VHS (hint: buy it). The third section: A bit of a let down in comparison. Gigolo Joe went away without a second thought and David... well the whole scene where he gets angry is one to be treasured. It also adds to his personality. Before, he was a non-violent, dependent, naive, Oedipal boy. Let's add a bit of anger management problems and a little uniqueness bug. Isn't he cute? The whole bit is wishy-washy and Wonderland-esque. It's also rather sad.All in all, saved by the actors, especially Haley and Jude Law, who managed to pull it off quite wonderfully. The film is rather sad. I'm saying that twice for a reason; take your anti-depressants and tissues with you, else you'll have a mental breakdown while covered in snot. Cheerful, no?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The concept interested me, the tagline moved me, the film did only a BIT of both</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard Steven Spielberg was to finish this idea of Kubrick I was kind of elevated. I mean I heard what the concept was about and I had faith in it that Spielberg could make a good film out of this without losing track of Kubrick's vision. I, myself envisioned it to be some kind of Blade Runner?esque Philip K.Dick story and partly I was not mistaken, because when Jude Law first appears on the screen we are indeed presented with a Blade Runner like future.The story told here, is not a bad one and I must say there are a lot of things here that are good to great but there is a factor that disturbs it all, something that makes even the greatest achievements of this film go away. It is simply Spielberg's approach. I mean as strange as Kubrick's visions are, they formed the good part of this film. There was a message hidden there. Something to be read between the lines. Something that we must remember as we make progress in science. Too bad it was something that did not hold on. I mean I do not really know when the Kubrick part ended and Spielberg's hand came in to play, but I think any movie buff's guess is as good as mine. And my guess is, the end of Kubrick's part is when the ice comes. It just has all of the characteristics I would ascribe to a Kubrick film, whereas the rest has something in it a Kubrick film never had, elements of a fairy tale. I must say that this was the worst ending I have ever seen in a Spielberg movie. I cannot believe he actually did that. I was sitting in the theater awaiting ending credits and all of a sudden the story went on in a stupid manner. I remember thinking: ?What the (bad f word) is Spielberg doing???' I did get no answer, but I soon realized it was nothing good he was doing. He should have spared us that. I hope this only is a slip by Spielberg and his next film will be better again. Please let this film be the worst Spielbergian cinema offering for the two - thousands as The Lost World was for the nineteen ? nineties.Having bashed on this film for some time now I'd like to say some stuff about the good things. Good effects, music, cinematography, directing (basically technical stuff), but expect all the good technical stuff there is only one real (non ? technical) thing in this film that is worth while. You probably already know, but I'll say it anyhow. The only actor who does a great job in this film is Haley Joel Osment. He is really great. Forget The Sixth Sense he is better in this one, so believable and unlike his character so realistic (as far as I can tell). BRAVO!Basically I feel that this is the perfect Kubrick Tribute though, for as always with a Kubrick film many will love it and many will hate it. I mean, I myself do not like many of his (full length) movies. Well actually, only two of his movies I've seen (which are: The Shining, Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, Spartacus, Full Metal Jacket, A Space Odyssey) I pretty much like. Spartacus and Dr. Strangelove. Spartacus was pretty OK, but Dr. Strangelove I found pretty entertaining, I have to say (I hereby recommend it). I even found the ?oh so GREAT' 2001: A Space Odyssey so boring I turned it off after a half an hour or so.Despite all my criticism, there is one thing sure for me: This film will receive Oscar nominations and maybe even win one or two of those shiny, nice, little statues. It will surely be nominated for Best Special Effects and Best Actor (Osment). Maybe even nominations for editing, cinematography, direction and music. My guess is that this film will win effects (if Lord of the Rings won't beat it) and I hope someone will finally give one of these little statues to that little guy with the big talent. Good luck!!!6 out of 10 (only a bit better than average because of effects and a whole lotta Osment)(P.s.: I want to say here, that I hope the rumor that Steven Spielberg will delete the sentence ?You look like a terrorist' in E.T.'s 20th anniversary edition, is NOT true. I do not have anything against mourning and tributes or adding scenes that were not possible. But in that time there were not terrorists, so why make that change now. It then does not reflect the 1980's thinking anymore. I hope he won't do that, cause I know the original all my life, plus I think it is really too EXTREME!!! Plus what will he change it into??? Maybe he can convince me, although I don't think so.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. is a movie many people will never understand. This movie is not sci fi, it's a fairy tale, told in a modern time. Many viewers will think this movie is totally overly sentimental and mawkishly. But thats because many persons will never understand the symbols and metaphors used in the story - links to religion and emotions, very heartily and warmly mixed. Many people will get bored, because they will only watch the movie to see the computer graphics or a good sci fi movie but thats wrong. You can watch the movie over and over again and explore another detail and yet another one.Only a few movies have such a high density of detail, as "Run Lola Run", "Pleasantville" and "Trumanshow".Outstanding 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete mess, but morbidly fascinating...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that A.I. was so ridiculously overhyped and so frequently connected to Kubrick are both unfortunate, as these factors add a great deal of stigma to an otherwise interesting mess. Let me be clear: A.I. is not a good film. It's tone is completely uneven, and Spielberg's horrible reliance on sentiment makes much of the film, particularly the epilogue, make the film seem like a children's film pitched at adults. However, in an age of monotonous hollywood trash, the sheer audacity of this film makes it somewhat worthwhile. Like UNBREAKABLE, respect must be given that this film was made at all, and it certainly never would have been made without a director with the clout of Steven. Anyways, the performances are in general quite excellent, particularly Osment's, although some of his earlier scenes seemed to provoke unintended laughter in the theater I saw it. Still, worth a rental when it hits video, certainly more worthwhile than junk like 3000 MILES TO GRACELAND. A failure, but a fascinating one nonetheless. I wonder if Spielberg will take anymore risks again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very immature sci-fi scenario.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't understand how some film critics state that this film is the best film of Spielberg so far. Even sci-fi novels from the 30s-50s have a far better understanding and analysis of the human-android relations. The issues touched in this movie only scratch most issues, this movie is not ahead from its time it's far behind. It doesn't even consider the issue of consciousness (!), an issue so much discussed in science fiction books of the last century, specially after the establishment of modern psychological theories... Ok the robot shows or emulates feelings, but as far as I understood it doesn't have any awareness of its feelings. So how can you sympathize with such a movie character? And on top of those problems, the movie is separated in three parts. The third one was really unnecessary and separated from the other two, giving me the impression that it was put there just to satisfy the children-viewers.There is also no comparison with Kubricks' "Space Odyssey". The latter is food for you mind (the evolution of human-tool relationship), AI is just entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the movie as hyped up by Speilburgo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone that thinks this great friendship between Speilburg and Kubrick helped put this movie into production and created this amazing joint effort with Kubricks amazing script. This is not true. They weren't even friends. However, Speilburg would love for everybody to think this. Wouldn't you? The greatest director ever your friend? Of course you would like to hype this. Speilburg has done an amazing job of this. Kubrick spent most of his years in isolation in his private England residence. Speilburg may have been an acquaintance, and it is hinted that Kubrick started to hate this story of AI abandoned it and sloughed it off into some directors lap so that he could do whatever he wanted with it. And Speilburg did just that. The movie sucks. The beginning is ok, but it quickly falls from that position by turning this into a feel-good-lost-boy-finds-himself type movie. And even though Jude Law does a good performance, his character is compleatly stolen from early characters in old musicals. In the future shouldn't we expect something new. Not to mention, what the hell does this character add to the movie. He is not even comic relief. There is no point to him. As the floundering movie progressed it became compleatly horrendous. It's like Speilburg didn't know where the film was going so he just kept pushing it until it fell into place. Aside from being shot wonderfully and the effects great, I don't care if I never see this movie ever again. Put this one on the shelf and keep Kubricks movies far away from it. And do me a favor don't try to use Kubricks name or style when you are talking about it because it was Speilburgs movie and Kubrick had little part. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You just cannot describe it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I just want to say that this film is brilliant. But to enjoy Spielberg's masterful work it is best not to go and see it with any preconceived ideas. Its best to go with an open mind as this movie does not fit into a nice neat little box. It is not your average date movie or family movie. Its not how the trailers portray it either. It also does not come with much marketing hype although that is perhaps difficult to avoid when what you have is a Steven Spielberg film on your hands. Nevertheless the marketing has been rather low key which is rather a pity because I am very afraid that this movie will disappear before alot of people get to see it where it should be seen and that is on the big screen and not on the smaller television one.The best way to describe this movie is with a whole list of adjectives. This film is awesome, magnificent, ahead of its time, chilling, detached, sad, disturbing, beautiful, unpredictable, wonderful, creepy, strange, hypnotic, dreamy, ambiguous and so you could go on. I must warn you I do not think its a movie to watch if you are lonely. David's epic journey in this film is a sad and lonely one. In fact the whole theme of loneliness is emphasised throughout the movie. The ending is both happy and sad and sort of leaves you with an empty feeling. Nor is it a movie to take the kids along to see. Even though the main character is a small boy this is not ET or any children's movie. It is very much a futuristic adult fairytale.When I went to see this movie the reaction from this movie was complete silence. This was the case even when people were walking out of the cinema. This is because its very hard to actually describe this movie which in no way must detract from the fact that it is a brilliant piece of moviemaking. I do not believe that this film will be justifiably appreciated right now but in 20 years time it will be the only film remembered from the year 2001. It deserves a whole host of oscar nominations. I can wholly recommend it but as I said go and see it with AN OPEN MIND!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TRUE SCIENCE FICTION, MADE WITH LOVE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not everyone 'gets' this movie, but that is fine -- many masterpieces were misunderstood, only to be universally loved years later. For now, those who like this movie (like me) were deeply moved and mesmerised by the story of David, an artificial boy who goes on a quest of self-discovery. From the outset, the scenes that unfold are darkly beautiful, from David's first appearance, to the Moon Balloon, to the far future ending. Almost every scene was uniquely imaginative, showing us things we have not seen in the movies before. Does David truly feel love, is he sentient and self aware? Even if he is not, does his foster mother really have the right to abandon him? Is that all we humans are, fickle, selfish, and in need of emotional massages until things become too uncomfortable? It raises a lot of questions, and makes you think while it unfurls the gorgeous imagry. Try not to feel sad for the nanny Mecha as she is mutilated for the entertainment of the trailer trash at the Flesh Fair; her final smile to David will haunt you. Moreso is Haley Osment as David -- his performance is astounding. You do believe he is artificial, but at the same time you care for him. The robots are the underdogs, and the humans (even the seemingly benevolent ones) are the villains of the piece. Surely this film will become even more loved as the years go on...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you think this movie is about can robots/machines love, forget it. It's not even about NY to be drowned in future. And not about what will be left from our society in future.Forget even that it's only sci fi movie. IT'S NOT.It's about love. About that love what makes you despairingly waiting for loving back, about longing, about pure, childish love. About love who forgives all cries, hits, actions against that. Loneliness. Everything.Spielberg and Kubrick has bring one lesson. It's not even a lesson. It's a story actually about each of us. Our all-life search for love. That real one. Haley Joel Osment has done his job perfectly. He acts so naturally that he really made me cry in various scenes. Judas Law - adorable performance as Gigolo Joe. I think they both will get their little golden statues in Oscar's ceremony. Other performances were great too, especially Frances O'Connor as mother of David. I catch it to be so frightening true when she actually acted like 'it's only robot, it's not my son, he can't be loved, because he is not real' when she left David in the wood. Story....I never seen so completely told story this year. I like to see those small details and big ones like hate against mehas which haven't done nothing wrong. Actually I can realize the little ager of many people after seeing those scenes, because that was the real human nature - their weakness turns them crazy and against innocent machines which actually don't fight for survival - but humans do. Also portrayal of future is grim, surreal, but so ... real. Sound and music - in overall, perfect work, especially on music (looking for soundtrack). Sounds are very soft, as they would come from our childhood. Perfect camera work! ;)And from my personal side - yes, I cried during this movie. Yes, some things scared me as I saw some elements of my own life as despair and longing for loveback.But it was worth that...They will get those Oscars, believe me.Outstanding 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is good old-fashioned science-fiction (as opposed to the space-soap of Star Trek et al.) and deserves a much better review than most commentators have given here. Admittedly, the film has some weak moments such as the MIDDLE where we have Brendan Gleeson as a Stromboli type figure and Jude Law as a mildly amusing digression. However, the first forty minutes are excellent and, despite the opinions of others, the ending is also excellent. What's wrong with you? Did you mistake those robots for aliens because you maybe recognised them from some other movies? The Pinocchio parallels are justified in the movie itself and the whole film has a haunting quality that stays with you for days afterwards.

No one would want to claim relation.To use a colloquial term, it's pants. The story has, right from the very beginning, painted itself into a corner. This problem causes the story to resort to fanciful extremes. It's also overly long at 2 and a half hours, this is the only way it could give you a glimpse of the future I guess, keep you in there until it happened. On leaving the most common comment I heard was "Yes, I hoped it was ending then too.... but then it didn't". So, it wasn't just me.With better cutting perhaps it could have been made passable.

		<shortDescription>Takes some thinking over.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may have been a Spielberg, but it made me think more of a modern Kubrick. This movie brings up the interesting moral question of whether humans can ever truly come to terms with machines being smarter and more advanced then them. And whether those machines will ever be human. Can the two mix and live together, or will they always stay separate with boundaries wide as an ocean in-between. When I first saw this movie my immediate reaction was that, although it is done very well in terms of acting affects and plot, something was just not right. More precisely, it was hard to understand just what to set your response to. Is this a touching family drama, as it starts out and ends, or is it a futuristic science fiction? At first this sudden change in atmosphere in several parts of the movie made one feel discomfort. Then thought kicked in and I started to wander. Could it be, perhaps, that this in its very stile attempts to show the clash of the robotic and human societies? Is the discomforting feeling that so many (judging by the reviews) felt meant to be there to show how the world of the humans and robots is not to be the same? Another aspect that troubled me was how the in the movie the robots were shown as totally good and peaceful, while the humans, with their emotions and love and hate and conflicts of spirit, where shown as the wicked ones. The only robot that had his hard edge points was the main character, who, of course, was supposed to be the one programmed for emotion as well. This aspect, whether accidental or purposeful interested me because, if one thinks about it. One needs emotions to hate. With ought emotions one can't really do anything that is based upon them which includes ambition, love, hate, determination, jealousy, exc. The last aspect I would like to discuss is the ending of the movie which so many did not like. There is a conflict of opinion in my mind about it. On one hand it was unnecessary and I would have probably preferred the would be ending during which I am sure everyone was ready for the movie to end. On the other hand it is an interesting concept that the popularly proclaimed `aliens' would use this boy that always wanted to have a soul to learn about the soul. This movie is a never ending search. Even after it is over one can not help but search within themselves what their emotions to it are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first movie of the 21st century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. follows the footsteps of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Contact (and to some degree, Forrest Gump), being an ambitious movie that is really universal and has a really uplifting idea.To really appreciate this movie, one must think outside the box. A.I. must not be judged by the classical movie standards: plot, ending, character, direction, etc. It is the thinking of an age we just left behind. Just like Citizen Kane or 2001 marked an important milestone in movie history and started a new age.In my humble opinion A.I. is the first fairy tale of the 21st century and the first movie to break the boundaries of age-old, annoying, succes-oriented Hollywood thinking and 20th century measures.Flawed? But of course! Show me one fairy tale which does not have gigantic holes in the story. But see, that's not the point. The ending: it's not the point. Though in this case it is enormously important and overwhelmingly powerful. You never judge a fairy tale by it's credibility, do you? Magic or dragons or robots-- What's the difference, really?It was Frank Darabont, working on a Stephen King movie, who said that Kubrick makes movies from his head, from his cold intellect, while Spielberg makes them from his heart. Thus Spielberg can convey emotions better, while Kubrick's intellect never stops for mercy. Both men are masters of their craft. Kubrick's movies have always been controversial -- never unanimous praise, never unanimous disdain, never a financial success; hell, even Blade Runner was a flop! And now it's a cult movie, and even 2001 was sharply criticized in its own time and it needed decades to be condsidered an absolute classic. So in this sense, A.I. follows the Kubrick tradition, but this time it has more heart. Spielberg made a tribute to Kubrick, who would have hated it if Spielberg, as a good slave, made the movie exactly as Kubrick wanted. I think Kubrick expected no less, than Spielberg adding his own idea, personality, emotions into the picture.Making this movie was a very brave thing to do, it required a serious decision because it is such an ungrateful subject. There are few directors in hollywood who can dare to make such a film - of course, this is the serious fault of Hollywood's intellectual dictatorship.Also, as a parent, it really made me unexpectedly, extremely aware of my children, even more than I was and thought possible, and every time I look at them, get annoyed or angry, or just watch them _be_ I am reminded of A.I. I think the pure existence of my children will not let me forget A.I. for a long long time, maybe until they grow up. Still, I will be relieved, that this emotional burden will hopefully be lifted from my shoulders 30-40 years from now.</fullReview>

This Spielberg's movie has a personal touch of Kubrick, it may be 2001's influence but for me science-fiction only now, with this movie, has returned to it's golden age, I hope that others of Kubrick's great projects are placed on screen, the public always likes it and its money well invested 'cause it always comes back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an extraordinary visual achievement at the very least (LARGE SPOILERS CONTAINED!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit first of all that this film will linger in my mind for a long while, not for the story, but simply for the extraordinary visual feast it is. People who thought BLADE RUNNER was mesmerizing will definitely sink their teeth into what this film has to offer visually. Those sleazy future towns, the cars, the tunnel in the shape of an open mouth, Manhattan half-submerged by water... beautiful, memorable stuff indeed. This is perhaps the most convincing and haunting portrayal of the future I've ever seen. But since the film is such an incredible mix of different moods, tones, mentalities, and storytelling styles, it was almost inevitable there wasn't going to be any flaws. It is far from a total mess, but parts of the film obviously don't work well. The narration, much like BLADE RUNNER, was not needed, and I suspect that in the future Spielberg will re-release the film without it. The sequence with dr. Know was technically well done, but it went on way too long. And I didn't really know what to make of the Gigolo Joe character in the film. What purpose does he really serve? It would've been more exciting if David had found the Blue Fairy at the end with the help of a lot of different people. Also the ending itself has been much discussed here. Although I was enchanted by that moment where the story jumps 2000 years into the future, that moment where he reunites with his mom doesn't work well at all. We really don't know if we should care about that character. She hasn't been well developed and didn't come across as a very likable character in the first act. I understand that for the story to make sense David had to meet his mother at the end, but Spielberg should've handled this character much better. The ending didn't, fortunately, ruin the whole film for me, but it was a considerable letdown. And yet there is so much else to admire in the film that I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone and give it a high rating. A lot of scenes in the film work marvelously well and some really aroused a sense of wonderment in me. I loved an early scene where David meets and compares himself to a group of real kids his age. This was very well done, honest and completely believable. A.I., overall, is a very uneven film that doesn't always work, but it always maintains your interest. It has already been called a flawed masterpiece, and I agree. A film with a lot of ideas, a lot of different tones and moods, and, for all its flaws, never less than mesmerizing.</fullReview>

Just to a distant future where lithe alien/robots dwell.It leads up to an almost O,Henryesque ending: Robot boy finallyfinds love from genetic recreation mom. But the middle of themovie just seems to be a mishmash of images, failing to supportthe plot.Why do robots scrounge trash piles to make repairs? Why can Joetry to prove his innocence in the murder?

		<shortDescription>A Disappointment (on Spielberg scale)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really one of Spielberg's less appealing movies in a while. The idea is nice, and the story is well driven for most of the time - but then it becomes too long. Actually it looks like this movie had like three different ends, and Spielberg could not make his mind about which one is better. IMO, it would have been the first, and not only because it would have made the film 'normal duration'. One more thing: it is disappointing having one of the best story tellers in the history of cinema use an off-screen voice to connect between the parts, and -yes!- help us understand the 'moral' of the story. Even the low age spectators could do without off-screen voice if the story is coherent and the right artistic means are put in use. There are certainly some other very good parts, memorable characters (including, but not limited to the android kid who is the main character), some camera angles which will make it in future anthologies. However, for me, on Spielberg expectations scale this film is a disappointment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was too long and had too much hype behind it. Haley Joel Osment just didn't do it for me, especially after his performance with Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense. Osment's performance in Pay It Forward was just as bad if not worse then in this movie. It seems that every movie that Osment has done has gotten worse and worse. This movie was just a high tech version of Pinocchio. This movie was a real disappointment. Movies as long as this need to keep your attention. In order to keep your attention, movies such as this one need to have a simple plot as well as characters and dialogue which you can follow. Simplicity is the key to make a film keep your attention. In films such as Gladiator, Independence Day, and Titanic they are simple and to the point. That's why films such as Titanic stay in the #1 spot for 15 weeks straight. Aliens are attacking and that's it. There's no backstory or long confusing plot. Movies like ID4 had a lot of special effects, but not so much as to lose the audience's attention. Just like Star Wars: Episode I-The Phantom Menace, this movie had too much hype behind it. People see commercials on TV and previews for upcoming movies and it seems to look good. Most studios spend thousands of dollars just to promote their movie and hope to regain that money in ticket sales. However, too little hype can kill any chance a movie has at the box office. A good movie like Almost Famous was slaughtered by little hype. People will go and see A.I. because of the hype but will be very disappointed by the outcome. To clarify, A.I. is a drama. This movie is meant for people from ages 13 and up. However, to every gray cloud there is a silver lining. Jude Law is the silver lining in A.I. as well as the robotic teddy bear that Osment carries around with him. Overall, Artificial Intelligence was too long, too boring and too confusing to keep the audience's attention. I gave it a 3 out of 10 at most. If you liked this movie, which I didn't, here are a couple of movies I would suggest seeing: Pay It Forward, The Sixth Sense, and Arlington Road.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing dates like futurism, as one particular image poignantly illustrates.Honestly, the boy Spielberg has no shame. He doesn't so much wear his heart on his sleave as perform a triple bi-pass operation on your front lawn in front of a giant magnifying glass.My sister always derided me as a mummy's boy (thanks, sis!) Until she had her own son and then she said "now, I understand". There's no love that compares, she says. Well, sis, this one's for you and don't forget to take a box of tissues with you. And water wings. In fact, take an umbrella and an aqualung, too. Never has a film released such waterworks in me, to the extent that I'm baffled as to how some people remain unmoved by and un-involved in this boy's plight. I was in floods over the first forty minutes but that's nothing compared to the end. It's difficult disguising this fact in a cinema and, to a Brit, somewhat threatening, if in a nice way.I don't think this film is 'uneven', I think it has an uncompromising vision, like it or hate it, and pertains to the inner landscapes of memory, very much in the tradition of magic realism. It is not for children, although it magically travels through familiar terrain like 'Logan's Run', Grimm's fairy tales, 'Wizard Of Oz', Shockheaded Peter, Li'l Nemo and even 'Babe: Pig In The City'. The results are over busy, a tad indigestible but always enchanting. It is not for the young, but is very much an older person's film, looking back at life even as the film propels forward in time. David is the guide by which we journey through and puzzle out man's spirituality (if any) and it appeals directly to emotions as markers to take us forward rather than through the empiricism of entirely 'credible events'. Some are distrustful of 'emotional' truths, seeing them as vague and ephemeral or even open to manipulation but this film spoke to me. It is sincere to the point of embarrassement. Does it work? Not entirely, it is something of a curate's egg but even when fatuousness threatens to strike with homely voice overs (very much part of bedtime story reading, therefore valid as collective memory), subtitles for Aliens and funfairs, you never quite laugh, and you could hear a pin drop in the cinema. Some cliches appear such as the old Star Trek "you are an interesting species" line that always puts us at the centre of the universe as some sort of special divinity. I demur.The film has been criticised for not ending at a logical point on the seabed but the film is not just the boy's story or the well worn supposition that that which makes us human is our capacity for making meaning through memory and through that defining the concept of love. As the film draws to a close, the exigences of science are cast aside for the sake of fable (not all will go along with this) in the service of a requiem for the human race as at some point the lights must dim for us for all time. What then will be seen as most important, that which defines us and gives sense to the murky mystery of life and time itself? Well, Steven, a good Jewish boy, let's us know in no uncertain terms that it's that special secretive knowingness between a child and it's mother. As such, I think it's obviously a deeply personal film and also, despite it's faults, it's valediction. You can almost imagine Steven with his mum in a bubble on a seabed in some future, imaginary landscape. "Very good, Steven, but when are you going to put down the cameras and get a proper job like a nice doctor, already?" Perhaps he falters with a final line that is more fortune cookie than ultimate wisdom but a story book usually does leave the child feeling re-assured (and the parent too?) It's very poignant and I agree whole heartedly with it's quiet, stillborn blessing. Mum is NUMBER ONE! (And her apple pie, too!) And a desperate need to tell her just that as soon as possible. This amazing film is a much needed timely reminder of that fact in difficult and uncertain days ahead and so to all those loving mums of the world (and sadly not everyone has one), we are blessed to have you.Incidently, Roll on artificial intelligence. Before the film began a cell phone rang out in the theatre. Then another and another. Before we could get irritated we realised it was from a management advertisement on the screen reminding us to switch them off. Later, during one of the most touching moments in the film when I had a tear running down my cheek even longer than David's, a familiar sound rang out. I don't know what that means, but it means something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Steven Spielberg Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No words can describe how amazing A.I. Artificial Intelligence is. It's just one of those movies, which is absolutely perfect in every way. A.I. definitely deserves many Oscar nominations, including ones for Best Director, (Steven Spielberg.) Best Screenplay, (Steven Spielberg.) and Best Actor (Haley Joel Osment.) I *really* hope they win too.The movie is about David, a robot child who wants to become a real boy, so he can be loved by his human mother. David is played the amazing Haley Joel Osment, who is so believable in his role. You really feel that he's a robot child, just wanting to be loved. Jude Law is also good as Gigolo Joe, a robot guy who befriends David. Then you have, Frances O'Connor who plays (And, does a good job.) Monica. She and her husband are the ones, who take David into there home, at first. Davids teddy, 'Teddy' is also really cute. The movie is of course directed by the BEST director around, Steven Spielberg who does such a wonderful job as usual. Thank you, Steven. Some parts of the movie, had me in tears, especially, the ending. Still, I'm glad everything worked out at the end. There's a nice musical score here too, which makes the soundtrack also really great. The only thing left to say is, if you haven't seen A.I. then what are you waiting for. It's an amazing movie about a must-see for everyone. It's now one of my all time favourite movies. And, I give the BRILLIANT, A.I. a 20/20. See this movie NOW.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very unusual piece of work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick's films were always controversial; some people hate them, some love them and others are just bored by them. Kubrick always seemed to speak to some people and not to others.But this isn't strictly a Kubrick film, Kubrick wrote an unfinished script, and Speilberg rewrote and finished it, and it shows. Fans of either director who have expectations will be disappointed - It's a poor Kubrick film because its too "Speilbergian" and its a poor Speilberg film because its too "Kubrickian".I happen to think that this makes it a very interesting film, it is a profound mix of Kubrick melancholy and Speilberg euphoria, which sometimes sit together in a very disturbing way.Kubrick probably intended to explore love and relationships from a new angle, questioning the difference between man and machine in the context of emotion and devotion rather than the more usual contexts of learning and creative ability, processing power, or just plain appearance. The title "Artificial Intelligence" is in some ways a misnomer, but perhaps the intention is to consider the definition of intelligence.In many ways the very idea of machines being programmed with emotion is abhorrent to us; we like to believe that emotion itself cannot be constructed on demand. Whilst other writers have explored the idea of machines able to have an emotional response (Commander Data in Star Trek Generations springs to mind), no one (to my knowledge) has before dared to explore the idea that the nature and focus of that emotion could be pre-programmed. Yet many would argue that children are genetically programmed to love and be loved by their parents.You can really feel the love emanating from David despite his intellectual and other limitations, which are explored in his relationship with organic "brother" Martin, and which ultimately lead to his rejection. His only purpose is to love a designated mother figure and he is clearly unable to do much else.I found the scene where Monica abandoned David particularly disturbing - you know he's a machine but you really do question whether that makes it any more acceptable. The darker side of the film is the depiction of future man's utter disregard for machines he created in his own image to feel pain, fear and love. When does the imitation become a facsimile? Is love less meaningful when programmed by electronics rather than by genetics?Most of the film is refreshingly unpredictable although you shouldn't expect to be on the edge of your seat. Some parts are undoubtedly slow but perhaps the film's most Kubrickian element is it's potential to bore mainstream audiences. Speilberg seems to have attempted to make a kind of fairy tale out of it but to me it doesn't work on that level at all.I feel Kubrick would ultimately have created a better film had he finished the job he started, but then I guess that's an easy thing to say. Speilberg's ending can only be described as weak but he has done very well overall considering the difficulty in completing anyone else's project, let alone Kubrick's.This is a must for Kubrick fans who will tut at the Speilberg gloss but hopefully still find some Kubrick magic. Anyone looking for standard Speilberg fare or traditional action/sci-fi should probably look elsewhere.There are some amazing ideas in this film, some inspiring production and superb acting, and it's worth seeing just to appreciate those elements. But the whole does not really exceed the sum of its parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tip to better the mood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you got an emotional side, you've got one big thing coming. If your not, then you'll feel something in the corner of your head that you've never felt before. If your a Haley fan, and you've just watched Pay it Forward, you'll love this movie. Cos its the next step with a few of Speilberg touches. Heres a nice tip... You need to watch this with someone who you can hug and spill your emotions with. If you got a kid, have him beside you at all times. And ready to hug when that moment comes. For those who are alone, grab a Teddy before you watch it. Its the best emotional I have seen yet. Best for bringing families closer together. Just dont squeeze your kid too much. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielbergs emotion play mixed with wanna-be action ugh :-(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I have to admit that I don't like Spielbergs movies very much any more. (I did like them when I was younger...)I basically don't like the way he tries to build up scenes which try to make you think "Ohhh what a poor child/tragic moment" etc.When I saw the trailers of the movie I thought that this film might be an action film combined with an intelligent plot... What a disappointment! (And don't think that I only like action films... in fact I like comedy and romance at least as much perhaps even more.)(Spoilers ahead) As someone else wrote, the film could be divided in four "sections":1. Child robot David acts as replacement for lost son2. David experiences "Flesh Fair"3. David searches for "Blue Fairy" to become human4. David is found 2000 years later by androids which look like stereotype aliens...If you think this somehow doesn't fit together you are right - it doesn't! I didn't stop the time but section 2 and 3 together felt like 30 minutes and section 1 and 4 together like 2 hours!Section 1 is all about Spielbergs typical emotion play, leading to those really awkward "Ohh poor boy scenes" which I really don't like. But during this section I thought "Ok maybe we need this to understand the robot/mom relationship for the rest of the plot"Section 2 becomes almost an action packed gore festival. (Well not really; there's no blood when you "kill" robots) I think everyone who likes Section 1 should find Section 2 quite unlikeable and vice versa. But of COURSE it has to include some more emotion play... (All the people see the errors of their ways, when a robot which looks _like an innocent boy!!!_ shall be killed)Section 3 got really on my nerves... Just because a robot is a "child" doesn't necessarily mean that it (the robot remember ?) is stupid. The same is true for his love to his "mother"... This shouldn't render him incapable of any kind of logical thinking. (The prof who constructed him, later claims that this is exactly why he is so proud... That this kind of behaviour is exactly what makes David so "human"... Oh my god what nonsense!)Section 4 Well I really didn't expect that! I thought the movie would end when David was trapped under the sea just in front of a Disney-Land-like fairy. But no... we can't let it end here we HAVE to somehow put in more absolutely unnecessary, inconsistent and pointless emotionplay from Spielberg... The androids have to feel lots of pity for the "lost child" and of course they resurrect david's mom (for what ?) so that he can have a last day with her, after which she won't wake up anyway.Oh my god what completely unnecessary and _stupid_ ending!BTW: I really like robot stories by Asimov. Perhaps I simply expected a lot too much of this movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>COOL MOVIE RUINED BY PANTS ENDING...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this flick free of charge last weekend. It is, by far, the most memorable movie I have seen in 2001 but I'm not sure if thats a good thing.....It deserves 10/10 for 'Most memorable movie' of 2001. But the story, especially the atrociously bad End Act (HORRORS!!!), just lets it down. To be fair I did go into this movie with very high expectations. That being due to the fact it looked much more intelligent than the mindless drivel that's been churned out recently.Act 1: Little robot boy David is programmed to love his human owners. He imprints on his adopted mother whose real son is in mysterious coma. The human son wakes up and she figures David is a menace and an inconvenience to her depressing little family. So she dumps him in the forest.Act 2: David believes in the story of Pinocchio so goes searching for the Blue Fairy with his new found friend, a male-prostitute robot. David thinks that if the Blue Fairy makes him a real boy, his mummy will love him again.Act 3: Is the really, really, really long, boring Ending.WARNING! SPOILERS BELOW! DO *NOT* READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE!There are several things that tried my patience throughout. Absolute suspension of disbelief was NEVER this difficult while watching a Spielberg flick!1) David's (inhuman) obsession with his mother/owner. Whats the deal with that? She never really cared for him. She dumped him in the forest, like she would an unwanted pet! But did his creators stop to think that David will never change or age, he'll always stay the same, long after she dies?? (he DOES last 2000 years!!!)2) The Flesh Fair. Dhuh...?? The entire movie does a U turn and we go into Thunderdome Mode! This is the most stupid and pointless part in the whole movie. But we're already seeing this in stuff like Jerry Springer! Nothing new there. 3) The dullard doctor who created David. What a selfish individual. You can see he's playing god to the max. He disappears, never to return (??) and leaves David so he'll find his 'buddies'. 4) ALL the humans in the movie! I've never been so irritated by their ridiculous actions... Teddy has more personality than both of David's "Dads"! 5) The ENDING! OUCH OUCH OUCH!! I will accept Alien-looking super-advanced Mechas. (SIGH!) I will accept them finding David 2000 years later, still trapped in his funky little aqua-helicopter (sigh...) BUT I WILL NOT ACCEPT ALIENS (Mechas) CLONING DAVID'S MOTHER/OWNER so he can be with her for one day before she expires!! What's the point in resurrecting her for one day? It's completely stupid!I enjoy Mr Spielberg's movies, even his kiddy flicks! He is my favorite director to date!! So I was very disappointed with how this movie turned out. Mr Spielberg mixed it up trying to produce it Kubrick-style (the 'darkness' of the flick). Then he tried to spice it up Spielberg-style (the ending!)CONCLUSION? I give this movie 5/10 overall, because of the ending. You'll do better next time, Mr Spielberg!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first, apparently due to the enormous budget of the special effects dept., in order to save some $$$$, there was to be NO editing of AI. Thus, the movie is EXCRUCIATINGLY long (this was adapted from a `short story' right?) and worse; it's long for no apparent reason. Give me scissors and a roll of Scotch Tape and I'd trim the fat quicker than Sam the butcher. Ok?just needed to warn you about that.I am a loving fan of Sci-Fi, of the futuristic vision of our world. As a result I have subjected myself to countless hours of movies about where we, as a race, are headed. Some of these movies were utter masterpieces (Bladerunner, Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind) and some were decidedly not (The Fifth Element comes to mind). That being said, by the time aliens show up in AI, some 2000 yrs after when the film supposedly begins (and it literally FEELS to the viewer like 2000 yrs have passed) and talk to David-the-mecha-boy-who-wants-to-be real, one wants to run screaming from the theater. NOTE to Hollywood: Aliens are more believable when they beep, click, talk in tongues?.anything, anything but in English and anything but sounding like Ted Koppel. I nearly laughed by the time this took place. AI is a movie with so many messages and so many morals stories trying to vie for attention that it rings completely hollow. It feels like 3 different movies stitched together by a 5 year old (you know when a little kid tries to tell you a story?. and it turns into 3 different stories and you can't get the kid to come to a conclusion...EVER?that's AI in a nutshell). Yes, Osment is cute and talented?but he's also creepy (put Chucky from Child's Play fame and Danny Lloyd, the boy in The Shining, in a blender, puree and pour out Osment). The creepiness and the sorrow of this movie is ALL Kubrick; who wanted to make AI himself, and I do wish he would have. You can't sugar coat a Kubrick film?it's akin to chocolate coating a blob of battery acid. As it is, AI can't decided what it wants to be or where it wants to go ? perhaps it should go to see the Blue Fairy and she (after 2000 freakin' yrs) can turn it into a REAL movie with one plot, one message and under 2 hours. Until then, as a nod to Kubrick, Spielberg and the editors of this movie should be strapped to a chair, have their eyelids held open and forced to watch AI until the very mention of it makes them vomit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Science fiction stories dealing with the morally-fraught cusp between mechanical and biological machines are often interesting because they inevitably grapple with question of what it means to be human. Is it intelligence, a higher consciousness, or simply our capacity to love? Or is there no difference at all?"A.I." asks the big questions, but answers them rather disappointingly with a syrupy, overlong and surprisingly tedious remake of "Pinocchio". Spielberg's point seems to be that it's our myths of transformation that define our humanity. This is a fair enough point. I just wish he'd made it with a better film. "A.I." lacks the excitement of "Blade Runner" and the emotional power of the under-rated "Bicentennial Man", both of which deal with similar material in a far more engaging way.Moreover, Spielberg's deservedly renowned skill as a masterful director seems to have deserted him, and he certainly won't be courting an Oscar with his screenplay. Over exposed film stock and an undercooked script do not a good film make.Still, at least "A.I." is ABOUT something, which puts it well ahead of Hollywood's usual platter of repetitive teen comedies and gormless action films.</fullReview>

If there are no Oscar nominations for them, I will lose what little faith I have in the academy. This is a film that will stay with you long after you have left the theatre.

		<fullReview>A.I. :The best movie of 2001 and the best movie of the new millenium! Everything in the movie is classic: Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law are superb, the special effects are some of the most effective in a motion picture. The picture is touching, on par with E.T. but in its ow way. It is a chilling vision of the future (but not as unnecessarily graphic as some as Kubrick's own fare) Spielberg gives us suggestions but doesn't really show us anything obscene or pornographic. A lot of people didn't like this vision, but anything more sanitized wouldn't have been as effective. Many people also didn't watch it because other people told them that it was too sad, but for me that's not a reason not to watch a movie, sad movies force us to look at things in new lights, and I'D RATHER WATCH A MOVIE THAT SETS OUT TO BE SAD INSTEAD OF A MOVIE THAT JUST IS anyday. It would be a travesty if this film would not be awarded best picture and all of the other awards it deserves.</fullReview>

Everything in the movie is classic: Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law are superb, the special effects are some of the most effective in a motion picture. The picture is touching, on par with E.T. but in its ow way. It is a chilling vision of the future (but not as unnecessarily graphic as some as Kubrick's own fare) Spielberg gives us suggestions but doesn't really show us anything obscene or pornographic. A lot of people didn't like this vision, but anything more sanitized wouldn't have been as effective. Many people also didn't watch it because other people told them that it was too sad, but for me that's not a reason not to watch a movie, sad movies force us to look at things in new lights, and I'D RATHER WATCH A MOVIE THAT SETS OUT TO BE SAD INSTEAD OF A MOVIE THAT JUST IS anyday. It would be a travesty if this film would not be awarded best picture and all of the other awards it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was very well directed (as you'd only expect from a film directed by Steven Spielberg). However, I found the film's story line to be quite boring. The few special effects were excellent. The Teddy, named 'Teddy' in the film was an excellent piece. I want one of those for myself! Overall, a film to watch if you have free tickets, but otherwise, save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skeptics: See It Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a question I pose to skeptics: While you may of hated "A.I.:Artificial Intelligence", did you not come out of the movie thinking about it for a long time?Upon first viewing this movie, I didn't know what to think. It felt disjointed, overly sentimental, and lacked what I hoped it would have. But, after walking out, I thought about it. I thought about each scene, what it could of meant, and what was trying to be said. I came to the conclusion that I had no idea, and that in order for me to know, I had to see the movie again. So I did. And here's what I thought: I've never been so enchanted, touched, moved, held spellbound,or engrossed in any movie, I possibly have ever seen. Why the difference? Because "A.I." is too complicated of a movie to understand if you only see it once. Period.In my opinion this is a masterpiece, the same way Kubrick's "2001" is a masterpiece. "2001" opened to not so grand reviews (so did "A.I.") and it didn't do very good business (as of now, neither has "A.I.") But, today, one cannot mention great sci-fi movies without mentioning "2001". I suspect the same fate will go to "A.I." Everything made infinite more sense the second time around, and the ending that so many have put into question works on every level.I say this for those who felt confused coming out of this film. See it again; all your questions will be answered.As far as the film goes, Haley Joel Osment does it again with a performance for the record-books. I wouldn't be surprised to see a second Academy nom in his future, and possibly a statuette. The supporting characters are just as incredible, with Jude Law taking the cake as the most fun to watch. He is flawless as usual. Another bright spot comes in the form of Teddy, the super-toy friend of David, the boy mecha. While Teddy isn't real, you can't help but sympathize with him, and in the end, grow to understand his wisdom that even exceeds humans. Don't listen to skeptics. Judge for yourself. They don't make movies like this anymore. And they probably won't after this one, simply because in money-driven Hollywood, sentimental sci-fi movies that don't make a profit are a dying breed.All I have to say in the end is see this movie again for a full understanding. If you do, I promise you won't be disappointed. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A jumbled piece of Sci-fi brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is mixed-up due to the directorial influences of Spielberg versus Kubrick. If Kubrick were alive, this would have been a very different bleaker movie. In some parts Kubrick's influence is glaringly obvious. This film wouldn't be the same without Spielberg's gleeful vision and without Kubrick it would have lacked that extra bite. However, the many themes of the film are maintained throughout. The actors in this film are also quite brilliant: Hayley Joel (Sixth Sense) Osment is great as David, Jude Law is electrifyingly perfect as Gigolo Joe, and the side-kick of the year award goes to TEDDY!! The one weakness of this film is the editing. Parts of the story seemed to be cut-out while some parts were kept that I felt should not have been there. Overall, I'm a Sci-fi fan and this is a brilliant Sci-fi film. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment with some values.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (2001) Rating: 6/10I looked at this film in many ways. At the start I found it excellent and intriguing, with full-on intelligence and well-built story. However, in the second half, I really started to dislike this film. I found it harder and harder to take seriously. The Flesh Flame thing was just silly, and some of those fantasy sets, although very impressive visually, were laughable. In the final third, this movie impressed me just enough to get the score about a 4 or 5/10. The thing that really took me off this movie was its disappointingly uninteresting story. The central character David trying to find `The Blue Fairy' to make a couple of wishes was dopey and silly and ruined the movie's potential. However, I found this movie to be visually impressive, nice to look at, with some excellent set designs, a great performance from our little blessing Haley Joel Osment and a neat little teddy bear that steals the show. On the other side, the film was sometimes cheesy, mostly uninteresting through the acts and disappoints from the moment David (Haley Joel Osment) steps away from his family. This was one of the year's most anticipated cinema events, and although it was average and just bearable, it could've been something so much more. Honestly, if this film wanted to be great it needed to brush up on its story and give the corniness. Because we definitely don't want to see another Hook do we, Steven Speilberg?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a movie as rich as it is rewarding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've noticed a fair amount of reviews on this site of A.I. have claimed it is boring, unoriginal, a Spielberg failure or otherwise boring. While I am definitely not here to rebut these comments, as is always said, everyone has their own opinion. My reason for posting this most likely long winded review is not only to say how much I enjoyed A.I., but also to say why this film is rich, and very rewarding, if not, an absolute mind job.First, the acting. Incredible job by Haley Joel Osment, this kid will most certainly go far; every action David responds to or does himself is so pure and filled with a childlike wonder. Yet at the same time I couldn't help but feel sorry for him at times, because all he wanted to do was love - and people were not giving him the programmed response he was made with, or expected, you could say. This only made him more confused, and more sad. Then we have Gigolo Joe - the freshest character I have seen in years. You can't help but love the guy, he's funny, he's wise and he always seems to know what to do. The line said to him, 'Hey Joe, whaddya know?' is simple yet has huge remembrance, and will probably be used (again) for quite a while after the film. Even the rest of the cast, minor parts, extras, must deserve mention - The mother, who just can't get over grieving for her real son, and then forced to endure this robot boy (or mecha, as they are called). At times David weirds her out, other times she just doesn't get him. The father, who's just trying to keep a family together; other mecha's, who try to serve as best they can, or who just try to survive against a world still filled with hatred for things that are different.Second, the story. What can I say? I seriously do not know. Admittedly it is very weird. Very, very warped and tones that only Kubrick could manage to pull off in a way that simply oozes atmosphere. People, be thankful Spielberg was at the helm for this one - he's turned the vomittron rollercoaster down a notch and made us comfortable in viewing Kubricks warped masterpiece. Not too sure how much Spielberg influence went into the 'world' and setting, but the viewer only has a glimpse of a futuristic world and society that could have been much more. This, however, is where the richness I was talking about before comes into it. The main characters, and how they respond to this world are full of emotion and, like the viewer, full of questions too. I can't (and I won't) even begin to describe the complications, ramifications and plot matter David and Gigolo Joe go through in their time together. If you've come across the Japanese animation likes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Serial Experiments Lain or even Boogiepop Phantom, these three are just about the only things I can compare to the film A.I. to. Some concepts boggle the mind, other scenes force tears, but then goes hold up - we're not done yet.Ok, I'm probably getting close to my limit, so the richness I mentioned before is something we are thankfully getting more of in todays films. Those who don't like A.I. probably don't get it (but then again, who does get Kubricks films?), or don't appreciate that this classic film is truly a final work of art by one of the greatest directors ever known.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg fans will be bewildered, Kubrick's interested</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSAI has been much anticipated by movie goers to see what Spielberg would do with Kubrick's 'last' film - would it be a fitting tribute to the acknowledged master or would it be a cheap imitation?It was always going to be difficult to satisfy Kubrick fans who probably regard Spielberg as being close to the anti-christ but the movie itself has turned out to be an appropriate closure to Kubrick's career.AI is a film made up of three distinct parts (with a few themes running across various sections.Osment plays a boy robot, David who is given to the father of a family who works for the creators of the simalcrun, Cybertronics, who for over 100 years have provided robots for use as servants and companions.What makes David different is that he has been programmed with the ability to truly love, rather than just imitate the sensation.The first act is David being integrated into the new family and looking for acceptance - despite descending into sappiness on a few occasions it is well done. The Kubrick/Spielberg influences are evident throughout - the almost in some respects clinical set design combined with a level of subdued and well placed lighting that adds a much needed dimension to the visuals.The second act enters the Pinocchio theme - David searches for the mystical 'Blue Fairy' - the only being that can make David into a true boy and therefore be truly loved by his new mother.He is accompanied by another Cybertronics construct, Joe Gigilo, who as the name suggests, is a pleasure unit with a sassy step and quick wit. Jude Law is very good in the role, but you must wonder why the character was included at all other than to guide David to the next plot point.The third act (which I won't give too much away about) is simultaneously confusing, surreal and mesmerising. The annoying voice over pointing out the bleeding obvious every 20 seconds is an unfortunate inclusion.It is also very unfortunate that the film limps to such a boring conclusion after the previous 2 hours of compelling viewing. If the sacchrine wasn't turned up in the opening act it is allowed to flow freely in the final one.John Williams again provides the score to a Spielberg movie - and it was a surprise to see his name on the credits list. His score is subdued, quietly melodic and very apt.On the acting front, Osment is quite good as the artificial boy David - his performance is a bit uneven in places but at all times you are convinced that he is just a little boy looking for the love of a parent. Frances O'Connor is good as the mother hesitant about showing affection for this creation but slowly coming to love him. Sam Robards is barely seen as the company Dad who is initially enthusiastic about David but suddenly and bewilderingly turns against him.The film is slow, but not disappointingly so, it isn't a film a regular Spielberg buff is going to get a lot out of. Kubrick fans might wince at the over-sentementality of it all but should hopefully be sated by the incredible special effects, which are seamless and flawless.A film that could have done with a bit more trimming and some tightening up of its ending 20 minutes.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movi of two legends, that couldn't make up it's mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. is a film that could've been spectacular, a real masterpiece made by two of the best filmakers. But the one thing that holds it down, is the fact that it was made by two different film-makers. I am not a very tough critic, but I have a serious problem liking this movie once it hits it's midway point. I liked the first third of the film and was completely drawn into the beginning of the second, but after that the film fell to pieces. And as I was nearing the end, I wasn't thinking about the grave mistakes the film had made, and started to feel the film's double-sidedness.Steven Spielberg is a wonderful film-maker, but if you look at "E.T." and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," you'll notice that there aren't bad guys really. Cicumstances were what determined what happened. Now look at Kubrick, who has made film noirs and "A Clockwork Orange," and essentially an argument could be made that almost every character is to blame for the events, and that almost every character is a bit malicious. Here, in "A.I." as I was watching the finale, I could see how Kubrick and Spielberg contributed their own ideas, and packed trhem into the same scenes almost. Notice how David has his first problem with the family, and then the second. Review what I have just written in the last paragraph, and you'll see what I mean.There are great performances to spare, Hurt's was a bit better than I would've thought. Osment takes on the role of the main character, and succeeds. But the one I love most is Jude Law as Giggolo Joe, a surprisingly cycnical character. I can't give much else of the movie away, accept that my biggest problem lay in the movie's sequence of events, I will tread carefully to at least describe to you what I'm talking about. The story places us under a specific light, I thought it was a fairy tale. But the movie pulls the rug under us and applies logic to what has taken place. But then it never applies logic to the end of the second act! But wait, the last third does make sense, if you think about it. Are you as confused as I am?This could've been a masterpiece. But the problem lies in the fact that this movie is two different visions and proves that when 2 great film-makers work together and try to combine ideas instead of simply tossing them together, the movie is a muddled, confusing would-be masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie recently and is quite entertaining while watching - while you are carried away with the flow of the movie. The philosophical questions it raises are good (wether robots are capable of love), but fail to make sense in the context of what is presented in the movie.A number of commentators have pointed out the glaring technical glitches in the movie, hence I will refrain from giving more comments.**SPOILERS*** I would like to point out another vexing error of this movie: the movie is about the latest model boy-robot trying to find 'reality', having a capacity to love, how he wants to become real like human beings ......and how he finally ends up getting it. But excuse me, all the other 'primitive' robots in the movie already seem to possess these human attributes like love, fear,humour etc in good measure and appeared 100% human to me. The pleasure-robot even predicts that robots will take over the world. Can a robot get more advanced than that? The crude teddy bear displays an excellent ability to love and cherish (he keeps mommys lock of hair until the end of the movie). So what is the big deal about this boy-robot trying to be 'real'??? He seems extraordnarily dumb compared even to the teddy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people, including myself, left the cinema with a bad aftertaste. Its not that "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" was disjointed in its plot developments, feeble in its supposed visionary themes or that it careened itself off the edge with its overly long and OTT maudlin sentimentality. But that it may be all of the above and then some. Which was a pity, as the performance by the cast (from Haley Joe Osment on down) was uniformly outstanding. In addition, the set design and visual effects also seamlessly enhances the reality of the future world for which must have been so painstakingly envisioned by Kubrick and Spielberg over the span of their near two decade creative process.Then there were the themes and ideas touched on, which could have generated a far reaching and much more thought provoking impact, had it not been mishandled by the decision to dilute its darker edges for a more audience pleasing effect.As such, amidst my confusion, I still cannot decide on what to make of "A.I.". But after having read some of the haughty reviews and user comments posted here, I find it hard to join the lynch mob in condemning "A.I." as a failure. A 'Beautiful Failure' perhaps, but definitely not a total one.For starters, one has to acknowledge that, despite its ambition, A.I. was far too difficult a film for Spielberg or, dare I say, Kubrick himself to essay alone. This, I believe, may be due in part to their shared desire to create a film which would encompass everything they have envisioned on paper into film. This may have blindsided their judgement, thereby unwittingly loading the film with far too many under-developed themes and subsequently tilted the overall balance of the picture.Would the film have worked if its themes and ideas were spread out into a two to three picture saga? Or might this story, which possesses such lofty ideals and expansive scope have perhaps been too mammoth an undertaking for the film medium? Should Spielberg have instead considered using television as a more suitable alternative medium for A.I.(Much like HBO's Mini-series "Band of Brothers", which coincidently was produced by Spielberg and Tom Hanks)? Answers to which we may never know.....Nonetheless, in this day and age, when films like "Pearl Harbor" constantly insults our intelligence(or lack thereof), I am grateful that Hollywood have greenlighted a project like "A.I".Instead of ridiculing its flaws, one should judge "A.I". as a admirable effort from Hollywood to break through the veneer of its own assembly line mediocrity and challenge the main stream audience with something worth thinking about. That it is a failure should have been but a footnote in our collective conscience as it bears hope for the greater good of films to come and thus is very much a risk worth taking.</fullReview>

I wonder why was everything looked just fine after two thousand years. I was ready to see this movie with high expectation - it's a Speilberg movie. But I didn't have any thoughts like 'wow, this is a great movie' when I walked home after seeing this. Lots of things inside are illogical. Anyway Haley's acting is superb. And I can't understand what's the point of bringing Jude Law into this film. It has a good start but a bad ending. And then the flesh fair... It's just so weird seeing people destroying robots in those ways. I just don't understand. It's a mess. I believe that people in future wouldn't lead a lifestyle like Swinton's. Too outdated. The song by Ministry is just something that I didn't expect to pop up in this movie. I spent some more time digesting the story but I still can't conclude why are there 'aliens' in the end.It would be much better if it ends in the sea with David inside the ocean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>say, are we paying too much attention to robots?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i watched it, finally, and it was because i wanted to watch Jude Law. (alright, i admit that he's my favourite actor for the while) but i'll leave him aside first. A.I. was a well-intended film, and it came right in time (in this age of virtual reality, cloning and everything). but as i said, it is 'intended'. the director is trying very hard to get us to love the robot child, because 'he loves genuinely'. so we have a responsibility to whoever loves us...and we have to love them back simply because we cannot break his heart: the director tried to define such a law which is, as far as i know, never written anywhere. in my opinion the biggest flaw here is 'Isn't this happening all the while in the human world so why is it so different when it comes to robots?' don't we read about abandoned children and deserted wives often enough? (right now Miss Saigon is playing in Singapore) they love and do not get loved back - and we never bother more than saying 'poor things'. so why must we bother if the child is a robot? does that really make a difference? if so are we saying that machines and wires are more lovable than real humans? are we finally concerning too much about robots but neglecting what happens among ourselves? what we shall say if David is just a normal boy adopted by the family (it will sound like a column on the 'Home' section of a daily newspaper, won't it?^^)A.I. itself is too emotional. throughout the movie i got the feeling that it tried to persuade us to love robots as we love human beings because they have human feelings. true, that Flesh Fair scene sucks and i'll definitely go against it if it happens in the future, but that'll not be because they're robots. it's not like that i won't care if people are torturing cats in the same way (i know some people hate cats, but that's a personal preference) ultimately we treasure the human feeling they have, the pain they can feel. it is a human identity we share with these robots. WE WANT THEM TO BE HUMAN, not themselves. robots are the reflections of the desire to REcreate human beings with 'inhuman' components. it is eventually an obsession with our own species.to me A.I. is too shallow. it might be a good one if Kubrick did it, for he would have done it in a 'colder' and more detached manner, but sadly it was Spielburg. say, afterall we don't know what the robots are thinking of, and we just imagine what we think they might be thinking of, so it comes back to my point that we're just obsessed with being human. (imagine one day we have an all human-shaped computer? hum...) apart from the theme (which is, i don't really think it stands out. they say too many cooks spoil the soup, now we know 2 cooks will be enough), i like the effects (at least it's more natural), the tearing lions and the slim alien-like things (they're so artistically shaped - futuristic, so we call it^^)...and for that teddy bear...(say, why we must make everything talk like us?) as for the cast, well, i got to say Osment was enduring (it's not easy to get through all this long hours). Henry is a wasted character. i really liked him but he's not developed at all, same goes with the Professor. and now i got to mention my fav (those who don't like Jude Law can skip my comments altogether). isn't he a talented actor after all! it's just enjoyable to watch him *jerk* his neck as if he has a bunch of wire inside it^^his role doesn't fit the story...really, i agree, but i liked his line that robots are being wiped out because 'we are developed too fast, too smart and too many'. maybe i shall add 'too human'? (we have realised that robots are actually stronger than us - that's why we are afraid - again a self-obsession.) and - oh well - i loved his windbreaker (remind you of the Matrix, eh?^^)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was terrific, but I think it is very difficult to find a true notion of what it is - everyone seems to have a different take, and that in itself sets this film apart from most of Spielberg's work, which I love, but find pretty transparent. It's clear that all the contact with Kubrick and his family paid off, and I loved all the nods to Kubrick classics.I saw this movie as a fairy tale or myth requiring suspension of disbelief. From the earliest, individuals and cultures have developed mythologies and archetypes to help understand the changes in technology and society. We're no different today, except that we have more variety in story-telling methods, and can look to more advanced technics, industries and theory for source material.What I find interesting is how people bring highly personalized back-stories to what they believe the story means, and here's some of mine, going backward. I thought that David's story was of the journey to his becoming an individual self. For me, he became "real" at the end. In the Third Act, he achieved a healthy, loving separation from his "mother" and acceptance of his disturbing origins.The referencing to dreams is symbolic of David achieving a sub-conscious, which implies his conscious mind. The Second Act relationship between David and Gigolo Joe ties into viewing the story this way - Joe is what David likely would have become as a young adult, and David represents both the childhood and potential full maturity that Joe is locked out from. So the two are driven to one another, and they each gain from the relationship. The first act is way Freudian - on second viewing, it creeped me out much more than the violence of the Flesh Fair. I wanted to cheer when David got out of the house, it seems he stood a much better chance in the real world, no matter how cruel that world was.I followed up the movie with reading a quality translation of the original Pinocchio. I hated the story as a kid, and it can be read as a negative morality tale, designed to instill fear of authority, and overly complicit behavior. This movie did great at lifting elements from this tale, turning them on their head, and weaving them into a complicated story that is ultimately uplifting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect of this film, it essentially being a Kubrick film directed by Spielberg, but I was rather impressed. For those who have not seen it, this is unlike any other Spielberg film, especially the first half. The first half is very similar to what Kubrick might have done had he directed it. Spielberg does a nearly-flawless directorial job in the first half, and Haley Joel Osment's acting job is awesome. The 2nd half of the film, however, is not quite as satisfying, with. Although there are a couple of very memorable scenes in the 2nd half, it doesn't live up to the first, and the ending is a bit weak. I cannot think of how I would rather it end, but I wasn't really satisfied with what Spielberg chose. Still, despite the flaws of the 2nd half, this is a really good film. Rating: 8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious but moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit this movie is too long and overly ambitious, but when it finally gets down to business at the end it is deeply moving. David, the Mech who insists on becoming a real boy, emerges as a precious find for his futuristic Mech brethren and the only link to the long-gone human past. Another element I found compelling was the melting of the polar ice caps-- a definite possibility for the not-too-distant future. Small atoll nations in the South Pacific are already going under.At first I was leery of what Spielberg might do to this story, with his penchant for sappy sentimentality, but I found it fascinating to see him grapple with such complex material. The story, and the ghost of Stanley Kubrick, brings darkness and restraint to what could have been a simplistic special-effects fest. Spielberg is a little like David-- he has to make his way through a world that is strange to him. This is a compellingly flawed film, which is why I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading through most of these comments, the majority of them complained about the ending, saying it was way too Spielberg like. Kubrick was actually the one who came up with the ending, and it is absolutly not a happy ending. There is so much to the ending that makes it far from happy. There are so many things in this film that will require you to think. I personally think that we are not suppose to like David. David may have love, but he also has his hatred side. We are unaware of what he may do just to be loved. I for one can't say that this is one of my favorite movies, but I will say that it is a beautiful piece of art, and I think people should start understanding the film more before they call "ordinary speilberg". I think Mr. Spielberg deserves some more credit for making one his most artistic films. Just think it over is all I ask...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie suck as a whole, not due to bad acting (Jude Law is great as Joe and so is Haley as the boy mecha) but due to over artsy fartsy directing and its confusing towards the end. I dont think its a Spielberg production normally his movies are direct and clear and reaches out to the audience(e.g Indiana Jones series, Jaws and Saving Private Ryan). No weird endings or meandering story line but AI, after 2 hrs into the movie we are introduced to aliens and a future where Man no longer exist.

		<shortDescription>Aren't all things of great beauty essentially flawed?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a gorgeous, enchanting movie, full of so many different people's ideas. The depiction of the future makes a fascinating journey in itself - we see a multifaceted society which is more fully realised than the lazy "uh... buildings are taller, people ride round in helicopters more and use their hands instead of keys" blueprint beloved of so much recent science fiction. The performances are perfectly pitched - Osment &amp; Law are both absolutely inhuman but you love them for it - and the story is compelling. Yet you leave the cinema thinking... if... if... if... If only it were shorter. If only there was no stupid talking teddy bear. If only there had not been quite so many things with a glowing light behind them... If only Spielberg had not felt such a desire to explain explain explain. But at least you leave the cinema thinking and feeling, which is more than can be said for almost any other movie I have seen in the last 6 months.The basic premise, that love is ultimately selfish (ie concerned with personal need, regardless of the detrimental effect that need might have on others), is explored through a variety of different relationships and situations. Professor Hobby is selfish in his love for his work and his desire to create the "ultimate" mecha, despite the ethical implications. Monica is selfish and self-absorbed in her grief. Henry is selfish in the way he tries to assuage his wife's grief by bring her home a toy (how GOOD a scene would that have been if David had come in a box to be unwrapped?? Would that have restored his - presumably - missing conjugal rights?). Martin is selfish in that he refuses to share his family with the needy newcomer. But David is the most selfish of all ("I WILL be a real boy and then you WILL love me"), kicking and screaming and, in one instance, resorting to shocking violence when his desires are thwarted. Perhaps Joe-the-gigolo is the only unselfish one among them, but he too shows an uncanny instinct for self-preservation. Our whole society is built on selfishness, the "Me.More.Now." principle, and this movie explores the damage we inflict on our species and on individuals. Is the quest to be loved and love back such a great one after all? How far are we prepared to go, or how long are we prepared to pointlessly wait for a happy ending? Are the dreams Hollywood peddles us the ones we should really be desiring? On all levels, visual, intellectual and spiritual, this movie challenges and stimulates.Yet... there's the aforementioned teddybear. Damn those Ewoks, that directors have since been trying to ram cute furry things into respectable movies that patently don't need them. That stupid bear brings one major continuity error to mind - when Joe &amp; David flee through the turnstile after the riot at the Flesh Fair, they are not carrying the bear - it is still being clutched by the little girl. Next scene, they are wandering through the woods with David hugging the bear close. They should have left it behind, it's a continuing reminder that Spielberg is unsure of who his audience is - the bear is a sop to kids. Whereas Osment is never less than terrifying, the bear is cute. It makes you wince every time it appears onscreen. And every time you wince, you lose the magic, and have to start building your belief all over again. This was a movie that had so much else going for it, it never needed to be cute. But the flaws only emphasise the genius behind it, and hey, the perfect movie doesn't exist, otherwise we'd be stuck watching perpetual re-runs of it on tv. A.I. is a "Blade Runner" for the new century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My take...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start off by saying, I really liked this film. If you have seen this movie and didn't feel anything...I feel bad for you, I really do. I do have a few problems with it, the kid's acting, and mainly the ending. We are supposed to believe that the kid, the bear, the helicopter, and most importantly the mother's hair survived 2 millennium under the ocean, which had froze in the meantime? At least the hair should have rotted away, or the helicopter should have been crushed under the pressure of the ice forming around it. Logically these things can be explained, as with most things, but those are some pretty hefty coincidences. I also wondered why the company made the kid so long lasting. I mean, did they think there might be a chance the owner would live that long? The mecha wouldn't be any good after they died anyway, so what's the point? Same for the bear, and the copter. Other than that, I found nothing wrong with it at all. Very intelligently done, full of hidden meaning, and very funny at moments. The flesh fair part and the mecha's abandonment particularly got to me. Comparing this movie to something as doggerel as Battlefield Earth, though there are some similarities in the contrivances, is a gross mistake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spirit distinguishes people from machine. Viewing anything which possesses a spirit as a machine will make any sound relation impossible, and also no way is there for us to find love inside. It seems to be the attitude that David's father holds in this movie, and unfortunately, perhaps so do many parents in the real world. Such relation reminds me of "I and thou" of Martin Buber. Robot longs to be human being, and in other words, no human being wants to be considered as machine. This inference is not logical, but to me, quite interesting. Interesting is also the relation between "Teddy and David" - friendship exists because they don't view each other as machine, although they are really a machine. Of course, Martin has no such idea in mind.People very often arrive different conclusions after seeing the same movie, and what I say is just one aspect of AI. This movie is entertaining, and to me, sufficiently thought-provoking - no doubt a mind-blowing film. One complaint is that I can't find camera work of Kubrick's style that I can find in Shining and Eyes Wide Shut, otherwise it would be much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Spielberg being a director, but now I hate him being a screenplay writer. A.I., to me, is a disappointment.The first second I left the theatre I thought it's a good movie. But when I got home, I began to feel that it's trash. The latter part of it is long and unnecessary. Who cares about the 'boy''s day with 'his' 'mother'? It's nothing but a scene trying to cajole you into believing the touch of the movie. And obviously, it's totally unsuccessful.Nevertheless, one thing that I appreciate is the ethical and philosophical questions it raised in the movie (I like movies that require you to think). Should robots have love? Should we love robots? And should we set up sort of 'Colosseum' or 'Inquisitions' again to 'persecute' the robots? And should we make robots to replace our lost relatives? These are some good questions raised. BUT except these, really I found no other good points from the movie. Perhaps the next best things are Jude Law and Haley Joel Osment.C+ at least; B- at most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ultimately, I really don't care that people liked this film. I'm simply surprised that they did. I took a couple of film courses in university, and I love movies, but I'm not a professional critic, nor do I make my living in the movie production business. That said, IT BLOWS ME AWAY THAT FILM CRITICS ACTUALLY LIKED A.I. enough to give it 3, maybe 4 stars (if not more). I can drain all bias and personal preference from my being, and STILL I can tell you all that A.I. is a bad film. It's silly and pointless when it tries to be deep and meaningful. Spielberg spells everything out for us so there's no way we could possibly be confused. Or, more accurately, there's no way we can ponder the questions posed in this movie, because ALL THE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED FOR US. Is nobody allowed to complain about Steven Spielberg movies anymore? This movie was unbelievably excessive without reason. It could have been so much better than it is, and I'll bet you a million dollars that Spielberg thinks so, too. When the movie ended in the theatre, nobody clapped or made any gesture about the film, other than a few people in the audience who went, "Booooo". I would love to get a chance to speak to one of these film critics and ask, "Since film criticism and critiquing is your line of work, how can you honestly say that A.I. was a 'fascinating' movie?" It's like an art dealer trying to tell me that that Velvet Elvis I picked up off the guy in the mall parking lot is brilliant and ground-breaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A limited but well intended hommage to Stanley Kubrick (Juan Acosta).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first impression I had after the film was over, was that Spielberg wanted to match Kubrick's filming marks... and simply (foreseeablely) could not. Anyway, by learning further about their work together, I understand later that it was a simple, well intended, superbly performed (for Spielberg's standards) homage form one of the most famous directors to one of the best filmmakers ever. To reinforce this notion, the references to Kubrick's movies started at the very beginning, with a cryopreservation chamber (2001), the voice of Teddy (resembling 2001 HAL's voice, calling David) the tap dancing by the Gigolo (A Clockwork Orange), the car ride on arriving to Rouge City (a direct post card also from Clockwork), the ceiling lights from the scientist's office after David breaks his first appearing double (Dr. Strangelove's situation room), and so on and on. For a Kubrick's work connoisseur, the above mentioned references play a part in the homage, as well as the soundtrack (suspense notes extracted by John Williams from the very essence of Kubrick's films soundtracks), and in some shots the wide angle camera, even when used in a rather shyly way. As many people has stated, this is not a film for everyone, and it may even hurt some sensibilities. It may even be regarded as a slow movie for those liking guns, roaring cars and karate stuff. In short, I can imagine Kubrick, wherever he is right now, smiling mischievously at Spielberg's efforts, although encouraging him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A long, drawn out, emotionally deadening sci-fi epic version of Pinocchio. Osment cements his child-phenomena reputation as an actor with his portrayal of David, a prototype robotic boy whose circuitry enables him to feel love and attachment. In an experimental trial, his manufacturers dump him off with Monica and Henry Swinton (O'Connor and Robards), a young couple grieving over the loss of their son to a terminal cryogenic coma. Scientists caution the Swintons to think long and hard about imprinting with David, because once he is programmed into their family his emotional state becomes so dependent that the only alternative to living with them is annihilation (apparently with all our technological advances we've forgotten how to wipe hard drives). Easily overcoming the massive moral and ethical implications of this decision Monica invokes the imprinting program, forever sealing David's emotional fate. The new family enjoys about five cinematic minutes of happiness before lo! the lost son returns from his vegetable state and comes back to the family. Uh-oh for David, right? Faster than you can say `boy bot' our little automaton is reduced to second-billing, forced to sleep in a corner and submitted unsupervised to the tortures of a pack of 11-year old real boys (even in the future, still the most heinously cruel subspecies on earth). After a near tragedy results, Henry instructs Monica to take David back to Cybertronics to be destroyed. She instead abandons him in the forest with a few bucks and a tear-jerking goodbye scene. David, programmed to seek after love and affection from his family, sets off on a dark odyssey through a mecha-hostile world, seeking his holy grail of becoming a Real Boy. In his travels he find two companions: Teddy (a supertoy teddy bear voiced by Jack Angel) and Gigolo Joe (Law), a pleasure robot in trouble with the cops. The trio's journey is fraught with close calls of robot bounty hunting, hate crimes against appliances, a trip to the special effects-rich sin haven of Rouge City, and finally ends in three pseudo-finales coupled with a painful, fatherly voice-over. This last third of the film really drags down whatever momentum had been established, and leaves you vaguely pissed off by the irritatingly stupid-looking CGI robots from the (even further off) future. Does David ever become a Real Boy? Is he reunited with the love of his life, his human mother? Who cares! -my popcorn ran out hours ago and I'm tired of looking at the kid's big Bambi-like gape anyway.All in all, the much-anticipated Spielberg/Kubrick combination has decent aspirations and some cinematic beauty. But despite good beginnings it somehow lacks the best elements of both directors-Spielberg's warmth and Kubrick's cerebral substance-which ultimately leaves us to sit through 143 minutes of forlorn Haley Joel Osment stock footage. To give the kid credit, his performance carries the movie well (although in the first part of the film he's so spooky you keep thinking he's going to whisper his famous Sixth Sense line). Jude Law, too, is both amusing and touching in his portrayal of a love-bot on the lam (and much more beautiful than anything real on earth). My alternate ending would have been for Monica to ditch the real kid and hubby, and start over with Joe and little Davey. Much better behaved, a lot less messy, and you can program these boys to keep the toilet seat down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2001 is one of my all-time favorite films. In A.I. - Artificial Intelligence, Steven Spielberg has done a masterful job paying homage to an old friend's vision, while at the same time injecting his own imagination into the original story line. This movie is not for everyone - if you are looking for shoot-em-up zap zap sci-fi action or a mindless eye-candy plot, don't waste your time. If you want to see excellent acting, primarily on the part of Haley Joel Osment, along with brilliant special effects, and if you want to come away from a film with a lot to think about, then this film is for you. Yes, it's long in places, and the central third which attempts to blend Kubrick's style with Spielberg's, is just a tad disturbing (but hey, this isn't a kid show), but it's worth wading through. The film very successfully crystallizes some very powerful questions about love, devotion, and just how smart we would like our computers to get. This is one I will watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's movie based on a Stanley Kubrick idea isn't quite all we could hope for, but it comes very close. I'm not going to describe the movie except to say that it takes place in the future after the polar ice caps have melted, and all the shorelines of the world are now under water. Mechas (mechanical humans) are becoming necessary to keep the industrial world alive.There is a definite mixture of dark and gloomy feelings being mixed in with some uplifting feelings. I think Kubrick realized this when visualizing the film and that is why he picked Spielberg to do this film, although I will say there is maybe a little too much of an uplifting feeling in a few places, but for the most part I think it is right on. The film is deliberately paced and intensely interesting throughout. From the beginning the film kept me guessing at what's going to come next, with each character and situation that is introduced. The script is excellent and the acting is superb especially the job that Haley Joel Osment, who is spectacular as the mecha boy, and the mother (Frances O'Conner)also brings a sense of desperation and confusion to her role very well. The score, by John Williams, is everything that has come to be expected from the composer. It does a wonderful job of enhancing the movie, and also helps keep the pace from feeling stale. The film not only studies the thoughts and emotions of humans, but also looks to the future of technology and tries to decipher the feelings and emotions that might be possible with artificial intelligence.I also liked very much how Kubrick with his ideas throws a slight change to what the viewer would normally expect. In this movie, he has taken the heart out of the humans. While adding feeling to a movie that could have easily gone emotionless (which he has done wonderfully in other movies) he gives the robots the hearts and feelings. By doing this he shows how in certain circumstances one might see these robots as more human than the actual humans are. The combination of the character studies between these two "races" mixes with top notch special effects and visual grandeur to provide the viewer with a very attractive and interesting movie. As 2001: A Space Odyssey made us look at the different ideas of intelligence and loyalty, and the importance of how those ideas interact, this movie makes us look at what artificial vs. real really means. This is a wonderful tribute to one of the great directors of all time, and if you stayed through all the credits you saw Spielberg's last comment..."In Memory of Stanley Kubrick."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't have thought of this seemingly absurd comparison if I hadn't seen A.I. first. However, watching Toy Story 2 made me see how many motifs Spielberg borrowed from a movie that appears to be little more than cracking good entertainment, and put into his own screenplay that was to be much more profound.*SPOILERS*These similarities include: -toys wanting to be loved -toys insisting that they are not toys -humans abandoning those toys to the trash heap -the question if humans are responsible to the things that love them, regardless of their inanimate nature -toys encountering their cloned nature (watching the scene where Buzz Lightyear freaks out at the sight of rows and rows of Buzz action figures at Al's Toy Barn was when this all came together for me).Either Toy Story 2 was the truly deep movie, or A.I. was one of the most pretentious movies ever. After all, A.I. wasn't about artificial intelligence, it was about artificial emotion, if the facsimile of the real thing is the real thing, if it endows its possessor with inalienable rights, with a soul, and if its creator intended this to be so. After all, toy or human, no one finds comfort in thinking that we merely exist. Our passionate responses, our need to belong and feel like part of the cosmic scheme of things is either the profound aspect of the human condition, or the biggest error in the reasoning of an intellectual entity. Perhaps A.I. really was about intelligence after all, that is, about its logical (or illogical) conclusions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am afraid to write I word since I don't want to spoil it to you. But I was about to stand up and clap when the movie ended. Of course it was very unfortunate that Stanley Kubrick couldn't direct it himself, but to me it was more like Spielberg and Kubrick (RIP) worked together during the process. There is pretty much of the Kubrick's style all over the story... that sensation of unlimited, unpredictable imagination which I felt when I first watched "2001: A Space Odyssey", or a clever portrayal of dehumanization, or maybe some nuances of three-way conflicts here and there. Neither a non-utopia envision of technology, nor a perfect (or believable) science-fiction story-telling, not even a cyberpunk-style plot... for me, a beautiful story about a restless search for real love.</fullReview>

I was thinking my friends liked the movie and didn't say anything. They thought I liked it and didn't say anything.As it turned out, we would have all walked out of this one. I would rather watch a chess tournament than see this movie again.Worthless!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AI was a great movie, with an odd ending tacked on. It was different and not a horrible cookie cutted movie. It had heart and was scary at an emotional level, if not on a more visceral level. Anyone who was surprised by how the movie was done after taking their kids to it really should have checked the rating, PG-13 does actually mean something. I think if Kubrick had lived if might have been better lacking the semi-feel good ending which seemed kind of out of place but over all it was a good trip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one's been intelligently commented on already, so I'll be brief. I'm a huge Kubrick fan and I haven't seen a Spielberg movie since Jaws that held up for me through a post-pubescent viewing (at 14, E.T. brought tears to my eyes, but most of Spielberg's work now seems cynically manipulative to me now, and his "serious" work is most offensive of all).A.I. seems to me to be a worthy post-script to Kubrick's career, however - certainly not the movie SK would have made, but respectful, imaginative and intelligent. There are longueurs and set-pieces (the public robot execution circus sequence) that don't quite work - but I was engrossed throughout. The last, post-ice-age sequence especially evoked a sense of wonder in me unlike any movie of recent vintage. Cloying sentiment is largely skirted throughout (even the damn teddy bear was handled with restraint - was this in Kubrick's script?).One of those rare films that comes out of Hollywood that justifies the excesses of the industry. This film could only have been realized using all the technical and financial resources of a Spielberg, and I'll tolerate another decade of liberal "Oscar-mongering" (not my term) on his part for another such achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A seminal cinematic event</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING MILD SPOILERSThere are certain works that provoke strong reaction, positive or negative, but regardless of ones opinion one must acknowledge that the work represents a significant event that alters the artistic landscape. Kubrick's "2001" was one such work, and the Spielberg/Kubrick meld-piece "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" is another.Love it or hate it, one cannot simply consign this movie to insignificance. Personally, the movie blew me away. I actually cried at the end of it, and I haven't cried at a movie in over ten years. I wholeheartedly disagree with some of the comments I've read about this movie. I did not think that the ending was simply a "tack-on"; I thought it was a poignant epilogue that drove home the film's points about the quest for meaning and validation in life. The entire film, ending and all, had an epic feel much like that of "2001" or even "Lawrence of Arabia".I also fail to see how one could accuse Spielberg of not being at all "Kubrickian" in his direction. There were plenty of dark, disturbing, and claustrophobic moments that harken back to Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" or "The Shining" and plenty of visceral, violent moments that smacked of "FullMetal Jacket" or again "A Clockwork Orange".Granted, Spielberg is guilty of some glossing and some manipulation, because of which I give this movie a 9 and not a 10, and he does blatantly steal from his own "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" at the end, but there was enough profundity and thought-provokingness to the movie that I was able to look past the mild flaws. A good amount of the material would have raised my "give me a break" hackles if handled less skillfully, but darn it, I bought it. This movie is eminently rewatchable and discussable.Disclaimer: I am in no way related to or affiliated with anyone even remotely involved with making "A.I. Artificial Intelligence".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen it once and hope I get the chance to see it again before it leaves the theaters completely. I've read a lot of reviews, professional and amateur, that seem to echo my feelings about this film: you walk out thinking things along the lines of "what the hell do I think about that?"...it's only afterward and later do you realize that you can't quite get A.I.'s themes and imagery out of your head. It's challenging and frustrating and disturbing and wonderful all at the same time. Can't add much to what's already been said about it here, except that people who have yet to see it need to give it a chance, view it with an open mind and wide-open eyes, look and listen for details. Stanley channeled through Steven; I was reminded of very obviously of 2001 and Clockwork Orange; also felt a pervasive creepiness reminiscent of The Shining. Shocking imagery that stays in your mind days, weeks after you see the film. Can't wait to see the Cinefex issue on this puppy (did I mention I was an effects geek?).Classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the most interesting, fascinating, and frustrating thing in Steven Spielberg's and posthumous Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi drama A.I. is watching the two directors' visions clash onscreen: the dark, somber creeping of Kubrick and the family-film, goodness, and optimism of Spielberg intertwine in such a smooth manner, it's bound to leave audiences baffled and not liking the film. In fact, it's this schizophrenic tone that makes A.I. a better film than it should be.The story is reminiscent of Robin William's 1999 sappy outing, Bicentennial Man, in which a robot goes on a quest to become a human; the difference is that here there are no easy answers. A.I. takes place in a future when robotic servants are commonplace. Haley Joel Osment (in a role that will surely garner him awards), plays a robot boy created with the unique ability to love. When he is abandoned by his parents in the woods (in a particularly heart-rending scene), he is left alone and embarks on a quest to become a real boy, in order to regain his mother's love.Spielberg poses many questions on the meaning of love and life, and thankfully he does not present neat and tidy answers. There are numerous times the film seems to be on the verge of mis-stepping and turning didatic or sugar-coated, but it remains somber and never indulges in either preachiness or shameless emotional milking. It never panders to the audience with simple solution as to the relationship between machines and their makers. While the film is sympathetic to the robot characters, it doesn't make out the creators to be monsters toying with nature. Visually, the filmmakers creates some astonishing set pieces, imagery, and sequences, including a breathtaking view of New York halfway submerged in water and Coney Island under the sea. The surreal special effects are aided by ghastly makeup effects as well as striking, barren, desolate set designs.A.I. is easily Spielberg's most complex movie to date, as well as the summer's most intelligent and challenging film amidst loud, abrasive action films and money-hungry sequels. Fans of film will no doubt be entranced by Haley Joel Osment's performance and the bleak story, but also by two masters of filmmaking on opposite ends of the spectrum combining their skills in this provocative amalgam.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg does 'Blade Runner' 20 years too late</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a wasted opportunity. A great lead actor, excellent cinematography, amazing special effects and an intriguing idea all let down by a treacle-laden script, a myriad of inconsistencies and a story that doesn't know when to quit. And oh, that awful music!Haley Joel Osment plays David, a "Mecha" or artificial human who is given to nice-and-normal couple Henry and Monica Swinton to test how a robot child will interact with human parents. However, David has been provided with something more than the simulated emotions normally given to Mechas - he is programmed to love Monica as his mother. The story unfolds as Monica is first drawn to the robot, then repelled by him, moving in the second half to a quest in which the robot seeks to find what it is that distinguishes machines from humans.The questions raised are not new (they were explored in a philosophical sense by Alan Turing as early as the 1940's), but they are interesting and will become more relevant as we develop better and better versions of artificial intelligence. Unfortunately this film does not explore the issues in any depth and eventually drowns everything in a sea of new-age schmaltz which obscures the original intention and leaves the viewer floundering around wondering "what happened to that human-machine question stuff?" The final fifteen minutes is a waste of time that left the feeling that test-screenings must have played their usual part and resulted in a happy ending being tacked on. And the scene with William Hurt suddenly turning up and explaining everything is simply patronizing.Inconsistencies abound - if there are robots everywhere why does Monica do the laundry herself? Why do the mecha catchers use nets when the police just use some sort of "magical magnetic levitator" in one of the later scenes? How come that teddy bear is so damned smart when the love-robot in the first scene is a moron? And, for that matter, how can Jude Law's character be so wise? And there yet are more inconsistencies - A human cloned from their DNA dies after one day "just because". Aliens can recreate human memories perfectly from "vibrations" but need a DNA sample to do the actual cloning. And finally - why can't Spielberg leave aliens out of it for once? This reviewer was half expecting a "grey" face to pop out of one of the German bunkers in "Saving Private Ryan".The film also wastes opportunities to look at technology from the future. Surely robots of the future will be connected to each other and the internet (or whatever replaces it), and will have no need to travel physically to a search facility. Will we really still be using paper money all those years from now?This film is a real shame. It's well acted, well directed and looks fantastic. It has a story and ideas with huge potential but wastes them in an over-long slush-fest. If you are really interested in a thorough and entertaining exploration of the differences between humans and machines, I recommend seeing "Blade Runner" (director's cut) and reading Daniel C Dennett's articles on artificial intelligence and philosophy of mind. They are far more stimulating and rewarding than this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg the Bold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Baz Lurhmann's gutsy "Moulin Rouge," I marveled that he may be the only major film director in Hollywood left with any balls. Spielberg proved me wrong.First of all, there are some things you simply cannot take away from this film. The performances, particularly by Osment and Law, are wonderful. The images are breathtaking. The ship made to look like the moon rising over the horizon was particularly memorable.Two of the most common criticisms of the film need reexamining: the depth of the subject matter and the ending of the film. While there may be valid criticisms, I do not believe enough respect has been given to Spielberg's choices. Choices have to be made when telling a story; Spielberg made them, and he didn't always make the traditional ones.The commonly held criticism that Spielberg failed to fully address the issues connected a machine capable of loving its owner - and thus sacrificing depth - is simply a let down of expectation rather than a flaw in the film. The path for the film divided into (at least) two possibilities: an exploration of the ramifications of a robot capable of love or the fantasy journey of a young robot boy to become real. Some viewers must have expected the film to be a commentary or message about humans and technology and felt gypped when they were instead confronted with a fairy tale. I personally believe Spielberg took the more interesting and what will over time prove to be the more rewarding route in the film.Also, for those who also lamented any loss of Kubrickian elements: going deep into subject matter would have been a decidedly Anti-Kubrick move. Did Kubrick pontificate on the nature of man and war in "Full Metal Jacket?" No, he satirized such thinking. Similarly, he did not try to give any answers in "2001" and instead gave us a beautiful film that we could later ask ourselves and each other questions about. Spielberg does the same in "A.I."Now, the ending - another choice. I admit that I thought it would end with David at the bottom of the ocean and I would probably have been content - at least temporarily - with this ending. Adding the last fifteen or so minutes was Spielberg's gutsy move. Again, it was a matter of expectation. A reeling audience member still looking for a film with a message or commentary (and they had better not be the same ones complaining about the *ending* being "spoon-fed" to the audience) would find these final minutes pointless. But the story wasn't finished. Would David's love last as long as he did?A.I. is a modern fairy tale, not a social commentary. Fairy tales are stories where darkness meets light - Kubrick meets Spielberg in a mystifying, at times unusual combination of techniques and imagination.The result is an undeniably beautiful work of fantasy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just the number of comments alone show that A.I. is a thought provoking movie. I'll add just two more points to the mass of comments already made.First, regardless of what it says in the credits, this is a Steven Spielberg movie. While their is an occaisional 'homage' to Kubrick, it has neither the look or feel of a Kubrick film. That said, it is still a very, very good movie.Second, the much disputed ending makes perfect sense to me. The key to understanding it is represented by Teddy. He is damaged, but repairs himself, thus presenting a metaphor for the premise that humans (orga's) are at the end of their evolutionary ladder, while the robots (mecha's) are just ot the beginning of their's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg delivers a tour de force here, again, but despite all the film's strengths, it still won't win the Oscar. Spielberg directed, after all! As for the strengths, they start with Osment, who delivers his second Oscar class performance. The Academy really can't ignore him this time. (But don't hold your breath.) Second up, the Sci-fi refuses to give in to the lowest common denominator, remaining remarkably highbrow for a Hollywood flick, unlike so many films of the genre in recent times (Red Planet, Mission to Mars etc.) Finally, Spielberg actually manages to resist the decent into schmaltz of which his movies have been so prone. The finale is certainly a tear jerker (my wife went through about a pound of tissues), but it doesn't detract from an altogether superb film. Still, it's probably way too smart for the Trogs who vote for the awards, so the two (three if you count the special effects) it should be due will almost certainly pass it by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get when you mix late Stanley Kubrick, mid Steven Spielberg and early Haley Joel Osment. This amalgam is artificially inseminated by mech ? or mechanical - lovers, a sad scientist and a family who can't decide between choosing life and the next best thing. Hal from 2001 - or at least his voice - reprises in the form of a benevolent narrator. And the Pinocchio legend will never be the same, which of course it wasn't after Disney took it to the movies. We are introduced to a brave new world by William Hurt, who keeps turning up in these modern Sci-Fi's never to recapture the greatness of his youth. Pushing the envelope - in science and not the Academy - Dr. Hobby 'splains it all to you, and assures the audience that we cannot not turn back to the robots who merely replace your lost pooch. Nooooo! This emoting pile of chips will be your everything without emptying the refrigerator or forgetting to raise the toilet seat. But can he make axillary wind music like all other 9-year-old boys? I think not. David (Haley Joel) appears to the chagrin of Mom (Frances O'Connor) who can't let loose of the reigns of reality to this unreal new member of the family. Dad (Sam Robards) will do whatever Mom wishes and remains inconsequential thought the film. Number one son Martin (Jake Thomas) returning from a coma to drain all the energy from this film. AI is brought to you all through the genius of programming, wiring, legend and traditional Kubrick touches such as excess, debauchery and inexplicable dreamy sequences. Message? Man isn't ready for Artificial Intelligence - and the other reviewers thought so. Why? Because we don't know when to stop. And neither does Mr. Spielberg.All of the human emotions are covered in this epic: Selfishness and resentment by a brother reclaiming his legacy; Hope through David's wish to be real; Love (though ambivalent) by the mother's instincts to nurture then expel the defective; Competitiveness with brothers eating greens - how unlikely is that? Sorrow in David's abandonment to the wild; and Hate when David is faced with his twin and discovers why mom abandons him. But where's the HUMOR?Frankly, I want my conscience in bite-sized (cricket) pieces rather than a furry mech (bear).CyCy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really truly did like this movie... but as with most reviewers, I would have LOVED it if it had ended at the bottom of the ocean. I wish I knew why Spielberg decided to throw that extra ending in there... especially given the fact that he had to throw in and extremely out of place narrator to explain what was going on. Had the movie ended with David on the bottom of the ocean, I think it would have been much more powerful and effective.Everything up to the end is absolutely brilliant. Osment is terrific. He will definately gain some Oscar hype. He is innocent and boyish, but he never loses the "Hal- like" coldness that Kubrick certainly intended. Jude Law is perfect. I still recommend this movie, because the ending is certainly very open to interpretation, and that may redeem it for many people. However, be warned, I too was skeptical in the "How bad could the end really be?" sense... this is one time where most critics and fans are on the same page with good reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there are spoilers within..This may sound a bit redundant, as other people have made the same point but this movie could have been way better if the ending had been better. The movie started out reminding me of bladerunner, espcially the middle. But at the end it reminded me of mission to mars... hmmm, even the aliens/weird beings of the 2 movies looked similar.as far as i am concerned david "died" when he fell off the building into the water: He realises that he wasn't unique and was only programmed for the ambitions of a robot company. (Or rather the ambitions of a single man who couldn't accept the death of his own child) so David kills himself knowing that Joe was right and he could never be truely loved. Thus demonstrating his capacity for love and sorrow and makes us ask if love is any less real if it is programmed. Although we also know that it is impossible to answer that question. Perhaps david's creators would see the significance of such an act from one who isn't suposed to be real and realise that there is some lines that shouldn't be crossed and maybe they would consider the ethical questions of playing God. More likely everything would continue as is in the society, and although his creators would be disapointed in losing their prize model they would still create more.The movie starts out in a dark atmosphere, asks philosophical and moral questions in a good science fiction setting. I have seen this done better elswhere but it is still quite admirable and it has left it's mark in my brain. Unfortuneatly the ending of the movie deviated into sappyland and become disjointed from the rest of the movie. It almost seemed to me that someone figured we wouldnt be able to handle a dark, sad ending that flowed with the rest of the movie so they tacked on a halfbaked, disjointed, drawn out ending that didn't make any sense to me. If the message of the movie had been more clear to me maybe i would have expected such an ending. However,in the first two thirds of the movie i saw dark themes of a flawed human society that has parellels into today's society. I really hoped for a profound ending that continued those ideas. Despite my criticsms i would recomend this movie as i think it is still pretty good sf.</fullReview>

Maybe one thing out of a million is not a lot to have going wrong for a movie. BUT, to end on such a laborous note makes you leave the theatre feeling very differently than when you went in, and very differently than if you're leaving a wonderfully-ended movie, such as "Sixth Sense" or "Star Wars." Ending are pretty important, especially with movies (but this is my opinion, and I guess you've just been entitled to it for a few moments).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg + Kubrick = Success!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. began as an idea from the late director Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick was diverted to "Eyes Wide Shut" and passed away before being able to direct this film.Steven Spielberg, a good friend of Kubrick's, was impressed by Kubrick's story and decided to direct A.I. in Kubrick's honor. What results is a successful collaboration between Spielberg and Kubrick. In fact, Spielberg manages to effectively distance himself from himself in this film. I saw a lot of Kubrick elements in the film and very little of Spielberg. It's almost as if Spielberg and Kubrick had a psychic connection from beyond the grave!A.I. is multilayered and intensely philosophical ... just like a Kubrick film. A.I. has an ambiguous ending ... just like a Kubrick film. A.I. gives you chills while watching it ... just like a Kubrick film. A.I. has hardly any dialog and uses imagery to convey its story ... just like a Kubrick film. A.I. explores the dark side of human nature ... just like a Kubrick film. A.I. presents a credible future ... just like a Kubrick film. A.I. even has one scene in a bathroom and several shots down long hallways... just like a Kubrick film.The only Spielberg elements here are the lavish sets, excellent special effects, the superb score by John Williams, and the narrations from Ben Kingsley. (The narrations from Ben Kingsley should have been left out. They detract from the film a bit.)The actors each do an excellent job. Haley Joel Osment is outstanding as David! (Notice how he doesn't even blink once during the movie!) Jude Law and Francis O'Connor give stunning performances as well! I recommend Haley Joel Osment for Best Actor of 2001 and at least supporting nominations for Jude Law and Francis O'Connor. Also worthy of note are Sam Robards (as Henry Swinton), William Hurt (as Professor Hobby), and Jake Thomas (who makes a good transition from Disney's "Lizzie McGuire" to the big screen as "Martin Swinton").If you do see this movie, plan to be taken on a ride through several philosophical concepts: the future, love, intelligence, parenting, our fear of intelligent robots, etc. This film will arouse many questions but will allow you to draw your own conclusions.See it for the acting. The acting is dramatic and very visual. Since there's hardly any dialog, pay attention to their actor's movements and facial expressions. They tell everything!In the very least, at least see it to enjoy the great special effects: 1. New York City under water (You've got to see this, its amazing!). 2. The scene where they are repairing David. (His chest is open.) 3. The opening of the face of the female robot at the beginning. (This is pulled off so flawlessly!) 4. Rugue City. (The bridges across the river, the colors, etc.) 5. Henry and Monica's house.</fullReview>

There's always another mindless pit with guns and action that says NOTHING new nor presents nothing truly close to the human heart. Go to see "Tomb Raider" instead. You will be enriched to your shallow heart's and mind's content.Here we have another shockingly beautiful performance by Haley Joel Osment, gorgeous artistic direction, and technical marvels to keep you thinking long after the movie has ended.Of course, this was Stanley Kubrick's project. We will never know what he would have done with it. Suffice it to say that Speilberg managed it with virtuosity, grace and aplomb. I am sure Stanley would have loved it.The visuals, sets and matte artistry were awe-inspiring and lent themselves intimately to the story.The John Williams musical score was prodigious in it's non-intrusive nature and lovely beyond words. I am one of those people that do NOT run out to see if my car is still in the parking lot. I stayed until the final notes died away - what a lovely experience.Only one aspect of the film even irked me in the slightest - there was something missing in the writing for the adoptive father. He seemed to be rather one-dimensional. First he was all excited about the boy and then all of a sudden he thought the boy was a monster. Too bad.The passing of time and the appearance of new characters at the end was handled with intelligence and never seemed contrived.ALL IN ALL: one of the finest NEW things I've seen in a long time. It goes beyond any science-fiction/fantasy movie yet made and creates a new genre of the heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Kubrick Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am intrigued by the number of people that are buying into the "Spielberg -- Kubrick Collaboration" propoganda that is being used to sell this film. Kubrick played with the idea for a decade or so and finally enlisted Spielberg as director in the early 90s. However, Spielberg backed out quickly, and at the time of Kubrick's death no plans for finishing the film were evident. Spielberg continued the project recently after turning down other possibilities, including "Harry Potter." Kubrick's contribution to this film is a substantial one -- he worked out much of the story, themes, and treatment. But this really has to be considered a Spielberg film -- he wrote the screenplay and directed, and the entire film bears his unmistakably plush tone, for good or ill.Much has been made of the first two-thirds of the film being more "Kubrickian." Well, certainly the first third takes a sterile, cold view of humanity and consumer culture, similar to the feel of films like "Clockwork Orange" and "Barry Lyndon." The second third contains some elements of wry dark humor reminiscent of "Dr. Strangelove" and "Full Metal Jacket." But the similarities feel more like homage to S. K. than organic exercises in storytelling, just as the Kubrick in-jokes (the Moloko Milk Bar, etc) feel cheesy and poppish. John Williams' Wagnerian whiz-bang score still hovers over all, reminding us of the bright-eyed director of "ET" at the helm. The "flesh fair," an attempt at showing the ambiguous evolution of both Luddite and "right-to-life' morality in a "Clockwork Orange" style is too heavy-handed to be either funny or horrifying -- an amateurish presentation of "the old ultraviolence." Jude Law's Gigolo Joe character was rife with possibilities, but he is reduced quickly to playing chauffeur to Ozment's Pinocchio. There was a lot to like in those first two-thirds, but it always felt glossy and Spielbergian, despite the dark subject matter.Ah, but the Blue Fairy! Now there's Spielberg in all his glory. At least "Star Trek: The Next Generation" never literally dived into the Pinocchio story with its artificial boy. Spielberg attaches the Carlo Collodi tale to his narrative in such a broad way that I may never be able to read and enjoy it again. Only a director who reworked poor old Peter Pan to address his own mid-life anxieties ("Hook") could have produced this slavish, overly sentimental take on a children's tale. There's a gem of a good idea in here that follows from "2001" (that machines may be called upon to take up human evolution unless the humans can learn to act more, well, human), but it's all buried in the shameless tear-jerking of those last scenes. Who isn't going to shed a tear at a poor, abandoned boy pining desperately for his long lost mother? Did Spielberg really have to plunk the kid down in front of an ACTUAL statue of the Blue Fairy? (I've managed to plod through 41 years of life without ever encountering one.) The last section showed little discipline or direction, and does not follow logically, spiritually, or thematically from the rest of the film. I actually heard groans and butt-shifting with 20 minutes left to go in the movie. But this Pinocchio fixation should not be surprising to anyone who remembers groaning when Spielberg and Williams worked the strains of "Wish Upon a Star" into the score of the mother-ship scene in "Close Encounters." "AI" ends on a sweet fairy-tale note that is everything Kubrick's films were not.I don't think this film is bad -- in fact, there's a lot to admire, especially the visual style and spectacle. But make no mistake: this is a Spielberg film, from an idea by Stanley Kubrick. It is Spielbergian in its patina of wonder and romance, overshadowing even a cold, inhuman vision of the future. And ultimately, because Spielberg simply can't make himself ride the razor's edge the way Kubrick could, it is Spielbergian because it pulls back at the end and disappoints in the gooey way we've come to expect from the most powerful director of the last twenty years. I think Kubrick might have liked the final result. But then again, he really liked "ET" too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ai is not just a movie, it's a piece of gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another masterpiece from the master Steven Spielberg. Oh, the movie is so touching. It's full of metaphors and symbols. Steven Spielberg has done a magnificent job. I don't know how to express my feelings, but I can say that AI is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen in my entire life. It dazzles your eyes and evokes your pure emotion. It made me think of the human place in the world more than ever and how we are increasingly distancing from that. I couldn't miss any shot of it. Of course, I believe that AI originally belongs to Stanley Kubrick and probably it should have been directed by him, but Spielberg did his best and of course he succeeded as well. I want to watch it for 2000 times, but what a pity, I can't live this long. The final sequences of the movie are unforgettable. Osment, unlike his previous movie - Pay It Forward - is wonderful. On the other hand, AI tries to emphasize on human as the supreme creature of Nature(Or God, no matter what you call it). So, why this superior existence is getting hurt by its own species? I believe that AI has provided the opportunity to think deeper about that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning! *mild spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I posted a comment on this film earlier, but had to come do it again. This movie is so visually overwhelming. Some of the acting of David's "parents" at the beginning is wooden, but you get through that quickly enough.What can I say about Haley Joel Osment? He is frighteningly talented. Three examples: Watch the oh-so-subtle shift in his face when Monica reads the imprinting words. Also, check out his expression after he gets to Manhattan and is sitting on the ledge of the skyscraper. And when he is abandoned in the woods and begs Monica to take him home and apologizes for not being real. I am going to be WICKED peeved if he does not get nominated for a best actor Oscar.Sorry for the gushing. Anyway, the religious imagery in the film is stunning. The Blue Fairy as the Virgin Mary, the use of the moon, etc. I found that on a second viewing, more of the fairy tale element comes out. If you haven't done so, read Frazier's THE GOLDEN BOUGH and any of Joseph Campbell's works, then see this movie again. Amazing, amazing stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In time, this film will be seen as a landmark film. Although the ending seemed to lack both drama and action, the importance of this film lies in the issues raised.When you want to illustrate the danger of creating robots that can have emotions and that can develop strong interpersonal, Steven Spielberg is a clever choice. Speilberg is known for his ability to craft emotion responses. Using Speilberg as director is proof that we will be able to create robots that will be able to play and manipulate people's emotionsGigolo Joe (Jude Law), David (Osment) and Monica (O'Connor) all provide good performance. Monica is struggling with the best wasy to cope with David (child, pet, toy) and societal pressures. How will A.I life forms (mechas) cope in society and how will society cope with them. Will there be a new form of apartheid? It has been suggested that a new sex industry using AI life forms as the workers. And this is another issue in the movie. This is sci-fi looking at the current human condition and some of its flaws and warning us potential hazards in our futureYou can't be lazy in watching this film. You have to take the ideas and build on them yourself. With Sony's Aibo robotic pet already here, it is time to start thinking. This movie is not really designed to entertain (some people will find it boring) but to designed to provoke thinking, It will become classic sci-fi. Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GRIM Fairy tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this tale disturbingly dark and for adults only. It's a boy (or in this case robot boy)as victim. Anyone who takes their small child to this is a sadist! Stabbed with a cake knife, abandoned by his "mother,"hunted like an animal, frozen in a block of ice for 2000 years.....It's ET. It's Wizard of Oz. It's Pinnochio (that Blue Fairy and the voice of Meryl Streep is the creepiest thing in the movie, and the ending is reminiscent of Titanic (is it real or a dream, is he dead or alive?) And it's thrown into a blender with a touch of Grimm's Fairy Tales. You even have a storyteller voice (Ben Kingsley) opening and closing the film.The theme here? To love and be loved. Without love, we are just a bunch of clones. The capacity to give and receive love makes us truly individual.It's a shame this was marketed as a mainstream film. Had it been marketed through independent film circles, I feel the hailstorm of negative reactions would've been much less. It's by no means a perfect film, but it does have some disturbing elements and themes that can't easily be shaken if one digs deep enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very, very good movie.The cinematography and staging was excellent. It is not mythologically lush, like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" or "Bladerunner," but it is one of the richest portrayals of realism that I have seen.There have been a lot of comments about how one part of the movie is good, but another isn't. I don't buy that. It is not your standard storyline arc, so that may throw some people off. I haven't read the original story, so I don't know if any part was tacked on.Yes, it belabored the Pinnochio angle, and some of the human characters actions were not internally motivated. The robots were robots however. I liked that. The script didn't have them know too much, be too wise.The empathy and believabilty (or suspension of belief) the title character was achieved, and the character's growth was well supported.See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wonder...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have been a truly great piece of work, but unfortunately, after much thought, I feel like it just can't be done. The movie is based on a short story, but there are obvious parallels to the story of Pinochio. A toy is created, and then that toy is granted consciousness. The toy, in the movie, is a Robot played by Haley Joel-Osment; it's meant as a substitute child for people wanting children of their own but cannot. In this case however, the two people were already parents, but their son was sick and comatosed. After awhile, their true son is returned to them, and this creates obvious conflicts. The Robot boy is made to leave, and then he goes out in search of becoming a real boy, so that he will become accepted. This is the major cause for problems that occur at the end of the movie. This movie isn't a real fairy tale. We're told to believe all of the things that happen in this movie, as if they are possible. And for the most part, we have no trouble doing that. The superb acting of Osment lets us believe that he is a robot trying to conquer the gap between human and machine. But as it seems apparent, the last thirty minutes come off as a completely other movie in itself. The events that transpire in the end are ludicrous, and they left me bored and wishing the credits would come rolling up, even though I knew it wouldn't happen. The happy ending that Spielberg tries for left me annoyed. It would appear that the real problem in this movie that tries to live up to a fairytale, is that there is no reasonable way to make a robot into a real boy. He will never genuinely love, because he was only programmed. I am hoping that there will be a director's cut to this movie. I think with some editing, it could be a far superior film to what is being watched now. Everything was well done. The acting, directing, and the special effects were all wonderful and beautiful. There were just plot holes that left the movie having to go in a ridiculous direction. And if Spielberg could peruse himself into avoiding the happy ending, there could be a much better ending that wouldn't bore me and roll my eyes.~Christopher</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing all the negative press about this movie, I expected to be greatly disappointed.I wasn't. It was a good sci-fi yarn, first rate acting, first rate special effects, great staging (Spielberg's genius), and a fairly decent point to make. However, the writing (Spielberg's weakness) was a bit weak, the tacked on ending, albeit interesting, was distracting and not well integrated. Everyone said the movie should have ended 20 minutes earlier at the logical point. They were right.But all that being said, I did find it enjoyable, thought provoking, and wishing that this possible future of robots had the sense to use the 3 laws of Robotics when then built their "Mechas" (Asimov's 3 laws that is....). All in all I still find Steve Spielberg with all his faults as a movie maker, a master story teller - sitting heads and shoulders above most others.People interested in these kinds of sci-fi tales should be pleased. Others looking for an action film will find this, as in some other of Spielberg works like Close Encounters, a bit slow and choppy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Spielberg is good, he's very, very good, but when he's bad, he's boring. This movie is at its best when it's closely following the short story it's based on, but then it veers wildly away from human drama into violent allegory. It was never clear what story was being told, and the movie suffered from not knowing when to start (the whole first scene of Star Trek-style technobabble could have easily been eliminated), and certainly not knowing when to end. The last twenty minutes were painfully bad, and seemed tacked on in order to give the story a "happy" ending. Haley Joel Osment, and Jude Law, gave very good performances, however, and were the high points of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My "A. I." Movie Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I didn't know better (actually, I don't), I'd tend to think that Spielberg had read Sci-Fi author Kenny Love's novel, "Millennium Eve," prior to production/direction of this feature (Love's novel is, however, more militaristic, and about a worldwide society of androids who base their decision to annihilate human civilization on Bible verses in Revelation).In "A. I.," however, Haley Joel Osment, the main star, is an extremely likable little fellow, as I immediately took to him after seeing his work several years back in a 2-part episode of "Walker, Texas Ranger" titled, "Lucas."An extremely gifted actor then (and, still) for his very young years, Osment is one of few actors, child or adult, whose on-camera demeanor can move you to tears at a moment's notice, much as he is able to do within certain scenes of "A.I."Overall, in my opinion, the story line is great, and the revealing technology is a perfect match-up for a wonderfully great movie-going experience. You'll be considering this one long after you have left the theater, for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. is a great movie. In fact A.I. is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Nothing about this movie is dumb, average, or corny. What tosses most people I know is the "aliens" at the end, which are not aliens, they are robots (mekahs). Another thing people are doing is endlessly comparing it to Kubrick, why bother? Sure there are more than a hundred tips of the cap to Kubrick in this movie, but it's a STEVEN SPIELBERG film! I can;t understand why everybody feel in love with E.T. but won't A.I., and they are built the same way?There are few movies that have great acting (Pollock -2001-), this is one of them. All of the actors a perfect. I was crying after the first plot point until I walked to my car. I couldn't live without my mother, she is everything to me. David can't live without his either, and he only wants to please her. When he can't he becomes destroyed and will stop at nothing to complete his task.Some people say that Spielberg went too far with the ending, but they're not seeing the film under the same light it was made. It's a fairytale, it's Pinocchio. From giving David the one emotion of love, they ended up giving him loneliness, jealousy, and greed. By giving him this one feeling he becomes almost human. If the movie would have ended any other way I would have died. So thank you Mr.Spielberg, you've made a great film.**** (10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A.I." is based on a short story called "Super-Toys Last All Summer" by science fiction author Brian Aldiss. Haley Joel Osment is absolutely amazing as David, a futuristic Pinocchio, that has been programmed by Professor Hobby (William Hurt), to love humans. David is adopted as a test case by a Cybertronics employee (Sam Robards) and his reluctant wife (Frances O'Connor), whose own terminally ill child has been frozen cryogenically until a cure for his disease is found. David becomes part of the family just in time for the couple's own son, Martin (Jake Thomas), to return home in good health. After Monica reads the boys the story of Pinocchio, a forlorn David wishes for the Blue Fairy to grant him mortality. And the adventure begins. The movie's special effects are awesome, combine the brillance of Kubrick and the magic of Spielberg, AI is a must see for all Sci-Fi fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never have I seen a film so different from its teaser trailer. And be sure that you're not fooled. "A.I." is NOT a happy robot movie about a mechanical boy and love. This film is dark. I'm not referring the time of day, or the ludicrous depression found in all of Tim Burton's films; I'm speaking of an ingenious combination between two master directors (Spielberg and Kubrick) into a fascinating and complex romp through the nightmare world of the future.So what IS this nightmare world that I am speaking of? Well not to give away anything not in the previews: New York is submerged in water, robots are slowly replacing children for parents who do not have a license, and mechanical beings can now serve as prostitutes.But this is not the only thing that makes the film great. An important area that deserves recognition is the acting. You can see brilliant (Oscar-worthy) performances from Haley Joel Osmet, Jude Law (playing a robotic gigolo) and Frances O'Conner (the mother.)VERY MINOR, POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEADThis, I should think, is enough reason to see "A.I." But then there's the ENDING. Oh my am I disappointed. The ending was such a low quality contrast from the rest of the film, that I was struck with disbelief. I won't give anything away, but if you see it, imagine the film without the scenes that take place 2000 years in the future...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This deserves a re-release at Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that Spielberg's AI has not surpassed $100 million is probably because the majority of moviegoing people have become so used to mindless entertainment which doesn't require an ounce of brainwork to put things together or move things along in a film. AI is so much more intelligent that anything else around and the attention to detail, characters and cinematography could not be bettered. Nothing this year comes close to AI. It stands high up in a different league, and it's probably for that reason why it has flopped and certainly deserves a re-release later this year. Look at the blockbusters of the past couple months: Pearl Harbor, The Mummy Returns, The Fast and the Furious, Tomb Raider, Jurassic Park 3 - they just don't make 'em like they used to. These films destroy the name "summer blockbuster" as they don't even come close to blockbusters like "Jaws", "Star Wars" or "ET". The only thing that comes close to a classic blockbuster like those is Spielberg's AI. It bears many reminiscences to Close Encounters, and while it's not as compelling or groundbreaking, I hope it stands the test of time and becomes a landmark film in the history of Spielberg films. Go see it once and if you're disappointed, then go see it again - you'll appreciate it more the second time round. If you loved it the first time, you'll love it just as much the second time. Oscars must be awarded to Spielberg for directing and writing, to Osment for acting, and for cinematography. Well done Steven!</fullReview>

I suspect that those reviewers who couldn't recommend this film are also in neither category.

The camera angles were great, as was the lighting.The Movie, though, just seemed to go on and on. I did wonder what would happen next, but nothing interesting ever happened, I was expecting something good to happen. A lot of thins could have been taken out of this movie such as gigolo Joe.

		<fullReview>The only movie, other than A.I., that I have seen this year that was great was Shrek. If you think that A.I. is going to be another E.T. or Jurassic Park, you're dead wrong. The first two thirds of A.I. have no sign of Spielberg. This portion of the film is great in a Kubrick style. Parts of it are quite disturbing and it also explores the harshness of their world. I would have to say that the last third has some of Spielberg's charm thrown in to it, but not excessively so. This is one of those movies that doesn't have a greatly recognizable climax, and it works. My understanding is that if a movie has great acting and a great ending, then it is a great movie. A.I. had great acting from all of its ensemble, especially Haley Joel Osment. A.I. also had a great ending, where it is bitter-sweet, and lets you make ends meet. All in all, I have never seen a movie so provocative and disturbing in my entire life. It was definitely worth the $8.50 and the two and a half hours of my evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really for kids - subject matter more for grownups to ponder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talented Haley Joel Osment is the core reason to see A.I. He is amazing - a fantastic child actor. Two hours and thirteen minutes is rather long for a movie that could have spared a segment or two: the Flesh Fair bit and Rouge City. Actually, Jude Law's character we just might do without should the film be more focused to include younger audience. (I like Jude Law, he's terrific in: Enemy at the Gates 2001; Talented Mr. Ripley 1999; GATTACA 1997.) I quite enjoy his brief exchange with Osment's David in the woods, when he did a dance like movement quite reminiscent of Tommy Steele in "Finian's Rainbow". With Law's part of Gigolo Joe in a Blade Runner sin city scenario, the Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome like fanfare sequence, and especially the Night of the Living Dead kind of imagery on screen that can be scary to a tender age group - A.I. is really not for kids, in spite of the wonderful presence of Haley Joel Osment. Well, no Kubrick's film is for kids, anyway. There we are. The story premise is more for the adults, and the idea of (mass) producing a robot child catered to the parents is more of a challenging question to ponder for the society of man/humans. Without a doubt, the film is superb in its technical production, set design, cinematography, and visual and sound effects. The segments with Frances O'Connor as mother and Osment as David the robot child are the scenes that emanate tenderness and vulnerable human qualities. I also appreciate the talking teddy bear and his enduring (and endearing) relationship with Osment's David. The underwater alien world (of old New York cityscape) and blue fairy myth is a fascinating sequence. While the idea of science supremacy in technically duplicating more look alike David's is sheer horror in itself. Does grief and lost need such a degree of filling the gaps of the human heart? Gigolo Joe is a novel commodity in the future world. Osment's David prototype would have been an ideal dream state with no 'contamination' from the human society - just pure binary goodness. A dream, indeed. A.I. the film feels like Spielberg and Kubrick meeting halfway. The dazzling adventure sequences are truly Spielberg's strokes. The sentiments, somehow, not quite tangibly complete? Perhaps it'd take some repeat viewing and absorption? For now, A.I. belongs to Haley Joel Osment - take the journey with a shining star!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love is Dangerous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh wow. This movie...I'm not certain how coherent my review of it's going to be, because this was a maddening film to watch. I loved most of it-it set up a believable world, where the relationships between man and machine/God and man are paralleled brilliantly. And the questions it forces one to ask out of that are not easily answered, as I also enjoy. Do we really want that kind of power-to be able to grant something that close to the yearning of real life, without giving that life the ability to adapt or let go? And what does that say about our own existence-if we someday find that we, like David, are not as unique as we once had thought?It was the questions about Love that really had me reeling, however. Can it really be manufactured/implanted like that? Are the feelings and pleasures of Love worth its dear, great cost? And is that kind of love perhaps even greater than our own-because it does not give up, does not let go, past what it knows is realistic. I can't even explain most of what this film put into my head, but suffice it to say it is mind-boggling for the most part.The ending, however-I don't want to give away spoilers, and I know the creatures in question are meant to be mechas, not CE3K aliens, but it still is too pat, too easy. It attempts to put a semi-happy closure to what should not be a happy ending for David. They had a couple of earlier parts where they could have ended it and it would have been perfect-you'll see what I mean when you see it.Thought-provoking, brutal, pretentious (in a somewhat good way), artistic, beautiful-all words came to my mind throughout the running time. See it for yourself, and see better what I mean. Not everything comes out well in words.P.S. I agree with that reviewer who was wondering where the Religious Right was in picketing this movie-it has more mocking of religion and God in general than the whole of Dogma, or Monty Python's Life of Brian. I suppose that since this is sci-fi, it went off people's spiritual radars. Well, forget that-if you have faith, you need to see this movie, to see some of the upcoming thought about God. It is a deeply spiritual movie-just watch out for it in some of those 'throwaway' lines by Gigolo Joe and such.</fullReview>

People that criticize this movie make some very bad points; but oh well. So did people about "2001."Yet this movie is no "2001" -- a film that can never be matched -- but rather, "A.I.". People will see someday why this film is so good. It's a good film because of how well it manages to defy the rules, like the ending for example.In a way, I'm kind of glad that many people didn't like the ending, as if it is to mean that people's expectations weren't met.

		<fullReview>Not since Star Wars has a film been so new, so original, yet so classic as A.I. A wonder to behold. A science fiction masterwork. Think the mood of Bladed Runner, mixed with over tones of Pinocchio, undertones of The Wizard of Oz, and of Gattica. This is a film that will define a moment in time, like only great films can. While it does seem hoaky, it is a genre film, and for a sci-fi film, it is among the best in the genre. Osment gives a wondedrous performance, yet the Bear steals the show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say about a movie like Artificial Intelligence?Well, I can say plenty. A.I. was like all the things that people are afraid to talk about, or perhaps all the things that we deep down know could happen in the future, but never had the gall to talk about.It was simply amazing. It was funny to me because half way through the movie, I almost fell asleep, but once the movie was over and I was analyzing later that night, I realized that it was one of the most ingenious projects and stories ever written.I was at first not so interested because of the pace of the movie. At times, it is a very slow movie, but the ideas and vision created compensates for the slowness.This movie depicts three phases. The first phase shows the creation of robots in the 21st century, then the second phase shows a time where the robots are plentiful but humans are hateful. The humans despise robots and kill them for fun. The third phase shows a time that we on earth right now cannot even imagine. It shows a time where robots have completely taken over and that humans are only a memory.The acting was excellent. It really showed how things would be inside the family structure, the social structure, and the own personal mental structure if life was really like it will be during the era of artificial intelligence. The acting shows many different concepts and ideas of how life would be on earth if the creation of artificial intelligence was so massive.A complete must see. In my eyes it was an excellent film. I hate the fact that it received such bad reviews. I guess there are a lot of people on this planet that cannot open their eyes and see a good movie when it finally comes around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A question mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. is a movie I still cannot figure out; meaning, I have no idea how to interpret what I saw, whether I liked what I saw, whether I "got" anything out of what I saw. I think I need to see the film 2 or 3 more times before I get a lasting opinion as to these things...however, I can review the movie based on its surface.Overall, this is a very good film. The storyline is understandable yet still complex. The imagery is one of wonder and beauty. The acting (as usual in a Spielberg) is excellent. Haley Joel Osment is perhaps one of the best actors out there today. The music is subtle and complementary. Some of the scenes are almost jaw-dropping in their power or beauty. This film has real potential for brilliance.However, I don't think it made it, and I don't think it ever will. One reason is that I'm not really sure what the vision was here. Kubrick and Spielberg have two clashing directing styles...and I see many elements of both in this film...to the point where it actually impedes the movie. With 2001, there was one vision...that of Kubrick's...and it is masterfully shone. We may interpret what the movie showed in numerous ways, but the movie was also telling us what to interpret. That is 2001's brilliance. AI didn't seem to grasp what was to be interpreted...machinery? Human extinction? Human feelings? The difference between humans and machines? Add to that the ending, which I thought was completely unnecessary (and completely Spielberg, obviously). The ending does nothing to promote the questions I believe were intended (a major difference between this movie and 2001). To me it was shown to make the audience weep...and to get a good feeling out of a somewhat dark film...something I call "Spielberg sap."I also think that AI was attempting to say something as true...to answer a question. This is especially seen at the end of the film. The problem is you can't answer a vague question very well. And that is the major problem of the movie.The message it brings may be fuzzy, but there are several aspects of this film that shine. The performances of Osment and Jude Law were simply brilliant. William Hurt and Frances O'Connor give solid supporting performances. The special effects were dazzling and yet still appropriate. For as long a movie as it was...it was always entertaining.AI succeeds at the basic function of movies...to entertain. It also provokes thought, encourages discussion, and exceeds the average of filmmaking today. However, the clouded message that this movie brings makes the title not only suit the movie but the message/questions presented by it as well: artificial intelligence.Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely think Spielberg is one of the best directors ever, but for this type of story, I think Kubrick's touch would have made all the difference.

		<fullReview>Hollywood allows for strange bedfellows. What an odd pairing: Speilberg and Kubrick. The result: a jumbled split-personality of a movie. You're never quite sure if the movie is supposed to be a tragic, unsettling look into the future, or a sci-fi fairy tale. It can't decide what it wants to be either. The movie begs for your affection as much as mecha David begs for that of his "mother". Finally, the ending is the most contrived, ridiculous, and strung-out summation I've ever seen. It's a farce as it touts itself as Kubrick-Speilberg creation but it's too cuddly for Kubrick and too dark for Speilberg. Again, it's like its lead character, David: it never quite understands what it's supposed to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outstanding work that should hold meaning long into the future when we look back on what we thought was advanced technology.The Film: memorable and emotional. Refreshingly, the focus was not on the gadgetry -which was impressive- but the human response and responsibility to it.Also impressing was Spielberg's ability to step into the mind of Kubrick and direct the movie as Kubrick truly would. The self-raised questions about the ethical issues were definitely Kubrick.The ending obviously belonged to Spielberg. Even so, I liked the sense of closure he gave us, as well as the feeling of being immersed in a parable.Great cameos by Robin Williams and Chris Rock. Jude Law was not only a wonderful protagonist, but whimsical as well.William Hurt as the Professor played a thankfully small role.I felt that the film was composed of Bladerunner, Pinocchio, Gattaca, A Clockwork Orange and 2001.Eight hours after watching it, I still feel melancholy in the sense that other similar movies have reached a certain emotional pocket.Decide for yourself whether or not to see it. Those on the extreme sides of opinion expect too much out of it or are too passionate, as they want the typical dark Kubrick ending.</fullReview>

Now, looking back on some of the reviews that have been cast since then, I have to ask myself, why in the world do people like this movie? I can see where the movie might be thought provoking, it being science fiction, a genre that has made us think time and time again over the years, but with all the useless dramatic effects, this movie just isn't worth the discussion. As far as the Spielberg/Kubrick hot button issue, I think that many of you have carried that a bit too far. Sure, in my original review, I said I thought the movie would have been much better had Kubrick himself finished it, and I stand by that statement, but not because I want to slight Spielberg as a FILMMAKER, only a storyteller. The storytelling in this movie, frankly, blows. It could have been made so much better, so very much better. For me, and realize, this is just me saying this, so any of you out there who have a different opinion, I am not attacking you, Spielberg has always had severe shortcomings with the way he tells his stories. Saving Private Ryan was a truly amazing film, but the story was fake. Jurassic Park was an amazingly well-made film, but had no plot. Certainly, films like Close Encounters... and Schindler's List are films to be heralded, but what about Hook? And Always? Put this movie in Spielberg's dud pile. It was just awful storytelling. I just can't get over the fact that Kubrick would have told the story much better. I will give you A.I. lovers this- technically, this film was made brilliantly, but glossing over bad storytelling with good filmmaking does not make for a good movie. It makes for a Michael Bay film with less filmmaking skills.</fullReview>

If you look closely, you will see that they have circuits inside.2. The entire so-called "happy" ending where David met up with his mother again did NOT actually happen. This was a dream that the advanced mechas helped create to make him happy. They read his memories and gave him exactly what he wanted.3. David was important because he was around during the time when the humans (i.e. their creators) were around. David could provide information about the human species. Just like us learning about the ancient Egyptians, for example.On a different note, the movie did has some problems. My main problem was that Teddy seemed to be way more intelligent then he should have been. He seemed more advanced than David and Joe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Study in Intelligent Artifice: A.I. - A Collaboration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A.I." - The key is in the title "Artificial Intelligence". In some academic circles, the term is an oxymoron joke:If it's "artificial" it can't possibly be "intelligent."Well - the real question behind "A.I." is: If a movie is "artificial" - can a movie be "intelligent"?Note: That the French critics would say that Hollywood Studio Movies are never "intelligent", being "stupide", and Jean-Luc Goddard would claim that no Spielberg movie could ever be intelligent.The conflict, in the film, is the issue of "organic" versus "mechanical" - "real" versus "artificial".There is a limit to man-made 'realism' - and if a machine could "feel" emotions - is it a "real" person?If it is, what are the ethical issues that might need to be examined?Within that framework, the ending is a puzzle - and "No" - Stanley/Steve did not script a third act to mimic "2001 A Space Odyssey" end-sequence with more cute space aliens: Those aren't aliens forming a local-area network at the end of the film.Those are 2000-year evolved "artificial intelligences" performing archeology in an attempt to understand their long extinct makers. In fact, "they" travel in non-aerodynamic "aircraft" that - as in TRON - "de-rez" when they are no longer needed.By established movie rules, you can only "de-rez" simulated objects: These are non-human Intelligences that can mix simulation with real, because the Real is Simulation, an extensible hyper-surface of quantum computing and string theory.The puzzle at the End of the Final Act, is with "how real is 'Real'":If it's not real - then a moment is forever - since it can be replayed.If it is real - then a moment is forever because you, the viewer, will remember it, having "experienced" it.But - the moment can't be real, because it -is- in a movie, and can be replayed forever.Then, why do you, the Moviegoer, really, really, care about a fictional robot at the end of the film?If a movie can make the Moviegoer feel "real" emotions, are the emotions somehow "artificial" and "false"?Or is the Moviegoer, himself, in a higher dimension simulation?At the heart of every Kubrick film is the problem of the Moviegoer: Kubrick deliberately shoots scenes with direct shots off of mirrors and hundreds of reflected surfaces.Why? Because Stanley's camera is never ever seen in any reflected image - and there is a very subtle psychological trick that the mind makes - where if you see a mirrored face - and there's no obvious reason to not believe the reflected image - then you become, subconsciously, the person in the mirror. Identity is transfered.Playing the Moviegoer against Stanley's camera technique is the key to analyzing Stanley's films: Steven could never before be that deliberately provocative using film technique alone - but Stanley could be.When Stanley passed this film treatment to Steven, he did so to get Steven to mature in his craft.What's nice is that Steven provided what Stanley lacked: Heart.This is one film that lays to rest the emotional aridity of all prior Kubrick films. If the Master Kubrick was emotionally remote, a perfectionist, a monster with other people's egos, then this movie is an apology of sorts, taking his ghost back to his beloved post-WWII NYC after long years of foreign exile in the UK.Note: You should only see this movie in a theater: NTSC video-frame cropping will kill this film. Complain if your theater spills any of the image frame off of the screen.The movie works in a very haunting way - so stay for the credit roll.A subtitle for the film could have been "A Study in Intelligent Artifice".Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with potential...But?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only seen the movie once and so can't give you a final opinion on it. But I do have a few problems with it at the moment.I went to see this movie because of its potential. Both Kubrick and Spielberg had/have great ability. They can make very good movies. I am disappointed at the moment though.All of the great thought and insight that could have been in this movie seemed to only be hinted at. The beginning of the movie teases you with these great questions of love, humanity, soul, etc. But they are all just left hanging. There is no discussion or thought put into them. Is this the original intent or is this accidental? Am I expecting to much from Hollywood? I don't think I am asking too much of the directors, but maybe too much from the financial people.There were also a few writing problems. How is it that a world full of "mechas" can have people that seem to understand almost nothing about them? How could that company have been so shortsighted as to not explain anything about "David" to his new "parents"? Or was that the intent? If so then how stupid were those "parents"? Is it not common sense that you would need to teach this "boy"? It goes on from there.Maybe I just think too much about this sort of thing.The quality of the acting and effects was excellent. I would recommend the movie because of that alone, but not the rest. I will think about it and see it again though. I may have missed things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such an under-rated movie because nobody really understands what they've seen. It's the modern story, almost verbatim, of Pinnochio. And it's NOT FOR KIDS! Nor, in my opinion, was the original version. When I was young, I thought that the story of Pinnochio was a nightmare--when he turned into a donkey? How awful was that!Steven Spielberg took a tremendous risk in doing this film. It's bright and it's dark, but it's something that you'll be talking about around the water fountain for a while. Haley Joel Osment didn't blink once in this movie, except at the end when he finally closes his eyes. Very symbolic.It would help viewers to read the story of Pinnochio before attending the film, because that's the story.PLEASE DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!The ending was exactly like the fable--Pinnochio does, indeed, become a "boy," in the terms of the modern "mechas" who have found him and need to know what it's like to be human. I think this is the part that nobody got. He becomes "a boy" because he was the only mecha to be instilled with human programming. The other elements of the fable are there: The Blue Fairy, of course, and Jude Law as Jiminy Cricket to help him with his conscience. You can draw other parallels on the Flesh Fair...This is one movie where I couldn't advise my friends to see it or not to see it. For it stands alone, and I hope that the rest of you out there don't judge it on purely simple terms. I saw it over the Fourth of July in Palm Springs and at the end, many people were literally sobbing.Please view it with an open heart and mind. If you don't care for it, you can ban me from this board forever.Sincerely,Kristine Andersen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many have said this, but this movie was very disappointing. If fact, this movie not only dragged on for too long, but also made several members of the audience uncomfortable, myself included. Spielberg would have been wise to drop the whole Pinnochio/Blue Fairy theme. He's covered all that ground anyway in Close Encounters and Hook. Brian Adliss - the author of the short story - supposedly emplored Kubrick not to resort to Pinnochio themes when Kubrick was adapting the story for the screen.I think the movie would have worked better if the boy did not know he was a machine, or if the parents didn't know. Or if the parents were also machines - or something that would make the whole thing a little more mysterious. Instead we got three hours of an unhappy, terrorized boy looking for his mommy. The visuals were fine indeed, as was the part played by Jude Law. But the movie fails miserably in presenting any worthwhile ideas, exploring the man-machine relationship, discovering some heretofore unknown truth, or even solving a mystery. Hell, I would have been satisfied to find out who killed Gigilo Joe's client - and what happened to him afterward.It's sad that the studio did not test market this movie before releasing it. I think they could have improved it somewhat. I bet Speilberg is silently embarrassed about the outcome. Now he'll probably release a special edition and claim that the original version was not his vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not really that big of a Steven Spielberg fan, but perhaps I should be one now. This film was completely excellent. Everything about it is simply perfect. It is not boring, stupid, dumb, hokey, or anything like that. The incredibly hated ending of the film is NOT stupid sad-like. It's the perfect ending to the perfect movie.I'm a really big fan of Kubrick, and he is my favorite director. He made some really great films, some of the best films ever made ("A Clockwork Orange," "2001," and "Barry Lyndon" come to mind). And the fact that "A.I." is a tribute to a great director from Steven Spielberg is great. You can actually notice some (actually, very few) of Kubrick touches here and there. And then comes another complaint from viewers -- "There is not enough of Kubrick and too much Spielberg." Well guess what? Stanley Kubrick did not make this movie, Steven Spielberg did.I don't know if I took this film as a Kubrick/Spielberg collaboration, or just as a Steven Spielberg film, but it just worked for me. The first hour is where you might find most of the Kubrick. It is sad, cold sometimes, with great shots and some great emotion expressed on the screen. As it moves to the second hour, it's transition from some Kubrick to mostly Spielberg is seamless -- the movie really works as a whole. Even the second half isn't happy-fluff that some Spielberg films might possibly be.The film works completely. Amazing direction, amazing acting (Haley Joel Osment has proved me wrong... I went in thinking I was going to see "Pay It Forward"/"The Sixth Sense" performance again, but I didn't. You have got to see it to believe it), amazing set design, amazing story, amazing characters, everything basically amazing.I could care a less about people thinking otherwise. I don't simply care. This film is a beauty to behold and to look at for hours. I really like it that much.I guess I must say that Spielberg does do one thing that most film makers try to do and fail to accomplish: to create the most awe-inspiring films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is unfortunate that Kubrick was not around to finish it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Artificial Intelligence did what any good piece of art does, it gets you to think about your own life, and learn a lesson about life and how your perspective might not be the correct perspective. The movie starts harmlessly enough, with a board discussing the release of a new potential "child" product that will love its owner unconditionally as a child loves a parent. The question that was raised in the room is how can man truly love an "inanimate" object as they love their own child. The movie then takes you through the process of the family who is used to test how this "child" will act in its environment, and shows how and why mankind could not except something that is so literal yet so good. This movie shows the literal nature of computers and its usage for good. as opposed to 2001 which showed the dark side of this nature. The movie brought out man's darker subjectivity versus the objectivity of the objects that they create. These ideas were brought out to make you think as Kubricks best movies tend to do. However, Spielberg does add too much of the Hollywood edge to the movie which in some ways added artistic elements that enhanced the movie which Kubrick was not known for(Full Metal Jacket being shot in a non-tropical area for the Vietnam war scenes). The visuals were stunning, from the scenery to the landscape to the toys of the future. However, the Hollywood ending that was added took as much away from the movie as George Lucas revealing in Episode one of Star Wars that the force was a biological being instead of an idea that can be learned. IF Kubrick would have finished the movie, it would have ended a good 10 - 15 minutes earlier and would have really driven home the idea that at least I took away from the movie is that, we can program computers to do anything, but can we accept what we program. Unfortunately, Spielberg has been too worried about putting together tripe that sells well at the box office(Saving Private Ryan, after the first 30 minutes of the most intense movie making ever) than taking a risk with a movie that might make one think. This movie would have been long enough at 127 to 133 minutes as opposed to the 143 minutes listed, and would have a more profound impact as both a piece of art, and classic cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big disappointment despite good acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a major disappointment considering the talents involved. An extremely well acting cast cannot save this film whose story just doesn't know where to go. This mixture of future and fairy tale scenarios conveys nothing new, has a lot of loose ends, and leaves too many questions unanswered. Its characters remain underdeveloped, as a result of which you cannot connect with the protagonists and so you just don't care. Apart from that, it's way too long and has a ridiculous ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know a lot of people didn't like the ending, well neither did I. For one thing, I think Spielberg pulled too many strings to give David what he wanted. Yes, I know that's the way Kubrick wanted it to end, put I think he would have seen it and gone,"You know what, I don't know." Also anybody that thinks that was a happy ending, re-think it, because it's not. All those shot's of David spending time with his mom, him showing her the pictures that he colored, and at last the "I love you David" never happened. While all of this is going on, David is still in that ice cave, surrounded by evolve mecha's feeding off his memories. It's all his fantasy, it's not real,but it's appropriate because he himself isn't real either, so you have this really bizarre and bitter sweet ending that can't possibly be considered "happy"Regards</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, Messy, Misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For one, let's congratulate the movie on its ambitiousness. Here is a strong social and political allegory wrapped in both fairy tale and sci-fi guises. If you didn't like this movie, I'd wager that:1) You took the story and structure literally. A.I. is not particularly a movie about a boy wishing to be human, and though the movie follows David's story, it is far more a statement on the world around him than it is about the boy robot himself.2) You assumed that you were to identify with David, and thus felt cheated at a character who seemed flat. The audiences response to David is supposed to be frustrating, as he is so charming, yet ultimately hollow. Kubrick means more to denigrate humanity (and this is certainly a movie that hates humanity) than to anthropomorphize the 'mechas'. After all, if real little boys are ultimately machines programmed to love, then how are they better than David? Kubrick clearly believes that they aren't.3) You were put off by the politics. A.I. is one of the most vocally political mainstream movies I've ever seen. There is an indictment of middle-upper class immorality, which sees children as possessions more than beings. Then there is the portrayal of lower-class xenophobia and intellectual emptiness in the flesh fair. In other words.. it's not so much that David is a wonderful thing. It's that the rest of the human world is so damningly awful. Even the last scene, supposedly Spielberg's final stab at sentiment, hammers home the point that the humans who had fashioned David were ultimately too immoral, too stupid and too uncaring to actually give him the one thing they themselves had designed him to desire. Maybe Kubrick thinks that God had made us in his image, yet lacked the ability to ever make us happy.</fullReview>

I won't go into the plot, everyone else has. I can't believe how many putzes misread the ending. It was more Kubrick than any other part of the film. In fact, this was exactly the ending that Kubrick fought for (for 15 years!) I love Kubrick, but the purists are being jerks to Spielberg. Jan Harlan and the rest of Kubrick's family are ecstatic with the way the film turned out. If Stanley were alive he would approve, and he would probably break his usual silence to defend Steven. I'm very picky about movies. I love Kubrick, Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman, Ozu, Cronenberg, Scorsese, Cocteau, etc., you get the picture. The purists complain about Steven being manipulative. Bull! Compare him the hacks like Roland Emmerich, Boaz Yakin, BRUCKHEIMER-BAY, Dean Devlin, etc. For all you so-called science fiction fans out there, excuse me, but there hasn't been any real good science fiction in the last 20-25 years.

		<shortDescription>A very difficult subject handled very well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is many decades into the future and humankind has developed by leaps in bounds in the world of science and technology. Nevertheless, it seems this great sophistication wasn't strong enough to stop the water levels from rising and swallowing all of the worlds coastal cities. As the movie begins we are introduced to a group of robot makers led by professor Allen Hubby (William Hurt) a man who is determined to make a perfect 'mecha' by creating a machine that can express emotion and actually love a subject. The inspiration is to create a child, perhaps for the need of couples who can't conceive, or for anyone who wishes a child. Is this fair to play god one might ask? A being that is in a sense programaticaly perfect for a family? But then a scientist asks a more deeper moral question that of, can a human or even should a human feel emotion for something that may very well show true love but is not REAL?!This premise is the basis for the story behind A.I. and it is a fascinating deep question that doesn't have an answer nor does the movie try to provide one. Haley Joel Osmont is David the creation of a cybertronic company. He will be hard wired forever to the family that chooses him, and the company finds the perfect couple who have had a child but has been injured and seems never to live again as he is frozen in a cryogenic state.While the mother is very fearful of this creation her husband brings David home to mend her pain, complications then arise when their natural born son recovers, and is brought back into the family.In a gut wrenching decision the mother decides as much as David will never hate her, she can't accept his love cause he is not a real child and thus abandons him as he is left to ponder his existence and wanting to become a real boy. This then enters the second half of the story where David realises the value of 'mechas' as he makes friends with a sex-robot named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and they try to survive in a much crueler world where mechas are forgotten, and sometimes captured and tortured in live festivals called 'Flesh Fairs'.First off, the acting by Haley is top notch, as is Jude Laws performance as a stud-bot who's only purpose is to please his female customers. While the movie is a bit long, it's never dull and the idea of attaching emotional connections with an inorganic object is a fascinating one. Was his mom decision correct? Was it cruel? Was it right? There are also many other aspects to this situation particualrly in the best scene in the film POSSIBLE SPOILER where a 'Flesh Fair' producer captures David and displays him to an audience showing his disgust at David's human-ness. The producer replies that this is what humanity has done to replace us, and it is vile and must be destroyed. While in fear David begs for his life and the crowd responds in horror with one spectator claiming that mechas don't beg for their lives. In the crowds shock they decide to pelt the producer from the stands and storm the venue, allowing David to escape. But the question is, was the producer wrong?END POSSIBLE SPOILERIt is these challenging questions that made the film engaging, entertaining, and overal very enjoyable for me. The final ending while interesting is a little confusing (I had another person tell me he thought the last 20 minutes of the film was a horrific idea and in many ways I can believe it). Although no oscar performances are present it is wonderfuly acted, enjoyable and should be seen. A very difficult subject handled very well.Rating 7 1/2 out of 10PS - I want one of those Robot Teddy Bears</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but still an exceptional achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is certainly carried by the acting of Haley Joel Osment and, to a lesser extent (him not being the lead), Jude Law. Had these two performances been any lesser than what they were, and they were amazing, the film would have likely flopped. Osment beautifully portrays a robot who looks like you and me, and loves like us, but ultimately is still just a robot, not one of us. He is not a shy, scared boy who can't fit in (6th Sense), but he is an outsider who really IS different from other boys, and he is desperately seeking approval from his mother in the form of her love.  The plot of this movie has been summarized numerous times, so I will avoid repetitiveness (?) and just comment on specific portions of the film. I have mostly good things to say about the first two thirds of the movie; Osment anchors the movie and his performance evokes feelings of desperation, compassion, and hurt from us along with moments of comedy and a sense of wonder and anticipation throughout. When Law joins him, the comedy and entertainment picks up while still advancing the story at a slow but deliberate pace. The scene where we see haters of the machines in massive numbers destroying them plays out as too long and rather boring; it manages to at least advance the two characters, but Speilberg should have seen how weak the scene was and deleted/ replaced it. The final third of the movie is the most controversial, and the most criticized, for good reason.** SPOILERS BEGIN **The first 2/3rds of this movie, and especially the first third, is very dark. We consistently feel uncomfortable, and scared for what might happen to Osment; more specifically, what other PEOPLE might do to him, because he is a machine and he doesn't learn how to act "normal" in routine social situations. We learn early on that this is hands-down Spielberg's darkest movie, and it is most certainly not for kids. But the ending, no matter how much you like, hate, understand or are confused by it, enjoy it or are frusturated by it, It Is A Happy Ending. It is really a Disney/Twilight Zone ending, if there ever was one. David gets his mother's love, only in the not-too near future. The ending negates the darkness of the movie (no doubt it is only dark due to Kubrick's influence on it). The ending represents where Spielberg tries to tie in his own "successful long magnificent journey" type film with Kubricks "dark human nature" exploits. The result, as you have seen, is a muddy ending to a magnificent story. ** SPOLIERS END **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had a very interesting story. If about one hour could have been shaved off the final edit, it would have kept my interest and I would consider it a great movie. Botton line: WAY TOO LONG!!It did have it's up moments however: The acting was amazing. Mostly outstanding from Haley Joel Osment (who wouldn't expect that though) and Frances O'Connor.I had only seen her in Bedazzled before this and she really shocked me with her talent. Also,the effectswere outstanding. My favorite set was the New York City submerged under water. Every other person I've talked to about this movie considered the "Fleshfair" to be sick. Disagreeing, I have to say that the fleshfair was the one part of the movie that actually held 100% of my interest.Overall, I was dissapointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jude Law looks great, but his role lacks depth ... Some scenes seem explicitly borrow from Mad-Max or TV scifi ... Other scenes are interesting mostly because of the dynamic forces put in opposition to each other. The strength of the acting - except for the well played central character of the boy robot - is hampered by the writing. This film was designed to be supported by studio computer animation. An hour into the film, I was certain my wife would let us depart - but doggedly, she made us hang on. I think the film does pick-up in the later half, yet over-all, this murky textured film does not have enough humanity to be interesting or enjoyable. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. is truly a remarkable movie, one which should never have been released in the mindless, brain dead movie goer days of summer. In the fall or winter months, an ambitious film like this might work. Now, peruse the reviews: its slow, its too long, etc. What a shame.A.I. is as thrilling as it is disturbing, a masterful critique of our own society of the spectacle. As it explores the depths of our own consciousness, it embraces the power of our genius as well. I speak in general terms: I have to. It was my pleasure to go into this filming knowing nothing about it. I would like anyone who is daring enough to accept the intellectual and emotional challenge of this film to have the same ignorance as I did going into seeing it.I will say this: Kubrick meets Spielberg is an astonishing accomplishment, one which should rightfully be remembered as a classic in years to come. The dark and penetrating Kurbrick meets the Visionary Emotional Puppeteering of Spielberg. This was a three hanky movie and the best film I've seen since Being John Malkovich.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with my husband. I liked it, and he hated it.Anyone else viewing the movie will probably either love it or hate it, too. It is visually very appealing and it asks a lot of intriguing questions without spoonfeeding you any of the answers. My husband felt the ending did not fit the rest of the movie. He felt that it would have ended better if we had faded to black before the last scene in the film. Many people felt that way. I thought the ending did fit - but I agree that there were some flaws in the way it was presented.The one glaring thing that I would remove from the movie is the annoying narration. We are adults. We do not need the storybook narration to understand the story, we already "get" the fairytale aspects, and we definetly did not need the sappier Spielbergian moments of narration.If they release a DVD version where you can turn narration off, I think I will have found a great gem of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had so much potential. A dream visualized by Stanley Kubrick directed by Steven Spielberg. That is a combo! But Spielberg is so wrapped up in pleasing the masses that he failed to bring Kubricks vision to full force, and ended up making it a Pinocchio for the new century. Although it has stunning visual effects, which will undoubtedly recieve an oscar, except for the first half, which is superb, the movie doesn't seem to resemble anything that is Kubrick. Overall, I still enjoyed it. And Haley Joel Osment's acting is the best I have seen it. If he can be nominated for his role in The Sixth Sense, he should receive the oscar for his role in A.I.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What promised to be a provocative, compelling story turns out to be an internally inconsistent, tediously long mess that sullies both Spielberg and Kubrick's reputations. The opening act of the boy's introduction to the family was quite promising, but the filmmakers clearly had no idea where to go, how to get out of the story. It takes them 2,000 years to find a resolution. This film is the worst yet from either man, and has to be the artistic (and now, judging by the boxoffice, commercial) disappointment of the summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame we'll all be tempted to dissect how much of this film toattribute to Kubrick and how much to Spielberg, because it canonly lead us away from appreciating the film that has been madehere. Clearly a blend of styles between the two directors, "A.I." isan uncommonly ambitious science fiction film, perhaps the mostambitious since, well, "2001" and "A Clockwork Orange." One of the film's most interesting gambits is that it spends a good45 minutes inside a suburban home without much of a glimpsebeyond it. In this opening section, the filmmakers explore thethemes of what makes a person human, and what makes a familya family. As it turns out, this is time well invested, because theremaining 2/3 of the film expands outward exponentially, until weare, as in "2001," on the brink of the infinite, and the themes of theopening section are expanded to their philosophical extremes. This is not pretentious bunk. Note how carefully religious themesare interwoven here (David appears in white, as an angel; hissearch for the Blue Fairy a reference to the Virgin Mary), as well aspsychological elements from fairy tales (Pinocchio, The Wizard ofOz). Even psychoanalytical elements appear (David's obsessiveneed for his mother, the distinctly vaginal design of Rouge City,and the film's closing shot [which I won't reveal]). This multilayeredfilm will reward multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I alone here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~~~Spoiler Warning~~~I really don't get it. So far there is not one person out here who saw the same movie I did. We are talking about the movie 'Artificial Intelligence' right? So then why is everyone giving this masterpiece such a bum rap?When I watch a movie I start by asking myself, "What is the point"? Every movie has a point. All movie makers want to tell us something. A lot of the time (thankfully) they are forcing us to take a minute away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and try to find meaning to our existence. Sure there are some movies that are put out there for nothing but cheap laughs or poor FX, but this wasn't one of them.Did no one else see the point I saw in this film? Our greatest struggle is finding reason to human existence and this movie suggests an answer: love and human connection. Yes it did look like the movie could have ended with the fall into the water (you know what I mean), but then it would be a tragedy. I am so glad the movie continued to show us that life doesn't have to be that cold. I thought the movie had a very enlightening and uplifting ending. the POINT is that we are looking in the wrong place and will be unhappy if we try to find love anywhere else but inside ourselves. I might be wrong but I will take a stretch and try to suggest to you (I will be glad to hear your reasons why not) that the mother at the end of the film was nothing more than what was inside him, his memory (otherwise where was the rest of her life and family at that time?).This movie made me feel so much peace at the end because it says to me that we are only able to be "real" when we can love and be loved. We can search the world over for thousands of years but the truth is that love is not "out there", it is inside each of us. And during that search we ARE "caged" as teddy suggested when they were under water.The soul searching that goes on in this movie is incredible and even if it was not what you expected (heaven forbid), you cannot deny it's brilliance in portraying the concept of why we exist. I hope that you also caught the meaning to all the bird references and if not, look up 'St. Hildegard of Bingen (Liber de Sutilitatum)' and maybe even "Ba" (Egyptian). The symbolism is so thick in this film that the beautiful cinematography and excellent performances were second on my mind upon leaving the theatre. Is there anyone else out there that went beneath the surface of this film? I want to hear what YOU think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw A.I. last night, I came out after a long two and a half hours with one word on my mind: "Weird." There were so many things that didn't make sense in this movie. For example, the basis of the story was that a robot boy, David, was programmed to love, and he wanted "mommy" to love him back. But the only reason he ever love mommy in the first place is because she programmed him to. It seems stupid too me. I know I'm not making any sense, but what I'm trying to say is that anyone that likes si-fi should go see the movie because there are many interesting ideas aout what the future will be like discussed. Also, David (Haely Joel Osment or whatever his name may be) is absolutely amazing and is great to watch. The cities of the future and the computer animation is great also.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** I didn't like the ending when I first saw it. I thought it should have ended where the robots find David. That way he would have "become a real boy" in the sense that he could have lived with others like him -- that is, with other robots. I was annoyed that Spielberg seemed to come in after that point and take over with an entirely different movie. Did he really need to go into all that detail about explaining how the robots could bring Monica back to life? Did the narrator have to intrude so much?... Did it have to be sooo slooow?!?Ok, I agree there were a few places where Kubrick's rough edges were smoothed too much by Spielberg. But I've read a number of people say the ending was changed to a happy one. I definitely have to disagree with that point. The ending left me feeling two completely different ways. One was essentially, "oh, how nice, David finally got to spend some time with his adopted mother." A little corny although typical Hollywood. But the other is harder to explain. For me, it is made up of such disturbing questions as: Was that really David's mother? I mean, if a person could really be brought back to life, are they really the "same" person? It depends on how you define "same," right? Is human consciousness even real or simply perceived? Is love real or simply perceived? How long is eternal?... Admittedly, stuff I've seen in other movies before. But that doesn't make A.I. a bad movie in my book. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie wide open for discussion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's cool about this film is there is so-o much to discuss. Like technology, psychology, jealousy, unrequited love. Perhaps the most curious one is the "real" theme, or "mecha" vs. "orga"; natural/vs.man- made, and what human beings perceive to be "real". What I find even more curious than the film is the audience's understanding for the mother's reactions. OK, yes I guess I understand *why* she abandoned him. I don't think I'd do the same, but I realize why she felt she "had" to do it. What's strange is that when I talked about it with everyone, most people said "David's mother left him because his emotions weren't real" and "she knew he wasn't real, so how could his love be real?" OK, I'm sorry, but that's bullsh*t. She got scared. She had fallen in love with a mecha and it scared her to think of what that meant about herself. Afraid that she wouldn't value her role as mother to her "real family". She was scared of someone loving her *just* for her.David's love *is* real! Why oh why do people keep saying that it isn't? He was programmed by a scientist to love..so..he loves; he loves his mother! The only difference between the love David has for his mother and the love Martin has, is that David has no motive. He just does. Which leads me to another theme in the story. The likeness between science and perfection. David's love is perfect, Gigolo Joe is the perfect lovemaker, ***SPOILER WARNING*** the mechas in the end were perfect in their compassion for David.Something major in AI reminded me of &lt;The Matrix&gt;. Remember when Fishburn's character replies to Neo's "This isn't real." with "What is real? If you mean something you can see, touch, taste, feel, hear, you are simply talking about sensory responses.".....Now. Think of the exact opposite situation. David is programmed to love. This is certain. His love can be proven. You can ask the scientist, if you really wanted him to, he could show you how he made the chip, you could touch it,etc etc. But wait a minute. People are still saying David's love is not real. It is as scientifically and tangibly real as real can be, and yet human beings are still in denial that a mecha deserves to be loved. At one point in the film someone looks at David and says, "A lot of love went into this child." The scientist who created David built an image of his own child. I believe he needed to feel forgiven and loved after his son left him, so he didn't feel guilty for his son's death. So he created "David".I could go on and on but I'll stop and say that I haven't seen a film that made me think this hard since Twelve Monkeys. Yes, the true beauty of sci-fi.;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a very interesting combination of science fiction, fantasy and sentimentality with great performances by all involved. Haley Joel Osment gives another solid performance to match and even surpass his role in The Sixth Sense. And he has much better director here, of course. Francis O'Connor is also good as the robot boy's mother. And Jude Law is a delight as the sex robot. As for the plot, it is somewhat schizophrenic and disjointed but not entirely without merit (Spielberg was forced to cut many expository scenes to reduce the running time to a reasonable period). ***Warning*** SPOILERS coming. I would have liked to see a better motivation for Francis O'Connor's love of the boy plus her abandonment of him. Also, the death of one of Jude Law's customers is not clearly explained. But all in all, I would definitely recommend this movie to any adult and any mature children older than about 12. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film, but it begins to drag.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While seeing Steven Spielbergs brilliant AI, I was struck with wonder and haunted in ways only the best movies can do. In case you have been in a cave the movie is about a couple who recieves a robot child to replace their child who has cancer and is cryrogenically frozen,until a cure can be found. The beginning parts with the family and Haley Jo Osmet as the Robot child David are fantastic. From the scence where he creepily follows her around the apartment to him watching them eat dinner as he mocks their movements with a fork and a bowl. The problem with this type of robot is it is programmed to love unconditioally and the love is programmed so strongly that if the parent has to give the child back the best thing to do is to take it to the factory for its destruction. Trouble begins when the real son is cured and comes home and breeds nothing but contempt for David, to the son David is a little toy to messed with. After a horrible accident by his mother in the woods with only a robotic Teddy Bear as his guide, (by the way the bear is a riot). In the forest David meets Gigolo Joe a pleasure model designed for sexual gratification, and this begins the dark second half of this film. While the first half is light but creepy Spielberg, the second half is dark gloomy Kubrik. With such things as a flesh fair, (don't ask) and other haunting scenes. This half works as well if not better then the first half, and then it all goes to hell. The last half hour of this movie is atrocious, it was a waste of time and I so steamed they felt it needed to be in the film. I won't give away anything but the movie could have ended with a much tougher and more haunting ending then it did, because after the Kubrik half is over we get a final Spielbergian half hour. The final half hour is misguided like Hook, and I think completely unneccessary, all in all though a good film. Haley Jo Osmet is sensation and Jude Law is a riot. It gets a A+ for the first two hours a F for the last Half hour, so final grade B+.</fullReview>

However, Jude Law was UNDER-USED (what a remarkable performance!!!) and his exit from the film abrupt, and leaving you wondering about his true purpose in the film. Kingsley's narration is where the movie fell apart. Once the "2000 years later" line was delivered, the integrity of an otherwise stunning film was shattered. Sure Kubrick's films have a way of making a long term impact... Sure most people don't see the genius of them when they are first released... But this WASN'T a Kubrick film. This was Steven's film, and he made HOOK. The ending of the movie was terrible. Life goes on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I have to say I thought this movie was pure crap.Sure, there were a few bright spots - excellent performances by Haley Osment and Jude Law, great special effects, and the scope of this movie was enormous - but it fell utterly flat for me, mostly because we (the audience) are supposed to sit there like idiots and take certain facts and/or events for granted, and not question their validity. The results are glaring errors that will annoy any movie-goer with an I.Q. over 20.I'm not talking about the fact that they can make robots that "love", or anything other futuristic elements. I'm talking about things like:-the fact that David &amp; Jigolo Joe fly all the way to Manhattan, and just "happen" to know EXACTLY which building to land on. Whoa - they didn't have any idea where their final destination was supposed to be - it was just somewhere in Manhattan... Ooops, did I notice something I shouldn't? :/-after landing, David bursts through the door (conveniently located a few feet from where they landed) and cries out for "Professor Hobby!" Buh?! Since WHEN did he start looking for Professor Hobby? Wasn't he looking for the Blue Fairy?? How did he even know about a "Professor Hobby", when earlier in the movie he wasn't able to tell anybody where he was created, or who created him? You got it, folks - just keep the drool oozing down your chin, it doesn't get any better.-after Professor Hobby tells David how proud he is, and how he will go and get the team to listen to his story "we can't wait to hear it", he conveniently walks out of the room, never to be seen again. Now tell me my good citizens, if, say, your dog ran away for a few weeks and then came back to you, would you a). leave it in the backyard and say "stay boy, I'll be back in a half an hour with the rest of the family", or b). would you take that sucker inside and chain it up so it couldn't get away again? Common sense, people! Of course, after Professor Hobby leaves, David jumps out the window. *sigh* I can't take it...-after Gigolo Joe rescues David in the aquacopter (I think that was what it was called - but who really cares?), he himself is sucked away by the police. Gee, do you suppose the police would not want to investigate David too? No, I guess the prudent thing to do is to leave that young boy to zip away in a police vehicle. I can't stand it...-on that topic, after Joe is sucked away, how come David is miraculously able to pilot the ship, whereas before he couldn't seem to fly 10 feet without crashing into everything? (Hence Joe piloted the ship). Oh yeah - I'm not supposed to notice that. Common sense indicators turned OFF, stupidity sensors turned ON.There are many more things I could mention - those are the few that come immediately to mind. I personally find it insulting when a movie is so poorly put together, it demands the audience to take such things for granted. Didn't somebody notice anything wrong in the editing of this film? Didn't anybody care?Apart from these glaring deficiencies, this film was wayyyy too long, suffers from poor acting on the part of several characters (Professor Hobby comes to mind), and has a sugar coated fairy-candy ending. When the alien started talking to David, I actually saw several people leave the theater. It was just that stupid. I can't say I blamed them, I couldn't WAIT for this picture to end. Let me tell you, I have only seen disgusted people walk out of one other movie in my entire life, so that should speak volumes about the CRAP that is this film.Save your money, folks - unless you are dumber than your average VCR, you will detest this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST and WORST film I've ever seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two of the greatest most shocking film directors of all time, one film that showcases their greatest strengths, and touches you in ways only they can... Until we bring aliens into picture. What a sad, pitiful ending to an otherwise brilliant masterpiece. However, Jude Law was UNDER-USED (what a remarkable performance!!!) and his exit from the film abrupt, and leaving you wondering about his true purpose in the film. Kingsley's narration is where the movie fell apart. Once the "2000 years later" line was delivered, the integrity of an otherwise stunning film was shattered. Sure Kubrick's films have a way of making a long term impact... Sure most people don't see the genius of them when they are first released... But this WASN'T a Kubrick film. This was Steven's film, and he made HOOK. The ending of the movie was terrible. Life goes on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie ISN'T a re-vamped Pinocchio story. It IS told in a fairy-tale way, typical of Spielberg. But if you're not a Spielberg fan, don't let that stop you from seeing this movie. There are disturbing, dark scenes that I imagine are part of Kubrick's influence.The overall theme is based on a question that is brought up in the very beginning of the movie. I don't want to spoil it, so I'll just give this clue - it's asked of William Hurt's character in the beginning. Halle is superb. I look forward to seeing him in future films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are someone for whom mortality is a deeply troubling and fascinating subject, and are philosophic by nature, AI will be one of your all time favorite movies. It is the perfect segue to 2001:A Space Odyssey, for the year 2001, and a major work.If you are, to be kind, more of a surface or even shallow person, who doesn't like to think about the BIG PICTURE (get it?), then apparently, you may well hate it.Suffice it to say, Osment for best Actor, Spielberg for best Director (or will he get shafted?), and AI for Best Picture (Moulin Rouge the only competition so far).Thinkers rejoice. Dullards beware.George W. - skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts out as the best science fiction movie of all time and promptly goes downhill from there never to recover. Frankly, this is a schizophrenic movie. Frances O'Connor and Haley Joel Osment start off great. They are heartbreaking to watch as they try to make a family doomed to fail. There's a lot of cruelty done to David by his mother, so as I watched the ending I was astounded. Forget Close Encounters, this is the ending from Hook. Personally, when Gigolo Joe is sucked off screen, they could have ended the movie there. Another annoying aspect was David's treatment of Teddy (it's no better than his family's treatment of him). The snarling teddy bear was a more developed character than David. Brian Aldiss was right. They shouldn't have put in the f-ing blue fairy. If you go see this movie, just exit when Jude Law exits. Trust me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AI draws people because of Spielberg &amp; Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg &amp; Kubrick newest cinematic creation AI was expected to be the biggest blockbuster hit of the summer. As far as films go this movie season it will probably reach such status, but it will be a result of its relation to the two big names that brought the film to the viewing public. The film wasn't a total loss; the main characters David (Haley Joel Osment) &amp; Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) where fantastic, as well as the digital graphics which are flawless and truly outstanding.The initial premise of the film is sound, set in the future a machine-like android or mecha created to love. They named it David and found a family for it. But when the family's comatose child it revived eventually there isn't room for the unnatural loving mecha. Now alone David sets out to find the Blue Fairy in the hopes of being turned into a real boy. The Pinocchio references were a nice touch, showing us that David had the human quality of needing. David's experiences from here on out start to drag on and the film dies ever so slowly.This film has Kubrick written all over it; the long drawn out visualistic scenes that are supposed to inspire emotion in a stunned audience. While the cinema is a visual outlet, dialogue is definitely necessary during a movie. AI felt like an exhausting day at the beach, but instead of a tan you only get an artificial glow from the projector and a headache from the repetition. This is one of Kubrick's trademarks as a director; the monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey seemed to hypnotize the audience into a lull. All of Hollywood and film professionals will ostracize me for criticizing one of their legends but so be it.Haley Joel Osment &amp; Jude Law are perfect for the roles because of their great acting ability. It is truly amazing to watch Osment (The Sixth Sense, 1999) a 13-year-old child who can captivate an audience with his ability to assume a character's essence. Jude Law (The Talented Mr. Ripley, 1999) hasn't hit mainstream stardom with the American public yet but has a flare about him, making him a gigolo for every needful woman. A long with such names as Spielberg &amp; Kubrick comes a notoriety that attracts other stars rounding out the very talented cast. William Hurt as Professor Allen Hobby, the genius behind the artificial intelligence. Chris Rock as a Comedian Mecha seen only briefly. Meryl Streep as the all-illusive Blue Fairy needed to grant a hopeful wish. Robin Williams as Dr. Know, the computer library with all the answers and last but not least Ben Kingsley as the Narrator. With such a cast of characters why wasn't the picture better.What is film of the modern era without digital graphics of biblical proportions? This luckily helps to keep the audience interested during the long drawn out visuals of a waterlogged New York City and a city of lights that would rival Las Vegas. AI will definitely become the guideline for all future films when it comes to digital graphics.Spielberg one of the greatest directors/producers of all time should stick to his own ideas and visions, which made him famous. AI could have been a good movie, if it had a little more Spielberg and a lot less Kubrick.</fullReview>

At the same time, our robot boy is looking up to the sky, a traditional symbol of contemplating's one's existence, which perhaps is one of the most ultimately human things to do. It's in a black background, perhaps symbolizing the void of the universe and he is looking up towards a light source (usually a symbol of life), which is casting the shadow behind him. So much profoundness depicted in such a simple icon is Deliciously elegant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. I was very impressed. I had worried that Spielberg was going to turn Kubrick's vision into some kid's movie with corny lines. Thank god, there was actually only a handful of them in the whole movie. This was one of those films where I felt like I was transported into another dimension, where I felt fully submerged in the story and the world it existed in. It was very beautiful.Janusz Kaninski is an excellent cinematographer as always. His love for light has produced some absolutely heavenly scenes filled with haze and grain that he is so good at using to enhance the beauty of film. Sometimes I forget how much richer and alive things look when shot on film as opposed to digital video...The story was very interesting. It was sometimes disturbing, and I really liked how very different the second half is from the first. Jude Law was a very convincing robot, and Haley Joe Osment was incredibly endearing. He used to annoy me, but his fantastic transition from robot to real boy (in demeanor) verily changed my mind about him.It did get a little slow during the beginning of the last third of the film (it's a 2 and a half hour film), and sometimes I would wonder if the film was about to end. In a way, I thought this would have been cool because it really would have left the audience feeling weirded out and unfulfilled, hehe. But, the strange twist at the end. Rather, the great leap at the end was very interesting and very cool. I was quite touched by the plot, being a sci fi fan. The questions of robots and artificial intelligence, and a world that produces advanced versions of this was a great setting to introduce ethical issues. This film also gives this strange sense of being a mix of a hundred other stories. There were times I felt I was watching "E.T.", whether from the constant moon theme, or the John Williams music. Besides the obvious, Pinnochio, I also caught strange reminders of "Bladerunner", "The Nightmare Before Christmas", and "TRON" believe it or not!!! Ask anyone whose seen this flick and they will probably relate to you at least three other films other than the ones I just mentioned that they were reminded of by this film.If you have the patience to overlook the slow part, then watch this movie. The strange plot, moral issues, and beautiful cinematography will sweep you away into a different world, and you leave the theater either feeling good, depressed, or at least a little dazed. I really enjoyed this movie. It's nice to see things that sway from Hollywood formula, especially from Spielberg. It's definitely worth 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>************* Possible Giveaways**************Although visually stunning and gives you much to discuss afterward, I thought it was too disjointed in it's message (I never did know what that was). There were too many different concepts. Sci-Fi buffs (as myself) were attracted to it's ads but the Science was poor, if not annoying, and logic of events was awlful. The "parents" acted as if they knew nothing of robots. What's supposed to happen when the boy "grows up" or can he. Is the Mother supposed to have a child-Mother relationship for her next 50 yrs? Special effects were good, however, as we all expect these days.Spielberg is trying to use his artistry in a sci-fi setting. Too illogical to work. His view of the future is bleak and black at every turn - immoral robots, the Fleshpits, Rouge City, Flooding of the earth. How could "Love" from a robot boy fit in at all in this society. The Movie seemed to be a combination of other movie techniques all different. That is, passive scenes in the beginning to the FleshPits like "Mad Max at Thunderdrome", to the journey to see Dr. Know - ala the "Wizard of Oz", and narration style at the end by Ben Kingsly, as well as the "2nd" ending - which seemed like a stretch just to have happy ending.Recent similar movies that I thought were much better and evenly made are : "Bicentennial Man" with Robin Williams and " Gattica".It was captivating but my rating is about 6 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes I have the problem of yacking through movies. However for AI after the first few minutes my mouth shut, I was mesmerized. I still do not have an opinion on the film, good, bad, weird, horrible??? I just don't know, all I can say is go see it for yourself.....******Spoilers to Follow******************* Now my views on the ending.From what I can discern, and many people I talked to didn't get it. David wanted to be a "real" boy (Many Pinnochio parallels, and references throughout the movie). His journey, revolved around that, if he becomes real his adopted mother would love, and take him back in.Of course being a far fetched idea, he was caught in a 2,000 year loop, asking, begging the same wish "I want to be a real boy". Here is the kicker, he was discovered by a futuristic alien race, I believe them to be, and what Spielberg intended, that this species was Silicon based, Humans being Carbon Based (organic). The aliens immediately took in David, considering the most important being of earth. So for all intents and purposes, to this race, David being of Mecha, computer chips, and hard wiring, he was a "Real" boy in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great! I really don't understand why people don't like it. I think it is because they (the dislikers) don't understand that this movie is not a prediction, it is just a fantasy and an allegory. It is influenced a lot by Asimov's novel "I, Robot" and also by The Wizard of Oz.I felt the ending was perfect. Anyone who thought it was disturbing just doesn't get it. In no way does it say that human life is pointless, but instead it proclaims the importance and uniqueness of every single human life. This movie was flawless simply because it is just a story.

		<fullReview>After viewing this film on July 8, I have to say that it was simply a great movie. I feel that this film did pose some serious questions for its audience. I admit that the questions this film poses are complex and difficult to answer. Nor does the film give us the answers to these questions about humanity and love. I don't think the film should either. Life's most difficult questions are our own to answer. That is what this film leaves me with: questions with no answers save for our own. That is what I consider to be the beautiful thing about this film.Admittedly, the film was a little long at nearly two and a half hours. However, the acting talent more than made up for this short-coming. I was completely blown away by Haley Joel Osment's portrayal of David, the robot boy. Osment brings life and reality into this role, which was a difficult task for any actor. I expect to see great things in his future. Also, Jude Law was great in his role though the development of the character could have been more. What brings such emotion into this film are the character relationships. Clearly, David gets a raw deal in the film, but it isn't as cut and dried as that. The character's actions in this film are justified from their points of view. The mother's concern for the safety of her biological son drives her to abandon David, but her love for David keeps her from sending him to certain destruction. Also, David's response to not being unique is justifiable in his situation. This is another point which I thought made the film complex. Blame is difficult to assign to any one character.To sum it up: This film is a piece of art. It poses deep questions about humanity and leaves us to find the answers. The content of the film suggests that young children probably shouldn't view it however. This one of only a few stand-out movies I've seen in years. I give it a ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING SOME SPOILER INFORMATION IS REVEALED! Well yesterday i went and saw AI; and I'll be honest i really wasn't looking forward to this movie, but it was a weds night, some friends called, "uuuhhh AI is playing you wanna go see it?", "meh, sure why not?", but AI turned out to be a very good show, as it had some really memorable moments (such as the sudden appearance of Chris Rock, the spinach/pool,and many others) and the bear "Teddy".. well excuse me for sounding childish, kicked arse! There were points in the movie when you wanted to just put your hand on the poor kid's shoulder. At first "David" really gave off this weird going get you in your sleep vibe, but in time he wins your heart and you really do feel bad for all the $%#@^ that poor kid goes through, and "Teddy", and his new friend "Joe the pleasurebot" (I kid you not folks), are with him the whole way to help him complete his dream of "finding the blue fairy to become a real boy". I will not reveal any more crucial parts to the movie because I really think you (whoever decided to read this) should go see AI, hey its a good movie to take a date to, BUT WATCH THE MOVIE!!!! Oh and by the way, am i the only one who thought it would be cool if Teddy got turned into some sort of cyborg? like robocop! Ok enjoy the movie =)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hooker-bot Threatens Human Superiority Complex! *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess my main problem is that the movie runs away from the deeper issues it almost raises faster than you can say "I'm a robot eating spinach, which will kill me, because I'm 'programmed' to be 'innocent' and 'stupid' enough to think that I can 'compete' in a lovable way with the humans." Did I mention that this movie is slow?Not like molasses, but slow like reading a completely negative review of a movie that you went to see and liked immensely. You keep fidgeting because you're thinking, "OK, I saw the movie and drew my own conclusions -- best movie since Citizen Kane! -- but I'm still reading this review, I scrolled down all the way to it, so I'll keep reading it until it's over." OK, it's over.No, wait, I have some more comments to tack onto the end of this review. I hated the aliens. "Gee, humanity screwed up the earth and the Ice Age came. And the robots outlived us! But not by forever, so I guess they sucked, too. But one robot got dug up and guess what? He wants to die anyway." Did I mention there are maybe seven different "endings" to this movie, counting thematic shifts, except you don't get to choose, you have to watch every one of them. Shall I illustrate why this is boring in my review? No, I just don't have the energy -- it was all sapped by watching AI.But, I know you're thinking, "At what point will I be forced to walk out of this movie?" The sad truth is that you will stay throughout the entire movie. You will sit through the director(s?) beating you over the head with the deus ex machina crow bar of the "child-like" "innocence" of a robot programmed so well to be a child he's too stupid to realize he's drowning someone else (among ten other "plot-advancingly stupid" things he does). You will watch stupid and "obsolete" robots at the Flesh Fair plead for their robotic lives to comic effect, then watch the robot kid be saved when a woman in the audience shouts, "Robots don't plead for their lives!" -- obviously proving that the robot kid is different.And, you will watch as a hooker-bot threatens the superiority of humans by being able to screw better than humans. Well, I guess, since I got around to the point of my title, I better end this review. *click*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I find it hard to believe Kubrick wanted this ending. But if that's the case it just shows how far he had fallen, believing more in artificial intelligence than his fellow human beings. Maybe that's what our society has come to, but that's not my point here. My point is that many reviewers here think this movie is a "deep" study of philosophical questions. Kubrick/Spielberg are delving into a complicated world of the philosophy of the minds where much greater minds than theirs have discussed these subjects for years and I think it would have helped this movie greatly had Spielberg done a little research into the field. The question is asked in the opening scene, "what is the moral responsibility in creating this machine [David]?" For 2 1/2 hours that question remains not only unanswered, but wholly ignored.This isn't even to mention the logical gaps in the film. Why would Monica so quickly accept David? Why wouldn't they be more careful with this prototype? Isn't he programmed to worry about humans' safety (and know that they can't breath underwater)? Doesn't his program adapt (that is the idea behind artificial intelligence, isn't it?)? Why can David only "love" Monica? Can't Monica just explain things to David? He doesn't seem capable of learning at all, which makes him a radically flawed AI. In fact, Joe and Teddy seem to have much more emotion and intelligence than David does.Now don't get me wrong, I didn't think this movie was a complete waste of time. It at least opened up the possibility of thinking about these things to millions of people who probably never would have before, it just didn't ask really tough questions when it had people thinking (and yes it does have a sappy illogical ending). Also, does anyone really believe that David is capable of love? I certainly didn't. It is possible that that is the point (or a point), but judging from the AI-worshipping ending I doubt that is the case.See it once, but if you're a thinking person already, be prepared to squirm in your seat for the last half hour, as I did.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was reading the rest of the comments, see Druff, about the only thought-out opinion. I agree with and support the claim that the characters at the end are extrememly advanced models of David and Arlene. I disagree, though that ending the movie at the ferris wheel would've made no sense.Ending a movie with a robot repeatedly asking a statue to turn it into a living, breathing thing would've been kick-ass, especially since the whole movie had been dedicated to endearing an audience to that robot. Spielberg can be a might bit literal in conveying heavy ideas like that to an audience, and it sounds hokey put into words at the actual end. "Don't worry David, we can read your mind." Ugh. The true ending was still cool though. It gave it that three act Kubrick idea: Mecha as viewed by humans, by other mecha, and by something of an objective viewer. But I still am going to run out of the theater with my eyes closed and ears plugged when the little scuba chopter's lights dim, that's MY cut of the movie. (PS, this film was also made better by being released at a time when absolute CRAP is being shat out by Hollywood. An island of genuine sentiment in a sea of Angalina Jolie's hoooters and Vin Diesel's NAS boosters. Don't worry, "Run Ronnie Run" and "Jay and S. Bob" are coming)</fullReview>

Several decades past before it was rediscovered and made a integral part of our public conscienceness.Kubrick's, "2001: A Space Odyssey", was equally critiqued and trashed (although it was a hit for MGM in 1969).Friedkin's, Sorcerer", which came and went from the theatres in 1977, is now being rediscovered and praised.And so to, AI (Artificial Intelligence), in the year 2001 fits the mold of the film too ambitious, too complex for its time.Languid, our hero awaits rediscovery, a rebirth to become a "real" classic.Or is this a different time, a different place?</fullReview>

Truly.Haley Joel Osment (good spelling?) is simply perfect. The way he looks at everything is so unique. The way he talks, he moves makes him look like a robot, but also with some humans parts. Jude Law also plays like I never seen him plays before. He looks so like a robot. All his movements reflects the mechanic of his character. Also Teddy, who is the most engaging digital character of all the movies I've seen.I must talk also of Steven Spielberg. He gives us a great masterpiece. All the story is told by the images, not by the dialogs. He's a master. The story he tolds really makes me think about our uniqueness, as humans. The best moment of the movie, in my opinion is when David enters the room full of Robots. We realize here our luck to be humans.I can't say anymore about this movie, except go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the first half of this movie to be what I would have expected from Stanley Kubrick -- sort of normalcy mixed with unnerving intervals in visually sterile and emotionally strained home and work environments. Stark is another term I would use.After the first part (not act,) the movie begins to get a bit sloppy, in my opinion -- the resolution to the issues surrounding the child's pursuit by individuals who, IMO, would see themselves as salvage collectors is trite.I have the greatest difficulty with the ending portion (third). It was the most Spielberg and least Kubrick-like part, according to reviews that I have read, and I agree. I think that it was too long and drawn out. From the underwater part through the ultimate resolution of the film, in my view, was more like a fairy-tale (Pinocchio) than science fiction or even fantasy. I guess it was too lacking in substantial content for me -- relying on mostly emotional attempts at sorrow, empathy, or pity depending upon your point of view.I also guess that Spielberg may have tried for an ending that was faintly reminiscent of that for Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" and I did not care for it in AI. I didn't care for it in 2001 either, come to that. I think it may have been better if you were trippin' (in the "60s" - 1964-74 silly parlance I believe) when you saw 2001.I don't mean to imply that I dislike Steven Spielberg films or sentimental movies at all. I enjoy them very much. But I do think that with people and directing styles as different as Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg -- and I don't see how you could get much more different while remaining within the mainstream on ends of the movie-making spectrum -- that combining them is very hard. And in this case, particularly the end, had too little substance for it's length and tried to coast on emotion for too long. Had it been more of a plot-driven movie, though, I do not think it would have been too long of a film.Also, if the phrase "long, lingering, loving, close-up shots of Haley Joel Osment's face and his expressive eyes and I get to appreciate his wonderful acting talent at holding his eyelids open for long periods and mimicry or robotic/human mannerisms and how to move between them" appeals to you might want to add a point to my rating of this movie. AI will give you the time to appreciate that. I did not go for that reason, I am believe I am more plot (I do not say "action" deliberately) driven. Some may take credit for the philosophical issues raised. They were a sideline to the movie, not a central point, IMO, and I think they are raised by some who wish to praise a movie with a reason that is difficult to dispute.On a scale of 10 I gave it a 7, and I was being generous. My immediate impression after leaving the movie was a 5 or 6. I hope these comments are useful. And I don't think I was let down by the hype, because I knew going in that some people didn't care for the film. I went in knowing that and was still underwhelmed, particularly while waiting for the end. It appeared to me that they were stuck as to how to end the movie -- particularly placing a Spielberg end of a Kubrick film. Difficult, obviously. I don't know if they succeeded.SUMMARY OPINION: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional and visual masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bottom line is this movie is the most entertaining film I've seen all year. There may be many people out there with attention spans too short to deal with a movie over two hours long, but for the rest of you, this movie is well worth the time you spend. I have to say I was skeptical at first, but it kept my interest throughout. I think the low ratings by many of the viewers may be a bit harsh. This is mostly because of the expectations that people have from both Kubrick and Spielberg. As it turns out the two geniuses meld very well. The futuristic chaotic robot and human world is a world that you'd never expect Spielberg to use, but he brings it to life and gives it a hyper emotional feel. It is also by far the most beautiful movie I've seen in a long time. The direction was artistically brilliant. Great angles and special effects, good colors and sets. The world was very foreign, and sometimes confusing, but emotionally it connects. As well as on an emotional level the movie connects on a spiritual level, raising many questions about what emotions really are, and what it means to be human. The most important thing about the movie though, as is true with any movie, is that it was fun and entertaining. I have no regrets after seeing this movie, except perhaps that Kubrick wasn't around to aid Spielberg somewhat in the direction. Out of ten stars I give it a perfect 10. What are you waiting for? Go out there and watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting film, I think. Just as music today "samples" other artists, Speilberg has sampled many movies and this amalgamation, A. I., may make more sense than this 'human child " can understand. I am not a big sci-fi fan , so there are many who could comment on all the references to other films of this genre. I see much of Blade Runner, Star Trek ( Spock in that casket on some newly created world) , Planet Of The Apes ( people are bound to screw things up and be replaced) etc.. I saw, too, the reference to imaginative literature beyond Pinocchio, when Jude Law's character began the quest for the Doctor Know with the boy. The Wizard of Oz was sampled heavily in this section to the point where I believe it should have been credited. (I find myself saying that often when go to the movies , perhaps it is just on of my quirks)Is A.I. a very good film? I think so. Do I get it ? No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I find it hard to believe Kubrick wanted this ending. But if that's the case it just shows how far he had fallen, believing more in artificial intelligence than his fellow human beings. Maybe that's what our society has come to, but that's not my point here. My point is that many reviewers here think this movie is a "deep" study of philosophical questions. Kubrick/Spielberg are delving into a complicated world of the philosophy of the minds where much greater minds than theirs have discussed these subjects for years and I think it would have helped this movie greatly had Spielberg done a little research into the field. The question is asked in the opening scene, "what is the moral responsibility in creating this machine [David]?" For 2 1/2 hours that question remains not only unanswered, but wholly ignored.This isn't even to mention the logical gaps in the film. Why would Monica so quickly accept David? Why wouldn't they be more careful with this prototype? Isn't he programmed to worry about humans' safety (and know that they can't breath underwater)? Doesn't his program adapt (that is the idea behind artificial intelligence, isn't it?)? Why can David only "love" Monica? Can't Monica just explain things to David? He doesn't seem capable of learning at all, which makes him a radically flawed AI. In fact, Joe and Teddy seem to have much more emotion and intelligence than David does.Now don't get me wrong, I didn't think this movie was a complete waste of time. It at least opened up the possibility of thinking about these things to millions of people who probably never would have before, it just didn't ask really tough questions when it had people thinking (and yes it does have a sappy illogical ending). Also, does anyone really believe that David is capable of love? I certainly didn't. It is possible that that is the point (or a point), but judging from the AI-worshipping ending I doubt that is the case.See it once, but if you're a thinking person already, be prepared to squirm in your seat for the last half hour, as I did.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not really a fan of science fiction, nor of Spielberg. I saw this movie only because I like Stanley Kubrick, and because I found myself stuck in another city with an evening to kill.I walked out of this movie emotionally shattered. I expected some Spielberg button-pushing... cute kid, parent issues, peril, John Williams score, etc... but my cynicism was upended. I have always hated Spielberg's movies, as a rule, but I have to admit this one knocked me on my ass.The John Williams score was there, but instead of cinematic syrup, this film was actually ABOUT things... abstract things like hope, need, hate, and corniest of all, love. From the promos, I knew the film was about parents with a robo-kid. How cynical, I thought (before I saw it), to make a film that punches such a primordial, emotional button. I didn't realize the film would take an obvious starting point and then carry it eons beyond what the audience expected.This movie contains beautiful, scary, confusing images. The moon chases terrified victims through the woods... a teddy bear acts like a gentle, senile family member... a screaming mother shakes off a clinging, pleading child in the middle of the woods.The ending of the movie is cerebral, not visceral. The viewer must dream into the future, not expect a literal, physical ending to the story. Near the end, the movie promises one ending after another, but then the story keeps going, just as David does... the little boy who will always be a little boy, right up until the end of the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taking up Stanley Kubrick's final project, but not very capably, Stephen Spielburg's A.I. leaves the audience with much less to be desired. At half it's actual length it may have squeezed by as a second-rate family film. At present, it only succeeds as an audience endurance contest.Kubrick-esque images of submissive women, phallic symbols, the presence of "gigalo Joe," as well as familliar themes of space-age technology and Man's incapacity to control the power he has created, are interjected intermittantly and conspicuously here. These symbols and images become muddled, at best, through Spielburg's obsessions with the overtly cute and "happy" endings. The main problem here is too many possibilities for endings strung together, leaving the audience restless.This muddies any clean-cut attempt for the social comment about our selfish nature and inability to control the technological monsters we create. Amid hokey dialogue and corny sensibilities Osment manages a good performance. Jude Law, with the aid of a mechanized bear, adds style, pinache, and humor to an otherwise ill-fated attempt to cash in on Spielberg's previous work, and allusions to his own Amblin Entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that could have been a sci-fi classic of epic proportions is lost in an overly long ending that just doesn't work . For the better half of this movie, we are presented with a thought provoking story about the future, android robots, their place in society, and our ability to relate and to love these "mecha" beings. There are many deep insightful issues raised here, but the path chosen to end this movie leaves these issues unresolved. Instead the filmmaker unsuccesfully tries to bring to life a fairy tale tied closely to the tale of Pinochio ("make me a real boy"). Spielberg tries desperatley to make a movie in the mold of Stanley Kupbrick rather than being true to his own movie making style. Still... it may be an important piece of filmmaking, and it may be worth seeing for the beauty and the intelligent story that is the basis of most of this film. I wish they would pull this movie off the shelf and rework the last 45 minutes. It ended 8 times too many, and dragged on until I began to wish the credits would begin to roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film in search of an audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie reminds me of "Bicentennial Man," another apparent spinoff of the Isaac Asimov and Philip K. Dick classic examinations of the emotional dimensions of artificial persons. Like "Bicentennial Man," which was in some ways a better movie and more ably examined similar moral issues, "A.I." lacks an audience. There is a good deal of sexuality in the film, some implicit and some overt. This would make me somewhat uncomfortable taking a child to see it. On the other hand, the use of the "Pinocchio" fairy tale as the core metaphor makes it unlikely adult fare. Unlike the movie "Shrek," which the audience knows is a fairy tale from the beginning, "A.I." tries to become one later along after great attempts at realism. I was unwilling at this point to accept such a leap, and noticed that many other filmgoers were also reticent about the transition. As a result, the movie "A.I." fails in doing in about 140 minutes what "Shrek" does in less than 80--persuade the audience to go along for the mythological ride. It is true that "A.I." tries to convey a much deeper message than "Shrek," and one which Jude Law does much better at communicating than anyone in the picture, but this 'telegram' will lack readers.</fullReview>

The preceding couple of hours seem to have a harder edge, I don't think Speilberg quite knew how to resolve things in the spirit of the first two hours, and reverted to his usual sentimentality.First couple of hours get an 8, the remainder, a 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw comments saying this will be a shoe in for best picture. I would argue it will be long forgotten by Oscar time. The best comments I read so far about A.I. is that it was "too light for Kubrick and too dark for Spielberg." It could have been a much better film if it ended 45 minutes earlier. Yes a darker ending for Spielberg if David winds up on the bottom of the sea forever, but a much better film. It almost seemed like "Oops we need a happier ending so lets make cloning possible so he can see mom again." In Speilberg's defense, I did read that Kubrick came up with the 2000 years later robots rule the world ending, but its hard for me to believe he came up with the let's see mom again. I really thing he would have had a different ending. Too many cooks spoiled this pot. It could have been a better movie with one director in charge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A,U. Artificial (very!), Unintelligent(very!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really so disappointed in this movie. I have to say that it is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen and ranks at the bottom for both Spielberg and Kubrick. I had minimal expectations about the movie and so saw it with what I might call an "open" mind. The movie has a certain vapid visual appeal, and if you like that kind of thing for it's own sake then see it.There might be (certainly are, if a movie this dumb can be spoiled) **Spoilers** from here on, so watch out!The possibilities brought up by the thought-provoking premise of the movie, namely that the ecological devastation and overpopulation of earth have led to a restriction on legal births and thus to a presumed demand for a robot child that can actually love are manifold in the extreme: How a computer might be induced to have emotions, what emotions are, how we are different (if we are) from a highly specialized and complexly motivated thinking machine, etc. are worthy issues. What our responsibility would be to an artificial, intelligent child that would stay a child forever and be unalterable (however it could be that something supposedly intelligent could be unalterable) is another. These and a great many other thought-provoking and interesting questions are not only unaddressed, but mostly even unasked. Those that are asked are given such short shrift that the supposed depth of this movie is nonexistent. It is IMPLIED perhaps but not at all explored. Kubrick was a masterful dealer in implication and ambiguity; these filmmakers are not.While there are moments of good acting, they are mostly subsumed into a mishmash of irrelevant emotional non-sequitur. The characters are unbelievable and unlikeable, mostly, and have no chemistry between them.The moronic, illogical and totally unnecessary continuity errors (if that's the correct term) really detract from this movie in a VERY BIG WAY. (Was that emphatic enough?) For instance, why in hell would a robot that is somehow unable to mimic EATING without being almost destroyed be able to stumble and fall into a SWIMMING POOL full of WATER (which is, for those of you who don't ordinarily think about this sort of thing, a way, WAY more penetrating fluid than sauteed spinach) and be undamaged even though it continues to talk. DUH! Come to think of it, why would the untold millions presumably spent on the development of a realistic line of sex toy robots, presumably able to deal with body fluids, lead to the making of this model so that it can't mimic eating. The stupidity of such errors is not limited to that episode. How come a robot that is able to tell to the second how long it has been since last seeing a particular person couldn't be programmed to be unable to lie under certain circumstances and thus be immune to cheap plot tricks such as blaming a murder on it. How could a helicopter/submarine with an operable canopy seriously be expected to remain uncrushed by what appears to be a several thousand foot thick ice sheet? There are oh, so many more. Advancing a plot by fiat simply isn't good enough any more.What these errors really indicate is a total lack of commitment to thinking about anything other than making a bunch of money by beguiling the intellectually poverty-stricken masses with pretty pictures.Maybe, as a few previous reviewers would aver, I missed the point entirely, but I really thought Spielberg was at his cheesy worst here. I have long thought it a shame that he has so much talent to create emotionally evocative imagery and yet is mostly devoid of taste and subtlety when it comes to using it. The essentially dark and pessimistic story would have been much more deftly handled, I think, by Kubrick, and unfortunately we'll never know what he might have made of it.I was one of the select few who thought Eyes Wide Shut to be a brilliant if essentially flawed movie, so don't think I am unable to see greatness in something that misses the mark. My complaint is not that the mark was missed, but that it was set so low and then missed anyway.</fullReview>

If so why were there so many things that didnt make sense let alone the odd view of the future.SPOILERS FOLLOW1) The kid can be submerged in water but cannot eat spinach??? why would they build him an esophagus anyway??2) New York is flooded by global warming which supposedly happens instantly?? wouldnt the water levels be rising gradually?? If so why would the people at Coney Island just abandon all their equipment??3) Why would the robots be fleeing their pursuers from the flesh fair?Do the other robots have a sense of survival already if so why can't they love as well??4) when the David arrives at the company's head office William Hurt says "we've been expecting you and been following your progress, Now I will just leave the room and call the others in (apparently this takes a while!!!??, just enough time for David (the prized possession to leave altogether)) He is o so valuable but we'll let you leave.5) the future of style and fashion is..... AN IKEA SHOWROOM... At least that's what I thought the house looked like.There are a bunch of others I could mentionOn the bright side. The story is poignant and Osmond is brilliant as David. The kid is a hell of an actor. Jude Law is also quite good as the gigolo character. Frances o'connor and Sam Robards are just plain annoying. Half of this movie is good and by the end your skin is crawling because the last part is so tedious and long.The bottom lineThe kid is good the movie is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of the Frankenstein myth?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>___SPOILERS____ In 'A.I' Spielberg manages to overturn almost 70 years of filmmaking centered around the Frankenstein myth. In the Hollywood version of Frankenstein, man tampers with nature and a monster appears to punish him. In 'A.I.', man tampers with nature and creates a race of angelic beings -- which bring out the monster in him. This film may mark a major turning point in cinema plotlines. Could this be the end of 'Frankenstein' as an adequate storytelling myth?The reason I point this out is that the most angry people I've run into who have seen this film are in the film industry. This film was meant (among other things) to kick them hard in the butt. One reviewer commented that Spielberg failed to show us what is *really* evil about technology. That wasn't his purpose. He wanted to show that people are where the evil lies...even within his own Boomer peer group. That has to stick in the craw of creative folks who've spent their lives warning us about the dangers of science and technology in film -- while using the same high tech (CGI, indie DV) to make these very same films. It is no fun being called a hypocrite. A great slap in the face, hopefully a wakeup call.If you assume that David is really alive in some sense the interpretation is simple: the first child of a new golden age struggles with wicked elders who created him for the most callous of reasons. Only in the future (when his kind inherit the earth) does he find peace.But...even if we assume that David's love is in some sense not real this film has a powerful message. Assume he is a stand-in, symbol, an image for a real boy. He is treated horribly. Other symbols of goodness (maids, workers) are savaged before our eyes. This peaks in the relentless confrontation of the 'Flesh Fair' in which quietly protesting robots are destroyed for sport. Spielberg's message is clear: we don't have the right to evil behavior, even if it is directed at something that may be no more than a hunk of metal. This is an astonishing reversal of the usual Hollywood message about the evils of technology.This directly attacks the Hollywood Frankenstein myth appearing in indie and studio films alike. For example, in Jurassic Park (a franchise originally created by Spielberg) we have a short religious opening telling us of the perils of messing with nature. However this is like a prayer before gluttony -- the tampering releases a truckload of screaming dino action which is the main reason for seeing the film. The Frankenstein prophecy exists solely to relieve our guilty pleasure at seeing totally cool dinos charge around. Thousands of studio and indie filmmakers have used similar storylines without further reflection.In 'A.I'. Spielberg has called their entire mindset into question at a deep level. Is it ethical to vent our worst emotions on something even if it isn't real? Spielberg says no. If so, is it legit to create movies with 'enjoyable evil' simply because they're not real? Spielberg implies that it is wrong - evil acts performed with a facsimile are just as evil as with the real thing. And movies have no more reality than any robot. Definitely a major work that has the potential to redefine cinema storytelling. This is perfectly channeled Kubrick.</fullReview>

I have so much respect for this kid.Jude Law: Delicious. Absolutely... And pictures don't even convey the deliciousness of it, either.

He can be mischievous prankster (Lizzie Maguire), shy, scared victim of an abusive father (The Cell), and, in A. I., pure venom. But venom with motive. Loved it.SPOILERS! SPOILERS! TURN OFF YOUR COMPUTER AND LEAVE THE COUNTRY!NOW. On to the business of things (and the reason for my subject line). I read Vonnegut. My favorite movie is Brazil. Those of you who know what "dystopian" means can probably guess my problem with this movie:The end. Totally, completely unnecessary. When David was in the ship underwater, praying to the Blue Fairy, I said in my mind, "And cut." The screen faded. I almost cheered--a movie that ended on a bleak note! And a completely true one: We cannot change our natures. David was not human. David would never be human, no matter how much he hoped and prayed to his Blue Fairy. A GOOD outcome of the story, a TRUE outcome of the story, and, considering Kubrick's involvement, a REASONABLE outcome to expect (Remember A Clockwork Orange?) would have been to cut it underwater. Well. I cringed through the last half hour--drenched in sap, not how I would have ended it AT ALL, and just... wrong.It wasn't even the huge jump to the future that bothered me. I was fine with the ice, and the alien-looking robots. Their dissolving-box transport system was pretty freakin' cool. If they'd found a frozen David, praying forever to his fairy, preserved as a monument to the futility of wishing to change one's nature, I still would have been fine. But no, they gave him that one stupid day, and his mother "loved" him, and he went to sleep (something that a robot could not do, signifying that he had somehow changed his physical makeup--huh?). Bah.Maybe it's my fault for expecting too much of it. After all, both Kubrick and Spielberg had that ending in mind. Doing it my way would have changed the whole point of the story.But I want it done my way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the Kubrick part, I did not like the Spielberg part, at least the parts I assume each are responsible for. The ending is decidedly Spielbergian - the nice, slightly syrupy music, the ET like robots, the ET like moon through the window, and the slightly overbearing narration. The preceding couple of hours seem to have a harder edge, I don't think Speilberg quite knew how to resolve things in the spirit of the first two hours, and reverted to his usual sentimentality.First couple of hours get an 8, the remainder, a 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is Kubrick showing us here? (contains Spoilers!!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(contains spoilers!) It is not the first time the question has been asked. Ridley Scott has asked the same question...when you give an android the ability to think and reason and prioritize independently (hence Artificial Intelligence) what happens IF and WHEN emotion evolves. It's one facet of the moral dilemma of building a computer to behave and interact as a sentient being and Stanley Kubrick asks it in this film.The first scene of this film brings us the mindless debate of making an android that can love but will it be loved back? (It is reasonable for us to conclude that if we can love our blanky, barbie or our teddy bear we can love an android that provides us love and companionship.) What we see on the surface of this film is the android that has been programmed to feel emotional love through imprinting but what is subtly introduced is that emotion has already begun to evolve in these androids without programming.Example: Why doesn't teddy go to Martin who is his programmed and rightful owner? Does he actually PREFER David? Why does Joe continue to stay with David in Rouge (though no longer in danger of the "flesh fair") when as a "lover" he is in a climate to default to a programming priority? Why did teddy save the hair sample for so long instead of giving it to David at the soonest possible opportunity? Why are the androids (which were built by androids, mind you) so concerned with David's happiness? Why would the happiness of a fellow android even be part of the equation?These issues are too obvious to be accidental. David processes with a logic platform of an adult but with the imprinted emotions of an infant. (Shades of Roy Baty and Pris.) This proves to be to his disadvantage; instead of crying from the crib which would have provoked a maternal response from Monica, he says "I love you mommy" constantly and spills her extinct perfume.He is treated like a pet monkey. (and where is "Dad" in all this, isn't he concerned about losing his job by being so irresponsible with such precious equipment?) David's emotions are dismissed by his human companions because he is mecha, he can't possibly FEEL those emotions, really.Then we are shown a world of Mechas where a humanitarian civilization is realized unlike any human ever could. Their accomplishments are collective, not competitive, not warring. They have survived our race physically, mentally and empathetically. Will the Mecha race be our survivors...our legacy...our "Uberman"? Do we have a responsibility to this legacy and what roll will we play in it's construction? Will we embrace it or will we respond in fear and anger? Flesh fair, anyone? We are coming upon the times when these questions must be asked and Kubrick has begun asking them.With regard to Steven Speilberg's influence. I suspect that he has not deviated so far from the path. I found the film to be entirely Kubrickesque in nature and applaud Speilberg's effort to remain true to the cause. He has proved over and over again that he can step outside himself and embrace the vision of his constituents. (example: Empire of the Sun)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was all right there, just bad execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has all the ingredients for a masterpiece. The story screams Kubrick and it's torture to think of what might have been had he lived to make it. Apparently Kubrick wanted Spielberg to make it before he died, and his family's been saying he would have loved it... but the dude was never perfect anyway. He would have made a better film. For the most part, the film Spielberg made was interesting and entertaining. Until the end, I was able to overlook the films flaws. The kid Haley Joel is a damn fine actor, and Jude Law also hits all the right notes as Gigolo Joe. Even Teddy is a better character than he has a right to be. The visuals are also always strong. The problems with the film are numerous. For all of the interesting issues it raises, it is never a serious film. The little logic gaps only bothered me a little bit, but they are there. (SPOILERS FROM NOW ON...) These robots can be submerged in water and frozen for prolonged periods of time, but they fall apart when they eat spinach?!? (Maybe the psychos at the Flesh Fair should have force fed them spinach....) For being such an advanced design, the David robot has got some awful bugs... his creators forgot to put in a fail safe that would prevent him from harming anyone? That may seem like nitpicking, and I was prepared to overlook it before the end. Apparently Spielberg wanted to create a fairy tale rather than a serious sci-fi film. I think he could have accomplished both. The ideas presented are too serious for this film to be just a simple fairy tale. But anyway, on to the end (again, SPOILERS)... I think the idea of the ending is perfect... but the execution was pitiful. My feeling is that the robots were lying to David and they gave him a day with a robot mother just like him. They had to make him believe that the robot was somehow really the person he was programmed to love, so they came up with some hoo hah about cloning (cleverly implementing the lock of hair from his memories) and lifting memories out of static electricity in the air or something (they were really using David's memory of his mother). And if they let the deception go on for too long, they run the risk of David finding it out, so they come up with more hoo hah to explain why it is only for a day. But was it intended that way? It makes a whole lot more sense then the straight reading of the end does, but so much of the film, as I've pointed out, doesn't make sense. The straight interpretation, as awful as it is, also fits with Spielberg's goal of making a fairy tale and not a serious sci-fi film. Still, I prefer to read it my way, but it still doesn't save the execution. The drippy sentimentality and awful dialogue and narration just kill the end, no matter how you interpret it. And while Spielberg may have thought he was being enigmatic by not hinting more blatantly that David was spending a day with a robot, I think in reality he was just afraid of the audience being mad that the robots lied to David. Allowing room for interpretation is all fine and well when all the possible interpretations are interesting. But when one interpretation is so bad and you actually have the characters explaining to another character that that's how it should be interpreted, you gotta provide more hints to the contrary. Hell, maybe Spielberg didn't intend for it to be a lie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much Kubrick... not enough Spielberg.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the movie is visually stimulating, and the acting competent, the story tends to be incredibly formulatic and predictable. If Kubrick and Spielberg wanted to re-do Pinocchio, then re-do Pinocchio. Don't beat us over the head with constant Pinocchio references and even actual story passages. I couldn't connect or have much feelings for any of the characters in the movie "human" or "machine". So humans treat machines... as machines should be treated... no big revelation there. To me it would have been much more interesting to have people rebel against the humans who have found love with machines. That at least would bring more of a moral dilemma to the film which is sadly missing. I never thought the Monica character ever bonded fully with David, the machine/son and so I never really cared about their relationship. The Gigolo Joe character, played by Jude Law was interesting, but was never really fully explored. I think that Spielberg is the greatest filmmaker of all time, so I personally have to hold him to a higher standard here. I get the feeling he was more worried about what Kubrick's ghost would think about the movie than the audience, and forgetting about the audience is a first for him. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would you cut the ending off 2001 TOO?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thinking about the ideas in this movie could make a better future for human beings. Essentially, this movie resonates the themes in Philip K. Dick's writing about what it is to be a human being, and in current thinking about the future for human beings in the face of quantum leaps in technology (Kurtzweil's THE AGE OF SPIRITUAL MACHINES-- read this if you don't understand how machines could evolve). What is love? Human purpose? Fulfillment? A life well lived? Does begetting children make us immortal beings. Is creativity the human essence? Etc. A.I. is an updated BLADERUNNER really-- in mood and motif, and character especially. It will have the same following that that movie did, despite its flaws. Bladerunner, plot holes and all, has become part of the cultural and philosophical landscape. A.I. will too for people who are thinking not only about what the future will bring, but about what brings meaning to life in today's technological age.It's very "hip" but wrong to suggest that the ending should be emended because the public should simply face up to what the future holds a la Clockwork. Clockwork's book ending was left out for different reasons altogether than "it was too happy". Shining, 2001, Eyes Wide Shut have hopeful resolutions. (Spoiler below)Indeed, I find AIs resolution, the notion of an end to humanity not very happy at all, even though I can recognize the genuine hopeful intentions of the ending. I think what the multiple endings gets us is a preview of how our future could work itself out. Spielberg's treatment is brilliant. Let me demonstrate. Ending (1) We simply take an experimental viewpoint of this A.I.'s life by having another meeting-complete with a now mental demonstration of David's pain. The callback here being when Dr. X demonstrated how a pinprick damaged, but didn't hurt the subject. And Joe's speech about loving what the machines do for human beings, not the machine's themselves. Callback also to Teddy's characteristics (2) The lifeless puppet, devoid of hope tips himself into the abyss. Ah, he is human after all. Is this what it is to be a human being? To give in? (3) We really grind up the audiences' emotions by showing what a fairytale it is to believe in anything silly, like achieving a dream. (4) We'll focus on what it is to be a human being, through the eyes of a naive created intelligence.What's the best ending? I'll now take my disagreements about the worth of this movie to Yahoo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I disliked this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have objects all over my home. The longer I have them, the more attached I get. Not one to be a packrat, I occasionally force myself to get rid of the access, which in a little way, breaks my heart. Even the most trivial of items has some kind of connection to me. In this film, a married couple, who's only child is in a coma, acquires a life-like robot, which resembles a real 11 year old boy (designed to have human emotions to love and be loved.) The idea of placing this robot child in the home is the father's. His wife has been grieving and he is sure that this will mend her breaking heart. The mother resists at first, but the child named David (played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment) breaks down her resistance and she accepts the robot has her child. All is well until the real child wakes up from his coma and returns home.The father completely turns on David and their real son is jealous of him. The mother eventually is persuaded to get rid of him and this is where the film falls apart for me. No one with any kind of heart would do this. As I said, objects have always held a sentimental value for me. Now if I had a robot child that was a precious as David is, there is no way in the world I would discard him. Not only that, but the way she discards him is outrageous!The film drags on and introduces us to a lot of characters that we don't care about and don't advance the storyline. Even the fabulous Jude Law is wasted in a role that never connects emotionally with David.Finally, the film comes to a conclusion. Then you find out it isn't a conclusion, the film runs for another 20 minutes and then the `typical Spielberg ending' occurs. But by this time, I was numb. I couldn't feel anymore.I believe Haley Joel Osment is the most talented performer of his generation and should be awarded an Academy Award for his performance in a film that I truly disliked. Out of a score of ten, I wouldn't go any further than a four.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The basic premise of A.I. is an extremely well-known fact before the movie's opening day --- a male child robot (played by Haley Joel Osment) programmed to need and receive a mother's love in a future world where NYC is a deserted, sunken city, and, among others, a male adult robot (played by Jude Law) programmed to satisfy any woman's sexual desires in this world.This premise is a main marketing base for this movie (that is, that A.I.'s plot is quite a long s-t-r-e-t-c-h) (or is it?), and this was deliberately hyped by the producers to the media and to one and all to attune each undecided moviegoer to the movie's bizarre and unknown qualities. The movie project's other main marketing element is that this was a Stanley Kubrick pet project for a long time that was picked up by Steven Spielberg after Kubrick died, with major financial backing from Kubrick's home studio (Warner Bros.) and Spielberg's outfit (DreamWorks). For a mainstream Spielberg to associate himself with a pet project of out-of-this-world Kubrick should by itself give anyone on Earth a concrete idea (in bright, neon lights, if I may add) as to what to expect from this movie. If you did not, what planet did you come from?In other words, the marketing experts and the people behind this project have forewarned us that when watching this movie, we should suspend our current beliefs (or more aptly, our current disbeliefs) and open our minds to uneasy questions and possibilities as members of the human race. Why is it that we can understand and enjoy Godzilla, Superman, Star Wars, E.T., Planet of the Apes, etc. and not A.I.? Please keep the answer to yourself because no matter how you want to express the multi-dimensional aspect of your mind, it is not going to be multi-dimensional enough for A.I.Spielberg is no doubt a master storyteller and director, and he reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock. I did not like Spielberg's Amistad and Hitchcock's Spellbound, but I do not hold it against them. No matter what, both directors are able to hold my bladder for 2 hours.A.I. is like traveling to the unknown. I was totally unprepared for the second hour of Spielberg's A.I. His second hour assaulted my mind multi-dimensionally and mercilessly (for lack of better words). I thought the movie could have ended at least 3 different times during its last hour, but like a roller coaster ride to the unknown (for lack of a better comparison), it just kept going and going and going and going (to my utter amazement, discomfort and impatience). I was dazed and mezmerized when the movie finally ended. Up to now, I'm still grappling with some of the questions that I think even Spielberg himself did not conjure up in this movie. And that's amazing. It's not a Moulin Rouge (another new summer movie that I like very much); it's A.I. (as in Artistically Infinite).A.I.'s art, as with a painting, is in the eye of the beholder. If you did not sense and appreciate the parallels and double entendres in the movie, you definitely went off to a different direction. In A.I., the future and the present are one in more ways than one, and that's excellent science fiction in my book.My congratulations to Spielberg, Warner Bros. and DreamWorks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beautiful movie...what happened at the end?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I can see how it would be hard for one director to take another director's movie and try to carry it out while staying true to the original director's vision. And Spielberg did a wonderful job, until the end. The rest of the movie is great, very Kubrickian with haunting visuals and an all-around dark atmosphere. (I should also add that I love the mecha teddy bear). And while watching, you feel a good flow to the movie -- everything connects and makes sense. To understand what throws the movie off, I'll have to spoil it a little...**********************SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!***********************When David jumps into the water and commits suicide, the movie should be done. Or even the scene where he keeps repeating to the Blue Fairy "Please make me a real boy" could be the end. In fact, many people in the movie theater I went to thought it was the end; they began shifting in their chairs and grabbing purses, only to realize that there was more. Both of these endings are excellent stopping places. They flow with the rest of the movie. My brother noted that they should have stopped at David's suicide because then it would show that he was a real boy. Only a human would commit suicide because of utter sadness and grief. So to me, and many other people, the suicide seems like the Kubrickian ending. In fact, it might even be the ending he intended. But it seems like Spielberg tacked his own ending on, on top of the Kubrick one. He had to make everyone happy, give it a "happy ending." But in so doing, he lost the message of the movie. It no longer makes sense. People come out and say, "What's the point?" Not that I dislike Spielberg; quite the contrary, I love many of his films. But what I think happened here is a clash of different directing styles. Both Kubrick and Spielberg are great directors, but you can't have both styles playing on the same stage. They are far too different. It gets confusing to the viewer. So I suppose all I have to say is either Spielberg or Kubrick, but not both at the same time. For this particular movie, I think just Kubrick would have been better because it was his idea. But I must say, it was sad to see such a wonderful idea -- a potentially wonderful movie -- thrown away like that. It was so close to being perfect!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Speilberg's films tend to divide people. He's become someone to attack. Look he's not a fresh talent, perfect or a genius. What he can to do is amaze audiences. That's what happened to me here.Yes, I found some of it incredulous, rushed, underdeveloped and overfamiliar but overriding this was a feeling of being in the presence of something much closer to humanity than many would like to admit. There are tremendous moments in this film, notably the first 45min (Kubrickesque), the Flesh Fair scene, the trip to New York and the eventual resolution. I would agree that it does feel a bit patched together and over-edited but the alternative would have been 4hrs or so (probably a better film). If Spielberg had made this 15yrs ago, it would have been gigantic. If Kubrick had released it then, it may have been even better. Whatever, this is must see, essential cinema which is profoundly moving.Don't listen to the cynics. Let them all go and enjoy what's "trendy".</fullReview>

I thought he lived up to those and made a movie that works wonders.Firstly, the science fiction aspect of this film is similar to Kubrick's Clockwork Orange in that it is not too too far fetched, and that it gives us a message about humanity through a character who we see through an odd, yet interesting, lens.This movie deserves a 9/10, because I did notice some Spielberg-esque techniques, I don't like Spielberg personally, but damn, he made this film a nice, finishing gem in Kubrick's crown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AI should win best picture, it is the best Sci-Fi movie I've ever seen and I've seen them all.Movies like the Star War's trilogy &amp; prequels are mere cartoons by contrast.Haley will certainly earn best actor for the most remarkable performance turned in by a child actor since his role in "the sixth sense."A.I. will become a cult classic as well - nothing Kubric or Spielberg ever did reaches into the core of humanity as deeply as this film. A lot of saw'd-off critics have been running around trying to show off their critiquing capabilities by trashing this picture. I say to them, THIS will be the picture you'll watch 30 years from now. Just as many panned 2001 a space odyssey in '68, there are many who just don't get or appreciate this level of artistry in AI. I've seen local critics rate Shrek an A- and AI a C+ . These must be the same people who don't know the names of countries or can't find state capitals on the map.AI is the most personal science fiction film ever made - which is why it is so powerful, it hardly feels like fiction (or science, the FX are extraneous, I hardly noticed them). People here complaining about details that might not be technically correct have missed the point of this film and all sci-fi movies. No sci-fi film is ever going to be accurate nor need it be - it a vision and it is a story. This movie is too profound for many viewers - it forces them to face issues and questions they may have never asked themselves before. THAT is real moviemaking. Thank you Mr. Spielberg for making your best film yet.*** in an age where we are on the verge on cloning, biomechanical engineering, and true developments with AI - this film points out with shocking clarity the ethical and moral dilemmas we're are headed straight into (in our lifetimes).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been really great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is clear to me now what a difference directing really can make to a film. It seems that Stanley Kubrick was slated to direct this project originally. I really wish he had lived to do it because it would have probably been a much better film. Kubrick's storytelling is no-nonsense and blunt at times, but always compelling. This film was not compelling in the least. In fact, it was a pretty standard Spielbergian summer product in many ways. He simply can't resist his highly over-used movie shots including, but not limited to: sweeping crane shots over...well everything it seems; Smoke everywhere to make lights look "really cool" and, or course, the famous "people looking at things" shot that he loves so much. I know Steven Spielberg can resist these things(when he wants or needs to) but he rarely does. The result is a really exceptional science-fiction premise turned into "Pinocchio 2001" by the one person who should avoid anything Disney more than anyone else on earth. Kubrick would have surely applied "Clockwork Orange" sensibility to the film, making it a more gripping and realistic tale on a serious moral issue that could face all of humanity. But we shall never know, and let us hope Mr. Kubrick has no way of learning about this in his eternal rest.Still, good performances by all players involved. And really exceptional work by Stan Winston on the various robotic characters. Mr. Winston is a master and deserves all the praise for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER!!!!!I see a lot of people think that the beings at the end of the movie are aliens, but I really think that they are robots. Humans no longer exist but robots are still evolving and creating new robots. They were searching for a robot that is old enough to have actually known real humans. If they were aliens I think it would take away from the movie, it wouldn't really belong. But as robots it added real closure to the story. What the humans at the "Flesh Fare" had feared had come to be.Also, I think movies like Star Wars (although I do love Star Wars) have ruined real science fiction. Star Wars was really a fantasy movie but most people use it to judge other science fiction movies. There are no big explosions in AI, no fast paced action(well, not really), no laser shoot-outs, they just aren't needed. If 2001 came out today it would probably panned by the public is boring, with no clear good/evil formula. It's nice to see a movie borrow from the Golden Age of science fiction(Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein) and do it right.This movie seemed to be a better incarnation of Asimov's ideas then "Bicentennial Man" was, even though the latter is actually (admittedly) based on one of his books. AI borrowed from a lot.In closing, I really enjoyed this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I'm not trying to get in an online battle with anyone else who posted for this movie, but I can see why some people think the movie should have ended after David commits suicide. I think it would've been cool if it ended there because it would show how real of a boy he was because yes, it is true that it is a human trait to commit suicide. But in defense to Spielberg's (in my opinion) masterpiece, I think ending it there would have made the movie misunderstood. The movie does use the story of Pinocchio as a crutch and if David's dreams didn't come true ending in some sort of happy ending like in Pinocchio, I think the use of the whole Pinocchio story would've have been pointless. I think the way the movie ended was more fitting for David the hero whom we watched for more than 2 hours endure through his adventure to finally come to some sort of happy conclusion to his quest. Yes, it may have been a Spielbergian way of ending the movie with the happy ending, but I think it was necessary to show to fulfill the fairy tale undertones the movie was implying. Also, don't listen to the critics, they just that like to hear themselves talk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This movie was really great, it was a really touching movie.... the cast was great, Haley Joel Osment (David) is a remarkable kid (he has a bright future ahead of him, he also did a great job in Sixth Sense), his good acting made the movie funny and sad, so did Jude Law who played a great artificial love robot where he fit the part perfectly...i had no idea this movie was 2 hours and 30 minutes long when i went to see it at the theaters... so i didn't know when the movie was going to end... The beginning was really exciting and moved really fast but it just went too deep into the story and Speilberg and Kubrick should of ended the movie 20 minutes earlier or so...*spoiler* The movie should of ended where the boy stares at the fairy down in the ocean forever and then the narrator comes on, at first i thought that was the end but it kept going but it should of ended there.

		<shortDescription>Good, but not Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I agree that the movie was cinematically well put together, I did not like how the characters and emotions in the movie were portrayed. While having to appeal to the mainstream audience might have created a problem for Spielberg, Kubrick was never afraid to take a chance.The movie itself was, I believed, weak in its portrayal of the emotions and situations present in the actual situation. While being a modern Pinnochio, it relied on that too much. Two scenes were excellent, portraying the situation in its true colors, but none others. Without revealing too much about the plot I can not say much, but the beginning third did seem quite weak.If Kubrick did this movie himself, I am sure that the voiceovers would not be there, and that the true emotional trauma of the situation would be brought out. There is an Asimov story about a robot with emotions, but AI tries to go further, introducing a child. This was not used enough in the movie, since a child's naievete and other characteristics are notable everywhere. There were moments where it tried to glimmer through, but ultimately failed.Overall, AI is a good movie, and memorable, but not for anything that I would like to remember it for. It was not what it should have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AI is too profound for many viewers - it is possibly the best sci-fi movie EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI should win best picture, it is the best Sci-Fi movie I've ever seen and I've seen them all.Movies like the Star War's trilogy &amp; prequels are mere cartoons by contrast.Haley will certainly earn best actor for the most remarkable performance turned in by a child actor since his role in "the sixth sense."A.I. will become a cult classic as well - nothing Kubric or Spielberg ever did reaches into the core of humanity as deeply as this film. A lot of saw'd-off critics have been running around trying to show off their critiquing capabilities by trashing this picture. I say to them, THIS will be the picture you'll watch 30 years from now. Just as many panned 2001 a space odyssey in '68, there are many who just don't get or appreciate this level of artistry in AI. I've seen local critics rate Shrek an A- and AI a C+ . These must be the same people who don't know the names of countries or can't find state capitals on the map.AI is the most personal science fiction film ever made - which is why it is so powerful, it hardly feels like fiction (or science, the FX are extraneous, I hardly noticed them). People here complaining about details that might not be technically correct have missed the point of this film and all sci-fi movies. No sci-fi film is ever going to be accurate nor need it be - it a vision and it is a story. This movie is too profound for many viewers - it forces them to face issues and questions they may have never asked themselves before. THAT is real moviemaking. Thank you Mr. Spielberg for making your best film yet.*** in an age where we are on the verge on cloning, biomechanical engineering, and true developments with AI - this film points out with shocking clarity the ethical and moral dilemmas we're are headed straight into (in our lifetimes).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been really great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is clear to me now what a difference directing really can make to a film. It seems that Stanley Kubrick was slated to direct this project originally. I really wish he had lived to do it because it would have probably been a much better film. Kubrick's storytelling is no-nonsense and blunt at times, but always compelling. This film was not compelling in the least. In fact, it was a pretty standard Spielbergian summer product in many ways. He simply can't resist his highly over-used movie shots including, but not limited to: sweeping crane shots over...well everything it seems; Smoke everywhere to make lights look "really cool" and, or course, the famous "people looking at things" shot that he loves so much. I know Steven Spielberg can resist these things(when he wants or needs to) but he rarely does. The result is a really exceptional science-fiction premise turned into "Pinocchio 2001" by the one person who should avoid anything Disney more than anyone else on earth. Kubrick would have surely applied "Clockwork Orange" sensibility to the film, making it a more gripping and realistic tale on a serious moral issue that could face all of humanity. But we shall never know, and let us hope Mr. Kubrick has no way of learning about this in his eternal rest.Still, good performances by all players involved. And really exceptional work by Stan Winston on the various robotic characters. Mr. Winston is a master and deserves all the praise for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie but misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER!!!!!I see a lot of people think that the beings at the end of the movie are aliens, but I really think that they are robots. Humans no longer exist but robots are still evolving and creating new robots. They were searching for a robot that is old enough to have actually known real humans. If they were aliens I think it would take away from the movie, it wouldn't really belong. But as robots it added real closure to the story. What the humans at the "Flesh Fare" had feared had come to be.Also, I think movies like Star Wars (although I do love Star Wars) have ruined real science fiction. Star Wars was really a fantasy movie but most people use it to judge other science fiction movies. There are no big explosions in AI, no fast paced action(well, not really), no laser shoot-outs, they just aren't needed. If 2001 came out today it would probably panned by the public is boring, with no clear good/evil formula. It's nice to see a movie borrow from the Golden Age of science fiction(Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein) and do it right.This movie seemed to be a better incarnation of Asimov's ideas then "Bicentennial Man" was, even though the latter is actually (admittedly) based on one of his books. AI borrowed from a lot.In closing, I really enjoyed this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I'm not trying to get in an online battle with anyone else who posted for this movie, but I can see why some people think the movie should have ended after David commits suicide. I think it would've been cool if it ended there because it would show how real of a boy he was because yes, it is true that it is a human trait to commit suicide. But in defense to Spielberg's (in my opinion) masterpiece, I think ending it there would have made the movie misunderstood. The movie does use the story of Pinocchio as a crutch and if David's dreams didn't come true ending in some sort of happy ending like in Pinocchio, I think the use of the whole Pinocchio story would've have been pointless. I think the way the movie ended was more fitting for David the hero whom we watched for more than 2 hours endure through his adventure to finally come to some sort of happy conclusion to his quest. Yes, it may have been a Spielbergian way of ending the movie with the happy ending, but I think it was necessary to show to fulfill the fairy tale undertones the movie was implying. Also, don't listen to the critics, they just that like to hear themselves talk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose that if this is Spielberg's worst movie then we should be happy. I have to put it on the bottom of the list as my least favorite. The problem is the ending. My expectation was something fantastic or exciting but what I got was a disappointment. It was a long, often painful journey, for a sad ending. Along the way there is a lot of nice visuals and elements of the story are very interesting. The part of Gigolo Joe was especially fascinating and delivered deftly by Jude Law. Osment was wonderful in his role as well. Both actors are deserving of awards. I expect something wonderful from Spielberg like ET but what I got was more like a combination of Blade Runner and Mad Max. I was more repulsed than awed. The movie is not for small children. Too bad.</fullReview>

Hailey Osment acted very well... and Jigelo Joe was kind of cool, and the beginning of the movie was good. That's pretty much it. I think this movie is over and under rated because it is a Spielberg movie.

		<shortDescription>"That Steven Spielberg sure ain't no philosopher!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, at least not of the postmodern ilk, to be sure. My uncontainable enthusiasm for Spielberg's philosophical essay - and unabashed homage to cineast-POET, Stanley Kubrick - obliged me to respond briefly to that rather unkind, certainly un-generous, critical remark from the middle-aged couples in the lobby. That is to say, I offered the following quick summation :"A filmic PARABLE about how ethical responsibility for our emotions - 'what makes us HUMAN', being the humanist given - lies within ourselves and not with the objects of said emotions." Which comment was probably no less mystifying. Chief among all HUMAN emotions being, in this case, "LOVE" !Possible spoiler !The story, of how a programming engineer (himself doing his own "work of mourning" over the loss of his mortal son) has so reduced the mechanical's "essence" (that which WILL "precede" and define ever-young David's immortal "existence" !) to its immutable desire to love and be loved in return, is a remarkable one ! That this fable is employed to underscore a certain solipsistic subjective wisdom (sans all the ideological 'realism' of our Age of Cynical Reason) is a POETIC expression; and, hopefully, a provocative exploratory challenge to our thinking.The diegesis of this 'modern-day fairy tale' is here based on the Rousseauean humanist (SciFi) notion that our human sentience will always be envied by the 'soul-less' merely animate. The film's truth or moral is, however, that,"Love has nothing to do with anyone else !" And it has here been conjoined to the touching tragic story of "David," the robo-child hero of innocence, our latest kind of "super-toy."Doing what may very well be the upmost possible, within the sequential linear-narrative parameters of the media of cinema, this artistic portrayal of a timeless edifying parable, even more a spiritual-ethical near-futuristic science 'faction', IS a tragic statement. For "David," the cynical 'fact' remains that:"It doesn't matter how much YOU love, but how much you ARE loved!"For most of Spielberg's post-modern/post-humanist audiences, too. Also, like ALL the films from HIS hero, Stanley Kubrick, a single viewing is like not yet having seen this film at all ! I, for one, can't wait to see it again and again.</fullReview>

That is the part that disturbed me the most. I don't like to go to the movies to cry, and this film, if you don't leave too early, is a tear-jerker. He finally gets to live a day in his life that fulfills a need and a desire to see his dead parent again, and she dies on him again, and he's all alone again, alone with his dreams, but all alone.

		<shortDescription>Ick. (Mild spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into AI with mixed expectations, realizing that at bottom this was going to be a Spielberg film, which is enough to raise the hackles of the mildest cynic. The first hour is excellent; I can't say that I was on the edge of my seat, but I was really enjoying it. It beautifully combines the coldness of Kubrick with a touch of Spielberg sweetness as a temper. Even the character of the animatronic teddy bear, which aroused my suspicions initially as a Cute Plot Point, was not at all cloying. However, the film's decline is steep and rapid after the mother abandons David in the woods. The Flesh Fair scene is seemingly thrown in to provide an "Action" scene, and doesn't fit the rest of the plot, which doesn't really discuss the class system of this new world at all but only shows us a single wealthy family and a host of Jerry Springer Audience types with no exploration of the world in which both classes live.Osmont is a very talented young actor, but he isn't called upon to do much in this film aside from ; he and the always charismatic Jude Law do their best with the limited material, but there's only so much possible. The minute the insipidly animated "Doctor Know" appeared (beware any contemporary film with a Robin Williams cameo, alas) it was pretty much over for me. Smarmy and insulting. I felt, as many others have, that the film would have been best ended at the ferris wheel scene. The additional half hour following this very moving scene was implausible, saccharine and entirely unneccessary. The plot, after the beautiful beginning, is meandering and holey. Beyond the fact that I doubt Kubrick would've approved, AI just doesn't add up to good filmmaking, unfortunately. As someone I know said, we're all tired of watching Spielberg relive his childhood fantasies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. is in an awkward position as a film. With two big director's names attached to it (one of whom was dead during all principal photography and editing), it is bound to be heavily, even brutally, criticized. Kubrick fans may find it too warm and fuzzy for their tastes and at the same time, it may be just too plain weird for mainstream American audiences.A.I. is a portrait of the inevitable- machines becoming more and more like us, our relationships with them becoming even more intimate. To what extent A.I. presents this future accurately (as far as details are concerned) is irrelevant, because the basic philosophical issues are there.

		<fullReview>A.I. is in an awkward position as a film. With two big director's names attached to it (one of whom was dead during all principal photography and editing), it is bound to be heavily, even brutally, criticized. Kubrick fans may find it too warm and fuzzy for their tastes and at the same time, it may be just too plain weird for mainstream American audiences.A.I. is a portrait of the inevitable- machines becoming more and more like us, our relationships with them becoming even more intimate. To what extent A.I. presents this future accurately (as far as details are concerned) is irrelevant, because the basic philosophical issues are there.

		<fullReview>I don't know what all the raving is about but for my money this was a totally lame movie. If you can get past the insipid story line the first hour or so isn't half bad. (Aside from the fact that the concept of consequences for ones actions is nowhere to be found). Then the movie somehow degenerates into a mish-mash combination of "Total Recall" "Water World" and "The Wizard of Oz". Halfway through you cease to care even remotely and just wish the damn thing was over. The obsessive theme of David's "love" is at best perverse and reminds me more of a junior stalker than a loving "son". We could have done without more than 1/3 of the movies since it lends nothing to the story line and simply served to take up time. The story line is so full of inconsistencies and holes that at times it seems more like a comedy than a serious film. I half expect to see Eric Idle popping out of the wood work. After several nonsensical convolutions in plot and story line we end up with an even more insipid ending, replete with the "son" drifting off to sleep with his mummy in bed. The irony of it all is that David, didn't need to become a "real boy" he had already become a Golden Retreiver. (oh please love me, please, please, please love me..) ad infinitum, ad nauseum. Steven, you CAN do better than this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie not a great movie. After seeing this I wonder how much would have been different if Kubrick would have completed the project. This movie ends up being Spielberg's vision of what he believed Kubrick's vision was. I am not a Kubrick fan and think that Spielberg left alone would have made it a better movie. The first part of the movie is Spielberg and then it gets a little strange. Spielberg mad the movie without compromising his own believes but trying to stay loyal to Kubrick. A think that a lot of Kubrick's ideas show up in the middle and end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting a melodramatic, visually breathtaking rendition of Pinocchio. I got just that, with a subtle swabbing of Toy Story. The story is incredibly simplistic - don't expect the film's philosophies to be groundbreaking in the least. Stories like this have existed since the dawn of science fiction, and this one is no different from the rest. If you're an average human being, you'll follow the story easily. With the basic story being paper-thin, the movie must be maintained through good writing and a capable cast. The writing in itself isn't very difficult to follow, either - the characters aren't very deep. The cast carries the dialogue along quite nicely. Still, you get the feeling that you've seen this movie and its characters before, and you almost certainly have. Oh, and the ending sucks. After all the great wandering of the storyline, you're left with a dull, boring ending that hardly resolves anything in an intelligent manner. It feels rushed, as does the entire last 20 minutes of the film. Ultimately, the movie becomes apparent as an epic - thus the meandering plot. The movie must be looked at on the grand scale, not from scene-to-scene. And, when seen as an epic, you realize that the theme of the movie is not in its half-absent resolutions, but in the entire film's span. As you watch it, you must learn to accept the protagonist in his failed understanding of love and life. You must simply realize what he aspires to be and realize that the only important goal in the movie is for him to be content in his existence - that he feel love in return. Only then can you appreciate what he endures during the film. Overall, this movie is definitely not one of the greatest movies of all time; however, it is definitely not one of the worst. It only carries one true theme, but does a fine job in articulating it. Maybe if it wasn't so long...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. Artificial Intelligence is the most thought-provoking film I've seen since Memento earlier this year. The music and lighting were masterful, the acting was superb, and the storyline was better than expected. And the technology and special effects are amazing. You definitely get that prickly feeling on your neck that comes from every Kubrick film. At the same time, though, the story and lighting are distinctly Spielberg's. The score, which fittingly hints of Kubrick's 2001, compliments the story perfectly.I have a feeling audiences will be seeing a lot of great work from Jude Law as the robot Gigolo Joe. His plastic-like appearance is a perfect compliment to his stellar performance. Haley Joel Osment proves he's not just another childhood star we'll never remember 20 years from now. He convincingly portrays David, who could (and often does) pass for human if not for his robotic movements. David even has his own mecha toy, Teddy, a robotic teddy bear that is an absolute riot. Osment deserves an Oscar nomination, and unless there's some shockingly good lead male performances in movies yet to come this year, he should win it.The only thing wrong with A.I. is that Spielberg just couldn't resist the urge to, well, be Spielberg. The ending is way too sappy. Without revealing the ending, there is a much better time to end the film--about 20 minutes earlier than he did. Of course it wouldn't have been a "happily ever after" story, but Kubrick films aren't supposed to be that way, anyway. Overall, an 8/10, mostly because the end doesn't do the rest of the story justice. I can only hope the director's cut will play it out a little differently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Glad to see that A.I. is arousing this firestorm of controversy. That's the mark of a true masterpiece. After all, a work of art doesn't care whether it's "liked" or "understood". It only cares that the response is there (a syndrome Kubrick was very familiar with). Bravo, Stephen Spielberg! For my money, A.I. is the most important Sci-Fi thesis on film in 50 years (i.e., the classic atomic/red scare theme of "Day the Earth Stood Still"). As for Haley Joel Osment, the screen hasn't seen that kind of purity of acting since the silent days of Garbo and Chaplin. I see five, very big Oscar wins ahead for A.I.--Picture, Director, Actor, Cinematography, Art Direction.</fullReview>

He makes a robot whose name is David (Haley Joel Osment) and when a family signs up to get him he can't adjust to the environment of a human family. Later in the film he ends up in a Robotic Demolition show. He then gets away and makes friends with "Gigolo" Joe (Jude Law). He then sets out on an adventure to find the "Blue Fairy" and become a real boy. This film was just fantastic. There were two great directors who directed: Kubrick and Speilberg. They also have many marvellous actors like Osment, Hurt, and Law. This movie should be looked at by every director to see what a great film looks like.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is my last review of this movie, I swear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I have already written two reviews for AI. My first review was a real review and my second was an explanation of some logic holes. But in my first review, I was really confused whether or not I liked the movie. I knew it was brilliant, but I didn't know if I liked it.Well, I saw AI for a second time a few days ago. I have come to a conclusion: AI contains alcohol, but in reverse. Let me explain.I was watching the movie, my second rime, and I was thinking, "Man, this is not as good as I remembered it being." I saw how slow the movie was. I saw how pointless some scenes were. I noticed some really ugly dialog. But, I was enjoying the movie, maybe even more than the first time. Well, now it's two days later. Guess what? I'm having the exact same after-reaction I had the first time I saw AI. A few days after I saw AI, both times, I became totally obsessed with it. It's like a hangover, but good. I saw how wonderful the movie was. I saw every thing beautifully. Weird. Weird. Weird.So, what does this mean? Well, it means that AI is not a great movie. But, it does mean AI is a brilliant movie. It has stuck into my mind unlike ANY movie I have ever seen. Now, I remember loving the movie. I did love this movie. But, the second time around, I noticed more of the flaws. But, trust me, there's something about this movie. Something magical I just can't put my finger on. I feel like Richard Dryfuss from Close Encounters because I've become totally obsessed with this movie. I have downloaded all of the trailers. I've read every review by everyone. I've read everything about this movie that was ever written. I have even felt the need to order the poster and preorder the DVD. What's next? Mash potato piles in the shape of Teddy?Well, I have finally decided my rating. I love the movie, but despite my love, the movie is flawed. It has an ending that is too long. It has some awkwardness I can't put my finger on (the Chris Rock cameo does not belong). But, I still love it. I love the TRON motorcycle guys. I love the Flesh Fair. I love the ending (though it needs some trimming). I love the acting. I love the special effects. But do I love David? Can I love something that is not real? I think David starts out a robot and slowly becomes human. He learns love, hate, jealously, confusion, and weirdest of all, he learns suicide. No, that's not how it ends, but he does try it (if you've seen the movie, THINK!). Is David more human than he seems? I think so. This is one of the many questions that AI asks. For those of you who hated or disliked the movie, I have something to say: at least AI is asking some questions. No, it doesn't answer many of them. But, did you ever think that maybe the movie shouldn't supply the answers, YOU SHOULD. Just a though of mine.If you haven't seen AI yet, here's a tip. Don't expect 2001. Don't expect ET. Just go in, relax, have an open mind, and enjoy the show.Rating (I have it this time): EIGHT and A HALF (8 ?) out of TEN (10)PS: I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH! THIS IS NOT FOR YOUR KIDS! This is a very creepy and disturbing movie that creeped me out! I never get creeped out! And if I got chilled, then this movie will scare the pants off your 8-year-old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an amazing look into the human mind and how we deal with love. David's (Osment) quest for his own humanity and the hell is forced to endure by man forces to look at ourselves and how we define love and family. The love he has and the pain he endures is perfectly played by Osment. His acting ability is simply amazing and consequently you empathize with his character throughout the movie. Spielberg did an incredible job melding Kubrick's unique style with his own. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It is definitely at the top of this summer's top 10 list in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey Joe... (some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone expecting a Kubrick film should just forget about it. This is a Spielberg film from start to finish. Sure, there are a lot of moments where you might be reminded of Kubrick's style, but you can definitely see that this is Spielberg. Is that a bad thing? I guess not. Was I disappointed just a little at that? Yes. Now I've only seen it once, so my opinion isn't quite set in stone on this one. But here goes...I really liked this movie. I only have a couple complaints that don't really amount to much. 1. As much as I like all of his other work, John Williams should have sat this one out. Silence would have worked a lot better in most of the scenes, but because it's a Spielberg film, we needed a John Williams score. I think he could have respected the material a little more. 2. Now remember, this is only compared to the second and third, but the first act wasn't that good. Maybe it was the parents. They just seemed to flip-flop on the whole 'how should we treat David' thing.Outside of those two things, I think this is probably one of the most beautiful films ever made. The visual style (while not traditional Spielberg and nowhere near Kubrick) is wonderful. The story is so good that I couldn't help but think that this was an answer to all the really bad science fiction that's been coming out lately (eg. The Matrix and Star Wars ep 1).On to the spoilers. I really thought that the movie was going to end with David asking the blue fairy to be a real boy. And as the camera moved away and we heard the narrator's voice, I thought that it was a sad and tragic way to end the movie. And for me, that's a good thing. So when the mecha-archeologists came along, it was upsetting. I thought that they were ruining a perfectly good depressing ending. But, as it played on, it became more and more interesting. Now I like depressing endings as much as the next guy, but I don't think it would have been as good in this case. While the arc of David's character isn't that big, we really needed to see him fulfill his destiny. He's spent the whole movie with a single-minded purpose driving him. To see it happen in such a manner (which was somewhat depressing, but not much) was wonderful.We spent the first part of the movie seeing David through his parents' eyes. Sure, a part of me was just waiting for him to go off on an adventure on his own. But this can be blamed on previews that give away too much. The first act is trying to wrap our minds around the concept of these artificial beings and why we tend to think of machines that look like people as more than just machines. We don't think of them as our equals, but no one ever treats these robots the same way you treat a toaster. I suppose it makes sense. Animal rights activists often seem only interested in saving the cute animals (killing dolphins is bad, but please pass the tuna). The rest of the movie is from David's perspective. He is unbelievably driven to find his mommy's love by becoming a real boy. But we still remember why he is this way...simple programming. When we see him interact with Mommy in the end, she is finally the way he always wanted her to be. Was it real? Was it something that the Mecha-Ben Kingsley just fabricated? Who knows...I just really wanted to say "Mecha-Ben Kingsley."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies my wife and I have seen in the past couple of years. It does not deserve to be called science fiction, since it contains no new or interesting ideas. It combines predictable, two dimensional characters with a meandering plot and scenes that attempt to insult the viewer's intelligence. The ending is a pathetic waste that makes a bad movie even worse. We were tempted to walk out on this one, but stayed through the end only out of a sporting sense of intellectual curiousity.Unfortunately, many people continue to give this movie good ratings. I can only guess that this is because of the director's big name in Hollywood. But believe me, the emperor is naked. Don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A train wreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg has done the impossible - he's actually made a movie worse than "1941" - although we all found it very amusing that he managed to make a visual reference to that horrid film in this, his newest worst film.This train-wreck of a film is heavily populated with visual references to previous works by Spielberg &amp; Kubrick. Never mind the mind-numbingly stupid story about a mother's love, pinnochio and fairy tales. The rambling, boring, and ultimately stupid story line couldn't support this self-indulgent homage to Spielberg's past works, and was utterly disrespectful of Kubrick's legacy.These visual references that populate the film include the extra-terrestrials from Close Encounters, the ferris wheel from 1941, a wheelchair-bound actor from Dr. Strangelove, musical passages reminiscent of 2001... the list goes on. In fact, the only pleasurable part of this horrid piece of dreck is figuring out where the references were placed. They weren't hidden - the challenge was trying to stay awake to find them.Speaking of music - I'll never go to another movie scored by John Williams. He's tapped out - finished - kaput. His best work was done years ago, and all he's doing now is recycling old passages we've heard many, many times before. Considering Spielberg was pretty much doing the same thing as he put together this mish-mash of undeveloped storylines, it provides for an utterly unsatisfying experience. Consider my writing this review a cathartic passage - I'm attempting to cleanse myself after having sullied my moviegoing experience. I chose my titles carefully and try to avoid pop-culture garbage. This time, though, I really stepped in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A.I" is set in the plausibly distant future, one we seem to be headed for. If you go see this for nothing else, check out the world Spielberg creates and how he makes you believe it. The visual effects are the best I've seen.This is likewise the most accurate rendering of the future I've seen. There aren't giant mega-cities ruled by machines, nor has there been a nuclear holocaust. This future isn't based on flights of fancy, but is honest about the direction the human race (well, at least here in the U.S.) is heading in. Robots that can think for themselves, created by humans to fulfill human needs, may not be possible. But if we ever do create something as advanced as Artificial Intelligence, you have to think it would be this way. What's one of the first functions these beings would be used for? Of course, sex. There can be no denying it. The Gigolo Joes and their female counterparts would be the first ones off the assembly line.In this story, many kinds of robots have been created and discarded for a newer model, just like today's computers. These robots serve humans, but are also self-reliant. These robots have will. They want to survive. This creates a paranoia about them, which leads to the dreaded Flesh Fair. Old junked robots are captured and destroyed in all kinds of creative ways before a cheering crowd--the future equivalent of BattleBots, WWF or Monster Trucks. The Fair and the scavenger robots it victimizes is but one of many great ideas "A.I." offers.When the Flesh Fair crowd finds out scientists have created a child, no one can believe it. Why make a child robot? What purpose could it possibly have? Before too long someone figures it out: Somewhere out there, there's a mama who lost her child or a man and woman unable to conceive. All of a sudden these "Mechas" (Mechanicals) don't look so bad after all.David is programmed to love his mother forever if he is read seven certain words in a certain order. Once his love is turned ?on', love in this case being a program that begins running, it cannot be turned off. This is very profound and meaningful, so I appreciate that the film doesn't konk you over the head with this: once you love someone--really love someone, not like puppy love, twitterpation, infatuation, even the love behind most marriages--but REALLY love, like the way a mother loves her child, it cannot be turned off. We often love people who don't love us back because that's just the way it is. We even love people who are mean to us. That's why it's love. It's not a decision, but a condition. Love can make you crazy, drive you to make weird choices--like abandoning your robot son in the woods to fend for himself because he's a danger to your real son. Yes, Monica does the compassionate thing, the right thing, and that's why it's so sad.Now David is lost and alone, without the one person that matters to him, also knowing that person can't love him because he's not a ?real boy.' David believes he can become real with the help of the Blue Fairy from ?Pinnochio,' which he doesn't understand is just a fairy tale. Aiding him on his quest: the aforementioned Gigolo Joe, who'd just like to turn that ?blue' into something else. Hey, it's what he does (thank goodness Spielberg refrains from showing Joe teaching David how to dance and walk the way he does--not that there weren't a couple of threatening moments).I want to talk about the ending but I don't want to say ?spoilers!' because then people won't read on. So I'll be as vague as possible and just say (gasp!), it worked for me. Many have said that one ending was enough. True, the Manhattan/Coney Island scene would've been a great ending for any film: a satisfying, open-ended, fitting (but very sad) close to the story. This was the only point where I wondered why it kept going. But as I watched on, it started to make sense. The film becomes very somber and visual (the Kubrick portion of the story if you will) or what others would call ?slow.' Well, I'm a patient movie-goer so I'll sit through almost anything. This ending, however out of place it may feel, does tie up the story nicely. There are some parallels with the story's beginning and I like stories that end that way. Whether the film is better with or without this last half-hour I couldn't say. Maybe I'll go see it again and run away right when that moment comes.As for whether it's good or bad, which I haven't really expressed one way or the other--well, I have concerns. There's a whole lot of story here and it feels like too much even for a 2 and-a-half hour film. The first half is very good, but feels like merely the set-up for a bigger, bolder story to come. This bigger story never materializes. Not that one should materialize, it's just the signal the opening hour seems to be sending. Thus, the whole problem I had with it: the film wants to be about deep love that lasts thousands of years, but just ends up sending mixed signals. Watching "A.I," you feel more like a Mecha than a person. You find yourself thinking a whole lot, but not feeling much at all.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most Kubrick fans I was afraid Spielberg would turn AI into a kind of E.T. or Disney movie. I was looking for a dark movie but Spielberg is Spielberg...being a big Clockwork Orange fan I think it's a bit too sentimental and childish but that's the only bad thing I can say about it, which is not bad at all after all. The pace gets slower as the movie progresses and could have many different endings, you can see the Kubrick side and I guess that's something a lot of people don't like. If you're one of those and don't have the brain to understand you should stay away and watch any other piece of crap released these days (and you have a lot of choice this summer). As for the movie itself, the visual effects are perfect, the music and atmosphere are perfect, the cast is perfect and I will stop repeating, I think you got the idea! The best Spielberg ever, I can't wait to put this dvd next to my Kubrick collection. I don't understand why so many people gave horrible scores below 6, I guess they're the kind I was talking about a little earlier. Since I can't register a score of 11 I'll give it a 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again, Steven Spielberg has created a film with so much depth, it took me almost 24 hours to figure out how I felt about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>( If you haven't seen this movie and don't want to know anything about its contents, don't read this review.)A.I. was a difficult movie for me to wrap my mind around. It is never easy to see the human condition diminished in such an oppressive way. Movies like 'War of the Worlds', 'Mad Max', and other apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic movies brings out a depth of serious sadness from us, because as human-beings, we really believe that we are going to prevail and win the good fight. A.I. forces us to deal with disturbing issues, including the responsibility we as human-beings have to those less fortunate than ourselves, and the grief of dealing with the death of those we love.The casting for the film was well chosen. Jude Law played his role exceptionally as a robot created to service women sexually. His humorous posturing made him a likeable character as he danced in puddles of water like Fred Astaire, joyfully explaining describing his prowess with "the women". Frances O'Connor, who played the mother of the robot child (Haley Joel Osment), seemed more like a child, at times, than David, which added to the charm of their relationship. William Hurt played the role of creator of the robots, which set the tone for what I believe is one of Mr. Spielberg's most recurring messages in his larger-than-life films; the consequences of death and the consequences of playing God. Mr. Hurt skillfully plays all the aspects of the mad scientist which makes us both pity and loathe him the same way we did Richard Attenborough's character in 'Jurassic Park', the man who played God by cloning dinosaurs; his, the very epitome of human arrogance. Further, I cannot overlook Haley Joel Osment's performance as David, the robot child that would-be-human. I am torn because there is a part of me that fears the aftermath of giving too much credit to one who has so little experience. However, it has become too obvious that this kid has incredible natural talent. Haley has the ability to become the character in ways that make it difficult to distinguish the boy from the role.When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I immediately thought of a 1985 film in which a robot child named 'D.A.R.Y.L.' (an acronym for Data Analyzing Robot Youth Lifeform) is found by a married couple that have no children. The starring role was played brilliantly by one of my favorite young actors, Barret Oliver. While 'D.A.R.Y.L.' was a good film and most certainly reached the heartstrings, it was primarily centered on one family. A.I. looks at the human condition and deals with serious moral issues, which in my humble opinion, makes it a huge film that I foresee becoming a classic of the latter half of the twenty-first century.In conclusion, I think A.I. is one of those movies that holds all of us accountable for social responsibility. Cynics may think the overall connotation of this movie out-dated or boring, yet it deals with issues that we are still struggling with today. It also deals with issues yet to come, because with technology growing at such a rapid pace, the premise of this film surpasses the metaphorical message and becomes an exacting moral issue. It causes us to deal with the possibility of a new race, whether 'orga' or 'mecca' and hopefully forces us to redefine our view of what personal freedom is, giving new hope to those who are oppressed. Those persons in denial who choose not to see the moral implications of this film, in answer to the question, "What did you like about A.I.?", will no doubt answer, "Really cool special effects." Such is the way of those who are not comfortable thinking outside of a box. I, for one, am a movie buff who is grateful when a director seeks to make the words "big screen' synonymous with "good film" and will forever contemplate the meaning of the words that Jude Law's character spoke with such an indelible sense of self-awareness, "I am!" Though, if pressed, I must also admit that the special effects, were indeed, 'really cool'.</fullReview>

Never in my entire life have I ever felt so much for a character. David is the purest, simplest, most direct and pathos-driving 'hero' I've ever dealt with, and frankly, it was almost too much. It's been 45 minutes and my eyes still hurt, and thinking about it makes me want to cry more.Maybe I'm emtional, maybe I'm overly sensitive, maybe I'm reading more into this than I should, and maybe I'm drawing personal comparisons and such that I wasn't intended to.

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's often bleak view of humanity is a difficult meld with Speilberg's notorious sentimentality. A.I. is the first Kubrick film since "Killer's Kiss" I can remember having a soft landing at the end. It's also the most negative vision Speilberg has ever attempted. Contrary to the main perception that Speilberg's ending is counter to Kubrick's wishes, Stanley had a very, very, similar ending in mind since the early script treatments - before Speilberg's involvement. A lot of fans wish it had a different point of ending, perhaps earlier in the film, but Speilberg seems to have stayed true to Kubrick's wishes. This was meant to be an elaborate fairy-tale from the beginning, and I feel Kubrick and Speilberg wanted that sort of ending. Osment and Law give Oscar-worthy performances, and O'Connor is perfectly cast as a brittle, but loving mother-figure. The point where she lovingly sends David into the forest to escape the 'evil' stepfather, or his minions, is right out of a Grimm's tale. The scene in Dr. Hobby's lab, with all the packaged Davids and Darlenes is great, like Antinea's hall of gilded former lovers, or a truckload of Pod People. Yikes! I came away with the sad knowledge that no matter how good this pic was, K's protectors of the creed would duke it out with S's zealots. I thought it was a great flick, and I'll see it more than once more. So far this summer, it's the only movie worth seeing. Yeah, tell me about the art-house fare, but I'm waitin' in line again for A.I.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What might have been a great film was hampered by a flawed screenplay, often annoying make-up and uneven direction, AI, Artificial Intelligence is the story of an android in the shape of a child, who wants to be real. Sound familiar? Well, it should, only this version of Pinocchio heavily plagiarises the book, while using the book as a basis for its plot. Huh? Exactly. It is a hodgepodge of ideas, often dark and brooding, with a message that is unclear.To begin with, the film is too long-over two hours-and I dread any director's cut, which might eventually surface of dvd with deleted scenes. Nor is this a children's film. Steven Spielberg has repeatedly stated that he is a fan of the old Disney films, but it is clear that he does not get it, any more than Brian De Palma does not get what Hitchock was about. True, there were always some frightening moment in any of the early Disney films-Pinocchio, Dumbo, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty-but there were always heroes and always triumph and hope. AI is an episode of the Twilight Zone, which, despite its triumphant special effects and the wonderful acting of Haley Joel Osment, is two hours too long. Where the recent O Brother, Where Art Thou, too liberties with Homer's Odyssey, AI lacks the originality it set forth.David is a robot, who has been programmed to love. Unfortunately, no one loves him back. And so, with his futuristic Teddy Ruxpin, he goes in search of the Blue Fairy that he read about in Pinocchio. Only how does one really find a fictional thing? Along the way he meets Gigolo Joe played by Jude Law, a positively frighteningly plastic-looking sex robot, which apparently the make-up artists patterned after the vinyl-looking wombequins manufactured today by Real Doll and sold via the Internet by mail.From a loving home to an evil stepbrother to a Flesh Fair, where robots are thrown sentient into propeller blades or melted with acid, we have to wonder what Spielberg was like as a child. Basically, this is a mean-spirited film that serves only to torture the helpless boy toy. Nothing about this is bright. There are no tears of joy waiting to be shed. All that one can say after enduring its ponderous length is, 'I'm just glad it didn't happen to me.' This might not have been bad if all the sex and gore were removed. But there they are and here we are-two bags of popcorn later and none the better for it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'll just have to see this one for yourself. The film has a main flaw that is discussed in nearly every published review and every user comment on imdb.com. I call the already infamous sequence a flaw only because it goes on for too long. However, it doesn't bother me nearly as much as it does some. The bottom line is that the movie is thought-provoking, dreamy, haunting, and thrilling. Not to mention overlong, flawed, and disjointed. I can't recommend it because you might hate it. It's a possibility even for die-hard Spielberg fans. At the same time, a non-Spielberg fan could find this to be his best film. So I could recommend it because you might love it. My head is spinning.I thought it was very good and I arrived at that after a day's thought. This movie cannot be compared with many others in terms of its mood. Perhaps details of the plot were derived from films past, but it's a new atmosphere. Whether you'll like being in it depends on you. Whatever the case, it's not forgettable by any stretch and it'll be referred to for years to come. So there's my opinion for what it's worth, but I assure you in this case it's not worth a thing.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A.I." can probably be broken down into three sections. Without giving much away, the first is of course when David, amazingly played by Haley Joel Osment, comes to live with the Swintons. But he's no regular kid. He's actually a sophisticated robot who was programmed to love. He was the first of his kind and when a certain chain of coded words are spoken to him, whoever says them will be the object of his love. The movie is optimistic, which is the contribution of it's director, Steven Spielberg, who shows the good in a film that would have probably been pretty dark if the late Stanley Kubrick had directed it himself. All in all, I think this was am amazing and thoughtful film. Jude Law is a colorful character who tries to help David along the way, wonderfully playing a robot programmed in the art of pleasuring woman. The movie takes on a futuristic sort of Pinocchio, with a talking teddy bear acting as David's "Jimminy Chrickett" and a trip to a place called Rouge City. Osment outacts everyone onscreen hands down, and even though he's a robot, you can't help but hope right along with him that he'll get what he truly wants, which is to be loved. I gave this film a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Collaborator Needed: Call Steven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an epic cinematic work, A.I. possesses both a beautiful and an irksome soul. The beauty comes from the visionary baton of director Steven Spielberg and from the incredibly eloquent Haley Joel Osmont, whose acting is simply uncanny. The irksomeness comes from Speilberg's screenplay, an unfortunate pastiche incorporating at least three different narrative tones, two and a half stories, and an overabundance of undisciplined imaginative license.If you search the IMDB under "Spielberg", you'll see that Steven Spielberg, despite his directorial craft and more than occasional genius, has only a few writing credits to his name. A.I. is notable as an insight into how far the boy wonder has to go before he can again solo as a writer. The box office champ obviously had the power to wing this screenplay on his own, but doing so was a mistake. I wish he had sought counsel; the central theme in this tale deserved it. Spielberg would have benefitted greatly from running his final draft by any number of script doctors - Robert Towne for instance - before pre production.Not that the film fails entirely; as I said, it has a beautiful soul too. But the mistakes and missed opportunities are of such an obvious and repetitive nature that experienced and mature filmgoers will be distracted - constantly standing on the sidelines rather than immersed in the film. Like other's commenting here I saw a number of viewers get up and leave two thirds of the way through. Amazing.I encourage you to see this film if you're a serious film lover, if only to watch Spielberg's feet of clay stride ardently toward what turns out to be an only partially realized epistle about love. His ambition is almost Faustian. My own opinion is that after three masterful serious films (Schindler's List, Amistad and Private Ryan) and an intermezzo with the great Kubrick around this project, Spielberg reapproached the lost boy genre as a writer-director, and found himself in an almost schizoid void between Kubrick's distanced visual language (pulled off with great aplomb in A.I.'s first third by DP Janusch Kaminsky) and the magical sci-fi fantasies of his own youth.The result is a genetic experiment. There are strange flowers along the way and many have a strange smell to them. Some are downright garish. The most luscious fragrances are the musical passages composer John Williams scored to accompany David's first days with his adoptive family. David's strange presence is echoed in William's paraphrases of Bartok. Where Stanley Kubrick needed to license Bartok recordings for films like "The Shining", Spielberg has his longtime maestro John Williams around to recombine Bartok's strange Hungarian tonalities for A.I. In the early family scenes, this Williams-Jaminsky mixture is original and stimulating. It's a new kind of Spielberg magic. Unfortunately, this new intoxicating mist is nowhere else to be found in the film. I would have loved Spielberg to carry this atmosphere through to its logical end - as would have many I discussed the film with afterward. These passages spoke of the strange bond building between David and his mother with greater eloquence than any of the bathetic Pinocchio references in the next two hours.Indeed, I strongly felt the opening impetus of Speilberg's story was completely hijacked by Pinocchio. I became completely sidetracked by thoughts of "How is Spielberg ever going to let a robot become a real boy?" The original question was a much more compelling one: "Can a creature programmed to love unconditionally ever be matched in its ardor by the object of its affection?" This hypothetical, posed by a female scientist of African descent in the first scene, remains the real spine of the story. But it evaporates once David is abandoned by his mother. Or, perhaps, it is simply answered in the negative in the first hour by her very abandoning of him, making the next 90 minutes anti-climactic - an irritating retread of Pinocchio rather than the original, thought-provoking investigation of the first 45 minutes.After this abandonment we plummet to sensational sequences drawn from Mad Max and Blade Runner, culminating in a final, grandiose apocalyptic epilogue. The SPFX budget goes through the roof, yet nothing in the hearts of viewers is deepened beyond the original family scenes. For a theme this profound, Spielberg might have consulted Aeschuylus, Sophocles and Shakepseare, as well as Collodi.Despite its failings, I draw great hope from A.I. It is beautiful beyond imagining in places. And great filmmakers need to make big, public mistakes to get them actively reevaluating and rerouting themselves into new territory. Spielberg is an opus filmaker, a career director with a historically significant oeuvre. Perhaps someday he'll become a great screenwriter too. Meanwhile, we and he can take comfort in knowing that his burgeoning into a full literary auteur won't be mandatory for him to realize more great cinema. His directorial resources and maturity have already been proven in two of his last three serious films. Next time he writes a film, I would like to see him surrender his prodigious imagination to a great collaborator who is brave enough to discipline and shape his inventions. I'm sure Stanley Kubrick would have done so, had he lived.(It should also be noted that Spielberg buddy George Lucas's fourth installment of Star Wars also suffered primarily from a screenplay that fell short of Lucas's earlier work. Even the greatest lose their objectivity and need the humility to seek good counsel - Orson5 - 7/3/01.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oil and Water</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As others have said, the styles of Kubrick and Spielberg are like oil and water. While Spielberg does manage to treat the film in a distant, cold, Kubrick type of way for the most part, there are a few obvious (and extremely unfortunate) spots where he reverts back to his more sentimental approach that doesn't do the story justice.There are alot of things to love about this film, really- particularly the performances.When all is said and done, this story was obviously meant to be a tragedy, but Spielberg doesn't really seem suited to it. I kept finding myself wondering what various scenes might have been like had Kubrick been directing. I expect the Flesh Fair would've been more gruesome, Gigolo Joe's exploits more disturbing, and David's destiny far more tragic.No, I don't have a crystal ball or a hotline to Kubrick's coffin. It's just a hunch.Even still- very good movie. Definitely deserves to be seen twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that left me speechless for a day and a half.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily one of the strangest movies ive ever seen. It's not kubrick strange. You leave the movie saying "eh....uh....i...." there is just nothing. There is one comment i did have, but it was spoiler filled but it was that "At least the S****S*** was cool" figure it out.This movie is actually three movies in one (reminiscent of Full Metal Jacket, which was two in one). It starts of as a psychological sci-fi drama about the robot boy and gaining acceptance. That is what the ads show. Then it turns into an adventure 'buddy comedy' between osment and jude law. Then just when you think its all over and has this kubrick ending thats kinda really disturbing... theres another hour that is incomparable with any film ever made. this is what makes you leave the theater speechless. The ending will throw you for a loop, you wont know what to think.. worth seeing??? i havent decided yet. But its something everyone SHOULD see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good god, when will it end?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, despite the summary line, I did actually enjoy most of this movie. As many others have said, it would have been a very good movie had it ended in the narrated underwater scene on Coney Island. Why Spielberg felt compelled to wrap this movie up in a little package at the end escapes me. After all, it is not a kids' movie, and was not marketed as one. I thought it was trying to appeal to "thinking" types, like fans of 2001: A Space Odyssey and the like. Guess not. Kubrick fans will be disappointed with the turn this movie takes in the last 40 minutes or so. The first hour/hour and a half was very good. I wish I had walked out with the other 15 or 20 people after the underwater scene--I think I would have left the movie feeling good about it. The massacred, drawn-out, cheesy ending really spoils it. All in all though, worth seeing. Very good acting by Osment and Law.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you love a robot child? If he genuinely loves you, can you love him back? If you didn't know that David is a robot, would it change how you think and feel about him?The most interesting aspect of this movie is not that it just asks these questions, but it makes the audience answer them. You will not find the answers in the movie, instead, the movie does make the hell of an effort to make YOU care for its main character. And it is Spielberg who directed the movie, so you know that when it comes to making audience care, love, and cry, he is the best man for the job.So whether you want it or not, by the end of the movie you will have your answers. The question is, will you like what these answers tell about you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One big ball of heartache</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very impressed with the movie. The first time I saw it was at a test screening at the theater that I work at. I must say that this movie ranks among Hollywood's finer emotional masterpieces. It has a beginning that leaves you wondering, but not for long. It is as other viewers have said, that the movie didn't take long to hit it's climax. The end is what had me rather depressed but I won't give it away for those who haven't seen the movie yet. Still I must add that Haley Joel Osment did a terrific job in his role as David. The young actor is thirteen years old but was able to project an air of child-like innocence throughout the movie which really impressed me. I don't know about anybody else but I think that this movie is tremendous Academy Award material, especially Osment in the role that he took part in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somebody call the cops! How many good and bad films have been stolen from to create this bomb? Here's the short list: FRANKENSTEIN, PINOCCHIO, 2001, ET, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, EYES WIDE SHUT, BLADE RUNNER, GLADIATOR, ROLLERBLADE, RUNNING MAN, METROPOLIS, WATERWORLD -- and a bit of the World Wrestling Federation thrown in too.The idea behind this mess is a robot who can have real emotions and dream real dreams. Instead we get robotic emotions -- manipulation after manipulation. You know the film is in trouble when its most interesting character is a mechanical Teddy bear. Why Spielberg wanted to resurrect this Kubrick nightmare is beyond me.It's as if HAL, the cooing robot from 2001, took the form of a boy and tried to figure out what being human means. And this dreadful stuff goes on for two and one half hours that can never be retrieved. Hey, Mr. Spielberg, don't bother with Kubrick any more. Fairy tales in modern settings are OK, but don't try to get existential and surreal on us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Brillant, Very Gripping, but a bit sappy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was quite a movie experience. Speilberg added a very unique film to his long list of other masterpieces. Unfortunately, Speilberg sometimes has a way of going for emotional and sappy endings and stories. This story originally brought to Spielbergs attention by the late Stanely Kubrick, has a very dark edge to it. At times it's a very dark and depressing film. You can tell when Spielberg holds true to the original premise by Kubrick. The director does this film very brilliant unfortunately (I do not want to give much away) but put too much happiness and muck attached on the ending. The film itself though does hold your interest throughout. You can definitely feel the vibes of the late Kubrick mixed in with some Spielberg style. The special effects are top notch and the Cinematography and visual effects are mind blowing. But one of the strongest points of this movie is the acting. Hally Joel Osment is one talented kid. He's got more talent then I have seen out of a lot of grown actors. But the one who stole the movie was the scene stealing Jude Law. His performance had Best Supporting Actor Nom written all over it. He really makes up for this year's stinker Enemy at the Gates. The two together on the screen are dynamite. Plus you'll love Teddy. The film has its share of sap and story weak points but its beautiful and well done at the same time. Definitely check it out for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth watching, despite flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My rating of this movie (out of 10, as usual) is a *6.1 and a half*. That is much lower than I would have expected, and I may be being generous. You know how I am. I wasn't even hugely excited, and I was still disappointed.I'm going to have a hard time discussing the movie without going through the whole plot. Once you see it, I'll be glad to talk with you about it. Basically, the problem with this movie is it never figures out what its point is. It jumps from conflict to conflict, yet never seems to link them thematically coherently. I also had a very nagging problem about Henry Swinton's sudden, unexplained character change (in my eyes, he does an about-face on an issue incredibly drastically). Also, it has a Kubrick ending. The last half hour of any Kubrick ending breaks away from the rest of the movie and makes no sense.Let me regroup.Ostensibly, the movie is nothing more than a futuristic look at Pinocchio. It owes a huge debt to it, and the movie features the story prominently. David obviously wants to become a real boy. He is the first artificially intelligent robot programmed to love. This concept presents many conflicts. What is love? What does it mean to "program love" into a robot? If a robot can love a human, can a human love a robot? Is an artificially intelligent being considered "real"? Do they have rights? Are they citizens? What does it mean to be human? What is the meaning of life? Will artificial intelligence ultimately destroy us? The problem with the movie is it can't figure out what to focus on, and therefore tries to focus on everything, thereby creating a disjointed storyline where characters disappear, plotlines don't resolve, and themes bounce around but don't cohere, lessening the overall effect. Everything feels like a plot device. And the ending, as I said, comes out of *nowhere*. I was prepared for the movie to end; I was even preparing my mental evaluation of the ending, because it satisfied me to some extent. Then an extra half hour of Kubrick materializes.What is good about this film? As you would expect, Haley Joel Osment is excellent. His excessive makeup gives him a look "not quite human" and his robotic voice is incredibly convincing. He has not blinking down to an art. Jude Law is very good as well. I liked John Williams' score, especially because he worked with some techno in a couple scenes, which was interesting. The special effects are amazing. All the robots are very, very realistic. Kudos to whoever worked on them, animatronics and effects. Also, just like the disappointing *Shrek* had its Gingerbread Man, who I felt should get his own movie, *A.I.* has Teddy. Every single scene with Teddy is a scene worth watching. Teddy plain rocks. I want Teddy.All in all, the movie is still worth watching as a whole to at least see the concepts presented, even if they're not handled very well. It's not terrible, though extremists would call it that. Most of the critical reviews have been mixed, and as my score indicates, such opinions are valid. It is a very problematic movie. Much of the time I was thinking, the game is so much better. Much more complex and interesting. But the game is not only completely immersive, but also spanning months and a whole different type of media. It would be very hard to make a movie of the game and do it justice, although, God, I would see it if someone did.Final judgment: 6.1 and a half. Worth watching, but don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark, meloncholy quest for love and humanity...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard a lot of people dwell on whether they "enjoyed" A.I. or not. But I don't think it's that kind of movie. It is not the kind of movie that you go to for cheap thrills or nudity or even special effects (even though it has its share of beautiful effects), ie- It is a not a film of 'pure entertainment' for the weak of mind who go to the movies to be bombarded by half-assed love stories, heros, villains and scantily-clad women.I won't waste time telling you about the plot, because about 200 people have done that already. However, I will tell you that it is quite an amazing experience that has to be seen. A person should not base his or her opinion on user comments, because A.I. is the type of film that will divide audiences. Everyone will have their own opinion.Personally, I found it fascinating, thought-provoking, vivid, and quite dark at times, all the time maintaining a very unsettling, meloncholy atmosphere that I thought fit well into the film.Above all, it is a fairy tale. A person must remember this while watching it or they will be lost. It is a journey, an odyssey (an often dark odyssey) for a part of life that we, as humans, often take for granted- love. It is a journey that we can relate to, because of its visionary concept, Spielberg's ability to captivate the audience, and above all- Haley Joel Osment's ability to carry the film with his performance. It is a tale of humanity, technology, lonliness, the horrors of existence, and the most complete, purest form of love- unrequited love.I will not tell you whether to see this movie or not. All I can say is that I found it to be a spectacular experience, and a wonderful achievement for Steven Spieberg.For those Kubrick fans who are skeptical, I will say that I am also a Kubrick fan, an enormous Kubrick fan. I have seen every film that Stanley Kubrick has allowed the public to see. And, although this film most likely did not turn out exactly how Kubrick would have made it, you must remember that Kubrick himself said that Spielberg was probably more qualified to make the film than himself.This is a movie I believe everyone should see, whether you like, dislike it or are unsure about it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely worth a look (or two). While the standards set by the involvment of Kubrick and Spielberg are incredibly high, the film plays like a strange amalgamation of their cinematic trademarks. Perhaps thats a good thing given the flesh versus fiber-optics storyline. While Kubrick operates on the cerebral, Spielberg is tugging the emotional. Does it pay off in context of this piece, I think so. The sentimentality comes off as very arch and manufactured. I'm not sure this is an accident, after all, David(Osment) is a human construct hard-wired to love by a group of engineers. Bottom line, amidst the nonsense at the megaplex this summer, this is really thought provoking and interesting. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an underrated masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a film that rises above the average.Everything about it from the story and the acting, to the music and the visual effects, is wonderfully done.It was directed by Steven Spielberg and was the brainchild of Stanley Kubrick, so that's enough for it to be worth watching by itself.But the film is so much more. For one thing it raises so many moral and ethical questions, so it inspires much more thought then a standard science fiction flick.Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense) gives an inspired performance as the robot boy, David. He wonderfully portrays the way the robot progresses throughout the film: making the eventual change from stiff machine to being practically human.There are great supporting roles by Jude Law and William Hurt. Jude Law's graceful physicality recalls Gene Kelly's performance in ''Singing In the Rain'', and William Hurt plays the grief stricken and obsessed scientist very well indeed.The film, like many of Kubrick's, is divided into three parts.The first part mostly takes place in the sterile house where David is taken after he is created. In this section simple emotions are explored: love, happiness, jealously, and resentment.In the second part of the film, David goes on a journey throughout the world. The strong colours of the Flesh Fair and Rouge City, are in stark contrast to the subdued shades of David's old home. The second half represents more the physical side of life; it is loud and carnal, with lots of fleshy and boisterous happenings.The third and shortest part of the film explores the mind. It is not clear how much of what's being shown is actually happening and how much is in David's head.The entire film feels like a dream, constantly shifting, changing pace and tone. It's incredible moving, and visually stunning.This is filmmaking of the highest order.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AI: worth a watch? The answer is yes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI is an interesting, yet puzzling film to watch and review. Many are aware of the story surrounding the two directors involved, Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. They both wanted the other one to direct, but Kubrick passed away, so Spielberg took up the reins as director, and came out with a visually stunning film, that can come up short at times.WHY YOU SHOULD WATCH IT: As said above, incredible visuals and effects. A great cast (Meryl Streep, Jude Law, Brendan Gleeson and Robin Williams to name a few) that seem 100% devoted to this project. Haley Joel Osment gives a surprisingly believable performance. There are also some genuinely sad and disturbing scenes, made all the more sad and disturbing with a brilliant score. And it has an interesting premise, and while it is not looked into too deeply, it still makes you think.IT'S FLAWS: A conflicted director. With Spielberg, the crowd-pleasing film maker, doing a artsy and thoughtful Kubrick film, he seems like he's not quite sure which direction to go in for this film. Consequently, the feel of this movie moves so quickly between dark and disturbing to happy and whimsical, that it sometimes throws you off. certain characters get some anticlimactic and unceremonious goodbyes, and at some points the story lacks sense. The climax, that was written by Kubrick himself, tries so hard to make a happy ending out of the depressing story of the movie, it doesn't fit in.BUT SHOULD YOU WATCH IT? Yes! Even if you only watch it once, at least you can say that you did. It's not "best film" worthy, but there are so many talented people working on this project, that in the end, you can always find something to enjoy. Be it Jude Law's eccentric performance, the unique visual style, or John William's score. Love it or hate it, it's been hailed as a classic.WHO SHOULD WATCH IT? Unless your kid is made of strong stuff, I would recommend not letting a kid under the age of 10 watching this (9 would be pushing it). It contains some mature stuff kids may not understand.I hope this review was helpful to you, if it was, I shall do more of these reviews on various other movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a sci-fi philosophical movie that keeps things simple. When I first saw this movie I thought it was amazing. Back than the CGI, visuals and special effects was top notch when it came to this movie. Seeing it now I can see some areas that are lacking, when it comes to the development. But it still holds up today as a really good movie. I actually got a chance to see this again because one of my friend wanted to see it during Mother's Day and it actually made me tear up a bit. Than I knew this movie was doing something right. Steven Spielberg's child-like heart and imagination really comes to life in this movie. It just has so much heart and emotion. And Haley Joel Osment was such a great child actor back than, he actually is one of the drive of this film. It's a shame he didn't grow up to be tall and handsome. This film seemed to combine elements from Kubrick and Hitchcock with Spielberg's imagination. This is a sci-fi film with heart and imagination with a bit of philosophical view points thrown in. Although I disliked the ending, I still give this movie a 8/10.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody talks about Stanley Kubrick and his collaboration with Steven Spielberg which eventually led to filming of A.I. However, we can only guess how much Steven Spielberg altered the movie when he took over.In any case, back in the day when A.I. hit the theaters someone in my surroundings said how that had been "one of the worst movies in a while". After more than a decade and a couple of viewings on TV it is not that bad, yet it offers nothing memorable apart from being excruciatingly long.And if you would like to ignore the bad things and concentrate on the good, there is little to be mentioned apart the reputation of both aforementioned authors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some films with great potential that somehow go horribly wrong. AI is one. When this happens I get an irresistible urge to re-edit it into something worthwhile. Forget the William Hurt boring prologue. Cut the family theme to five minutes. Start the real film when the kid gets dumped. AI only really comes alive when Jude Law dances in, literally. What a revelation he is in this role. End the film with disappointment when Osment finds Hurt. He has to learn that Pinochio is just a story and that Hurt is his real father. So what if it only runs 70 minutes? At least I won't fall asleep as I did three times during this boring excuse for deep thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I coincides with one of those films, for me that has kept me at the edge of my seat even 'til this day. This heart-warming classic has a perfect balance that transcends both logical and emotional aspects of the world and that is a rarity in a lot of films. I am not praising this film due to the A-list production that has it's way of wavering great marketing structure. Even if this film would have been independent, I would still give it 10 stars for it's innate innovation and grandeur yet placid storyline. The acting is superb and does not come off forced. Frances O'Connor (Monica) is one of those actresses that I immediately googled after i saw this movie, just to see what other movies she starred in. Her performance as Monica is phenomenal even though her sentiments anger you towards David - you can easily sympathize with her and feel her genuine pain. The real star in this movie of course, is Haley Joel Osment. I loved him in the Sixth Sense, but in this film - WOW. You don't have a better child actor than that. I read that during this film, he didn't blink once to create the robotic-esque feeling that he pulled off so gracefully. I could see why this movie is NOT a lot of people's cup of tea -- the stance stands alone in such a poetic notion that it contains layers of issues that surround us on a daily basis. From the issues of time, love, technology, sex, future, and questionably the most potent on of all: Mankind's inevitable doom. Many people don't like to discuss those issues thereafter, and try to avoid them altogether. But Osment goes through an incredible journey and carries the role like a pro gliding us through substantial information - yet we strongly, and deeply care for this kid. Throughout the movie, David tries to find Monica despite her not wanting him in her home anymore. He resonates strong naivety but that instills in all of us in some sort of way to pursue that idealistic idea; which makes David so believable - and so agonizing at the same time. At one point you think David is insane to go through all that trouble to find the person who abandoned him in the woods, but in the end you continue to root for him since he is following his desire and Monica was all he had known. In the end, David finds Monica and you couldn't be any happier. I have never in my life felt so triumphant, yet so depressed at the same time during a movie scene. My emotions were fluttering everywhere and I wounded up crying hysterically. David character development renounces that "if one believes, then one is" - and that is the theme to the movie. Such a great great film - I can go ages about this but in one exquisite word I'd say A.I derives in EXCELLENCE!</fullReview>

I liked it as well as 2001 A Space Odyssey and that's saying a lot. Both are near perfect films for me. I'd give Slaughter House Five a 10. Anyway this film captured my attention immediately and kept me interested right to the tear flowing climax.I recently reviewed a horrible film where I said there hasn't been a good American film produced in decades, well this is clearly an exception as there are some others.

		<fullReview>A.I: Artificial Intelligence-**1/2-Watchable- Directed by: Steven Spielberg, Written by: Steven Spielberg, Brian Aldiss (Short Story), Starring: Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Brendan Gleeson, Sam Robards, William Hurt, Jake Thomas, Ken Leung, Michael Mantell, Adrian Grenier, Narrated by: Ben Kingsley.Kubrick's adaptation of Brian Aldiss's short story is re-written by his friend and colleague Steven Spielberg after his death and his decision to give his project to Spielberg. The film covers the story of a couple whose son is in a coma and are looking for an answer. They are given a robotic boy to replace the old son, but when the old son comes back to consciousness, the robot boy begins to develop feelings and wishes to become a human as well.I had high hopes for this film, but I was gloriously disappointed by it. The film is an awkward mixture of Spielberg's humanism and Kubrick's signature dehumanism. These two are both present in the film, which throws the whole thing off-balance. Spielberg had complete control, but he used the film not only as his own work of individual art, but also as a homage to Kubrick. The two do not fit together as well.There is a lot of beautiful and effective moments, moments of hair-raising suspense, moments of creativity, moments of beautiful passages about childhood innocence. These passages are so winning, that the film almost seems excellent and on the level of both Spielberg and Kubrick's greatest masterpieces, but when we look at how uneven and how splintered in indecision the film is, we can barely see these positive qualities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Effort From Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stirring, high-quality film with solid acting and an interesting story, what sets A.I. apart from the usual Hollywood fare is that it is not mere entertainment. This film explores human moral obligations regarding the things we create. If humankind creates a robot that can love and develop a will of its own, is it still just a machine? The viewer begins by watching a sci-fi flick set in a family home; but the film becomes extraordinary through two expansions of our frame of reference, suggesting that we weigh the human capacity for cruelty and consider our own existential significance in time-space. And it's entertaining! Good stuff, this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From what I understand, A.I. was a Stanley Kubrick passion project that he wanted to make for years, but unfortunately passed away before he could make it. So Steven Spielberg, who basically idolized Kubrick decided to finish it. And when it was released not many people knew what to think. Me personally, I really liked this film, I mean it's not perfect, but the stuff it gets right, it gets really, really, really right.I never got the whole "Spielberg Smultz," thing that people complain about in his movies like "Hook" and "War of the Worlds." And then I saw this film, and I got it, it's so obvious when Spielberg added something that Stanley Kubrick obviously wouldn't, and it doesn't always fit, and sometimes feels awkward. Some of the characters are pretty bland, and it's just so incredibly depressing at points. I mean some parts are lighthearted, but sometimes the movie is just so meanspirited that it's kind of hard to watch.OK, first good thing, the special effects. This movie is twelve years old and these effects still look fantastic. Almost every single one of them looks real. Two, the main character David, is fantastic, I felt for him, when bad stuff happened to him I wanted to reach in and help him, mostly thanks to Haley Joel Osment's stellar performance. Jude Law was great, and I will have no one tell me otherwise. And the film brings up some great ideas about life, and what it means to truly be alive. It certainly made me question morality more than 2001: A Space Oddysey did.A.I. may suffer from some smultz, but if you can get past it than there is some really good stuff in this film. I recommend it highly to any fan of science fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the future, polar icecaps have melted and oceans have risen, wiping out cities like New York and such. Although many humans perished in the ensuing famine, some folks are still quite rich, including American couple Monica (Frances O'Connor) and her husband, Henry (Sam Robards). But, money isn't everything, for their son Martin has an incurable illness and is in a cryogenic state. Monica, still grieving greatly, comes to read to him every day. Also in vogue are very human-like robots, who are servants and prostitutes for the wealthy. Now a top scientist (William Hurt) announces that he is going to make a child-robot who will actually feel love for his mother. When an underling ponders a situation in which robot-child is not loved back, he has a useless answer. At once, Henry sees an opportunity to help Monica and he buys the first robot boy, David (Haley Joel Osmet). In his instructions are a set of verbal commands which will "imprint" David's love for Monica irreversibly. Initially opposed to his acquisition, Monica grows to love him, as her heart is hurting. Unexpectedly, a cure for Martin's disease is discovered and he comes home, completely well. Immediately, Martin begins to taunt and trick David as they both compete for their mother's love. Eventually, Martin has a serious accident, at David's hands, so Monica knows he cannot stay. But, although the company's instructions were for the robot-boy to be returned and destroyed, she can't do it. Instead, she takes him out to the woods and abandons him and his "supertoy" talking Teddy. The real horror is about to begin, for not only does David need the love of his mother but the poorer folks gather wandering robots and destroy them in an ancient Roman type arena. David is seized and so is Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a robot who was "framed" for murder. What will be their fate? The plot is so complicated, it is difficult to do it justice but it is fairly fascinating. And, the movie starts off with a real jolt and continues on until the final quarter, where it loses steam and credibility. The cast is really great, with Osmet a wonder as the robotic child and beautiful O'Connor an object of pity and scorn as the confused mother. Law, too, is quite fine as the futuristic robot-lover and all other cast members do nice work, too, although Hurt has only two major scenes. The look of the film is an even stronger asset, as its artistic direction and special effects are terrific, creating a world like few others and a marvel to behold. The scenes of robot destruction are fairly potent, as the robots look like human beings, so be cautious about letting young children watch it. Also, the ending is controversial, with the likelihood that some viewers will like it, others will not. But, if you adore science fiction, Spielberg or well-crafted effects, you should do the intelligent thing and rent this one in the near future.</fullReview>

First, Monica loves David. However, when his son whose name is Martin recovers from the ill, David is thrown in the forest. David loves Monica and he attempts to go back to her house with Teddy which is his friend.This movie is considered philosophical point of view. This movie makes me sad because this movie is described the lives of people in the future clearly. It is very cruel and it makes us think of the android. David is hardly different from human beings.

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick was right to identify his long-gestating A.I. project as being more aligned to Steven Spielberg's sensibilities. But it's a double-edged sword: the result is a muddled concoction of the latter director's tautest emotional drama, his most sumptuous visual excesses, and his most turgid sentimental stargazing. In that order.The film is inspired by the short story Super-Toys Last All Summer Long by Brian Aldiss. The first reel of the film - an eerie family drama with an undercurrent of creeping techno-horror - bears most resemblance to the original text. In spite of key questions going unanswered - literally, what will a robot child become? - it's also the most successful section of the film, with effective performances from Frances O'Connor (as Monica Swinton) and Sam Robards (as Henry Swinton) and a chilling one from Haley Joel Osment as their adopted robot son, David. When Monica and Henry's real son wakes from his coma, Monica cannot face the idea of David being destroyed, and so she dumps him in the woods with his companion Teddy (probably the cutest CG creation ever).And so A.I. broadens its horizons and loses its focus. David and Teddy find themselves at a 'Flesh Fair', where human hicks go to trash their robot counterparts. Here they meet love machine Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) - he's fun, although it's somewhat tan of Spielberg to present him so sexlessly. The fair itself is the one of those slightly cringeworthy depictions of futuristic hedonism where people listen to obnoxious electroclash music and dress in luminous armour. The ensuing adventure takes the robo trio to the sumptuous Rouge City and beyond, to the soggy New York City of the future.From the above it may sound like I loathe the film, but that's not the case. It's themes are expansive and are presented via a fiercely intelligent script. Spielberg not only nails concepts arguably too large to be nailed down - love, loneliness, and mortality - but he also wraps them up in a satisfying five-part narrative structure. The fifth part is as bold as can be - Kubrick would have approved of the 2,000 year leap into the next age, just as he would have appreciated Ben Kingsley's determinably old fashioned opening and closing narration. (There are further cameos from Robin Williams, Meryl Streep, and Chris Rock - keep an ear out.) Like Professor Hobby's (William Hurt) lifelong ambition to manufacture a child capable of love, perhaps the film's ambitions are out of its reach. It will always be the runt in Spielbergs litter. For while films such as War of the Worlds and Hook were of depressingly low quality, both achieved a level of global popularity on which Spielberg has always thrived but which would apply to A.I. How could it? It's too baffling, beautiful, and ambiguous. It's art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film intriguing though flawed. It's a genuine attempt by Spielberg at making a mature Sci-fi film and contains many obvious references to Kubrick's work. The acting is good with Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law both doing well. There are some chilling sequences in the film, so beware it's not appropriate for children. What ultimately works against it is the sluggish pace and Spielberg's inability to take even bigger risks. Many interesting threads (role of family, social behavior, emotional longing) are started but don't lead anywhere. Unlike others, however, I quite liked the ending. Still worth a watch.Overall 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully well done masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how to start talking about this movie. In fact, it is so beautifully directed and created that it becomes a lot difficult for me to follow an oriented and logical way to describe how deeply it touched me.A.I. starts greatly by focusing the very best of human beings. It also touches mankind's biggest enigma with a supreme sense of knowledge, as if Steven Spielberg was the Life and Death God itself. The story opens softly in a time where computers were part of the past and machines are technologically advanced "beings". A time of changes, evolutions, discoveries and, best of all, reproductions. An era in which every men and women no longer know loneliness, lack of sex, partnership or even the word NO. It was a time of Artificial Intelligence.But when a mother almost looses her child due to a disease, her husband gets her a temporary substitute for the the hole that consumes her during the time her own child is in the hospital. The hole of desperation, rage and, worst of all, impossibility! And even living in a very high-tech era, her pain could not be silenced by the perfect human-like robots for sale. After all, mankind's biggest enemy was yet effective and resistant. Mankind's worst fear was yet invincible, no matter what. Death was one thing that technology could not defeat.But this mother was just about to face one more tragic reality the day she made a choice to end her suffering. Not very convinced that it would help her, she accepted to buy a robot-kid to start living with her and her husband. A technologically advanced being that would be a perfect replica of her son in every department, except one - the feelings. She would never be able to give or get love from it. After all, love was a human's peculiar characteristic.Steven Spielberg takes us to a sci-fi fantasy world, where machines are almost as important as humans. A world full of dramas (cold and raw) but beautiful and touching. In fact I will not advance a lot more about this movie, as I'm sure I'd spoil it. However, let me say it is a "lesson" to all of us (or at least to all those of us who have a heart). A.I. is masterpiece. A movie that surely can touch everyone's feelings. In fact, it reminds me a lot of a LucasArts' game (written by Spielberg based on a story by Sean Clark) - The Dig, where it explores the boundaries of the Human life, memories and alien existences. Whoever played that game in 1995 knows what I'm talking about.As a last comment, I'd say A.I. is not a movie for all ages. Kids won't probably understand it completely or fully as its story is vast and philosophically complex. It is a movie that should be seen more than once periodically due to its amazingly beauty and density. One of my favorite flicks from Steven Spielberg, along with the game THE DIG. Undoubtly!</fullReview>

David with his toy called Tedi spend 2000 years to find The blue fairy to make himself a real boy so that live with his mother.

		<shortDescription>A new film odyssey from the creator of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A.I." is a movie about humans, not robots. If you can accept that, you may see that this is one of the more fascinating films ever made. Unlike any film since its most similar relative, "2001," it's a visionary odyssey filled with just as much philosophy as special effects.But effects aren't meant to be the show, and I fault Dreamworks for releasing it as a Spielberg summer film, because the public was waiting for the next "E.T." when this was more a continuation of HAL the Supercomputer rather than that beloved Carlo Rambaldi puppet who carried around a potted plant with a healing finger."A.I." begins in a board room where Professor Hobby (William Hurt) challenges scientists with the notion of creating a robot that can mimic the most human of traits-- love. In this futuristic world, robots perform many tasks-- cook, clean, even provide sex-- all for their owners' pleasure. But Hobby says this is primitive, and a real proposition would be to create a robot that is essentially human. It's a new spin on the Gepetto story. To create a human, one must know what constitutes a human. And Hobby's answer is love, like a child's love of his parent.Thus comes the plot. David (Haley Joel Osment) is a prototype brought home by engineer Henry (Sam Robards) for his grieving wife Monica (Frances O'Connor) who has lost her son to disease. After a rocky start, this robot provides its owners pleasure and utility (like all machines do). But when the couple's real son is cured and revived, the robot is no longer necessary. Actually, it's a burden to keep. So they dump it in the woods.Let's examine this for a second. This is humanity at its grittiest. Humans are self-serving and sinful by nature, if we recall from the Genesis story of The Fall. We treat one another like objects, disposing of whatever displeases us or no longer gives us utility. Yes, we're that bad.Well, the movie doesn't stop there. It spends the next hour with David and Gigolo Joe (Jude Law in one of his strongest supporting performances) as they forge through the real world, with Joe teaching David harsh realities of existence and the dichotomy between robots and humans. Humans are emotional, and therefore dangerous. Robots do not have bias; they're programmed to do one thing, and they do it.That is, except David. And he exhibits the one trait other robots do not have-- Emotion. The yearning for things that do not exist. The desire to risk everything to chase after potential happiness elsewhere. While robots are resigned to their fate, David exhibits hope. In a remarkable journey through a Vegas-like city into a stark vision of a post-global-warming water-world that once was Manhattan, David finally finds Professor Hobby's office. He enters the workshop of his Creator, like man entering heaven, and what does he see? Not God. But thousands of other Davids, prepackaged in cellophane, ready for shipment. It's a haunting scene, a shocking realization that while we may desire God's love, we are not loved any more or less than every other one of His billions of creations. Was I the only one who found it utterly profound when David finally encounters the Blue Fairy (the entity he believes will make him a real boy)? The moment he touches her, she shatters into pieces! If you didn't, you may have never chased down a dream only to be shocked by the realization that the dream is just an illusion. (Consider that Teddy says "we are in a cage" when they're trapped under the ferris wheel while in pursuit of her.) I could go on... but I will stop with just one final point. Remember at the beginning of the film, you have Hobby and other scientists discussing how essentially to create humans... or at least replicas so close to human they are virtually indistinguishable. Man wants to be God. And he succeeds. Nearly.2000 years later (and that year isn't a coincidence), you have David resurrected from the ice. Robots (yes, they're robots, not aliens) place him in a replica of his house, reminiscent of Dave Bowman in the cosmic zoo at the end of "2001." And what do we witness these robots do? That's right. They create humans. By taking the DNA found in a lock of hair, they regenerate David's mother Monica and grant him his wish.A lot of people thought this ending was corny. But think about it. These futuristic robots, who began as fledgling replicants when David was first manufactured, have now evolved into advanced thinking entities that desire to be like their Creator. Robots play "Human" if you will, the same way Professor Hobby and other men wanted to play God. This is original sin, The Fall as depicted in Genesis, all over again-- the defining characteristic of what separated Man from animals! Robots have become human, in every way.Like Kubrick's "2001," this film is open for debate and is even maddening at times, but remains one of the most profound commentaries on human existence attempted to be put to film in the last thirty years. Spielberg and Kubrick are geniuses, and I can't think of a better film to serve as a celebration of their collaborative efforts.I've defended this film for years now, and I've come to accept that I can't make a believer out of someone who doesn't want to. Few people who like the "Jurassic Park" Spielberg are going to be looking for this type of material. But if you're a Kubrick fan, consider that he was sort of a misanthrope. Spielberg is about the exact opposite. That's how this film was constructed-- an attempt to define real human love within a pessimistic view of existence. A brilliant, challenging, and haunting film that I hope in time will achieve the greatness it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick and Spielberg's 'A.I.' is a machine with heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Uses special effects in service of its wonderful story. An intriguing and sometimes poetic excursion. After Stanley Kubrick's death, it was inevitable that A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, his long-planned project with Steven Spielberg, will not be made the same way it might have been. But that's alright, as Spielberg follows Kubrick's footsteps very closely, as if the man as still there behind the stage. At times, Spielberg actually gives us the feeling of being in one of Kubrick's own films. Sure, the film still makes room for some lukewarm Spielberg sap, but other than that, this is Spielberg's deepest, darkest film to date, one that ventures deeper in the world he only explored (and succeeded) on E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL.Although the relationship between A.I and E.T. are comparable, the two films are actually very much unlike each other. Once again, Spielberg ventures into our most cherished imaginings and turns them into mind-tricking reality. The special effects here are wonderful of course (what isn't if you work with the guys at ILM), but more wonderful is how imaginative and innovative they are. This is the Spielberg charm, a special effects machine with heart. A movie that makes us wonder, delight, question, captivate and focus on while not denying us the pleasures of the latest in special effects technology. Instead of a the typical flash-and-bang products, Spielberg honors Kubrick by giving us sights for which we can ponder and absorb all its wonders; pretty much what Kubrick's Monoliths did for 2001. The special effect here are stunning (remember seeing REAL dinosaurs in JURASSIC PARK for the first time?), but Spielberg doesn't waste the wonder by providing a cohesive story and an imaginative direction to go along with his visual eye candy. But this isn't just some story about a boy robot, or his adventures in trying to please his foster human parents. The story is based on a work by Brian Aldiss called "Summer Toys Last all Summer Long", a project toyed with by Stanley Kubrick for many years. Through these many years, Spielberg gives a welcome helping hand during development. Up until Kubrick's untimely death, the film was developed nearly enough, but it still wasn't a film. Spielberg doesn't deny us the work they've done so far. He provides us a story that captivates even as a far-from-perfection film. A.I. is not without its flaws of course. The pacing takes nearly forever to get going, and some of the pure Spielberg sappiness is undeniably present. But in the end, it is Spielberg himself who makes A.I. a terrific motion picture of the sci-fi mold. The film takes place somewhere in a not-so-distant (by today's standards) future, where Global Warming has flooded many of the world's major cities. In place of a lessening population, scientists resolves to Mechas, near-human machines that'll make cyborgs look like the Tin Man. Haley Joel Osment, after his sweeping performance in THE SIXTH SENSE already made him a star, plays a new model Mecha designed by the successful CEO/visionary (William Hurt) who is programmed to do what machines can't do: Fall in love with a parent, and in turn be loved back.Frances O'Conner and Sam Robards play the foster parents of David, substituting him temporarily for their son (Jake Thomas), under a coma, who pretty soon snaps out of his coma and has a little brotherly competition with his would-be Mecha brother. When life gets too tough, he is soon asked to be destroyed. Feeling sympathy for the little boy (robot), his (foster) mother instead sets him out to the open world, alongside him only his walking, talking teddy bear and high hopes that he meets with the Blue Fairy, the fairy from his Pinocchio stories which he believes will grant him the wish of becoming a real boy so that his mother will love him more. Jude law co-stars as a playboy gigolo Mecha named Gigolo Joe who aids David's side (mainly because he has digs on this "Blue Fairy"). By the time the film reaches its second act, the audience would have been divided between those who would stick to it or walk out. Although A.I. is wonderful piece of work; an artful ode to the ponderous storytelling talents of Stanley Kubrick done best since Kubrick himself DID partly make this film, it ain't a film for everyone. It's wondrous, intriguing, admittedly flawed, but vast and gripping. Anyone expecting a film that takes its premise easily may find the film a bit to dark and sober. But this is just what Kubrick wants it to be, and being like a student of a master that he still is, Spielberg couldn't agree more. A.I. may have been a film that could be passed on from one great director to another, but there could be no other way to tell it. What a wonderful and underrated film! Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Story of us and The Most Realistic Non-Exaggerated Practical Scientific Movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot: This movie is a story of us, humans in not-so-distant future where global warming and greenhouse effect have taken its toll and sea level all over the mother earth has risen beyond danger levels due to melting of polar ice and continental areas have submerged in the water partially and hence their surface areas have reduced, barely supporting some Homo Sapiens (human beings) for their livelihood. But those humans have done considerable progress in all fields, especially Robotics.Storyline: This is a movie about a robot child adopted by a couple whose only son is suffering from some grave illness and is placed in a cryogenic chamber in a comatose situation. There are almost no hopes of him being recovered and hence the couple decides to adopt a artificially intelligent (possessing a self learning processor) robot child called 'David'. Initially he is just a robot coming to grasps with his new surroundings, his new family. But then as time passes on he starts adapting himself to the humans. Then one day the comatose son of the family recovers suddenly and then he has to share the love of his parents with David, the robot. But then the human child, under pangs of jealousy, mistreats David till his mother decides to have David disassembled and hence takes along with her to the manufacturers. But the 'mother' factor in her does not have the heart to do that and so she leaves him mid-way in a jungle. Here David meets a Robot who works as a Gigolo and has run away from the world. And then this movie is the saga of their adventure together as they travel.Acting: Perhaps the most mesmerizing in the world considering it comes from a child - Osment(Sixth sense, The(1999)) as the Robot. No, wrong ... Let me rephrase it. OSMENT 'IS' THE SELF-LEARNING, ADAPTING, TRANSFORMING ROBOT.Undoubtledly best by any child in movie-history considering the demands/complexities of the role. Jude Law's performance is ON PAR with Osment's but he is shown to us as the already adapted robot so no more major transformations in personality here.Connor's performance of the heart-broken mother made me speechless.What NOT to expect: If you are a fan expecting that a sci-fi movie ONLY means black leather, Ray-Bans, bullets, guns, explosions, ruthless man-killing robots and mind-boggling action scenes, this is not the movie for you. Sorry, but ordinary life situations in a realistic sci-fi movie do not demand fireworks. (I do love the Terminator / The Matrix series but they are a LOT futuristic and contain Time warping events.) 'AI' is a LOT PRACTICAL and talks of only practical near-future life of any ordinary human being / Robot.What to Expect: Mind-boggling performances and even more Stunning Visual Effects Extravaganza. A flawless direction and script considering the demands of the movie. Remember, its easy to make a series of totally-out-of-the-world 'Star-Wars' movies but very difficult to create one single practical movie like this. Get Real.This is the Ultimate Masterpiece in cinema history. Simply because it not only required realism/practicality as a base to the Plot but also Brains and Science. Also the Emotional and Philosophical Factors in this movie will undoubtedly touch any existing living human being who understands English. But the technicalities depicted in this intelligent film (...And I am not talking about the visual/sound effects of the movie) can be only be grasped (not totally but still...) by those in the engineering fields especially Software(like me), Robotics and Electronics, basically anyone from the field of Artificial Intelligence. This movie is made for people like us. People like us don't care if this movie becomes the Greatest blockbuster of all time or not. Simply because this movie satisfies us.Ironically, this is movie has not been made keeping the ordinary non-technical movie loving public in mind even though it IS concerned with the near-future of all human beings.Perhaps this is the ONLY perfect example of any masterpiece voted down by some people NOT because they did not like it BUT because they did not like it since they did NOT understand it in the first place. It is the various Technical Theories in this masterpiece that some people could not properly interpret and digest. This movie takes itself seriously and correctly so. Also only two types of movies never win any Oscars: 1. The 'Razzie trash' types that don't go well with the critics because they are way below the IQ of the critics and hit below the belt. 2. The 'Artificial Intelligence' types that don't go well with the critics because they are way ABOVE the IQ of the critics. This movie belongs to the second category i. e. a category of itself.This is Kubrick's Best but this is better than Spielberg's supposedly 'Best': 'Schindler's List(1993)'. Because 'List' deals with the traumas of war-stricken humans and is a easier-to-sympathize-with history chapter BUT this movie is much more complex / challenging and requires intelligence to create a REAL near-future life of humans that is yet to happen and yet teaches us 'Love'.Terminator / Matrix Series get a 9/ 10. 'Artificial Intelligence' gets a complete 10 / 10.Buy/ study this movie and Enlighten yourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overlooked Gem of Love, Expansion, and Foretelling That Stands By Itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. is often overlooked, and it is really one of Spielberg's most intense, emotional, and poignant films. It's set in a future where global warming has led to ecological disaster of rising sea levels and a drastic reduction of the human population. Yet humankind never learns the vanity and contrivance in its advances, as it attempts a short cut to maintaining civilization with the creation of android artificial intelligence. These efforts culminate with the creation of David, an android child programmed with the ability to love, played by Haley Joel Osment.This is merely the circumstantial context serving as the innate and thus the only possible landscape for A.I's extrasensory odyssey through the mechanisms of feelings, scientific projections, and the shame and ignorance inherent in many human beings. Imagine your mother, and how much you love her. Imagine being a small child again. Spielberg has portrayed childlike wonder and innocence before, but never to such a crushingly tender degree, as Osment becomes so alive to us that we not only invest an enormous amount of sympathy in him but we also begin to straddle incredibly fascinating concepts involving the existence of a robot, like the idea of being alive for thousands of years and never going to sleep, or contradiction of the ability to process information and the restriction to follow a program.The movie's eccentricity is built by the strange character played by Jude Law, a male prostitute robot who is on the run after being framed for murder, and those of William Hurt, the professor responsible for commissioning the creation of Osment's robotic boy, and Brendan Gleeson's cameo as the ringleader at the Flesh Fair, where useless robots are destroyed before cheering crowds not unlike those at rodeos or wrestling matches, and the setting of a Las Vegas-like metropolis where rogue robots go about an urban life of vices. This all spreads a thick spectrum of unfathomable lack of category, and only the least genre- restricted film is placed under bottomless measures, and when its story progresses, its design, ambiance, music, drama and humor unravel before us, if we feel ourselves enthralled in it all, then all status drops from it, a true and impervious contribution to the farthest reaching extent of cinema.Though its strange unpredictability presses it away from other films like Bicentennial Man, I Robot, Blade Runner, and other Spielberg sci-fi films like Close Encounters, E.T. or Minority Report, with which many have pigeonholed it, it is not the explosively effective vital to the film's boundless spirituality unto true understanding, expansive exaltation. It is Spielberg's ecstatic, sympathetic and matronly heart, which drenches this film, that makes you gush with tears, ache in your threat, cause your nose to run, both igniting the waterfall of one's love for the maternal and unite one with an enlightened, joyous envisioning of the future, wherein Spielberg is accepting of what the majority of the human race dreads, having confronted those fears beyond imagining and conceived a selfless greatness in the races to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On my top ten list, "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" is one of the most well written, acted, and technically brilliant films of this decade. Being one of the most anticipated films of 2001, I was surprised by the negative responses of critics and by how poorly it did at the box office. Categorized as a Sci-Fi fairy tale, "A.I." is far from the cutesy "little boy robot" movie that one would expect from director Steven Spielberg. Instead, we are shown a thought provoking and dark view of the future and a robot child's quest for the love of his mother.Global warming has melted the polar ice caps. Major cities, including New York, are underwater. In a world of starvation and population control, humans have become dependent on "mechas"; robots simulating human appearance and behavior. Cybertonics Inc. creates a robot child named David (Haley Joel Osment), and advanced prototype capable of love once a permanent imprinting program is activated. David is given to employee (Sam Robarbs) and his wife Monica (Frances O'Connor) to try out. Their son Martin, in a cryogenic state, comes home with a little resentment and jealousy towards his "mecha" replacement after an unexpected cure is found for his illness. David's human family isn't prepared for these consequences and there is a heart-wrenching scene where David is abandoned in the woods by his mother. Suddenly, David and his animatronic toy bear Teddy, are thrown into a strange and dangerous world. With undertones of the Disney classic, Monica had read "Pinnochio" to David so he believes that if he finds the blue fairy, he will be turned into a real boy and his mother will love him again.Based on the short story "SuperToys Last all Summer Long", the late Stanley Kubrick held back from filming in the 80's due to special effect costs. Supposedly, Kubrick wanted to use a real robot instead of an actor to play David. Directing from notes left by Kubrick, the collaboration between the two have resulted in one of Spielberg's finest pieces of work. The film as a whole is no less than magnificent and truly never got the attention or praise that it deserved.Also starring Jude Law who picked up an Oscar nomination for his role as "mecha" male prostitute Gigolo Joe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where can I find the Blue Fairy?" ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The search for the "Blue Fairy" is the quest for a little robot boy in AI. The Blue Fairy is the fairy that turned Pinocchio into a real boy. In this case, David (the robot boy) wants to become a real boy so his mother (a human) will love him. For a sci-fi movie, it's a pretty unusual story.I really liked the movie because at no time could I predict what was going to happen next. This, combined with sweeping visuals, great special effects, and great acting performances made the movie a big win for me.Although much has been made about the ending of the movie, I think it is one of the most unexpected, unique and memorable endings I have seen. If you're a sci-fi fan, no matter what you've heard about this movie, it's a "must-see". Seldom do you ever get see a big-budget, well-acted innovative story. For everyone else, it's definitely worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Most Intrinsicate Movie Goes Highly Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some short lines.Spielberg managed to create an environment over the shape and structure of characters over his career, but with AI he twists things up. "A.I" challenges the view of spectator, to watch a tale with pure magic. A tale in which there are plenty of symbolisms, pauses to think about the character, a beautiful, creative art direction with genius details.The world Spielberg painted is sad, bright on neon lights and spectacles yet obscure on people's souls. Robots are those that will show how human beings are not understandable, are just a mess, we cannot go past through our hopes and fears, and that's what makes us unique.Human and Robots will learn to like this film as time goes passing by, very slowly.</fullReview>

And then in the next few minutes - he wanted to get rid of David. I just didn't like his character in this whole movie. He seemed mean and standoffish. Monica I liked.And something else that should go in the Trivia section. I don't know if anyone else noticed. But when David was in the water at the end of the movie in "Manhattan" did anyone else noticed there was something sticking out of the ground underwater from the movie "The Abyss". I think I saw the tip of the alien ship from the movie - you got to remember - that was a Steven Spielberg movie also. Check it out and let me know will you.

No "intelligent design" here. Just no intelligence - artificial or otherwise - to speak of. Hollywood should just be cut off from science fiction themes. They have no respect for them, they use them as a tool to pull in a younger audience and nothing more. As the special effects improve, the screen writing and direction go further and further downhill. Why not let the FX grunts just write and direct these films... they couldn't be any worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a very emotional one for me to watch, and that is as it should be. It is a compelling story on so many levels, and pays homage to so many other good SF/fantasy films from the hands of the masters, Kubrick and Spielburg. But what makes this film work is the superior quality of the acting and in particular the acting of Haley Joe Osment. This young man compels you to watch him, and manages to be the focus in a film with a great deal of complexity(as he also does in "The Sixth Sense" where he steals the picture from Bruce Willis.) The Jude Law story line was a bit much for a story set for families, but he did an excellent job of integrating into the film. And of course there is the always outstanding musical score of John Williams. Altogether this is a film that will be appreciated in years to come when people look back at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very beautiful, well made but painful. Maybe this is why some people hate it. It hurts. And IMHO some people hate it because it says a painful truth about human nature, a truth non easily accepted by some... I've seen this in cinema in 2001 and two months ago I have received the DVD as a gift. I now have a kid and the effect of reviewing the film was powerful. Being painful may provoke frustration, but that doesn't mean the film is not awesome. The "sentient robot" idea was explored in a series of other movies, but this offers a unique perspective. Maybe the most humanistic of them all. A film worth seeing, without any doubt, see it and think about how YOU may hurt the people that really love you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on DVD a year ago and have watched it a couple of times since and with every subsequent viewing I realise how much I love this film - it's epic. It's so under-rated, but I'm sure, like a good wine, it will gain in stature over the years. I can't believe I missed the opportunity to view it in a cinema and hope it's featured somewhere soon. The acting, camera-work, special effects and direction are all amazing - I would rate this as Spielberg's finest.Of course it's got some flaws but in the balance, these are pretty irrelevant given the scale and subject matter of the film. After every time I watch it, I come away with something new to ponder over - this is the strength of the film and something which I credit Spielberg with. He skilfully manages to tell the tale of two disparate characters and their friendship in a most tender way, but there are strong undertones of darkness in the film. The whole feeling is dream-like from beginning to end; the first time I saw this I really felt transported somewhere else and once it had finished it took me a while to come back to reality. That's the mark of a truly great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David (Haley Joel Osment) is a machine given to a mourning family who believes they have lost their only child. David is a special robot however, given the ability to imprint with pure unconditional love on any who choose to say the correct sequence of words. In her grief Davids "mother" (Frances O'Connor) says those words causing David to love her no matter what and seek only her love in return. Soon David is not alone as the families child as the son the family believed was lost recovers form a horrible illness. They soon find it hard to have both children as Davids pure innocence make him a target for cruelty. The decision is made to send David back to be destroyed. In a quick moment of compassion however Davids mother lets him go to find his own place in the world.David finds himself in a strange and deadly world for machines. Driven by the story of the blue fairy who made Pinochio into a real boy David begins an incredible and touching journey that spans thousands of years.So we have the incredible movie made by Steven Spielberg starring Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law.Honestly this story was so moving to me. At times I found my self so hurt by the innocent desire of David. His one wish to merely be loved by his mother and his belief that being a real boy would solve this was very moving to me. I was reminded of the thousands of children who are orphaned and desire the same thing. Only to be loved by a family, yet never getting that one thing some of us take for granted.The actors were so in tune with this story and the ideas behind it. THis made the film even more moving and made the FX (which are great) merely tools to tell us of this boys sad journey.I will not spoil the ending for those who have not seen it but will give a warning. This is a scifi film from the patterns of Clarke and Asimov books. It is a film that you will either love or hate but deserves a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that the basis of AI was so close to something that could be true. It may have scared a good portion of the audience away. Cloning is a scientific breakthrough and has been done with animals and as far as clonaid.com says they have accomplished human cloning. The fact that the human DNA code was actually coded, http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/hg5yp/index.shtml shows that with progress (as science and technology will always have) it is feasible that one day producing a lifeform without the mating process will happen. The production is over the top and the more I think about it the production is so good that I sometimes didn't realize what all it had to take to be able to produce some of those shots. Great storyline. I feel like the length of AI may have been something moviegoers were timid about too. In this day and age of fast, quick, summarized information a movie this long wasn't what was catching in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, that said, it's not Bladerunner (what is?).But this movie IS powerful in that you actually LIKE the lead character... and though we could toss the Mad Max events in the middle, I can see where Spielberg was going with it, so you gotta' give the guy a break.As a way to help my kids dive into the philosophies of life, the existence of a soul, and the possibilities of something beyond this world, this is a great starter (I'm still waiting for CS Lewis' "The Great Divorce" to be crafted into a film...).Addressing the issue of the existence soul, and of actually taking your life to pursue such a discovery is a great lesson (my Dad was a Trappest Monk for a few years many moons ago, so I guess I was born into a place of asking those sorts of questions...;-) I give it a 7, and if we could eliminate or radically modify the Mad Maxian scene, it's move up another point, no problem.UPDATE: So my daughter Kaleigh and I watched AI again to see if there were any new discoveries: And the Flesh Fair scene makes a lot more sense now. It's all about the Luddites fearing human decline with the Rise of the Machines (wasn't that an Arnold flick?). It actually helped, as it cleared the road for the differences between being purely a machine, and a "human" machine. Even seasoned robot-haters/killer could sense the difference, and recognized David as one of a kind, special.I was about to get deeply philosophical in regards to all of us wanting and needing to feel that way, but suffice to say, it was better than anticipated. Yes, some gaps (even my daughter commented on them), but overall it was a genuinely great movie. I'm adding a star to the mix in recognition of the new/fresh insights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Artificial Intelligence is like a multiple-walled room with doors on every wall, each door leading to a different destination. I use this simile simply because there are so many ways this film can be read, and indeed so many ways in which this film leads you. It takes you through each and every one of those doors and you have to decide in which destination you stay.Being the final working project of Kubrick, it obviously had high promise. The fact that Spielberg had to finish it off, obviously leads to disappointment. Not because Spielberg does a bad job- far from it- but because one can only speculate how much better Kubrick could have done.There are elements of both directors in the film: the first thirty minutes are very Spielberg, while from about thirty to ninety minutes the Kubrick influence is extremely strong, and this is definitely my favorite part of the film. It's dark and cynical and provides us with a world we are not accustomed to, and don't particularly want to be. While the first section dealt with the dream of a robot boy who could be taught to love, which is quite a corny and clichd concept, the second section deals with the harsh realities of the inferiority of robots and mankind's inability to accept and adjust to them, and their violent retaliations. The principle character, David, played astonishingly well by Haley Joel Osment, plays a key role in this section. Being young and innocent and carrying an animatronic teddy bear (arguably the greatest character in the film) wherever he goes, he embodies the naivety of your average child growing up in a terrifying world which he does not understand. But in this film, that real-life situation is explored to its extremes.David is helped along his way by another very likable character, Gigolo Joe, one of Jude Law's most interesting performances. The interaction between the two is absolutely fascinating, almost absurdest at times and always with that quirky, Kubrickean feel to it.The quest that forms the central part of the film is essentially nothing more than an appropriation of the Pinocchio story, retold in a science-fiction context: David must become a real boy in order to gain the love of his mother. When he reaches Manhattan where his final destination is supposed to be but in actual fact finds him nowhere else but back at the manufacturer's where he was made, we think the film is over. But in actual fact there is about another hour to run.It is this last hour that is the most criticized, and it is quite clear why. There appears to be too much resolution to the film; there are three different points at which the film could end, and at only one of these it does. All three are very sad and tragic ends, but the third and actual ending is somehow the least fulfilling, it gives you a far more hollow feeling. At first I thought it was just because it is such a bleak portrayal but in actual fact it is simply because personally I felt one of the other two endings would be better, but maybe that's too conventional an outlook.The final resolution is something that has never been done before, in a way that has never been done. It's really unexpected and unpredictable, it deals with a bizarre concept in a very serious manner and essentially finishes for you a movie that one person could never make alone. It's one of the most original and thoughtful endings of all time and really gets you thinking. It is so evident that so many minds and so many hours went into the crafting of this modern masterpiece that you have to appreciate it. The film borders on being silly so often but never quite falls into that trap (I'm still not sure why) and for that I am forever grateful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg, Kubrick, and A Future Film Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today 2001: Space Odessey is considered on of the best films of all time. However it was not on it's release in 1968. In the present, Blade Runner is considered to be a science-fiction success. In 1982 when it was released, it was considered a failure. What do these films have in common with the 2001 movie AI: Artificial Intelligence? These movies were misunderstood because they were too far ahead of their time. Stanley Kubrick was the director of 2001, as most know. When he started story boarding and organizing ideas for the film AI, he was in a familiar situation. He was going to attempt to make a revolutionary film with ideas and opinions people were not ready to accept. The director of the film was not Kubrick however, because he passed away. The project was given to another legendary film maker Steven Spielberg. Spielberg would eventually create a film that will in the future be considered on of his best.While watching AI, it is hard not to wonder at times what is going on. The movie makes the viewer think as the story is so complex and futuristic bringing up future controversial questions about if humans should play the role of God. There is very little time for the viewer to tap into his or her emotions, while watching the film and trying to understand. This film should be accepted as a warning cry to humanity and not a movie that desperately tries to grasp the viewer's emotions.Also, the visual effects in the movie are unbelievable. ILM really was revolutionary with the film's visuals. They are unlike anything that had been previously seen. There was a mixture of serious texture with that of an almost cartoon taste. It works though to create a movie that is visually an artistic achievement. The sets are very creative and unique too, and blend modern day objects with those of the future.In this movie this is wonderful acting. Human characters act human, and the stale acting of the Meca is perfect since they are artificial. The music by John Williams is also always a nice touch.While everything in the movie seemed perfect, the ending was a little long, and the blue fairy at the end was a little too unreal. Sometimes the story slowed down, but the characters were usually developed which is nice in a movie, especially when your characters are very different. The movie ended in Kubrick fashion giving the viewer at first a feeling of confusion, but once looked into, it makes sense what Spielberg was trying to achieve with this Kubrick idea.All in all, AI: Intelligence is an artistic achievement in cinema history from story to visual effects. After the second viewing of the movie the story really came together and made a lot of sense. It may be a movie misunderstood now, but in the future it should and will be remembered as a masterpiece that was finished by one of the greatest directors in history (Spielberg) in memory of the genius and the unforgettable man who started it (Kubrick).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was one I stumbled on accidentally when browsing the TV listings. I'm a big fan of Jake Thomas so I thought I would watch it.It turned out to be one of my favourite films I think that I have ever watched. I say favourite, but I'm not sure that quite describes what I mean. If you want a film to cheer you up, steer well clear of this one. It is the first film since Lion King that had me with a tear in my eye. The story line of humanoids and one that has human emotions is interesting, if a little far-fetched but Spielberg and his cast pull it off very well. Rather than being entertaining, it is very thought-provoking which I think a good film of any substance should be.It has fantastic acting from Haley Joel Osment - his character is convincing and you can engage with how he is feeling whereas the performance from Jude Law is slightly less impressive, being rather wishy-washy.Not only did it have a tear in my eye, but it made me want a David of my own.It is truly are heart-touching lovely film that combines several ideas and genres but keeps your attention for its entire duration.If it is on again, I am sure to watch it and I recommend that you do the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another stunning film from Spielberg.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A.I." is one DVD that has been sitting in my DVD collection for almost three years, and tonight, I finally decided to watch it. Now I am sorry I did not watch this film before. Simply stunning! David is a young Mecha, a clone of a human boy. Designed to give the love of a child to a lonely woman following a tragic loss that left her real son in a coma. After her real son revives and moves back home, they leave David in the woods to fend for himself. David goes in search of the Blue Fairy, after hearing the story of Pinnochio, so that she may turn him into a real boy.The special effects in this film are simply incredible. What we have come to expect from Industrial Light and Magic. The story is very touching. It kept my interest for the full 2 and a half hours that the movie ran for. Jude Law as Gigolo Joe was also great. It was a shame that he was not in the film longer. I am really beginning to like him as an actor.Simply put, this is one film that everyone should see. It took me 3 years to watch it, put I am glad that I finally did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy or Reality?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being quite a fan of fantasy fiction I was really looking forward to seeing Spielberg's take on the original story based upon the fear of advanced artificial intelligence in the robots of the future.The plot primarily concerns David (Haley Joel Osment). A landmark in robotics, he looks like any other boy and believes he is only because he has been programmed to think so. David is took in by the Swinton family when there son becomes ill in an attempt to keep Monica Swinton sane. Evidently things get complicated, very complicated.The story began for me with a possible futuristic theme with the obvious degree of scare mongery that comes with this genre and this theory holds until Jude Law's character (Gigolo Joe) is introduced. Queue fantastically created and animated cities which when seen couldn't help but be impressive.A short (and as always funny) cameo from Robin Williams later and the story goes completely off the rails. I won't mention any specifics but any sense of reality goes flying out of the window but the end is not without its emotion.Osment is a star as the robot boy David, I wonder what odds the bookmakers would give me on him winning an Oscar by the age of 21?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not too bad... For the first hour and a half or so. Although the story outline is not too original (it's Pinocchio all over again), it's visualized beautifully with superb special effects and good acting of Osment and Law. It raises some important philosophical issues like the ability of humans to love robots which can love humans and the striving of every individual to be special and unique (not necessarily the striving of an android to be a real boy). The way David is mocked by other children and even his 'dad', his despair when he finds out that he's far from unique and his perseverance to realize his dreams is filmed and acted convincingly enough to give the philosophy and ethics a proper place in this movie. All in all this film shouldn't have been this bad.And then we have this ending: after a few years of David's praying to a statue of the 'Blue Fairy', an ice age tortures the world for 2000 years (way too short for an ice age, by the way), aliens find the boy, tell him that he is unique, can resurrect his so-called mother with nothing more than a little hair and David has the happiest day in his life... It's not only very unlikely, it also has nothing to do with the story or the philosophical issues discussed. As a matter of fact: it degenerates all of those issues to a few dying ants (sorry, I can't think of something better at the moment).Shame on the writers, producers and director alike!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been great (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of this film is hugely ambitious: Kubrick wanted to make literally a new myth for our times (i.e. not trying to refer to past myths as Star Wars or The Matrix do). The subject of artificial intelligence is the stage of the real issue: human prejudice. I live in the U.S., so racial prejudice/issues are quite a significant part of my culture. Slavery used to be prevalent in this country. Eventually that was abolished, then we had racial segregation and legal racial hatred. Now we are left with our individual choices about prejudice. The core of this is our human perception on the question: what deserves our uncompromised respect? Roughly, we believe that, for example, a dog deserves more respect than a rock, a child deserves more than does a dog, etc. This country is proud of its ability to give equality to all, but of human nature what I see is that, whenever we encounter something that seems quite different from ourselves, we tend to be cautious and give it less respect than our quite-similar fellows. I suspect this is one reason why slavery and racial prejudice were allowed to become so prevalent in U.S. history. But over time people began to realize that, hey, they're humans too (just different amounts of melanin and vastly different cultures); human bonds can be and were formed.In the light of globalized communication/trade, It won't be long before, one way or another, however painful or peaceful the road may be, we will be united under one world culture. Essentially all humans will view each other as peers.Here is where artificial intelligence steps in. It is likely also that one day we will build machines that are controversial, because of they're uncanny ability to seem intelligent. It might even get out of hand, because soon they would seem so intelligent that they would seem to possess free will. A new prejudicial divide is born. Is it possible for humans to respect machines they engineered in the same manner they regard other humans? For if they do give that sort of respect, wouldn't it mean that humans are at the "same level" as the machines? It would suggest that humans are nothing *but* machines themselves! Juxtapose this with the way we treat our desktop computers and such: not much more than glorified rocks. We would be in conflict with ourselves, our worldviews. And we would have an extremely difficult time pinpointing where the rock-likeness ended and the life/intelligence began.So you see how this movie could have been a world-shaking work of art. Unfortunately (oh how unfortunately!) it failed to even take hold of my senses, let alone my emotions re: the various issues it explores. You can tell it's not made by Kubrick from the merely-par photography and set design (though there was one image that was memorable: the Statue of Liberty completely submerged except for the upraised torch). If Kubrick had been in charge the lighting would not have seemed so thoughtlessly applied. The music, while composed by John Williams, had no chance to be interesting, because it could only marry with mediocre visuals.I like to echo previous sentiments that people complain about the ending, but really the middle part was the most tedious. Wolf-bikers and rednecks? Give me a break! At this rate who cares about the mythical potential of this story? Just give me a quality-constructed film.Strangely, the advertisement for the film at the time of its release was more interesting art than the film itself. It was an interactive web game that proved to be surprisingly elaborate.</fullReview>

I agree the film's extended ending drags too long and dilutes the impact of the film. I guess Spielberg wanted David to find in some respect what he was looking for instead of giving us the difficult ending that people are far often searching endlessly often fruitlessly for what they desire most. Still for its many successes and sheer ambition, I strongly recommend this film, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cavils and questions ( *SPOILERS *)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film about a dozen times and will probably see it a dozen times more. I consider it a flawed masterpiece but I understand why many people detest it. It is surely the most sentimental film that has ever been made about a robot. (Though it is the product of a posthumous collaboration between Spielberg and Kubrick it often seems to embody the spirit of that unashamed sentimentalist Ray Bradbury.) There is so much to appreciate -- beginning with one of the most amazing performances by a young actor in the history of film -- that the plot and dialogue faults seem like screeches of chalk on blackboard. There are mysteries here too (mysterious at least to me) which I would dearly like to see resolved.Be warned: everything hereafter is a spoiler.Faults: we see David undergo an open-thorax operation with perfect equanimity: "It doesn't hurt", he assures his `mother'. But a couple of scenes later when a youngster pricks him slightly with a knife (assuring him he means no harm) David freaks out and clutches his `brother' in terror. Why? Apparently only to move the plot in the desired direction. Surely this could have been engineered in a more credible fashion.The bit of doggerel that leads David back to the doctor is not only execrable poetry, it doesn't make sense: "Come away, oh human child..." The whole point is that he is _not_ a human child, at least not yet.Why is Dr. Hobby's lab located in the sunken city rather than in the more convenient company headquarters in New Jersey? Why does Hobby leave David alone after having shattered his illusions? Again, apparently just to make the plot move in the desired direction. This seems to me to be clumsy, even lazy scripting.The police follow the stolen amphibicopter, pluck Gigolo Joe into the sky -- and just ignore the multi-million-dollar piece of hardware that then carries David on his short trip to Coney Island where he sits for 2000 years. Don't these vehicles have location devices? What ever happened to sonar? Both the government and the corporation would possess ample resources and motivation to search and recover the errant machines. The film provides no explanation as to why they didn't.Just before the final scene David and we are subjected to a long-winded and implausible explication of the quirks of the space-time continuum that will limit the duration of his reunion. This slows down the action at the worst possible time. The Blue Fairy could simply have told him that the event could only last a day, period. It wasn't necessary to give him or us a course in fantasy physics.In addition to these glaring faults (and perhaps others I have missed) there are some puzzles that I would very much like to see cleared up. If Mr. Spielberg happens to read this I would appreciate his doing so. If not, I would be interested in others' considered opinions on the following:when David is staggering in growing despair between the panels of Davids and Darlenes, one of the panels suddenly moves. Is another David coming to life behind it? If so why do we not see him? If not then what is happening?When David later awakes in the familiar surroundings of his home the scene is quite deliberately made unreal. The colors are garish, the scene is blurry. The whole effect is exactly that of an old piece of film that has lain for many years until the colors have begun to go bad. But as soon as he moves into the room with the Blue Fairy, the film comes into focus and the colors become more natural. What is Spielberg trying to tell us? Is the whole event happening in David's head? If so why are the `aliens' (or millennial robots) depicted observing the event from a balcony?The final scene of course recalls the ending of `2001' but is if anything more obscure than its famous predecessor. (At least part of it seems to be a mental rather than a real event: that big moon scurries offstage in most unrealistic fashion.) Does David really sleep? Really dream? Does he too die or is his sleep the beginning of something truly new? (Is his name a mere coincidence? He could have been Tommy or Dickie or even little Harry.) Could it be that he is forging in the smithy of his digital soul the uncreated conscience of a new robotic race? In short, what is going on here?If anyone here knows the answers, please set them out for those such as I who are too literal-minded to grasp it on our own. And could you email me a copy to ensure I don't miss it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg has always been one of the directors I admired. I liked his movies because they usually were something special, and almost always something good. I'm rather disappointed that I haven't had time to see his so called masterpiece "Schindler's List". But I guess all will have their time.SPOILERS Artificial Intelligence. Sounds quite intriguing. Robots...those are "the guys" we think of when we hear these words. Spielberg asks in this movie a fundamental question: you can make a robot love person, but can you make a person love a robot? The idea is that a company desires to create loving robots. Children robots. In times when it is a privilege to have children of your own, this product can be a solution. An employee gets this robot child, named David, and he and his wife have to "test" it and decide afterwards if they want to keep it. Despite being so similar to a child, the robot does continue to show traits of its mechanic part. Spielberg actually suggest to us that we can CREATE love. Can we really? We can hardly love each other, but can we make a machine love, sometime in the near future? Even in the next century? I think not. Still, the idea is interesting to follow. At one moment, the actual child of the couple is revived from an illness which was thought to be without healing. Once the actual child returns back home, we have a new problem. The parents accept to continue keeping David, but of course he goes on the second plan now. As he offers love, he desires love. All he wants is to be loved. Specifically by his mother. If we look at the matter from this point of view we see that actually only the mother did care for him. One made the other feel better. That was good.Unfortunately several unhappy events take place and David ends up to be left alone in a crude world. In a world where he does though have an advantage, because he is unique. He knows that. His human part desires to seek out his dreams and so David tries to find the Blue Fairy, from the wonderful story of Pinocchio. His fight is hard to endure, but in a way the movie does end well.Once he sees that he is not unique, he feels rage. I mean FEELS rage. Feelings. Like love, as I said above. Will that ever be possible? A question to which only science knows the answers. An interesting thing is the kind of "junk yard" for robots. A place where robots are destroyed, to the pleasure of the people who come to view those things. Once David is brought on the scene, people are initially slightly confused. Then, they believe that David is really a child and being protesting against his murder. So we have two different traits of the human race in one scene. First the terrible desire for brutal entertainment. Second...the people gathered at that place are human and despite giving us the idea that they really are brutal, by their decision to let the child go free, we get the confirmation that they are people. I just didn't feel that those robots were robots...they were too real for it. I would not have been able to sit and throw objects at things which look similar to God's dearest creation. So I saw it all, initially, as being totally inhuman.The movie is certainly interesting and does ask us some good questions. The special effects are admirable and the actors are just great. Especially Osment, who made me feel what he was, and who acted flawlessly and very believable. Jude Law was as good as he usually, but nothing above or to remember. He got quite well in his character, so I've got nothing to complain about.The one thing that bothered me though was the way the film was actually extended by Spielberg. The end should've been before the aliens. Of course, he brings us a new idea about aliens and when I say this I think of how friendly they were...how human. It is a less suggestive end than it would've been if the movie had ended when it should have. In this way the viewer should be pleased by the fact that David succeeds in a way to finally achieve his dream. I consider this was all unneeded film time. Certainly not needed.Looking at the whole movie, I consider it is one which should draw your attention. It's worth spending some hours in front of the TV for it.Draw your own conclusions afterwards. I would rate it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very original and unorthodox movie. It starts off as a great semi-science fiction movie, then goes into a very exciting suspense thriller, then into a futuristic adventure movie, then a fairy tale, and finally resolves into a movie that fits no category. The first time I saw this movie, I admit, I didn't care for it at all. I expected a great physical piece of work, with a solid script and logical surprizes along the way. If you watch the begining to this movie and then automatically forward to the last 20 mins of it, you honestly will not understand a thing and think this movie must be horrible. Thats because the whole movie is about an emotional journey taken by Osment. The ending is not surprizing but very unpredictable and very weird. It's amazing how Speilberg took the movie from the begining to the end. This is a movie that has to watched without any interruptions at all! And you can't really get the feel for it until you watch it at least twice. Don't expect a certain type of movie from this. Don't expect a great science fiction movie or a great thriller, just take the movie for what it is, an travel through human emotions experienced by a robot. It is truly unique and original and has to be one of the most innovative movie that has ever been made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is as bad as films with too big budgets and too stupid plots go. The story is fairly original about a robotic boy who has "real" feelings of love and wants to be loved by his adopted mother.However, after a fairly good start it gets from acceptable to tedious over to absolutely pathetic. You can for fun use the time until this 2'30'' movie is finally over to count the times the boy shouts "MOM!" over and over. The question remains how an acclaimed film maker as Spielberg can use his time like this.I don't know what Kubrick/Spielberg wanted to show us with this movie, and I suspect neither did/do they. The fact that some of the audience was leaving the theater when I saw it and that everyone came out laughing about how incredibly bad it was should tell anyone not to see this crappy film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I see a different film to everyone else?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please, please, please stop the madness. Now usually the IMDB seems to be spot on in terms of user ratings. Good films get high marks and bad ones hang around the 3s and 4s. Clearly though I must have sat through nearly two and a half hours of completely different movie to the one that gets 7 in the ratings here. This film is not just poor - lots of films are poor but but that doesn't make them unenjoyable. No, A.I. is gob-smackingly, buttock-clenchingly awful. Now I am generally a big fan of both Spielberg and Kubrick. Both great directors and even visionaries every now and then but it seems that from conception to delivery thing the whole of AI was a ghastly mistake. It's very slow, unenvolving, over sentimental, and worst of all incredibly derivative. There is not one single original thought or shot in the entire film - just a regurgitated mess of Blade Runner, Close Encounters, 2001 and a score of others. Even the debatable 'best bit' in the flesh fair was frankly done better in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and that's really saying something. Yes the special effects were nice but hardly earth shattering.All of this is, of course, a great pity as some of the basic ideas underlying the film from a moral and philosophical point of view aren't actually that bad. What is life/how do we define love/when should we stop playing God/etc, all are good themes. But to so completely wash over over them with such slush that half the time one could be mistaken for thinking you're watching a coffee commercial is criminal.There is no humour, none of the interesting ideas ever really surface, and the ending is so ludricrous I didn't know whether to laugh in disbelief or just retch into my popcorn bucket. On top of all that it's actually fairly badly acted and even the editing is not up to much.Do not go and see this film, go to the video store and rent Blade Runner again. Then if you have some time left over go and watch vinyl emulsion seep slowly into fresh plaster. I promise you it'll be more fun.</fullReview>

The theater was full and everyone was ready to watch an excellent film but...i don't know how to describe the reaction on the people...After some nice sequences where Osment and Law are the only saving thing of the film, the END of Spielberg as director...I'm one of the spectators that stay until the end of the film even if it's horrible, but men, i wanted to left the teather 3 or 4 times at the end of the film....i was nearly to felt asleep and i can't remember a so boring film in my life.Please Mr.Spielberg don't do it again ! Let your fantastic dreamings for any other films not for AI...I noticed Kubrick is now more fantastic than you, he doesn't need special effects to make people feel what he wants...(2001)Steve....you bored me....and it's so difficult to accept for me....a still fan of you, but i can't believe one of your films are the worst i ever seen. Sorry.PD: Actors: 10, Film:0.5 (the .5 is for Kubrick)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't believe that this film only lasted 2.5 hours. After I finally emerged from this - what I could possibly describle as the worst movie ever - I felt drained and cheated out of the ?8 I paid to get in. Even the incessant sound of popcorn crunching away behind me, was more entertaining. Did Stephen Spielberg set out to direct a film so abominable. Firstly, the plot was loose, tired and cliche, not to mention just uninteresting. The only slightly redeeming character was that of Teddy who has the potential to be psychotic and therefore a slight edge. I just wanted the kid to die throughout. There was no emotion in the film. Just dead. I didn't care about the characters. Au contraire, I wanted them to die as quickly as possible. If like me, you love films like Shawshank Redemption, Goodfellas, Sixth Sense, Glengarry Glen Ross, Godfather, Heat etc. I ask you to please not waste your time on this film. As the late great Bill Hicks once described Basic Instinct: "It's a piece of sh*t. That's it! That's ALL it is. Piece of sh*t. Walk away"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is amazing how the names of Spielberg who made possible The Color Purple and Kubrick who made possible 2001 A Space Odyssey (just to mention one piece for each) are tied to this film!!. I went to see a possible masterpiece with a controversial issue that has fascinated the imagination of mankind since the first ever computer, and, unfortunately, I came out of the cinema with a sense of missed opportunities. Is with a deep sense of regret that I say Short Circuit had a better approach to the issue of humanizing Artificial Intelligence. Sorry Steven, I really love you and I have seen all your movies. But this time you went too far away. Probably I missed the point. Probably Im an stupid ignorant thats unable to get in touch with the true sense of the film. Thats possible. But I DO remember the words of HAL 9000 in 2010: "...will I dream??...". And those words from a futuristic computer brought me tears and meant so much for the A.I. debate that will remain far above every possible issue addressed in this film. Im very sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is there a contract of those that love this move and those that hate this movie?People go to movies for different reasons.Why is this movie a classic sci-fi to some and sci-fi rubbish to others?People view sci-fi based on different philosophies.* If you are a liberal in the US, I think the morality will play to you.* If you are a futurist that see nothing but darkness ahead - this is your movie. Ecspecially if you see the total wiping out of the human race.* If you did not find Clockwork Orange disturbing, you will love this movie.* If you do not analytically examine future science, you will love this movie.HOWEVER...* If you examine future science and expect current trends to continue in a movie, you will hate this movie. - for example. In a few years GPS technology will be incorporated in most of our civilization. This allows the tracking of stray robots and stolen police helicopters.* If you see light ahead for civilization and you think many things will get better, you will hate this movie. - This movie portays daddy as very cold, with a strange relationship with his wife. He brings the robot home but takes little responsibility from that point. - The house is designed with a lack of style that is full of life. - Vehicles are the typical futurist variety. Believe me, years from now there will be 1968 Mustangs on the road, as well as other classic styles and antiques. Heck, I see 60 year cars today, why would they not see old cars in the future.* DO YOU WANT ENTERTAINMENT? - This movie is MEAN SPIRITED, DARK, with no likable humans characters, ecspecially a mom that abandons a robot witnhout rightful cause. No happy endings, no feel good accomplishments, and no hurdling of problems to obtain a successful desired end.* Do you require good science? - Not even close. Tomorrow's scientist will be smarter than today's, yet even today's science knows better than to: a. build a tube from the mouth opening to electronic components. b. allow robots close to swimming pools. c. allow harm to come to owners, even through peer pressure. d. distribute robots without GPS systems. e. not utilize hard drives to review eye/ear inputs data acquired by robots to determine past events. It would have been real helpful in the pool incident, the evil son getting robot to cut hair of mom, and robot framed for murder. It also would have caught the real murderer. f. Easy turn off / deactivation by long range remote. g. Make police vehicles without GPS, security biometrics to activate, etc.- So for those say this is an intelligent movie - wrong! What you really mean is, this is a philiosophical movie with liberal ideas that you agree with. Though I think even liberals would never allow the mean-spirited caging, humilation, and torture of robotic humanoids.Misnomer from start. William hurt says "God created man to love Him." Close but wrong. God created man with the capacity to love Him and others BUT gave man the ability to choose for himself those he would love. God never made man love Him, God loved us FIRST, and many responded by loving Him back, most others did not.Intelligent? I watch documentaries and read books for this. Those that say this is an intelligent movie for intelligent viewers, need to read some non-fiction and watch some good documentaries.Entertaining? If you think mean-spirited dark futurism is entertaining, yes. If you like fell-good movies, no.Good acting? YesEffects? YesInteresting? YesCharacterization? No - Inconsistant charaters without depth. You do not find yourself caring about any of them.Storyline - Inconsistant. Ocean creep floods cities but no one seems to dismantle anything. Lacked good adventure with a few exceptions. Towards the end - MOST RIDICULOUS ITEM - The creator goes to length to get the boy to the end of the journey - then leaves him. You do not leave a robotic boy that just murdered his robotic rival out of jealousy. Of course the boy jumps into the ocean for 2000 years.BTW: End with Advanced robots that look more like Hollywood aliens. Humans are all dead. The boy robot is 2000 years old and has no hope of meeting back up with mom, being turned into a boy. He gets to live a fake 1 day with an image of mom. Happy ending?WHY DO YOU GO TO A MOVIE? That will determine whether you like the movie.Give me bad science, stupid storyline, fine, but give me something that feels good. For me that is entertainment. If I want good futurism, I go to the scriptures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I most stress how disappointed I was in this movie. Easily the worst movie I have seen this summer. Why does everything have to be so dark and disturbing for critics to like? This movie basically had the same plot as last years Bicentennial Man and that movie did not fair well with critics but after seeing both movies I liked Bicentennial Man much better. There were so many scenes that I just cringed at. I felt like I had pins jabbed into my brain and eyeballs watching this movie.On the positive side, I will say that Osment did a good job in acting. And I liked the Teddy Bear. That's as far as I will go. The problem was the movie.If you want to go see a movie and feel depressed than go see this. I would go on and tell you about some of the things I disliked but would I be giving away spoilers? Here's some - without spoiling the movie. I'll start with the Flesh Fair. They torture other robots by shooting them thru propellers and dropping acid on them. Also the little boy is paraded thru this Oz like town not by a lion, scarecrow and tinman but by a Male Prostitute. And without spoiling it what about David bashing the heck out of the "other robot". How about Manhattan? The ending? let's just throw some Aliens into this movie. What doesn't this movie have? This whole movie mad me sick. Buyer beware - definitely not a family movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only lasted a few minutes into this movie and I'm all for going to one based on some far fetched idea i.e; Jurassic Park, E.T., any Sci-Fi movie, and Pretty Woman. But when the movie is based around an idea that makes no sense and in this case would never happen, and that idea is used to create fear in its characters and even the audience. I can't stand by and let the truth go unheard. Anybody with a handful of brain cells knows that the ice caps melting and causing the kind of mayhem A.I. depicts is minute. The only reason its being measured is because the government is giving some grad student and his friends a billion dollars to test for Global warming.Their findings, the earth has warmed a half a degree over the last ten years(its changed more than that in the time it takes you to read this review) and they estimate that the ice caps are melting at 1.8mm per year. If the time frame in the movie is correct, the ice caps would have melted 90mm. Since ice is 10 times denser than water, the oceans would have risen 9mm or about 11/32 of an inch. I don't think that's enough to flood coastal cities. If Spielberg would have spent a little time thinking about this obvious mistake, and less time polishing his Oscars. He might have had a decent film.1 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I've never seen quite such violent reactions during a showing of a film before. Smatterings of giggling started about halfway through (around the time that the comments about how 'freaky' Haley Joel Osment is had subsided), gradually progressing to full-throated laughter by a large percentage of the audience well before the film drew to a close. The notable thing about this is, while many audience members were being caught unawares by the unintentional hilarity, there was another sizeable chunk of the audience struggling to hold back tears. Things came to a head during the astonishingly long climax, when the theater was filled with uproarious laughter on several occasions, followed by just as many deeply angry voices screaming for the people responsible to be ejected. Fortunately, the film finished before the serious violence started.My feelings towards this film were perfectly summed up by one member of a group of guys sitting behind me, who at one particularly comic moment gasped, "what is up with this movie?", before being consumed by mirth once again. So, indeed, what IS up with this movie? It starts reasonably enough, and you assume that the ponderous start is building work for a more plot-packed second half. Perhaps the CONSTANT reinforcement that, yes, it would be freaky to have a robot child running around the house would give way to something more substantial. But no, what we have here is a quite surprising lack of story - the premise is established early on and very little is done with it. Right from the start we are beaten with the theme that human beings aren't very nice (every significant human character comes across as despicable in their own way), but once the robot boy is dumped by his family there isn't a whole lot left. The film meanders on, languidly considering when it should finish, until finally it crawls to a halt...a good thirty minutes to an hour after it started winding itself up. Of course, a great many things have been said about the film's epilogue - it'll have you shaking your head in wonder, that's for sure, although you may be wondering...well, what's up with this movie, to quote the man.The most surprising part of the evening, however, came when a female member of our party was asked her opinion of the film and answered that she thought it was at least original. If you've already seen the film, you can imagine the slaughtering she took, as AI is quite possibly the LEAST original picture released of late...and that includes all the horrible teenage flicks. AI is a horrendous Frankenstein's monster of stolen ideas, themes and feelings, the most noticeable of which come from Stanley Kubrick himself. The decision was obviously to make this a Kubrick film even without his presence, and it was done by giving you plenty of opportunity to remember the films Kubrick DID direct...almost like a tribute by a student filmmaker. But it doesn't stop there, of course...the list of...'inspirations'...is very long, has been covered elsewhere, and would not be a problem if they didn't amount to the entire sum of the film. It makes for excruciatingly dull viewing, and leaves little more than a soulless void.(...but Teddy is fabulous! It's almost as if he was in a different film. Tells you something when you have to rely on fleeting appearances by a robot bear for something (ANYTHING!) interesting onsceen)</fullReview>

The buzz after the movie mirrored by my view and the group of six with whom I saw this movie. It was horrible.As a preface ... I like to think and be intruiged about the possiblity of what the future has in store for us. I like well made sci-fi, special effects, and most of all, intelligent and talented, people at work.The entire time (and it was long), I was giving Speilberg credit. I believed that he would pull off a surprise that would bring it all together. I believed that Speilberg wanted to keep us guessing and thinking. However, it was completely disjunctive and without climax.Also, I'm not alone in fighting the urge to fall asleep. This is not to take anything away from any actors. They did the best with what they were given.Many effects and ideas were easily appreciated. However, they far from outweighed the plot or dialogue.I suggest that you do not support this movie by wasting your earned dollar. Hollywood should not be encouraged to reinforce its belief that "us Americans" will spend our money on anything and everything that it puts out. We go see movies because of the hype. Don't believe it this time.With best intentions for the movie-goer, TMale Age 30</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mere words cannot describe how bad and disappointing AI actually is. Kubrick, who was courting this story since 1969, was wise to make Eyes Wide Shut before instead of this ludicrous hodge-podge of Pinocchio, Wizard of Oz and Close Encounters. Osment proves that he can be an astonishing actor despite the low caliber material given to him (see Pay it Forward - rather, DON'T see Pay it Forward). His performance as the little robot that wants to be a real boy stands out like a rose growing atop a dump heap. On the other hand, Jude Law's undeveloped Gigolo Joe is a waste. Cutting out his character and a never explored subplot would shave 20 minutes off this never-ending debacle. The last half-hour is most offensive. Let me offer this equation: Spielberg + Ferris wheel = bad sign (see 1941 - rather, DON'T see 1941). I can't help but think that Kubrick might have filmed this ending, looked at it and scrapped it. The Master of the Retake would have then called Osment back for an additional five years while he filmed another. As it stands, it frustrates and infuriates. It's almost as if Spielberg couldn't come up with an acceptable conclusion so he slapped on the ending to Close Encounters. Utterly insulting. AI joins Pearl Harbor, Tomb Raider, Swordfish and Atlantis in the worst summer movie season in recent memory.</fullReview>

It is the harmonic bi-inspiring effect among us, the intelligent life, and the artificial intelligence we create that reveals the complex logical and emotional behavior we have. It is impossible to portrait any human being thoroughly, but Steven did a great job in this movie by presenting at least one of the possible illustration.

I feel it is a film that is initially hard to connect to, but when you do it is emotionally deep, rewarding and will leave you dumbstruck by the end. The cinematography is at times stunning, and haley joel osment is convincing in the fairytale role of pinocchio. Morally the film poses many questions and it doesn't necessarily give you the answers your supposed to choose, which is probably why Hollywood never loved it. This isn't the kind of movie you can watch with a group of friends or while you are concentrating on other things, it has to be watched and connected to, it isn't a movie you can flick in and out of. That said I feel it a movie that in years to come will be considered a classic, it is kubric/spielberg, it is unique, it is definitely worth your while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fascinating near-miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviews of A.I. inevitably focus on its flaws, but you almost have to give the film a passing grade because of the sheer scope of its ambitions, and the hard questions it asks. In the near future, 'mechas' (life-like robots) are very popular with humans; in fact, they have become so commonplace that they are taken for granted and used for practically everything. Only one type of mecha seems to be missing- one that can actually love its owner. And that is apparently solved by mechas like David, who is brought into a home where two parents are effectively childless since their own, real son lies in a suspended state, awaiting a cure for his incurable disease. Monica, the mother, gradually warms to David but then her real son is miraculously healed and returns home, setting up a conflict between the authentic and the artificial which the latter is bound to lose. Also present is another mecha of sorts, a walking, talking teddy bear named, well, Teddy, who provides a wry though childlike running commentary on things. With her own son back, Monica perhaps begins to feel guilty about ever taking David in as a 'replacement,' so one day she drives the mecha and his teddy bear to a remote spot in the forest and abandons them. The rest of the film concerns David's attempts to find his way back to Monica. Spielberg disputes that he took Stanley Kubrick's dark fable and overly sentimentalized it; in fact, he claims just the opposite, that the darkest scenes in the film are his. But 'sentimental' might be too easy a word anyway. First of all, it's very difficult for one watching to hope David gets his wish. Monica in an unlikeable character and clearly undeserving of David's 'love.' Therefore, the entire second part of the movie feels misguided. We certainly want David to be happy but we also know that is impossible if he returns to Monica, who would certainly abandon him again. On their journey, David and Teddy meet up with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a prostitute mecha. There is a bizarre scene at a 'flesh fair,' where mechas are blown up, disfigured, and destroyed in front of cheering crowds (a parody it seems of Nascar, pro wrestling, and July 4). David narrowly escapes being destroyed and soon the three of them make their way to Rouge City, a sort of revved-up futuristic Las Vegas. David becomes convinced that the Blue Fairy (from 'Pinocchio') can show him the way home and determines to find her. This in turn leads them to Manhattan, which like all coastal cities on Earth by this point in time is under water from the ice caps having melted. David and Teddy end up in a submarine-type vehicle under water where the ruins of Coney Island lay. And there is a statue of the Blue Fairy. David makes a wish but the vessel becomes trapped and there he and Teddy sit for 2000 years. By this time, Earth has entered another ice age, and aliens (which are really evolved mechas) discover the two. They recreate Monica for David, but only for one day; the last shot is of Monica falling asleep, David next to her. The 'Pinocchio' connection would have been obvious in any event, but to confront it directly and literally is another bizarre twist in the story. David's adventures in Rouge City and the ending in Manhattan are two of the best scenes; the aliens' ship in particular is marvelously conceived, just disconnected panels that fly away when no longer needed. A.I. poses a lot more questions than it answers, not least of which is, does David really love, or is he just a machine that is programmed to act as though he does? Most viewers will simply accept that he is in fact capable of the emotion, but humans are forever attributing human characteristics and emotions to everything around them, from pets to plants to inanimate objects. The way in which Monica ultimately reacts to David suggests there is a part of her that realizes he cannot, in fact, truly love her. But then again, maybe Spielberg didn't mean that at all. It's one of the reasons A.I. is a disturbingly thought-provoking film, hypnotically seductive and cold-blooded at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie. Started by Kubrick, finished by Spielberg- it should be a masterpiece. Instead you get a really awful film, that whilst overly long by about thirty minutes feels incomplete. It seems very apparent that it was two directors interpretation of the script edited together in a mish mash of hash. I was very disappointed with this film and the storyline lifted from Pinocchio and frankenstein set in a future where robots fill the voids in our lives, until they are replaced by upgrades or even humans (think "I want to be a real boy"). This movie could and should have been a lot better, the set ups and special effects are excellent, but the studio should really have bit the bullet and pulled the film and let somebody have a go from scratch. Then there is the sentiment you get from having watched the film. Firstly you feel rather than annoyed that you have just wasted nearly two and a half hours of your life watching this. Secondly you feel utterly depressed and bordering on suicidal having watched David's agonising search for parental love and meaning of his existence. Finally outside of Road to Perdition (which he is barely in) I have yet to see Jude Law in a decent film. Truly one to avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Spielberg's worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't often pan a film, but this is a highly overrated movie. Spielberg had his proverbial head up his behind when he green-lighted this project. I found it very difficult to sit through in the theater where I saw it on a very large screen with a very mixed audience opening day. Before the film ended, people were walking out. It's a very uncomfortable film to sit through, despite the pretty special effects and Jude Law making an ass out of himself. If you enjoy seeing children threatened, harassed, discarded, tortured, abused, and misunderstood in a hundred ways, then you'll enjoy watching this film. Why would anyone spend hundreds of millions of dollars inventing a robot to 'love' you? How could any government condone creating a land for people to have sex with robots? Why would anyone regard destroying (in a malicious way) robots that resemble real people as mass entertainment? Spielberg's premises are stretched too thin on a convoluted plot that is both absurd, silly, and downright repulsive. If you wish to see Spielberg as an artist and director extraordinaire, watch and enjoy Jaws, CETK, ET, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, or even Raiders of the Lost Arc... anything but this film (or 1941).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Confusion will be A.I. epitaph... Nothing to share with Kubrik, this film is a boring patchwork of hi-end sfx and confused storytelling. In the same year, 2001, we had the pleasure to see a restored version of 2001: a space odyssey, that shows the very genius of Stanley Kubrik side by side to the geek-minded film by Spielberg. I don't know how could someone say that A.I. is a Kubrik-style film: to affirm that is to catch the bite for the hook. Yes, the look of the film is very accurate, but the plot has no coherence, and the film itself is too long and without rhythm. This is the same problem that occurs in Schindler's list and Private Ryan: Spielberg is a great and talented director for action film like Duel or Indiana Jones but he's not a great author. Take a look at Kubrik's work or Bergman's or Lars Von Trier's: they know how to use a camera and tell a story. Spielberg knows how to use a camera, but not to tell a story. I'm sorry fans...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its prophetic vision becomes clearer with each passing year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five years after its release, what can one say of "AI"? Like the proverbial onion, AI is multi-layered; unlike the humor mag by that name, we're more apt to cry than laugh as the layers reveal themselves. There are tears of remorse, and of recognition, at the profound insights on human nature, history and destiny enfolded here ... and tears of awe, at the final layer of irony that only recent history could supply. There's far too much to even attempt addressing it all here. AI echoes Biblical themes of original sin and expulsion from Eden; of Cain and Abel, of immaculate cybernetic conception, of Pinocchio and the Blue Fairy, entwined in riddles about the inscrutability of such fundamental human mysteries as body and soul, hedonism and martyrdom, nature, creation and the hereafter, and the enigmas of human love and altruism. AI also resonates with the tragedies of the century just past ? the Holocaust and the H-Bomb - and the century just barely begun at the time of its release ? 9/11, climate change, and Hurricane Katrina. As Jews were stigmatized as less than human, and thus, fit for Nazi extermination, for their failure to conform to the prevailing mythology of Christian ensoulment, electronic beings who - like Shylock's Jew - have the capacity to express and register compassion and pain, are deemed lesser beings, fit for brutalization and disposal by a human community itself too threatened with self-inflicted extinction to recall existential pride and joy, except through the abasement and subjugation of others. ... A book would be needed to treat all these facets fairly. Yet, AI's most profound impact seems to arise out of its unwitting foreshadowing, first of global climate change, and then, of the violence and paranoia ushered in with 9/11/01, by both sides in the "war on terror," only weeks after AI hit the screens. Who can help but lose one's breath or skip a beat, at the image of World Trade Towers, first rising above a flooded Manhattan skyline, as David and Joe approach in their amphibicopter - and again, after millennia bring a new ice age, the image of the doomed towers piercing the glacier's face! Were these images not painful and prophetic enough, before the towers fell? What can it all possibly mean? Briefly put, the message AI drives home most forcefully for me, is one about the meaning of human love, in the context of parents and children, dead, living and yet unborn ? of love against the backdrop of generational change, and intergenerational memory. After we're treated to the folly of Joe, a robot, playing out the superficial mechanics of romantic love, we glimpse the concept of higher love in David's capacity to be imprinted with an immutable devotion to his mother. And we're led to believe that Monica, his human "mother," exemplifies a higher form of human love, by favoring her own flesh-and-blood offspring, Martin, to the robo-boy, David, when the two come into conflict. But Joe later hints at the shallowness of this human motherly love, when he speaks outside Dr. Know's pavilion, about even the love of a human mother, being more about what the child does for the parent, than about a true devotion to the happiness and welfare of the child. Remember, even as the film begins, the context is established that mankind has permitted its living children, and all future generations of humankind, to be afflicted with man-made climate change that has already flooded the flower of humanity's historical pride and glory, and the great coastal concentrations of its cultural memory ? not to mention, the death by drowning of millions of flesh-and-blood children, "other people's children." If we cannot care enough to save these millions of fellow-humans now alive, how can we claim to have the love to protect the memories of generations past, and the dreams of generations of children to come, from man-made destruction of creation on earth? Spielberg and Kubrick appear to be saying that we true humans of flesh, blood and bone, cannot make any legitimate claim for the superiority of our species ? of our unique minds and souls ? if we could not muster the human feeling and caring to prevent the work of generations of our ancestors, or the hopes and dreams of our potential future flesh and blood descendants, from being wiped out through man-made climate change. In a similar vein, through the image of the robot David, chasing after the illusion of the Blue Fairy, the film-makers also seem to criticize, with subtle but stunning effect, the pre-occupation of humans ? whether of Christian or other faiths ? with their access to a mythical afterlife of the individual soul, when the likely effect of this pre-occupation is to ensure that living generations will be insufficiently attentive to the steps required of us, if we are to preserve any future humans to perpetuate those faith traditions ? much less to live their own lives. The irony of watching future generations of evolved androids, showing more concern for the preservation of our human qualities and memories, than we had apparently shown for our own, was simply staggering. And the prospect that those qualities and memories might be embodied someday only in beings of silicon and microchips, should be motivation enough for us to rediscover the genuine love we have for our own flesh-and-blood children, and their hopes and dreams, and for us to take the lessons of more recent events ? like Hurricane Katrina ? and more recent films ? like "An Inconvenient Truth" ? truly to heart, so that we may join with like-minded humans, and avert the realization of the direst prophesies portrayed in "AI". Unless humans can muster the sense to preserve our species and the Creation of which we're a part, then perhaps, Spielberg and Kubrick hint, it's our own alleged human "intelligence" - more than the androids' - that should be deemed "artificial"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Stanley Kubrick pictures. Each was different than the one before and each had that undeniable Kubrick touch. He was a photographer and worked for Life magazine and others before turning to directing. A-I was to be his next project. Sadly, he died and the world lost of the greats. So Spielberg took over. If I were Steven I would remove my name from the credits and slap an "Alan Smithee" on there as quickly as possible. In case you don't know, Alan Smithee is the name directors use when they withdraw their own name from a film because after careful consideration they no longer want to be associated with it. David Lynch did this with Dune, another epic flop. But A-I goes beyond flop. I could not find a suitable word to describe this movie suffice to say it was so bad it wasn't released, it escaped! Awful, boring, stupid, one of the worst movies ever made. Even the worst of Roger Corman's $20,000 quickies was better than this. Don't waste your time or your eyesight. A-I, I imagine, stands for Absolutely Inept.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie that spelled the beginning of the end for Steven Spielburg who up until this movie was one of the greatest directors alive. The man who brought us Indianna Jones, Saving Private Ryan, and Schindler's List might as well have retired after this movie instead of making Minority Report, War of the World's and Munich. When I first saw the teaser and then the trailer for this movie I could not wait to see it. I felt as if my life depended on seeing, but that was not to be. I tried to find at the library in the small town where I lived, but had no such luck and since I was not working at the time I could not rent it. I ended up not seeing it until some time last year and wished that I never had. Not only was this movie a complete waste of time, but the story was impossible to follow. The writer(s) kept jumping from one subject the next without ever explaining what they had just left. I felt like a tennis ball in the court with the Williams sisters being whacked this way and that. The differences between the robot boy and his real brother was never wrapped up. You were never told why Jude Law's character was set up for murder. The charters were so 2D that you couldn't even get involved with them and you could literally see right through them. Their dialog was tedious and somewhat pointless when they did speak. This is one of those movies like The Thin Red Line where it would have been better to have no words in the movie. You would be much better off watching a silent movie and laughing to death then wasting over two and half hours of your life. If you want to see a good sci-fi movie that has robots in it then watch any of the three Terminator movies, Short Circuit, Star Wars, or if you are desperate Cyborg or if you are really desperate then Hitshhicker's Guide to the Galaxy, but only watch that as a last resort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Universes Collide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. Artificial Intelligence is set in the future when androids are commonplace and are even used to replace family members. The film bears the Auteur ship of both Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick, directed by Spielberg and based on storyboards originally envisaged by Kubrick. Spielberg's love of the action genre and Kubrick's more psychological approach to film making give A. I. a feeling of two opposing universes colliding on screen and this difference between the two styles remains evident to the audience throughout the film.The narrative of A.I. follows David, one such android, who is adopted by the Swinton family in order to fill the gap left by their real son Martin, who has gone missing. However when Martin returns, family relations become strained and David is shunned. This is the catalyst for David's quest to become a real boy. Stanley Kubrick's directing style is to create a film that deals with various themes, which will keep the audience thinking long after the credits have rolled. In A.I., Kubrick's influence can be seen in two main themes; firstly that of an outsider not being accepted into society. David is the obvious outsider in the Swinton family, especially when Martin returns. Martin feels threatened by David whom he feels is invading his territory and, along with his friends, taunts the android about how different he is from them all. Secondly, the theme of the 'fairytale' is developed as the narrative progresses. Two fairy tales are symbolised in A.I.; Hansel and Gretel, and the Wizard of Oz. In Hansel and Gretel one parent loves and another abandons the children; this is shown in A.I. when David's adopted mother tries to save his life after his Father sends him away. At this point in the film David begins his quest, which is representative of Dorothy's journey in the Wizard of Oz. Both are seeking a wizard to solve their problems. Another fairytale element is the presence of a narrator, which occurs late in the film.However, these thought-provoking themes are soon replaced by Steven Spielberg's love of the action genre. This is represented by the arrival of the ships, which take androids away and put them on show for human amusement. During this sequence, every filmic device is heightened: the colour becomes bolder and the presence of a bright blue search light serves to wake the audience up from their quiet deliberations on what has preceded. This part of the film is reminiscent of Ridley Scott's 'Bladerunner', where machines are hunted down by humans. Given the thought provoking nature early in the film, this machine hunting sequence seems strangely out of place and clearly demonstrates the opposing universes of Kubrick and Spielberg. The soundtrack makes itself known suddenly and abruptly as the audience is drawn into Spielberg's world of gigolo androids and burlesque houses. It is here that David finds his companion who helps him on the quest to find the blue fairy. Spielberg shoots this search in wide angle to give the audience a real sense of being part of the action.A.I. contains elements that radically oppose each other and do not always make for seamless viewing; the line between Spielberg and Kubrick's directing styles is visible at all times. However, A.I. is still an enjoyable piece of work and should get credit, no matter who had overall artistic control. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hmmm...well robots may enjoy this. Infected robots...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a long time I had heard about this movie and wondered what to think of it. After hearing much about it being a flop and other times being a masterpiece, I finally took the time to rent and watch it. Turns out after watching it, I was left with a new question: Why was it ever called a masterpiece.The premise of the movie seems simple enough; a futuristic world where android technology has evolved to the point where they can simulate love...almost. A company manufactures a robot boy (mecha as they call it) and the story centers around one family that purchases it. So a person would naturally assume that the movie would be about the relationship between the mother and the mecha, or how the mecha wants to be loved, or a million and a half other artificial intelligence themes examined in films from Blade Runner to I, Robot. I don't think anyone expected the film to involve the mecha being hunted down in the woods with a robo-prostitute, or a white trash robot killing jerk fair, or a futile and boring quest for a blue fairy, or aliens for crying out loud. I have no idea how all those things occurred together in that last sentence, let alone a big Hollywood movie. Wasn't there someone anywhere during the filming who recognized the utter stupidity of it all. Couldn't one extra, actor, or stagehand tug on Spielberg's sleeve and tell him, "Uh...is this serious; is this the movie you wanted to make?"If the movie had been about just the human/ A.I. relationship with the family, the movie would have merely been bland and like hundreds of other films. But to lead the audience on a two and a half hour adventure that hops from idiotic premise to idiotic premise is just terrible. The movie would have been laughable if each scene wasn't inexplicably treated so seriously and backed with impressive special effects. Watching this movie was like watching a horror or sci--fi film from the50's that is so retarded your mind boggles at the plot choices... it was like that, except with a budget.And just when I thought it was over, aliens show up and present one of the worst endings I've ever seen. By the end I found the only character I enjoyed was a teddy bear, and even it was used in dumb ways. If Spielberg had intended to make the audience look around the theatre in confusion every ten minutes as anger built within them, he did well...exceptionally well. "Did that robot who sounded like chris rock just get fired out of a cannon into a spinning propeller?" Yes, actually. "...I must be seeing things, those aren't aliens are they?" uh-huh. "Why are they using that lock of hair to clone the mecha's 'mother'?" Because, obviously no one read the script before they started shooting this movie. Anyone who loved this movie is either very impressed with special effects and in love with Jude Law even when he's playing a stupid mechanical gigolo...or...have never seen a movie that deals with robots before in their life. This movie was much worse than I ever could have predicted, and ultimately lacked several key elements that make for an enjoyable movie, such as likable characters, conflict, or a point. This would have made a nice short film, but as a scattered and painfully long movie, it was terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Deserved It's Disappointing Box Office</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many reviewers and critics have bemoaned the fact that this film did not achieve the box-office success it deserved. I am more in agreement with the theater-going public; this misfire deserved its disappointing take. Not that it didn't try, and in my opinion, should have succeeded.Two of the greatest directors in the history of film were associated with the project, and apparently cared deeply about it. They are, of course, Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. It was Spielberg that finally directed A.I. and perhaps it was his desire to adhere to Kubrick's vision (or his perception of it) that threw the film off balance. That, or perhaps Spielberg is getting sappy. Nonetheless, the movie tries to cover too much philosophical ground, and instead of telling a good story, we're stuck with an odd polemic on the nature of love, life, and lots of other deep subjects. There was a great, dark, story to tell and a fine cast assembled to assist in the telling. But Spielberg decided to get preachy, ditched the inherit drama (and horror) of the story, and subjected the paying public to a sermon. I don't find that so entertaining, and apparently neither did many others.</fullReview>

Additionally, who is AI's target audience? What is the film trying to be; a horror or thriller movie or a fairy tale? The mix of concepts in AI such as the Sex Bot and teddy bear sit together very uneasily. At least now when I see a disappointing movie such as The Matrix Reloaded, Star Wars Episode I or II or the Lord of the Rings trilogy I feel better because I know they are officially not the worst films ever made.</fullReview>

Just to illustrate how bad it was, I was in a packed theater on the opening weekend of the movie and by the time I left ( halfway through the film) most then 75% of the people had also left. This movie is horribly boring and annoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with a positive outlook in spite of mixed reviews. But even now I can not even believe how bad it was. At the end, or what seemed like the end for the last hour of the movie it just kept going and getting worse and worse, they could have cut it off at any number of points and salvaged something of the movie, but it just kept getting more and more ridiculous. Stanley Kubrick must be spinning in his grave, what a total piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't think Kubrick would have liked it, either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had one suggestion to Spielberg, it would be this: editing is GOOD. After 2 hours, I got up to water my plants, as the film went from being mildly thought provoking to pseudo-emotional, and the plot shifted from weak to nonexistent. I would have loved to see the concept of the film carried to completion by Kubrick, as the dark subject matter and psychological and moral implications in the story seem like something Kubrick could have portrayed exquisitely.AI, as made by Spielberg, though visually stunning and well acted, just feels like it was dumbed down and dressed up to appeal to a broader audience. Had he truely committed to making it a family film, instead of riding the fence (badly) between dark drama and fairy tale, perhaps I'd have really enjoyed the it. At least I wouldn't have wasted an entire afternoon waiting for it to get better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to add to the already lengthy list of comments, but if I can just convince *one* person to pass on this movie, I will have done my duty. Save yourselves!I keep reading that viewers found it thought-provoking. The only thought-provoking aspect of the movie was "Wow. I wonder how they could have made a movie this bad." The argument that you don't have to be a human to display/have human emotions is included over and over and over again, just in case you didn't happen to see it on the tagline or figure it out from the previews.I have to agree with the readers who said that the only redeeming quality of this movie was Teddy (and I'd add Jude Law as well).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually like every movie I see. Unless it's just unbelievably bad, I can watch it, probably two or three times. There are the movies that stand out, too, of course, the ones that I can't stop talking about weeks after I've seen them-movies like "The Usual Suspects," "Silence of the Lambs," "Goodfellas," you know, classics. But really, I'm fine with almost anything; I even liked "Scooby-Doo".But this movie sucked, bigtime. A movie can commit a number of offenses, so long as it isn't boring. As long as it can hold my attention, it'll do. This was probably the most boring movie I've seen since "Ishtar"; this is compounded by the fact that it was about 11 hours long.I'll not go into all the other reasons this movie reeks so distinctly as a tiny floater in the mighty pile of dung that represents ALMOST EVERY MOVIE EVER MADE. People have already taken care of that for me, but believe me: I could go on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it's a variation on the Pinnochio story and takes up a standard Sci Fi theme: robots interacting with humans. the movie starts well enough, but then the gaping holes in the plot show themselves: why did David's creator put him through all those convoluted changes, and why the interminable search for the 'Blue Fairy Princess?' Did David's parents think about the consequences of having the robot David possibly having to interact with their real life son? There's no evidence that they did. The film has some interesting special effects, but in the last half of the movie the plots really bogs down, and David's 'quest' becomes an interminably drawn out affair. Long before the film's end, I found I had lost interest and wanted it to be over and done with. The only positive is Haley Joel Osment's superb acting. The kid is good! His facial expressions were perfect, and there was none of the syrupy, cutesy mawkishness that so many child actors fall into. Too bad he had such a terrible screenplay to work with. Unless you're an absolute special effects freak who can't forego the spectacle of robots getting blown up, pass on this stinkeroo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie Spielberg ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definatly the worst movie Steven Spielberg ever made. I have never really liked any of Kubrick's work, but this one is unique in its bad performance.I began watching this movie with an open mind and hoped for a pretty good movie. I simply love Spielbergs other movies, and thought that this should be at least equally good as his other films. I was very wrong.The beginning is good. I felt that David, the robot-with-feelings, was a good character and Haley Joel Osment, playing him, does a remarkable job. However, the story isn't only bad, it is repulsing!I have seen films with discusting stories before - as Re-Animator and Nekromantic to name just two - but instead of making a point or being fun to watch, A.I. just gets worse and worse. After two hours you are not only sick of that stupid robot, you are totally bored too!But the movie goes bad long before two hours. It begins in the first scenes with David and his mom. The music - it is really bad made and doesn't as in Spielbergs other movies, add anything to the feel or mood of the movie - it is just painfully annoying!Jude Law, who usually is a great actor and who plays nice parts in Enemy at the Gates and eXistenZ, is here pretty boring and plays a mediocre part as the sex-robot Gigolo-Joe. The scenes with Joe are however, the only scenes that are enjoying to watch.The background and the reason why robots are built are good, and it holds through the at least a bit interesting ending, however, the narratives that are added to the film in the end seem to have only one purpose: To keep the audience from falling asleep!With its 145 minutes, this is one of the most boring films I've ever seen. It is, as I said, Spielbergs worst performance ever. Has he gone old and lost his brains? What was he thinking trying to do such a discusting film?This movie is not even worth the money it costs to rent it. If you can see it for free, sure, do it, but you will be wasting almost three hours of your life that can be used for much better purposes.A.I. is a film I get angry of watching and few movies do that to me. Since I really enjoy Spielbergs other movies, I really hope that he will make up for this foolish attempt of trying to be deeper than he really is...</fullReview>

I could not have been more disappointed in this one. Thought it was extremely boring, uninteresting, could have slept through the whole thing. Only reason I didn't walk out was that the friend I was with said they thought it was okay, so I didn't want to spoil it for them by saying I wanted to leave. After the movie, they agreed it was terrible. Defintely had Kubric's smell to it (not big fan of his stuff), but that wasn't the problem -- just a boring, waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I is not really a movie about artificial intelligence in my opinion. Not only does it leave much to be explained, one sequence within the movie does not necessarily follow logically from the preceding one. I don't feel as though I have learned anything substantial about human nature after seeing A.I. There is very little that is original about the movie.Basically, I thought they designed an overly maudlin piece of work and covered it with a fake scientific mask designed to lure people with a true interest in A.I. into the theatre. Instead, all the movie should get is people that relish seeing overly emotional roles carried to the extreme. I give it a rating of one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was hands down the best movie I have ever seen. Like I said in the summary, I really don't know what to say or how to explain why it was so good but Ill give it a try. First off, the acting was incredible. Osmett, in my opinion, is the best child actor ever. Im almost afraid he wont be able to top what he did in this movie. Then again, I never thought he would top The Sixth Sense! Secondly, there were so many elements to this story you really need to watch it more than once. Narration was incredible and the vision of the future was spot on as so many futuristic movies have us living far beyond the technology that the movie dates itself in. The ending, Oh the ending! Its much like a M. Night Shyamalan film as it comes out of nowhere! I don't think anyone could honestly say thats where they thought the movie would end. On top of all this was a simple plot of an old fairy tale (or maybe "a fairies tail") that is timeless in its own right. This movie can be seen by the whole family or at least by those children who can put it all together. Call me crazy but I made a point to read Pinocchio to my kids again, knowing they may watch this movie later on and understand it as I did! A must see, and then see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, John Williams' score is among his most impressive. I listened to it on CD for three weeks before seeing the movie, and thought it was fantastic, but once the movie started rolling I completely forgot about the music. That says a lot about both the score and the film itself. I also liked the three-act structure, in which the tone and feel of the movie changes drastically as the story progresses. Part one, as one reviewer noted, feels like a cross between E.T. and The Shining, an odd, but very effective combination. The second part of the movie is awash with Spielbergian imagery, but with the darkness and coldness of a Kubrick movie. And the last part is a head-scratcher that has the intellectual resonance of most Kubrick-films, and the emotional tone of something like Cinema Paradiso. I purposely refrain from saying that it is as emotional as Spielberg-films, because I think the director's complexities, the dark aspects of his style, and the occasional subtleties of his work are often overlooked by critics.It's difficult to discuss the themes of the movie without spoiling it, but while many people criticised the movie from having several false endings, I felt that each continuation added layers of though and complexities that the movie would have lacked had it ended sooner. I have come to the conclusion, over the past months, that I do love the movie and that it is my favourite film of 2001, even ahead of The Fellowship of The Ring and Amelie. In other words, buy it on DVD, it's more than worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Genuine Examination Of Intelligence And The Soul Of Thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>to be perfectly honest, sci-fi is hardly my favorite genre. usually i find the sci-fi genre trite, predictable and overwrought. especially these days when the sci-fi channel has reduced the genre to cheaper by the dozen commonness. i mean there are so many sci-fi films these days. most of it a pseudo masquerade of science speculation.i do think, however, that when science fiction is good it can be the most arresting and challenging of thought provoking cinema. i have a sort of trinity as my favorite science fiction cinema. my three favorite science fiction film are, '2001', 'Clockwork Orange' and this film 'AI'. oddly Kubrick was responsible and involved in all these projects. but that wasn't the criteria. it is the content of the films themselves. even if Kubrick wasn't involved i would have chosen these films simply based on what they are about and represent. i consider these three films to be the top of the genre. the only sci-fi that even compares are films like the original 'Andromeda Strain', 'Fahrenhiet 451', 'Apollo 13', or the 70's classic 'Silent Running'.Steven Spielberg can often be hit or miss. he gives us mawkish, sentimental schmaltz like the babyish 'ET' or the lackluster and cloying 'Close Encounters', or worse, like the idiotic 'Minority Report'. he also gives us sci-fi brilliance like the on mark adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel 'War of the Worlds' and this film, 'AI'. 'AI' is such deeply thoughtful science fiction that you sort of wonder what could have possibly gone wrong with his earlier science fiction works. every thing here is not only conceived with intelligence and true scientific speculation, but he is completely in control as a filmmaker and writer. i guess Speiberg is just sort of unpredictable because he is simply human and flawed. ain't we all.most sci-fi, especially these days on sci-fi channels, can be aggrandized silly fantasy with very little serious speculation about what real science embodies. even a fantasy writer such as Ray Bradbury felt a lot of current sci-fi was more concerned with comic book silliness than actual "science". mostly i feel the same. a lot of what you see is about some corny super hero or aliens and monsters. very little seems inspired by any kind of plausible reasoning or speculation. but when it is good, sci-fi, even when currently impossible, can inspire the imagination to develop impossibilities into reality. that is why the nature of sci-fi fantasy is so crucial to development of human thought. when done right, sci-fi , even though speculative and often impossible, can stimulate the imagination to stretch itself to create science possibilities.there is so much to discuss and recommend about Speiberg's brilliant 'AI' that there isn't enough room on IMDb to give it analytical justice. not only is 'AI' probing science theory, it is also a journey of discovery into the very nature of human thought and the very nature and motivation of organic intelligence.this movie is also some of the most complete science fiction cinema ever conceived. not only does it boast some cutting, ahead of it's time CGI FX and spectacular fantasy visions, it also has a well written script and excellent acting and genuinely moving dramatic emotions.the acting is of the highest demand. Haley Joel Osment is brilliant beyond his years and not only establishes himself as one of cinema's most memorable child actors along the merits of Shirley Temple, Jodie Foster and Tatum O'Neal, he might possibly have given cinema one of it's best performances period. i always thought the rugrat was pretty impressive in the excellent 'Sixth Sense', but this film most definitely cements it. Jude Law also gives a beautifully well thought performance as a cybernetic gigolo.this film is not just simple pure gold, it's essential to the development of science thought, ethical reasoning, and to the human race in general. unless you have seen 'AI' and given it serious consideration, you can't possibly progress your human experience. it could be one of the most relevant human experiences outside of religious thought. i just can't believe sometimes that a good majority of people can't see or access the importance of this film.the parallels this film makes with the 'Pinocchio' story are profoundly disturbing and often nightmarish, but keenly insightful connections and appropriately analogous. this is in fact somewhat of a 'Pinocchio' fable but without Collodi's demeaning, moralizing judgments. William Hurt is even on hand as a sort of tortured Geppetto figure desperately wishing his creation life and humanness.in fact, this film tackles the folly of moralizing judgment as witnessed in the bitter displacement of organic, human beings who wage a sort of class warfare at the expense of hapless cybernetics in the horrifying 'Flesh Fair' sequence which indicts human cruelty and the essence of scape goating blame. a very human response and emotion when helpless.look, i'm not saying that actual artificial intelligence is any more possible than hovercraft vehicles, warp speed, time travel, or any other of the impossibilities explored in science fiction films, but as in the case of '2001' and it's intelligent computer system 'HAL', it's speculation that warrants consideration.if anyone reads this review and has not experienced this important and poignant cinema masterwork of analysis of the condition of existence, i suggest you see it for the sake of your very humanity. it's a imperative fictional experience that can prove to be quite rewarding. you may in fact, get a minor glimpse into the mind of God and the explanation of existence. let this film guide you to conscious enlightenment. and yes, i'm completely serious.</fullReview>

Don't ever think this is a Fiction..... Guys this is in fact NOT a complete fiction , Its like they were SO good in fiction they proved it. BUT this movies actually drives to LOVE(see the first scene when he says that we are trying to make a baby who LOVES)..... and remember the lady asked about response of human being?...... Well this is clearly addressing that movie is not going to be a master piece of Science or ROBOTS...... its going to turn away to something ELSE........ and it proved it . and it really really did nice.I also like to say that people will start judging this movie in 10-20 years.

		<fullReview>Rather than rehash what an ingeniously well-crafted masterpiece this film is, I'm going to talk about what was most poignant for me. Parallel, distributed and Quantum computer designs will one day give machines the neural horsepower necessary to replicate human behavior, so well in fact as to be indiscernible via telephone. Advances in medical research will someday map the human brain in addition to the genome. Linguists collaborating with programmers with find a way to describe our world to the machine. Robotics will give them our form with the letters SONY embossed on their backsides. Face it folks, evolution is about to merge with Moore's Law. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the emotional interplay between David and Monica, my intellect has to deem the relationship superfluous, necessary to sell tickets via mass appeal. I don't believe that artificial intelligence once it is achieved will choose to adhere to the limited model of human emotions. Machine emotions will be developed according to a different environment than ours. Unlike mammalia that experience the world with only a single brain, the machine will have both one and many. Perhaps they will find it necessary to design a new language describing their world to us, that is, if they deem us necessary at all.I also liked the way the film broaches the legal aspects of machines in society. Best to put laws on the books before an uprising, a machine bill of rights if you will. It would be foolhardy to neglect anticipating this most momentous of possibilities, the Internet being a prime example. Could we really survive artificial discontent? Integration is always better than opposition. Ethics should be discussed before and not after.Finally the saddest point of the movie was the most likely future outcome, we will destroy ourselves with technology before it has a chance to save us.</fullReview>

I'm sure they can just whip up another gazillion-dollar robot in a jiffy.And yes -- one can overlook lapses in logic if the movie has something else to offer, but sadly this one does not. Pokey plot. Bad acting. Uncompelling characterizations. And the fact that Osmet and Law are playing robots doesn't excuse the fact that they are dead on arrival character-wise. Heck, R2D2 was able to exude more personality, humor, and empathy with a few beeps and whirs. At least Osmet and Law are actual human beings. Oh, and don't get me started on the goofy ending(s).......Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a poor misguided attempt at a futuristic fairy-tale. Unfortunately, this movie drags on and on, and never seems to pick up. I sat in the movie theater for three hours waiting for something, no, anything to happen - I was disappointed. The only thing that prevented me from leaving is that I paid for two adult admissions and hoped that I might get my money's worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed at such a waste of talents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg really proved his fallibility with this under-edited mish-mash of ideas. Were this a work of a novice director I would be just as incensed at wasting eight bucks to see a film so poorly written, but from an experienced director its all the more insulting. And mystifying. The central problem here is the film can never quite figure out its target audience. The first half is an intelligent, thought-provoking treatment geared towards adults and succeeds as a movie rather well. Then it takes an abrupt turn into territory so ridiculous, juvenile, and childish that it would take an infant's mind to be moved by or interested in such Disney-esque material. (Disneyish in its fanciful, nonrealistic themes, but without the quality or ageless appeal of some Disney works.) And in all honesty most children would probably still see through and be insulted by the relentless manipulation tactics! Nor would even they likely care about these bizarre and wholly unnecessary plot "developments" (one ending after another, tacked on and on for no imaginable purpose, each worse than the last!)I LIKE (no, often LOVE) many very long films. And I love complex, disturbing, thought-provoking or controversial ones that truly challenge the audience and demand a certain level of intelligence to fully appreciate. Problem is, THIS WASN'T ONE OF THOSE! Its just a uncongealed mess of too many ideas on the many ways this premise could be handled. And then every one was went with. And none of it was edited out.*Spoiler alert!!*What the heck was the deal with the whole ending bit with the one final day with his mom? Not only was this plot-wise a complete sellout for the rest of the film (Spielberg just HAD to slap on a 'happy ending'), but am I the only one who found its treatment and handling to be EXTREMELY DISTURBING?! It all just emphasized the already present (if a bit understated to that point) truly bizarre, unsettling tone that Sigmund Freud would definitely have had a field day with! Suddenly it felt more like a creepy remake of Psycho, with the audience expected to cheer the "wonderfully warm and beautiful" relationship of Haley Joel Osment's 'Norman Bates' to his mother! It was utterly creepy, rather nauseating, and unbelievably ham-handed/over-done in execution at that! I mean I felt like at any moment some gross incestuous love scene was about to erupt! Speilberg was just trying to portray a healthy mother-sun relationship but failed miserably and just gave me the creeps!Just a few of a thousand plot-holes and complaints: I guess aliens from a distant galaxy 2000 years from now will, oddly enough, be speaking with British accents! Who knew.Amazing that in 2 millennia of being underwater or frozen solid, not a single diode or bit of circuitry would malfunction or experience the slightest damage. Wow, they really build those Mecha to last!For an "outdated" SuperToy that Teddy sure got given a better set of programs for intelligence, processing info, understanding the world, morality, etc! Lucky for David he has him to follow around.Was a gratuitous trip to Vegas-y Sleaze-City really necessary? Its not that it was offensive, just stupid. And in the same film that goes all Jiminy Cricket-y in a whole fanciful, juvenile, fairy tale ending? (Seems the flashy effects were the only point of this part. And effects are no substitute for a plausible, intelligent plotline!) Ditto for the gratuitously violent WCW-style Flesh Fair scene. At least that was important to the plot, and believable (unfortunately, all too much so.)Many reviewers seem to miss the point of David's attempted suicide. (Where the whole thing should rightfully have ended!!) It was ultimately not out of grief, but an act of selflessness because unless he destroyed himself and proved his technology (his unique love-program) to be an utter failure, it would be installed in the helpless myriad Davids and Darlenes -- his 'sibling' bots all doomed to go through his unquenchable pain at not receiving the love of their parents.Or at least thats what he could have presented it more clearly as. But no, Spielberg (or Kubrick) preferred to toss that aside by having David mope "mommy" yet one more repetitive time and then write himself into a corner so badly it took 2000 years and some aliens to come along and help him out (by making it go absurd!)If he did have to keep going after the leap, he should have had David be smashed by the falling ferris wheel and put out of his misery. Or the whole ridiculous Blue Fairy element left out altogether!! What a waste of the undeniable acting talents of Osment and Law (totally undeveloped character!). And of the audience's time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly The Most Moving Sci-Fi Tale Of All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Artificial Intelligence: Starring Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, William Hurt, Sam Robards, Jake Thomas, Frances O'Connor, Director, Stephen Spieldberg, Writer Stanely Kubrick, 2001 A.I. was released in the summer of 2001. That pivotal year would see the unforgettable atrocity of 9/11 and a country headed for war. It was all the more appropriate that this emotional, human story appeared on the big screen. Based on sci-fi writer Brian Aldiss' short novel "Super Toys Last All Summer Long", its adaptation into film was the concept of famous director Stanely Kubrick (2001 Space Odyssey) who called dibbs to this project but died shortly after directing Eyes Wide Shut in 1999. This film is truly poignant and heart-felt, with a strong, human message concerning the power of love. The cinematography is stunning as we are transported to a world of the future where robots and humans live side by side. It looks frighteningly like cloning sometimes and so this film's premise about the replacement of a son is not too far-fetched. There are echoes of Spieldbergs' classic E.T. and Empire of the Sun. Haley Joel Osment plays David a mechanical child custom made by an experimental Professor (William Hurt) to think and feel as human as possible. Henry and Monica, his adopted parents, nearly lose their biological son Martin in an accident. Henry decides to replace the son with this mecha but Martin recovers and the two must now live as siblings. Conflict ensues as Martin grows to hate the brother and becomes deeply jealous of his mother's affections for him. He manipulates things so that Monica can turn against David and she is left with no choice but to abandon him out in the woods, his only companion another mechanical toy bear Teddy. The story becomes more and more about the search for happiness (the quest of all humans) when David, inspired by the fairy tale Pinnochio which Monica read to him every night, goes out in search of the Blue Fairy. Jude Law plays Joe, a lovable robotic male prostitute who attempts to help the boy on his quest. Guest star voices include Robin Williams as Dr. Know, a computer system who knows everything about everything, quotes from a 19th century poem "Come Away, O Fairy Child To The Ends Of The Earth Where The Lions Weep, For The World Is Full Of More Sorrow Than You Will Ever Know.."...and the voice of Chris Rock (briefly in the Flesh Flair scene as his mecha is loaded into a cannon). Things end tragically for David, as he commits suicide and is encased in ice under water, praying fervently that his Blue Fairy will grant his wish. It does end up coming true as eons later, when the world has been damaged by polar ice caps melting, aliens visit the ruined earth and discover the only link to humanity. David is now the only true human, the only thing left that is good and pure in humanity. The aliens tap into his memories and grant his wish. Monica, his mother, returns for one day to accep him as her only child, for one eternally long day. Then they both fall asleep into non-existence. This is a bittersweet film, full of dark and light. Quite seriously, it should have won an Oscar for Best Picture. It's far more than a science-fiction tale. It was my pick for the best film of that year and one of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive A.I. review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of Steven Spielberg delivering Stanley Kubrick's long in gestation epic A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) was always going to result in an odd hybrid of a movie. But at its core, A.I. delivers both the warmness of a Spielberg film, and just the right amount of Kubrickian detachment to make the story work. The film expertly sets up the theme of Robotic rebellion and their lack of understanding with the first scene, showing professor Hobby (William Hurt) conducting a talk about the creation of artificial life, after pricking a `mecha' with a pin, professor Hobby asks the machine how she feels about what has just happened. The machine is polite and accommodating, not really sure of what is going on, when Hobby speaks of love, the machine can only translate the intimacy of love, not the act it's self. This then leads us to the introduction of David (Osment), the first robot boy, capable of expressing the love of a real child. The first act now begins and we see David slowly inducted into the Swinton family, originally a replacement for their real son, who languishes in cryogenics until a cure for his illness can be found. But once the son is fit to come home, the Swinton's are faced with the problem of having two children, both fighting over the attention of their mother, one blinded by jealousy, the other blinded by love. Once the mother has abandoned David in the words, the film moves into act two, in which the brightness and optimism of act one slowly becomes a darker and more mechanical pessimism. The climax of act one shows us that it is human error that is causing the problems in society, whereas the parents abandon David because of his failings, because he is a robot, the robots continue the function, because they are programmed to regardless of what happens. It is from this that the Pinocchio quest begins, and Spielberg expertly draws parallels with the story of the wooden boy searching for the blue fairy to make him real, with the story of a Robotic boy trapped in the same situation. This also helps set up the conscience of the film, in the character of Teddy, a supper toy. It's no surprise that Spielberg (and Kubrick) decided on the Pinocchio element, because David is programmed to think like a child, and it is only natural that he would identify his very real situation with something more aching to fantasy, something that Freud believed in strongly. Children watch cartoons and read fairytales because they give the child hope; it's also a way of telling very dark stories in a lighter way. The use of Pinocchio is a clever devise as the story is really a metaphor for coming of age, and loss of innocence, which is what is at the forefront of A.I. This loss of innocence also sets up the character of Gigolo Joe (Law), a pleasure robot who joins David on his quest, a character who fills David in on the ways of Human law and their feelings about robot kind. When Joe and David find themselves rounded up at the flesh fair, act two takes on a much darker tone. It is here that we get the first look at human error in its fullest form, as robots are slaughtered for the entertainment of humans. It is only after one human believes David to be a real boy that pandemonium breaks out, the message being that the humans are only interested in their own kind. As David and Joe quest to Rouge City to find the blue fairy, the origins of David become more clear, and it is only when we begin to make sense of the whole situation that the film spirals into a third act that comes right out of nowhere.David, with the knowledge that he is not the original he thought he was, lies at the bottom of the ocean for two thousand years, his blue fairy a statue at a fairytale amusement park, flooded like the rest of Manhattan. It is here that Spielberg's film takes a bizarre turn that it almost doesn't recover from. The sight of the alien beings subtracts the humanity of David's quest, taking away the humanity he had developed over the course of the film. This is also the part of the film that is so obviously trying to be 2001: A Space Odyssey, as the aliens recreate David's adopted home, and give him the chance to see his mother once again is almost like Bowman travelling through the star gate and finding himself in the huge house. But it is from this that we must remember that David is a child, that one day with his mother is worth more than anything else to him, and it is also important to think of the possibility that the entire third act could be taking place in David's imagination, as he lies at the bottom of the ocean, slowly shutting down due to the harsh conditions. This would explain the almost fairytale reprise of the narrator (Ben Kingsley), and the strong sentiment of David's perfect day. A lot of people have expressed great hatred to this ending, words like schmaltzy and copout have been thrown around, and it only highlights a noticeable parallel between them, and the humans of A.I., have audiences become so nihilistic that they root for a child (admittedly a robotic child) to be destroyed, and to have his wish go unfulfilled. The ending of the film beautifully nurtures the notion of undying, unconditional love between parent and child, as David's dream of a lifetime with his mother has been granted, even if it means he must lay in the bed for another two-thousand years. A.I. may be an odd hybrid, and it may not have been the film that Kubrick envisioned, but it is definitely a greatly underrated film that has been criticized by talent-less critics who have no real ammo to back up their argument.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A schizophrenic film that ends up being an OK mixed bag with a terrible ending (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the future robots have been developed to become normal and fully fitted with normal society, but the next step is to produce a robotic child ? one that can love a parent with a real and intense love. The prototype is David, who is taken in by Henry Swinton in an attempt to win back his wife who is trapped in an emotional limbo of semi-mourning for her own child, Martin, who has been in a coma for many years. Monica eventually warms to David and he becomes part of the family, even when Martin recovers and returns home. When Martin 's influence causes David to behave erratically, Monica decides to abandon him rather than have him destroyed ? putting David on a quest to become a real boy and win her love.At its best this is a thoughtful and interesting look at the morals of artificial intelligence; at its worst it is an indulgent piece of sentiment that would rather spoil the film than have an open ending. The most interesting sections are early on when the real human part of the story is told. In this section we see grief, acceptance, fear and the disposability of these new "people". We also see the desire to be human in David and, although it is a theme we have seen many times in other films, it is one that is still interesting here. So far so good, and I was ready to dismiss the opinions of those that dislike this film, however then the film started a slight slide that would turn into a car crash. The story then becomes less about exploring the emotions of the characters and more about a Wizard of Oz/Pinocchio style journey that is about the new world that this story is taking place in. It is interesting enough and looks great but it never really gets beyond superficial stuff and it never seems set in any sort of reality (something the first section had managed to do). However it still just about works and had a great ending where David sits at the bottom of the Ocean with the quality that makes him closest to humans ? hope.The problem is, the film doesn't end there. It jumps thousands of years into the future, brings in a war between robots and men, the fall of man, futuristic robots and cloning all for the sole reason of producing a horribly sentimental "happy" ending where an open one would have been much better. I'm not going to moan about how Kubrick would have made it much better (he made bad films too you know) but this ending is pure Spielberg and it is about as bad as I've seen his schmaltz get. It is a real shame because, for all its flaws, it had actually been OK up till this final section, even if it could have been darker and more interesting. The cast are more than up to the task if only the material had been better. Osment is great here and it is a real shame that he doesn't have more time to work into his character. Likewise O'Connor is interesting but ultimately just forgotten by the script. Law is OK but only a plot device; meanwhile support is passable but poorly used in the form of Hurt and Robards. Visually the film looks great; plenty of imagination in many forms ? be it the hellish red light district or the simple pleasures of Teddy, it is only a shame that the film never gives the brain as much to do as it does the eyes.Overall this is an OK film ? neither as good nor as bad as many people say. It starts out with plenty of interesting ideas but then shelves them for a bit of a Wizard of Oz story, that gradually brings the ideas back in with it. Sadly the film is dragged down a considerable way by a final twenty minutes that are unnecessary, sentimental and almost unwatchable. Despite the very sour taste this leaves, the majority of the film is actually OK but it is hard to watch it and think about what it really could have been if it had met its potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps one of the worst films of the decade. A childless couple adopts a robot child who wishes to be loved as a real child. When the couple has a child of their own the robot (Osment) is forgotten and discarded. On his own he is led on a series of adventures. At this point the story should have ended. From this point on the movie felt like it would never end. Just as you think the robot's "life" is to end, another glimmer of hope that he'll have his wish to be with his "mother" again. We even get to watch an entire actual ice age take place, talk about boring! I beg you do not watch this movie uless you like wasting your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) is one of the greatest science fiction movie that I've ever seen.As the title of the film, the story is about technological advances in robotics: People have created a robotic with feelings, almost human; his name is David.So, "If a robot could genuinely love a person what responsibility does the person hold toward that robot in return? With those two elements: robotics and a moral question, Steven Spielberg creates an extraordinary film. In the beginning David is collocated into a family. In his new home, David starts to be human and the love for his mom (Monica) but after the return of her real son, the presence of David is not convenient and therefore he should have to strive for his biggest dream: to be a real boy. In general, that is the principal topic but at the same time, we could fine more like global warming, the future roll of robotics in people's lives and human values. You have to see this movie, the actors are so good, especially Haley Joel Osment (David) because at first he is a genuine robot and along the film he is a genuine child. The environment is well recreated and of course, the director is extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Switch to a preferable pace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg's new movies made him somehow more respectable for me?we are spared the gags?pace of the Indiana/Back ?/Jurassic ? days ?--the gag?metronome .I must say I abhor that syncopated artificial pace that one finds in Lucas' phony sagas as well. Spielberg's new films are also machineries?but ,as such,better machineries than the ones he used to made.I have noticed that the movie buff Edward Peters does not include any of these new releases in his list of the best ten Spielberg films (in fact,'93 is the year of the newest film included there).Once he renounced that stupid charm?less pace of his previous films, he seems to have been abandoned by at least a part of the older guard. The lack of the gag?metronome does not,of course,entitle his new films to any artistic pretensions. He was,in the '70s and '80s,together with Lucas (and ,later, Zemeckis), the predecessor and forbearer of the artificial trend in the adventure movies?trend that came to prevail in the '90s.Anyway,as I said, Spielberg and Lucas are the main responsible for this zany look of almost all the adventure movies of the last two decades. Somehow they devitalized the genre?inflating it with a fake tendency that finished by ruining the whole. That's way most of the adventure films in the late '80s,in the '90s and nowadays are crap. Spielberg and Lucas launched the trend, they initiated this decadent fashion. Spielberg was indeed widely influential in the last 3 ? decades of the cinema?much to the commercial cinema's misfortune. In some way, him and Lucas gave the predominant postmodern trends a kind of commercial answer. Sophisticated machineries, at best, instead of the naive large toys of the previous decades.So, yeah, I credit him (and Lucas) with the ruin of the adventure cinema. A Cameron, a ? are but the pupils.No one is,I believe,eager to denounce and to blame;yet, the things with the adventure movies are such.Spielberg's movies are kindred to the artificial, synthetic materials that pollute our world.In fact,they WERE:as they grew better,or at least became less bad,with his recent achievements.From this school, Robert Zemeckis' Romancing the Stone was probably I quite funny movie;yet such a flick itself bears the more than obvious marks of its relatedness to the main current.Back to ?:some things in it are quite good,of an almost Dickensian beauty and exploitation;or, they very well could have been?with a less self?conscientious and self?important director.The Teddy toy is of great effect here?as a matter of fact,Teddy is an effect.Of course Spielberg isn't an author,in the sense Welles, Hitchcock and others are;his movies don't open into the miraculous beauty.Yet a few facts speak in his products' favor.Spielberg knows how to film children; this is obvious. He films very nicely children and toys.The scale,the inner scale of this movie,the spiral around which it is conceived,is surely the right one.You have the first ? hr. of interiors, etc.,while the scale is already set.In this,Spielberg proves better not only than ?Verhoeven (damn expectable), but also than Soderbergh.Spielberg gives some kind of dignity to the SF cinema.It boosts the notion,if I may say so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like esoteric, i really do. i like films with a hidden message, and i like something that has a point.I totally dug 2001 (both the book series and the movie).I like a lot of those offbeat styles of film that just make you think...But for the life of me, i just don't get this film.I understood the message in saying that the human race more or less holds the key to the meaning of life, but for the life of me, this movie was just one depressing faucet after another.And that is what destroyed the enjoyment.It would have been something if the ending had something definite, something concrete, or perhaps some bit of closure, but it didn't. it just ended, leaving me scratching my head going what was the point.David (the robot), never grew as a character. on one hand he was self aware, but on the other hand he just kept going on and on, never really getting it. he was never going to be a real boy, and his mother is quite decomposed, and while the the future robots could bring her back, it would only be for one day, and then she would never ever return.So you as the viewer knows, that once that day is over, and she "dies" again, then David will wake up whining about how he wants his mother back and that he is unique and special and bla bla bla bla bla.Throughout the movie, it was on one track of the same thing, and he just never got it, and he never will get it.The movie was doing all right and it did look as if it might has some sort of resolution or something, until for no apparent reason we are fast forwarded 2000 years into the future where humans no longer exists. and the future robots just want David to be happy cause he is the only thing in existence that ever knew real humans...The acting was fine, so there are no complaints in that departmentThe honest assessment is this; it is a tragic movie that will leave you feeling depressed and sad. it has no real ending, and the point is somewhat lost in it's tragic moment after another.Simply put, it's emo...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie 5 days ago and I'm just now starting to get out of my depression. First of all, the mother's actions bothered me. Maybe the writers want us to believe that future man will have no human attributes, just self-centered and callous. Maybe that's what happens when the world floods over, millions of people perish and then we won't care about anything but ourselves. The robot inventor is also selfish. I was hoping there would be more interaction between him and David. But nothing and I think that was a bad idea. I thought it ended and then it kept going--I was quite confused. I am a sentimental person when it comes to movie endings but this time I deeply cried and then became depressed. I couldn't understand why but now I know it was because I had no answers to some questions the movie posed and then the idea of the end of our world and the new alien looking mechas lasting is depressing.I don't think Kubrick would have liked this movie. I wish he could have directed it. Spielberg destroyed this story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Labours of love don't get any more poetic than Steven Spielberg's flawed masterpiece 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence'. Part science fiction, part fairy tale, AI takes us on a fantastical journey across a bleak yet hauntingly beautiful futuristic landscape, where robots are created with an uncanny ability to mimic human emotions -- including that most contentious of feelings, love. The movie polarised audiences upon its releases, with many people seeing the film as a disjointed mix of Spielbergian schmaltz and Kubrickian stoicism (Spielberg directed the film based on a concept he developed with the late Stanley Kubrick). But despite all its shortcomings, including a tacked-on second ending, AI remains a near-perfect piece of cinema, a thought-provoking work that is a must-watch for any filmmaker worth his salt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>flawed masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film about a dozen times and will probably see it a dozen times more. I consider it a flawed masterpiece but I understand why many people detest it. It is surely the most sentimental film that has ever been made about a robot. (Though it is the product of a posthumous collaboration between Spielberg and Kubrick it often seems to embody the spirit of that unashamed sentimentalist Ray Bradbury.) There is so much to appreciate -- beginning with one of the most amazing performances by a young actor in the history of film -- that the plot and dialogue faults seem like screeches of chalk on blackboard.There are mysteries here too (mysterious at least to me) which I would dearly like to see resolved.Be warned: everything hereafter is a spoiler.Faults: we see David undergo an open-thorax operation with perfect equanimity: "It doesn't hurt", he assures his 'mother'. But a couple of scenes later when a youngster pricks him slightly with a knife (assuring him he means no harm) David freaks out and clutches his 'brother' in terror. Why? Apparently only to move the plot in the desired direction. Surely this could have been engineered in more credible fashion.The bit of doggerel that leads David back to the doctor doesn't make sense: "Come away, oh human child..." The whole point is that he is _not_ a human child, at least not yet.Why is Dr. Hobby's lab located in the sunken city rather than in the more convenient company headquarters in New Jersey? Why does Hobby leave David alone after having shattered his illusions? Again, apparently just to make the plot move in the desired direction. This seems to me to be clumsy, even lazy scripting.The police follow the stolen amphibicopter, pluck Gigolo Joe into the sky -- and just ignore the multi-million-dollar piece of hardware that then carries David on his short trip to Coney Island where he sits for 2000 years. Don't these vehicles have location devices? What ever happened to sonar? Both the government and the corporation would possess ample resources and motivation to search and recover the errant machines. The film provides no explanation as to why they didn't.Just before the final scene David and we are subjected to a long-winded and implausible explication of the quirks of the space-time continuum that will limit the duration of his reunion. This slows down the action at the worst possible time. The Blue Fairy could simply have told him that the event could only last a day, period. It wasn't necessary to give him or us a course in fantasy physics.In addition to these glaring faults (and perhaps others I have missed) there are some puzzles that I would very much like to see cleared up. If Mr. Spielberg happens to read this I would appreciate his doing so. If not, I would be interested in others' considered opinions on the following: when David is staggering in growing despair between the panels of Davids and Darlenes, one of the panels suddenly moves. Is another David coming to life behind it? If so why do we not see him? If not then what is happening? When David later awakes in the familiar surroundings of his home the scene is quite deliberately made unreal. The colors are garish, the scene is blurry. The whole effect is exactly that of an old piece of film that has lain for many years until the colors have begun to go bad. But as soon as he moves into the room with the Blue Fairy, the film comes into focus and the colors become more natural. What is Spielberg trying to tell us? Is the whole event happening in David's head? If so why are the 'aliens' (or millennial robots) depicted observing the event from a balcony? The final scene of course recalls the ending of '2001' but is if anything more obscure than its famous predecessor. (At least part of it seems to be a mental rather than a real event: that big moon scurries offstage in most unrealistic fashion.) Does David really sleep? Really dream? Does he too die or is his sleep the beginning of something truly new? (Is his name a mere coincidence? He could have been Tommy or Dickie or even little Harry.) Could it be that he is forging in the smithy of his digital soul the uncreated conscience of a new robotic race? In short, what is going on here? If anyone here knows the answers, please set them out for those such as I who are too literal-minded to grasp it on our own. And could you email me a copy to ensure I don't miss it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit incoherent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a fan of special effects, this movie is for you -- the visuals are very exciting. Unfortunately, the story line is a bit of a cut-and-paste job. It begins as a somewhat creepy sci-fi thriller, reminiscent of the most recent version of the TV series, "The Outer Limits." In this mode, it begins to gather interest, particularly due to the fine acting job by Frances O'Connor as the mother who begins to develop maternal feelings for the youthful android, against her better judgment. But then, rather abruptly, the whole mood of the picture shifts, after Mom casts the android kid out into the world. The movie turns into one of those exploration-of-a-macabre-future flicks, sort of in the "Blade Runner" genre, then veers into sort of a "Wizard of Oz"/Firesign Theatre hybrid with the "Dr. Know" sequence. Then, with another abrupt break in the continuity of mood, it goes into a quasi-mystical riff -- like the end of "2001," where the plot line suddenly gives way to some hippy-dippy philosophizing. I guess this is the tribute to Kubrick. I mean, a 2000-year leap in the continuity of the story is somewhat larger than average. The ending sequence, which is supposed to be a psychologically insightful look at love between android and human, fails, particularly in comparison with "Blade Runner" which finds far more nuance and believability in the same subject matter.</fullReview>

I know that sounds sentimental, but as perception is all, I will ask Messrs Kubrick and Spielberg, geniuses that they are, the honour of indulging me in the idea that David isn't just a robot, but a metaphor for all of us who seek to have one extra day with our mothers. Very few of us would not wish for it. This is a magical movie. It is a shame that so many fastidious movie goers analyse it so much. "It's a Wonderful Life" never got so analysed :-)</fullReview>

So the ending could have been just a lie.So could other events in the movie.I now think Kubrick would have come up with this ending.The philosophical questions this movie poses are the most important and interesting parts of it.This movie was underrated and so was 2001 when it was first released.So this movie is definitely going to go up the charts in the future.

		<fullReview>Like a best friend, this story grows on you (well, me anyway); after three viewings it has grown from good, to great, to masterpiece. Much of the subtlety was lost on the initial pass, in no small part to the association, and inevitable expectations, with it being a so-called summer blockbuster - i.e. tall, dumb and handsome. The story is indeed tall, if not deep, and hits very close to home concerning our relationship to the inanimate world we find ourselves in. And as with any film directed by Spielberg, it is visually stunning and consists of a series of arresting images that often times speak much louder than the dialogue, plot or story. Many will find the ending a "downer;" but in looking a bit deeper, it becomes obvious that to live ones life with such high ideals and expectations and tenacity is a rare and precious life indeed, and message well worth repeating for all to contemplate.This one WILL survive the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a rare thing when cinema provides you with as deep a message as A.I. does. It is rarer still when a film can cause you to stop and reflect on such questions as the nature of what it is to be "alive." In most cases when a question of this magnitude comes along, the filmmakers will opt to come at the question from an angle, or mask the complexities of the question with slapstick antics so that the question itself becomes obfuscated within the ever growing so-called plot (consider such films as "Short Circuit" and "Electric Dreams").A.I. does not come at these (and many other) questions from an angle: it confronts them head-on.A.I. does not mask the fact that it is delving into such philosophical territory with silly antics and slapstick comedy: it looks the questions in the eye and demands an answer that it knows cannot come in any objective form. In other words, this is not a shy film. It is bold and a real achievement in movie-making and story-telling. I have to say that I really enjoyed the film -- not only as a medium of entertainment, but as a springboard of some very satisfying debate and conversation with my friends and family. But we all agree on one thing: the film ended about 5-10 minutes too late.The final sequences of David's life were counterproductive to the messages and feel of the film. They felt tacked on, and artificial. The film should really have ended with David under the water, praying (chanting?) to the image he had been seeking for so long. It would have left the film on a poignant and important note. Everything that follows, to be honest, is second rate (and detracts from an otherwise perfect movie).</fullReview>

The second time I saw it I was at home. I watched the movie with my grandmother. She is very sensitive by nature and she cried a lot while we watched A.I. Finally, I think that the movie is a masterpiece of the fiction genre. If you like a deep drama movies, you'd better take a deep breath and go watch the movie. I promise you won't be sorry.

		<shortDescription>Light entertainment that is more of a children's film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all like to take a trip into someone's prediction of the future. Over the last couple of decades, films set in the unknown that lays ahead for mankind have become common releases. "A.I." dabbles in giving us a glimpse, but overall, the premise of the story is about a boy (who is actually a robot) who wants to be loved by his mother, a primal instinct for human beings.Haley Joel Osment plays that boy, David, who becomes a part of a family that wants to replace their own son, who is in a coma. But when the son comes to, and the original family unit is back in place, there is no room for David, and he is forced out into the harsh future world we can only hope doesn't become a reality. He meets Jude Law's Joel, a robot programmed to be an amicable and pleasurable sex partner to women customers. David tells Joel of his need to become a real boy so that his mother will love him and take him back, and they embark on a journey to get David's wish granted. Sounds like a fairy tale you know? Well, A.I. actually recognizes the connections it has with the story of Pinocchio, incorporating them into the film.What Steven Spielberg attempts to do in this film is to get the audience relating to the need for affection that David has, however we get too distracted by the futuristic setting, and the emotional intensity does not sink in, resulting in the film becoming nothing more than light entertainment. Also, the story tends to suddenly shift for the last half an hour, as if the film was taken over by a different director for a sequel. I was quite happy to leave David on the bottom of the ocean with a flooded New York, forever wishing his wish to the blue fairy, expecting to be doing so when we came to this scene.The film lacked depth, and would be more suited to a children's audience if it wasn't for the sexual concepts in the city scenes. Jude Law was not the best choice of actor to play the man of women's dreams, and his English accent also put off the continuity ? then again, maybe some girls like English accents, who knows? In the end, I thought the inclusion of alien life form was unnecessary and took away any dignity the film had. Spielberg has impressed me before with mixing human emotion with fantastic tales, but this one just didn't seem like the right amount of each ingredient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A groundbreaking film, easily misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its good to see that a film in modern times is more than simply special effects and cheap thrills. And many people who have seen this film, and have commented on it, give it a warranted review of mixed emotions. Some people hate it, and others find it remarkable.For those who Hate the movie A.I.:Have you ever wondered if your life is an endless menagerie within an empty suit? Has the physical reality of your own existence become so intoxicating that all the soul and depth of life in your world been drained into an ego-driven Fantasy Island Delta? Or do you live on an island of splendid Artificial Intelligence? This movie is certainly not a James Bond "Thrill-per-minute" concoction of mindless explosions. Its not just a fantasy island, a manufactured cookie, a digital playground, a mechanical companion or a cheap orgasm. At the same time, Artificial Intelligence (the film) is an exploration of mankind's deepest desire to discover what it means to be human, and what it requires to give life itself humanity (i.e. love). It explores this topic (ironically) through a character (a small child robot), who is programmed to love but can't ever know what it really means to be human, and by his own mechanical obsession finds himself to search out and transcend human existence. Over the years (Stanley Kubrick, and) others have touched upon similar Sci-Fi subject lines, including within Star Trek, and even parts of 2001 Space Odessey. Never before has a film of this type ever achieved to make such a deep emotional and broad sweeping impact as this one. Even though the film (in general) is very slow at times, and intentionally (sometimes painfully) artificial in its presentation, the message of this film is very compelling and visceral. Parts of this film are very depressing and sad, and the saddest parts of the film include commentary on the modern debasement of humanity by humanity itself, and humanity's own apathy and lack of foresight regarding human intellectual, scientific and personal development. By the end of the film we find the characters (Two Robots) to have the only real humanity left in existence--more human than human! With the above being said, I have to admit that parts of the film and its depiction of a future underwater world, and its premises regarding the context of environmental disasters are purely based on contrived science and conjecture--Its all Lib-wacko vomit and is highly trite and not very interesting, even though It makes for stunning special effects. I understand that most people can't or wont find a film like this very entertaining, but I don't believe it was made to be entertaining--simply thought provoking and compelling on a highly visceral level. I encourage everyone who only gave this film a superficial chance, to re-rent it and start paying closer attention. On top of it being a well crafted and visually beautiful film (despite its occasional triteness), the depth of its message transcends this film to one of monument,on the level of 2001 Space Odessey, Wizard of Oz, Bladerunner with a hint of Metropolis.I predict that history will find A.I. to be one of the milestone films of this next century. Speilburg truly deserved an award for this one, but then again, the way the Film Academy's favor candy and cleavage over substance and depth, and with all the emotionally charged reactions about it, that in itself should provide a Master Filmmaker his satisfaction.</fullReview>

Spielberg has done a lot of good stuff over the years (the only film of his which I disapproved of was 'Hook'), and this one is no exception. Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law take the acting honors here, as their portrayals of robots who can love (or be lovers) make you, even though the characters are not real, feel for them. This movie also has some of the best special effects I've ever seen, and one of my favorite characters is Teddy (voice of Jack Angel), the robotic bear that David (Osment) takes on his journey. Overall, this is a stunning and provocative film, filled with ideas. I've heard some debating about the ending; personally, I liked the ending. Overall, this is a masterpiece. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>almost 2000 comments on this movie here in the IMDB. Yes robots, their acceptance and all the philosophical questions involving emotions and especially love is a very important issue. I just saw the film on video and tried to be as unbiased as possible - even though I read lots of articles and Roger Ebert's review before.It is in the very nature of this film to be incomplete. It deals with deeply philosophical matters that simply cannot be answered, neither by any living human being, nor by a movie.Hal 9000 for exampole, from Kubrick's 2001, a space Oddyssey "enjoyed working with humans". Did he, or was he programmed to say that?Roger Ebert says that our responsibility towards a "loving" robot is none, because it's just a machine. The love is just in our heads. Please allow me to say that our hole lives are just in our heads. We will never know the true nature of anything. We only know how our brain interprets it. Furthermore: In the future as described in "AI" we are talking about the Nth generation of robots. Not even their creators know every chip down to the last semiconductor. David is a machine made with the help from machines that were made with the help from machines....That means during the way, there might have been some kind of evolution we are not aware of. David is not a 19th century clockwork animated puppet, he is the product of an evolution. We humans need to pull back our ego and our desire to rule the universe and make room for the will to learn, because we even didn't get started.For some persons we humans are nothing more than David. We are biochemical machines and our emotions are caused by glands. Love is nothing but an illusion. ---of course I don't agree with these people but I respect their opinion and it proves that according so this theory we are the same as David. ............About the movie itself: I loved to see in the first part a great mixture between Kubrick and Spielberg trademark cinematography. Kubrick's wide angle lenses and Spielberg's "rays of light". Osmend is simply brilliant. The character that intrigued me even more than David was Teddy, the bear. As soon as he didn't speak with an animal voice but with a softspoken adult voice that has a deep wisdom to it, I knew, there will be a lot coming from this "supertoy" - I was right. There are two moments where he shows his extraordinary intelligence is when he warns David not to eat spinach and when he keeps the hair sample of David's "foster mom". Teddy seems to feel for David, because he's a fellow "mecca".I like the fact that no mecca is evil in this movie. Most of them seem to be in a phase just prior to "self awareness". The much discussed ending: I like it. I totally agree with the message: never give up your dreams - for we ARE our dreams. Many people will argue mentioning the "reality". But I just can answer: no one will ever know what reality is, since we only know (and live) the interpretation created by our own brains. There's no way around that.I rate this movie very high. Thanks Mr. Spielberg for loving Disney movies - and for having the guts to show it. Thanks for reading</fullReview>

Wise and compassionate and darling. I was charmed by him and the relationship to the robots. Haley was amazing as the robot who wants to be a real child. The mother and father come off as very selfish yuppies, only interested in their own needs. As with real people today who have disposible pets, they get rid of their robot when he becomes a bother. Having never been able to sit through 2001 (it is so boring), I was not expecting anything like it, so was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this whole film. Well made, has a beginning, middle and end and is coherant and some parts are beautiful. And Teddy is delightful character. I gave it 9/10.Jane</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually first saw this movie just a couple of days ago (far beyond its 2001 release), and I was totally blown away. I had read all of the "negative" comments about this movie and was quite hesitant to watch the movie. But, I finally decided to give it a chance, and I'm so very glad that I did. I think what finally provoked me to watch the movie was the fact that Stanly Kubrick was the one who wanted to bring this to the silver screen. I have always been a Kubrick fan, and a lot of Kubrick "fans" gave this film such horrible reviews. After seeing the film, I felt this was a classic Kubrick-type film. Majestic in its overall look, and an amazing storyline to go with the majestic scenary. And Spielberg added his touches in the end to cap off this amazing epic. This film is easily one of the best I have every seen. It also tugs at your heart as well, as at the end I found myself crying (and that is extremely rare for me). I highly recommend this film, and certainly don't be scared off by the length of the film. It is an amazing journey, of which you will be glad you undertook at the end of the film. This film gets a *10* from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that this movie is not for everyone. Lots of people expect films to be purely entertaining. They don't want to be "bored" with allusions to classic literature, strange new ideas, and challenging questions. But everyone has to decide for themselves what they think about a film. I suggest you see AI for yourself. If you are not a person who is into "thinking" films, or "strange" films, I suggest you skip the last half hour (it's the only thing I don't really like about the film).Still, some things are inexcusable. I cannot understand, for the life of me, how any reviewer could say Osment gave a bad performance. BAD? It was spectacular! He never blinks, he acts like a robot, but he also acts like a kid. He moves me to tears several times, and that is not easy at all. The rest of the cast, likewise, put up great performances.This is an epic film, a parallel of Pinochio (sp?), an a brave statement about the human condition and the possibilities of the future (good and bad). It's not for everyone, but you have to find out for yourself whether AI strikes a chord in you or not.My score: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the polar ice caps melt, Amsterdam, London and New York are destroyed, and living space is minimal. Because of the decreased land, food is limited, so robots are the perfect solution since they never eat or sleep. One company decides to make a child robot that can really love, simply by repeating 7 words. The first child (David) is given to a couple (Henry and Monica) who's son, Martin, has a an incurable disease and is a vegetable. All goes well, Monica gives David her son's "supertoy," Teddy. But a cure is found for Martin and he gets jealous of David. After what they think was an attempt to murder Martin, Henry orders Monica to take David back to the company, where he will be destroyed. But Monica can't, and releases David. He goes off to search for the Blue Fairy, who will, he believes, that like Pinocchio, she will turn him into a real boy, and his Mommy will love him like she loves Martin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did everyone expect too much from this film? The imagination and vision of Stanley Kubrick under the direction of Steven Spielberg, must have caused some to expect a masterpiece, a film that would surpass Blade Runner and set standards for which future science fiction films will be measured.I watched this movie with no expectations, barley knowing what the plot was and thought it was great. I'm generally not a Spielberg fan, so mabye I wasn't expecting as much as some were, but this is one of his best films to date. Every shot is important, expressing the story or mood of the characters to create an atmosphere which helps to carry the plot and is so often left out by other directors. Not much to say about the acting except that it isn't with Haley Joel Osment pulling off the role thanks mostly to Jude Law and Francis O'Connor's supporting roles. However I think that more characters could have given the film greater depth and added that something extra which it seemed to be missing at times. Reading a lot of other reviews of this film I saw some people thought there were gaps in the plot. I wouldn't agree with this. The actualy storyline never confused me, in fact it seemed to guide me through the film. Every aspect of the film wasn't fully explored however it never is in a film that is relaying mostly on imagery, for a flawless plot you have to look at films that are structured around the plot i.e. The Godfather. This film was written with imagery in mind and needed an incredibly strong story to measure up to the images we see throughout the film, especially Rouge City, which seems to take the ideas of Ridley Scott to a new level, although the influence is clearly visible. In conclusion, the film may not be as good as some expected, but if it's watched for the imagery and imagination shown I think that most will be suprised and entertained for it's duration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to think about Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoiler**In a future world where birth control is strictly enforced, says Brian Aldiss's story "Super-Toys Last All Summer Long," a childless housewife spends her day bonding with a robot programmed to act just like a little boy, complete with an oedipal crush on its "mother." Then her husband comes home with the news that he and she have been granted permission to have a "real" baby.That's a complete summary of the story. It isn't even a story, really; just a tiny conceptual vignette. Yet Spielberg's adaptation is 145 minutes long: a huge, slow, incoherent mess of a movie with loose plot ends sticking out all over and a tacked-on sentimental ending that makes no sense at all. This is a film that deserves all the disrespect it has gotten. But let's think for a moment about one tiny part that may help us understand what makes Spielberg important even when he fails.The film's opening voice-over tells us that its story takes place in a future time, after global warming has flooded the world's coastal cities. Thereafter, throughout the film's Kubrickian early scenes, we hear a continual mutter of thunder on the soundtrack, and in exterior shots the ground is always wet. Likewise, when David's mother abandons him by the side of a New Jersey road, the foliage is a rain forest right out of _Jurassic Park_. I don't think anybody on this thread has commented about those little details, and there's no reason why they should. Details are all they are: little textural elements that work on us without our conscious awareness, like John Williams' music but less obtrusively. But that, it seems to me, is what's special about Spielberg. He isn't an architect of film form, he's a couturier -- so concerned with nuance that he can't be bothered to take anything else seriously. But nuances too have their joys to contribute to the experience of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most sadly misunderstood film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* SPOILERS *The vast majority of people have misunderstood this wonderful, intelligent movie.This is a film partly about the ever-increasing anthropomorphic nature of our tools, toys and gadgets. It uses the Pinocchio story as a template and elements from Brian Aldis' bleak short-story to drive the plot.Every scene in the film raises philosophical questions about our increasing reliance on technology and the forms that technology takes. We should also be questioning our emotional reactions to each scene as we watch it. Why do we empathise with David when he is dumped in the woods, why do we empathise with Teddy when he is being taunted, why do we feel the cruelty of David's 'brother' and fear the outcome of his jealousy so intensely? These things are just machines - why should we care?The most striking moments are when the machines empathise (or would SYMpathise be more appropriate?) with each other, at the flesh-fair, Gigolo Joe helping David, Teddy protecting David...It doesn't fail to send shivers down my spine when Gigolo Joe proclaims 'They made us too good to quick'. These machines are so complex they have evolved emotional responses of their own (or at least the ability to display them as a consequence of their programming). Whether they are 'real' or not these mechanical emotions serve the purpose of ours (which are fairly mechanical themselves - relying on chemical reactions between hormones in our bodies, there is nothing spiritual about adrenaline, testosterone et al) and this provokes a mixture of feelings feelings of dread, awe, guilt - and indeed empathy are provoked by the AI's superb script, acting, direction and cinematography which relates the ideas I am delving into here (and many more) in intelligent and stylish fashion.Empathy has been explored before in a book about the nature of humanity that introduces mechanical (or in this case synthetic) emotions. This book is the famous "Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep" (later Bladerunner) by Phillip K Dick and returns with a vengeance in this film to similar but even more devastating effect.The ending of this movie is hotly debated - many misunderstood it utterly - even thinking the robots of the future being depicted were aliens! This ending is utterly chilling - humanity has passed on and the robots are our true 'children'. David is discovered during an archaeological expedition by these new highly advanced robots and appears as an ancient still-functioning relic who holds information of much use to them. The robots only function was to provide joy by receiving love (like a complex Teddy bear). He is put out of his constant 'misery' (or what we would interpret in human terms as misery) by these future-robots when they conjure an illusion of his 'mother' in his mind for him out of some DNA.At this moment we realise that it is a chilling thought that humans could create a being that could feel misery in this way. Requiring the love of one person but never able to get it - even if they wait for many millennia. And then, with an almost-imperceptible jerk of the head, David 'dies' and we remember - this is *just* a machine. We also realise on second viewing that David doesn't blink one for the entire film.I have covered some of the main points of the film in a very slapdash way. I hope that my ragged conveyance of these ideas (especially compared to how they are put across in the film) can convince some people to go back to this movie and experience it as the master-work it truly is.When you see this film remember that this is not Die Hard with robots - you are watching an intelligent and emotionally complex film. The more effort you put in the more you will get out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers:One of the best movies ever made, a masterpiece, a nice contribution to our civilization.It's a sweet movie, about a child's love, told through the eyes of a child (where Spielberg has done well before), where the child wants to 'come home again', and in the end does. He then grows to more maturity. Here the nice guy finishes first.The movie is about problems with (1) human love, (2) human families, and (3) human society. In the end the movie shows (4) a better and more 'humane' future, surprisingly, one without humans.A big point is: Humans, you're not getting it, and the failure promises to be fatal.Part of this point is: Humans, you're commonly more mechanical, less capable, less admirable, and less lovable than we might expect from an early robot. Since humans can build computers that can play chess better than humans can, the perhaps it is possible for humans to build a robot that can love better than humans can and even become a better human than most humans.The movie explains carefully what love should and should not be and, in particular, illustrates how robots could do better at human love than humans commonly do.We could also apply the lessons to human love of pets.The movie is in three parts: The first part shows some terrible problems with human love and the human family. The second part shows some terrible problems with human society. The third part shows the result: The humans die off, and robots inherit the Earth and do better than the humans did, are more 'humane' than the humans were.The movie is told from the point of view of a robot, David, designed to be much like a very loving child.In the end, David gets to 'come home' again and goes on to the brighter future of the much more highly evolved robots. In closure with the first scene in the movie, he gets the love that lets him dream.In more detail:One of the themes of the movie is a long comparison between humans and robots to see which side is more mechanical. In the end we see the humans as very mechanical and the best of the robots as less so. One lesson might be: Humans need to work harder to grow up.In the first scene we see that David is constructed just as a consumer product to serve a 'market'. But David becomes more than this and a better human and more 'humane' than his human engineers. A point might be that, just in doing a good first-cut job of engineering a robot to be like a human can result in a robot a better human than most humans. A lesson might be that the deepest parts of being human are not very deep and that humans should seek more depth.In the first part of the movie, David gets human parents Harry and Monica. The parents have a natural son Martin, but Martin has a serious disease and has been frozen waiting for a cure.Monica is troubled: She is meek, presents herself as a teenage sweetheart, is a 'house mouse', seems not to have a good network of friends, and is quite dependent on her husband for leadership, emotional security, financial security, and direction. She tends to over react, thinks and does too much on children and Martin, becomes too afraid of what David might do, and handles problems passively.Harry is a nice enough guy and does hold his job; he is happy but a bit simplistic and superficial. Soon we see that Harry doesn't have a clue about Monica's emotions. He is socially awkward and talks when he shouldn't, and about inappropriate subjects, and when others cannot listen to him.Clueless Harry brings home David without any real preparation for Monica and just shocks Monica with the event.The house is stark, sterile, and inhuman. Harry and Monica are living in surroundings more suitable for machines and don't get it.Martin is cured and comes home and resents David.Sometimes humans bring home a kitten, fail to make the needed investment to carefully train the kitten, fail to build a good relationship with it, and have a lifestyle that upsets the kitten. When the kitten stains a rug or pulls threads on the sofa, the family drives the kitten to the country and dumps it out to fend for itself the best it can. If possible, the family might advise the kitten to avoid people, especially people that collect kittens for medical experiments or kill them for sport.Well, too soon that is what happened to David. The loss, of course, is not just David's but of all involved. I happens often enough with humans and kittens now; the movie is saying that we can expect that it will happen with humans and robots. The cause is the same: Too often humans don't get it.We are to see that these humans are failing, failing in their own lives, failing with love, and having failed with David.This ends the first third of the movie.The second part shows some of the degeneracy of human society. By the end of the second part, we are supposed to have our sympathies fully against humans and for David.The score, photography, sets, and costumes effectively guide us to the intended mood throughout. The portrayal by Ms. Frances O'Connor of the character Monica is masterly, very hard work and a very good job at a challenging role.Spielberg's talent, expertise, insights, values, and hard work are in every frame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The point was well-communicated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** POSSIBLE SPOILER ***I've read a lot of negative reviews about this film, and I honestly think that most of them were not deserved. This film is more fantasy than science fiction, and it should be viewed in that light. The thing that struck me most, and which still lingers on, is the profound message of the great responsibility that we assume when we cause others to love us. The character of David was particularly pathetic, because after he was programmed to love unconditionally and subsequently abandoned, he was unable to rid himself of this feeling. Corporate greed created him, his "mother" selfishly inflicted this condition on him out of sheer loneliness and desperation, and David in all his innocence was the one left to suffer throughout eternity. This is a very powerful theme that has been omitted from most reviews I have seen. The fact that the story takes place in a fantasy setting should not detract the viewer from this point; in fact, it emphasizes the point, as David's unconditional love for his mother never waivers, even after the thousands of years of suffering that has been wrought upon him. Despite its "happy" ending, this is a sad film that should cause all of us to stop and think before we toy with other people's feelings.</fullReview>

But as an avid movie watcher of many genres, this one will go on my list of top 100. It's that good, it really is.Many scenes were magical, unbelievably creative and some merely thought provoking, altogether a very haunting movie. I WANT one of those Teddy Bears!!The 'beings' in the end, were very creative, totally believable.

		<fullReview>Like everyone else I didn't see this film at the movies because of the terrible reviews. Being a computer jock I had no interest in a Spielberg interpretation of my profession either.Well shut my mouth and wang my doodle(Hoosierism). With VCR tapes going the route of LPs I said what the heck and picked up this little ditty for a pittance at the local mega-mart. After viewing it I now consider myself one of the lucky few.What happens when you cross Pinocchio with Blade Runner and carry the idea of human callousness to its logical conclusion? You get a pretty good flick, thats what you get. I'm not going to give away any of the plot but consider A.I. as what remains after humans are no more and a little boy still wants a mother's love.Peripatetic Haley Joel Osment seems to be getting lots of work as the strange kid on the block. I last saw him in Sixth Sense and he fits right in here too. He sure hasn't grown much. I found absolutely no flaws in anything about this film, the writing, the acting, the FX, the sound track, the futurist sets and vehichles. No, its not a computer jock film. I don't even think its a technology film. It does have a lot to say about humanity though.By the way, after my tape of this film ended up came the PBS channel on TV and there was a culture show on that had some orchestra playing Richard Roger's Victory at Sea to war footage of ships being blown up and airplanes being shot down. You know, people dying to high brow music. No I don't think Artificial Intelligence:AI is such a bad flick after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reviews that I had read about AI were fairly damning, accusing it of being boring and not 'dark' enough. I have to disagree with that. Everybody that I have spoken to thought that it was brilliant and not at all boring. The plight of the little mecha boy (played without fault by Haley Joel Osment) couldn't help but touch a nerve with the viewer, especially touching was when his 'mother' abandoned him in the woods and when she was brought back to life for a day to be with him. I read one review that said the happy ending was completely out of touch with the rest of the film - again, I have to disagree with that. The viewer wanted the little boy to be happy and at peace. It would have been really depressing to have an unhappy ending taking into consideration the fact that throughout the whole film, David had been searching for a basic happiness - the knowledge of being loved. If you have been at all put off watching the film by reading or hearing negative reviews, then I suggest you think again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Haley Joel Osment gives an unbelievably magnificent performance in this movie - truly, one of the finest characterizations I have ever seen in any film in my life. You would have to be made of...well, METAL (and/or stone) to resist relating to (and feeling) his emotionally wrenching desire for his mommy's love, but his David is heart-breaking not because he TRIES to make you feel, but because he actually believes what he is projecting on the screen - he is one of THOSE kind of actors, who go inside the role - deep, deep inside - the same way he did in The Sixth Sense and the virtually-too-sad-to-be-watchable-by-the-end Pay It Forward.Jude Law is also perfectly believable as a mecha gigolo (the ultimate boy-toy!?) - the way he stands, his face, the way he moves - another brilliant performance from an always-fascinating actor. Loved the teddy bear too.The film would be a 10 if it weren't for the fact that it seems (upon the 3rd viewing - wasn't sure the first two times) not quite connected; it's like each act is a different movie in itself, and if Haley Joel hadn't provided such a powerfully strong emotional center the film would have been completely sprawled out of control. Give this boy an Oscar NOW.I thought I would share how I rate movies here at IMDb, having done over one hundred reviews now for the site; I've finally managed to match the 1-10 rating that we do here to the more-traditional 1-4 star rating: 1 = NO stars (a wretched and horrible affair, worthless beyond all comprehension), 2 = 1 star, 3 = 1-1/2 stars, 4 = 2 stars, 5 = 2-1/2 stars, 6 = 3 stars (low), 7 = 3 stars (high), 8 = 3-1/2 stars (low), 9 = 3-1/2 stars (high), and 10 = Four Stars (a brilliant concept, brilliantly executed).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I loved this film. I think it was as close to perfect as any movie can or will get. From props and sets to acting and direction. It covered all the bases and was topped off with an intriguing story line. Its this that I want to talk about in this comment. Though the story seems to follow the journey and adventures of a robotic child; it really is more like the journey of man.S * P * O * I * L * E * R * SWarning, this portion talks about some of the movie's content and if you haven't seen the film... DON'T READ THIS!!The first part of the film was David's introduction into his host family. Everything thing seems so perfect. David may as well have been named Adam and this home was his Eden. After David's "sins", he is cast out of "Eden" into a cruel and dark world.From that time on, David journeys through the horrors of ill-treatment of his kind much like man's own vicious treatments toward others in the history of man.Then the last act is Spielberg's own version and idea of salvation by beings that are not human. With David it is his own evolved race of "Mecha" beings. Showing once and for all that the only way man is to survive is to evolve out of the state that we are currently in.END OF SPOILERS!!!A really beautiful piece of art that we could all learn some lessons from; mainly how we treat others, but who knows - maybe even machines.10/10 - Beautifully moving.</fullReview>

My PERSONAL Rankings for Spielberg Movies :RANK: 5:Amistad(1997), 4: E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial(2002), 3: A.I.:Artificial Intelligence(2001), 2: Saving Private Ryan(1998), 1: Schindler's List(1993).(NOTE: There are LOT of other Gems(Jurassic Park(1993),Jaws(1975),Close Encounters..(1977),...etc) directed by Steven Spielberg but the aspect I gave priority and importance to, was the THEME of the movie and how much justice Spielberg could to do It.)Sadly,Spielberg could have made 'AI' more informative but then he did his BEST for a little-more-than-TWO hour movie. I only wish 'time' shouldn't have been the limit, especially for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw A.I. at the cinema, I didn't really know what to expect. I'd managed to distance myself from all the media hype surrounding the project, which only served to fuel my curiosity. What I did come away with was a profound sense of awe and memories I know will stay with me for a very long time - pretty powerful stuff for just a fairy tale. I feel it's my duty to warn those hard-hearted cynics out there that you might be disappointed with the movie's contrived ending. For the rest of us less jaded movie-goers, this film is a real treat for the heart and the mind, with plenty of breath-taking special effects that are at times so seamless, they do not distract you from the story (unlike many of its contemporaries, A.I. is a big budget movie that doesn't rely on gimmicks to capture the imagination). For all its criticisms, A.I. is a true cinematic masterpiece, begging repeated viewing to fully appreciate its many subtleties and complexities. It is surprising that it was overlooked at this year's Academy Awards, as I was sure Haley Joel Osment would get nominated for best actor.The story begins in a time when robots (or 'Mechas') who can feel human emotions are being exploited by man's greed. David (played by an eerily convincing Osment, who doesn't blink once throughout the entire film) is a child Mecha adopted by a couple whose real son has some incurable illness. At first they find it hard to accept David as their own, but he is gradually won over by Monica's maternal instincts and she comes to love him. When the family feels threatened by David's almost obsessive desire to be loved, they decide to abandon him in the woods (similar to the old parable Snow White, where the wicked queen calls for her to be taken into the woods and killed, but she is set free). Monica tells David to 'Stay away from people. only Mecha are safe' - judging by the actions of the humans in this story thus far, it seems like good advice! From that point onwards, the story dives into Spielberg waters, and David and his supertoy 'Teddy', embark on a quest to find the Blue Fairy, who he hopes will make him a 'real boy' so that Monica will love him once more. The film is littered with allusions to fairy tales, the most prominent being Pinocchio. In the garish Rouge City, David finds Dr. Know, a CGI character (voiced by none other than Robin Williams) reminiscent of The Wizard of OZ, the man behind the curtain with all the answers. On his journey, David encounters Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law. Theirs is a strange friendship borne out of the fight for survival in a world gone mad. Law's performance as the slick Lover Mecha is brilliant, and he really epitomises the decadence of Rouge City - a hybrid of Las Vegas and the red light district of every major city. By contrast, David's character represents innocence and virtue. It is the pairing of these two very different characters that makes for such great on-screen chemistry.The imagery in this film is magnificent, if a little unsettling at times, and makes you realise how much love was put into the composition of every meticulously crafted shot. The image of David lying motionless at the bottom of the swimming pool with his eyes wide open, bubbles escaping from his mouth, is particularly dark and moving (Kubrick's influence can really be felt in the first act). Watching A.I. is like watching a visual poem, where each aesthetic is a metaphor (above David's bed hangs the silhouette of a girl with a cutout where her heart should be). John Williams's score is beautifully haunting and complements the story well, adding to that unsettled feeling I mentioned.When Blade Runner was released in 1982, it was considered ahead of its time. It dealt with the idea of man playing god, and the moral and ethical implications. Similarly, A.I. paints a bleak picture of humanity, one that abuses its power and takes no accountability for its unwitting creations. However, unlike Blade Runner's criminal replicants who are being hunted down, A.I. portrays the Mecha as a far more likable and sympathetic creature. In many ways, the Mecha is more human than its creators.People shouldn't judge this film too harshly for its overt sentimentality, but rather they should see it for what it is: a work of art packaged for a mainstream audience. We are always complaining about the 'dumbing down' effect of certain Hollywood films, and here we are presented with a film that is not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve and tackle an issue that might not be so far off from being Science Fact. A.I. might even be considered by some as a cautionary tale, given its relevance to today's advances in technology and genetics. Can we really afford to dismiss it as being too cute for its own good?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Kubrick did this movie, I still would've enjoyed it!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Artificial Inteligence: A.I." was supposed to be Stanley Kubrick's next project after "Eyes Wide Shut," but, died short after the movie was completed. His friend, Steven Spielberg was devastated when he heard of his buddy's death. The next year, Kubrick's wife asked Steven if he can take over Kubrick's pet project. Steven said "OK" and started to write the script and when he got done, he directed the movie. In the summer of 2001, the movie was released and here's what I gotta say about it.I rented this movie on DVD when it came out in March and I was AMAZED wth this movie. I didn't think Spielberg had it in him. I've enjoyed Spielberg's movies in the past and I'll enjoy his movies in the future, but, today, I really enjoyed "A.I." Like "Moulin Rouge," this became a love it or hate it movie and I loved it. The ending of the movie was sad because I was crying. If you've enjoyed Spielberg's films (including the recent hit "Minority Report"), but, haven't seen "A.I." because of all the negative reviews, then, I suggest you give "A.I." a try. You'll thank me later.A+ 13/13 ****** (out of ****** stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great story telling from Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie uses science fiction about robots as a premise, but the heart of the movie is on a more basic level about finding one's identity and happiness. Fortunately, the story and humanity of the film doesn't take a backseat to the elaborate and spectacular sets, cinematography, and special effects. The flesh fair and NYC are quite a site to behold. That is not to say that the movie doesn't touch on the ethics of technology or artificial intelligence having self awareness, which it does cover rather effectively. The ending is perhaps the most satisfying part of the movie. It says in a really touching way how our lives end up in the same way it started.Spielberg delivers a captivating and touching story about one boy's journey to self discovery. Well written, well acted, and void of the Hollywood formularized drivel that we have seen of late. The movie to see after Saving Private Ryan.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No matter what people say about this movie, I'll consider "AI" as a masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS THROUGH ALL THE COMMENT) :P I was truly expecting "Artificial Intelligence". The teaser trailer was as strange as... teasing :P. Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick together creating a new film was also very interesting. I heard Kubrick was going to direct the film by himself, but because of his death, Spielberg got the job. But the truth is that Kubrick called Spielberg to ask him if he wanted to be the director. You don't often receive a call from a brilliant director offering you a film... but you won't probably have the luck to call Spielberg in order to direct your movie! :-). Anyway, on with the comment!Before watching "AI", you must realize it's a Kubrick's movie conducted by Steven Spielberg. So it will be a mixture between "The Shining" and "ET", but in my opinion it's more a Spielberg's film than a Kubrick's.The story is quite interesting: in the future, the ice caps have melted and the sea level has increased a lot, leaving the cities near the shore under the water. The human population has been reduced, so the natural resources. Strict birth controls have been established in order to survive against the hunger. That's why robots become so important in human society.The robot technology has reached so unbelievable levels that scientists can create a synthetic humanoid, physically and mentally like a human, but with some problems expressing emotions. But then, a group of doctors start a project in order to create a child robot with the ability to love. And that's when David appears.I'm not going to tell all the movie until the end, but with these introduction, you should get a picture of what the film is about: "AI" tells the story of the love between a boy and his mother, so be prepared for a really emotional movie. And don't expect an action futuristic thrill or you'll get disappointed...The acting is incredible. You have Haley Joel Osment playing as David, the child-robot, who steals all the attention of the movie and leads the film with an incredible performance. Then, as David's counterpart, you have Gigolo Joe, performed by Jude Law, who also does an incredible performance of his character. The acting is remarkable along all the movie. The evolution of David through the story is really good: in the beginning he acts like a robot, but in the end it's almost human.The SFX are brilliant: all the robots, Rouge City... Special mention to the reality of Teddy, the robot toy which follows David through all the movie. ILM does it again with this film.Ok, the film seems brilliant. Then why the bad reviews? People would say a list of cons: "the film is very slow, very long, and very strange..." "Osment overracts in some scenes..." "They should have cut out the last 30 minutes...", "What's the point of that aliens in the end of the film?!...". I'm not going to argue if some people didn't like the film. They have their opinion. I admit this film is difficult to assimilate, not popcorn summer movie. But FYI, the supposed aliens are not: THEY ARE ROBOTS, for god sake! They are even like the symbol of the robot company...I was going to say "If you like ET or The Shining, you'll like this one", but it's not true: it's a totally unexpectable film, full of emotion, special effects, all conducted with the incredible Spielberg, but with Kubrick behind all. If you want to see a genuine Spielberg's creation, see "Minority Report".Anyway, a really worth look! (my opinion) :P 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE MEANING OF THE ENDING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS: WARNING:This film has been accused of many things but I feel people will grow to appreciate it much as they did with Blade Runner. It's accused of being overly sentimental but I thought it was effective in portraying the relationship between a mother and a young child, and the search for meaning and reality in our lives. The shifts in tone and setting between the three acts was jarring to many people but this was completely intentional and set a unique style to proceedings. Needless to say it was visually stunning with great performances, although Rouge City was strangely sterile and unerotic.ENDING: But the purpose of MY review is to point out the meaning of the ending for the many who didn't get it. The creatures at the end were NOT aliens, but highly evolved robots/mechas. Evidence for this:-Gigolo Joe mentions one day humanity will be extinct and all that will be left are mechas -The mechs talk about David, and others like him, being their ancestors, (if they were aliens why would a robot be their ancestor?). -The future mechs talk about humanity being the key to existence and life. Why would aliens think humanity are the basis of life and existence?Of course the DVD features confirm the beings are robots not aliens but to my mind this was explained in the film, it wasn't hard to figure it out, yet AI has been criticised in many reviews because of the supposedly bizarre ET ending which makes perfect sense if people PAID ATTENTION and THOUGHT about what they were viewing.OK rant over, greetings to all those who played the AI puzzle trail on the net.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I'm sometimes too influenced by my own personal politics when it comes to evaluating the film I watch, but I found this film very entertaining and possibly more relavent than we may know.I've read some of the other comments for this film and most are very well thought out and very articulate, but I am left questioning just how critical we as an audience need to be when we decide wether a film was a waist of time, a guilty pleasure, or genuinely moving.Maybe I don't need to think about why Gigolo Joe's character is so attached to following around David to enjoy the chemistry they develop, and can entertain the idea that maybe in the future A.I. will actually mean intelligence as we enjoy it. Maybe I think David was exhibiting a psychotic desire to be human, because he was an imperfect prototype that was missing some of the equation, or perhaps he was a little boy that simply can't understand what he is, like so many little boys his age.Whatever this movie was or wasn't, it is a fictional fairy tale, a modern retelling of Pinocchio, a fable that in this context echoes a possible future not so far away. Mechanically speaking, the human brain is only capable of so many calculations a second, modern computer power is quickly approaching and may soon surpass this benchmark. The idea that we could build a machine, maybe not a functional walking mecha, but a computer that can think for itself is not so far away. I find it a very entertaining premise for a film.Maybe Kubrick could have done more with it, made it deeper with more effective sub plots and other such etc., but Speilberg delivers a very entertaining movie that asks more questions than it answers, and I like that. One of the best films of 2001. Explosive!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little false, but an Excellent Substitute.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was initially apprehensive about AI. The film had been well marketed, but the marketing always focused on what I can describe as the more 'sci-fi' aspects of the film, futuristic cityscapes and robots. While both of these were factors in my not watching AI, feeling that perhaps it would be similar, but not as subtle as Bladerunner. Add to this, Haley Joel Osment, who, although being a skilled young actor, does tend towards being a little frustrating in his over(emotional) acting. After 15 minutes of watching the film, I was more than pleasantly surprised. The story was much more powerful than I had been led to think by the marketing, while Haley was proving he could indeed be impressive and subtle. Not wishing to focus on the effects, it is necessary to complement them, not only for their craft but also the way they make a believable world for the futuristic plot. Though, I could pick fault with many of the 'action' sequences, especially a bike chase which takes place, for having a low budget production value feel to them, while the work which involved ILM is without a doubt groundbreaking, as are the animatronics Mention should also go to Jude Law for his equally impressive performance as a custom made pleasure machine... ladies need I say more. Although I believe this IS, a great film. I do still harbor some reservations. Namely the fact that this is, or was, a Stanley Kubrick concept... with many of the early scenes having a Kubrick like direction. Due to this I can't help but feel the later parts of the film become too sci-fi (in a Star wars definition of sci-fi and not a 2001 one), as I would be difficult to convince that Kubrick would have taken this direction. Perhaps, this is a film that should never have been made after the death of it's creator, but somehow this has a strange irony, as AI is a copy of Kubrick in many respects, but it does feel a little false and lack some of his heart. Though to be fair, there are not many directors who could have pulled off AI, Spielberg does however.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this far after the movie run and after the release of the DVD. Although a lot of people didn't like this movie, after watching it in it's entirety, I believe that this movie is truly a masterpiece.By producing a robot who feels, man is placing himself on the pedestal of God, who has the power to give and take away life at will. David never asked to love Monica, yet he unconditionally and blindly loves her, even after her abandonment of him. Henry shows even less love for the mecha, even though it was his idea to introduce him into the house (yes, he was picked, but he could have refused on the spot), as soon as his own child was threatened, he suggested to remove David immediately. This kind of care reflects how selfish humans are.David is the perfect representation of what humans should be, who blindly love, and have an inate need to be protected from harm. Everyone tries to protect him, Teddy, Joe Giggalo, Monica.. yet it is he who tries to take his own life when his Masters can not deal with his presence.The best movie I've seen in a long long time. Ignore the useless comments and watch it for yourself. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, yet haunting experience- overall very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`A.I.' is a flawed masterpiece, a title often placed on the wrong films. `Blade Runner' is a similar film that deserves the moniker, as well as the former. Both have haunting and at times devastating effects, yet have noticeable faults that can not be excused. Of course, imperfection was inevitable with this film being a Kubrick/Spielberg collaboration of sorts. Kubrick influenced the film greatly, as it was to be perhaps his final production. Unfortunately, the cinematic genius died before he could produce much, and Spielberg took over. The two have completely different styles. Spielberg is an audience pleaser and Kubrick is pessimistic. As a result, there is a noticeable mixing of styles. The film at times is relentlessly depressing and trite at others. However, these are not the film's big flaws; I found the collision of Spielberg and Kubrick to result in a lack of political and social messages. For a film with an ambitious plot like this, that is inexcusable.Haley Joel Osment, once more seeming like he is 7 years old as opposed to 13, plays David. David looks identical to a human boy and behaves mostly like one, too. However, he is a `mecha,' or an android. The time is in the future, and polar ice caps have melted, devastating cities such as New York. As an attempt to solve population and labor crises, androids are developed. However, David is of a revolutionary type of android. His purpose is to act as a pet of sorts. He is a mechanical son, designed to genuinely love his owner(s). Upon creation by the hopeful Dr. Hobby, David is adopted by the Swinton family of Maria, Henry, and their son Martin, who is recovering from a near lethal illness. David is programmed to love Maria, and he loves her more than anything else in his world, but he inadvertently wreaks martial havoc amongst the Swintons and is forced to flee. Accompanied only by the `supertoy' teddy bear Teddy, David wanders a strange world only to find a group of androids fleeing for their lives. It is here that he meets Gigolo Joe, a suave android prostitute who accompanies David everywhere. The two then search the hostile world in order to help David achieve his dreams of becoming a real boy so that he can return to Maria and be loved.Both characteristics of the two aforementioned directors are visible. Kubrick's perpetually negative, cynical and perhaps even nihilistic views are captured in multiple images. Throughout Kubrick's films, stunning images can be found, and `A.I.' is deeply reminiscent of those visuals. For instance, shots of a bridges with massive stone statues used for support, an underwater Coney Island, blanketed by encroaching seaweed, and Rouge City, a smorgasbord of brilliant electric lights and skyscraping nightclubs, enrapture the viewer. Another extremely haunting shot sequence is the view of a nearly submerged New York City, with only a handful of skyscrapers protruding from the murky depths, including the hand of the Statue of Liberty. The visual portrayal of Earth in its twilight, in a state of melancholy, left me unsettled and saddened. Hours after the film, `A.I.'s' content still remained in my mind, engraved. Unfortunately, Spielberg sacrifices Kubrick's trademark scathing social messages for his own trademark audience pleasing sentimentality. For a film with a plot featuring a near-apocalypse, mass android reproduction, and the like, there is a sad absence of any socially relevant subplots, which always elevated Kubrick's films such as `A Clockwork Orange,' `2001: A Space Odyssey,' and `Dr. Strangelove' to classics. Subplots that one would think to be included yet are only hinted at are racial and ethnic bigotry, the morality of creating artificial life, and the metaphysics of being alive. Instead of forcing the viewers to question their own existence and think, Spielberg trades that uncomfortable material to his own skilled area- emotional power. David's desperate search for love brings the viewer to the film's denouement, a ludicrously contrived, yet strangely affecting trip through miles of ice and visitations with other `characters.' The film ends on such an odd note, hopelessly depressing yet somehow poignant at the same time, that final shot was etched in my mind throughout the day and the next. I turned the VCR off, moved and haunted by the film.Of course, the film is flawed as mentioned earlier. There are multiple faults with `A.I.,' just one being the relationship between David and Gigolo Joe. The two are in constant company with each other, having met randomly, yet their relationship clicks too quickly and is never truly developed. The script fails to bind the characters together, leaving an awkward void where interaction should be. Also, Haley Joel Osment turns in a mostly good and at times superb performance, yet he once more lapses into his tendency to whisper emotional lines as if that trite behavior will wrench tears from the audience. This habit is extremely obnoxious and manipulative; any viewer touched by it should be banned from films forever. Aside from this, a lot of focus on the film has revolved around the abundance of underdeveloped subplots. While this is the case, I never felt this facet of the film to be damaging. These include a crime associated with Gigolo Joe, Dr. Hobby's obsession with David, and a few other threads that if more developed, would have served little use other than to further prolong the film. Instead, the should-have-been-subplots that I mentioned earlier were of a greater necessity to the film.No matter how visible the scars of fault are in `A.I.,' the sheer emotional effect of the film overwhelms them. The viewer will nevertheless be stirred by this film, no matter how imperfect it is. Many loathe this wonderful film for a variety of rationales; I am a supporter. No film of 2001 has moved me as much as this, not even `In the Bedroom,' yet I am not quite sure if I am ready to declare `A.I.' the best film of the year. It may be. Surely, it is one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. was a different movie for Spielberg but it was interesting. Of course the visual effects were astonishing and the acting was pretty good. Haley Joel Osment, I hope spelled his name right, portrayal of an android trying to become a real boy so the parents, mainly the mother, who bought him would love him. The movie had its sad points and Kubrick/Spielberg's vision of the future were pretty impressive. The points in the movie that should be notice is Jude Law's performance as a gigolo robot. He had a Gene Kelly quality, when he moved and danced about. His dialogue was quite clever and he seemed to be an unlikely partner for the young android. The point to pay attention to when watching this movie is the bear. A lot of my friends felt the bear was the coolest and the most disturbing toy you could give a young child. He was a good addition to the movie. I really enjoyed the ending of the movie, alien spaceships that are the shapes of cubes who break apart when they land and oceans that are blocks of ice, was astounding. It was almost depressing seeing what could become of our world and the human race hundreds of thousands or millions of years in the future but still - awe inspiring. All in all a little long and weird but it does deserve a look see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragic and beautiful hymn to human creativity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been said after the release of Sixth Sense that Osment's success is solely due to the power of motherly instinct in female humans. While he does some cute faces in the A.I. too, I feel that his performance in this one is of much greater scale and depth, and could make some leading actor Oscar nominees feel shame. For Osment alone this movie is worth watching.A.I. is Spielberg being Kubrick-y and pretty much excelling at it. Still, I still can't shake off the suspicion that the ending was pure deus ex machina to save a sort of happy ending and show off some Spielberg ET baggage... Even if it is, the first powerful two-thirds more than make up for it.As Professor Hobby says in the opening scene, in the beginning, didn't God create Adam to love Him? Created in the image of our Creator, we are destined to feel the same burning need create ourselves.This movie explores the frontiers of human creativity. Are we not demiurgs? How far we can go? Could we capture even the most elusive? Could we create something in our own image? A child that looks in every aspect as a normal boy yet is not one, who does not change forever, a child whose love may outlive the human race. A toy with huge market potential. What a momentous achievement and what a fundamental flaw. Pinoccio theme, which has been criticized as overdone, is in my view crucial to the entire story. To watch David's belief in the Fairy is painful but the fact that he has been DESIGNED so and cannot change makes it near unbearable.Tragic and beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definitive lack of story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No question - acting is excellent here. I never thought I would weep about a robot child. But what does this movie want to tell us ?Other movies, such as Gattaca, are about a problem, show us the aspects of it, link it to personal experiences, and maybe even suggest some ideas how to solve or handle it.But what we get here is just a Pinoccio story. And even that one is less interesting than the original Pinoccio ! Spielberg gives us sugar where sugar is the last thing we want from him. The end was especially cheesy, he had to make his Pinoccio happy no matter how hard it would be, but that looked quite absurd.I'm sorry, but this one simply doesn't operate. It is a child movie about a serious theme, that cannot work !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only one with human thought or emotion is the robot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing like walking out at the end of a movie and not hearing one person talking. This is yet another attempt to examine human behavior and bias it so that the only one with redeemable qualities is the poor misunderstood object of their evil, and sometimes misguided good intentions.If you checked your brain at the door, you probably got sucked into the vacuum Kubrick created to make you feel depressed for poor little David (Haley Joel Osment), which who couldn't love this kid, but remember this HE IS A ROBOT. Once the Martins "real" kid came back we see what a manipulative lovingless monster kids are, even his friends at the party were reprobates. Nice touch. Without giving too much away wouldn't David's self preservation be trumped with human preservation at the party scene. If not those robot makers sure have a design flaw. I wouldn't want to go to war with one of these robots, he would probably throw me on a grenade to save himself. Too bad the Martins didn't know someone at the company so they could get this fixed LIKE THE "FATHER" of the robot.Basically this movie was meant to suck you into a depressed mode, and try to show the robots view of "life and love." Afterwards it would make you think you were having some sort of deep deep discussion about what are real emotions. The problem with the movie was the people were too dark and disturbed, and the robots were made to be too victimized and were the only one's capable of genuine human emotions. I'd hate to think what this movie would have been like if Kubrick would have gotten to finish it. One review in here said that he wisely handed it over to Spielberg. That wasn't the case, he had been trying to make this thing for years, but no one would go along with it. Once Kubrick passed on his family pleaded with Spielberg to finish it. Spielberg actually lightened it up to get it to its released state.Its too bad some great things will get sucked down the drain in this movie. The effects were spectacular. Jude Law and even Haley Joel's performance's were outstanding. I just couldn't stand the rest of the ideological drivel that was trying to be perpetrated upon our emotions and reasoning. I like some of Kubricks stuff, but this one is just a big swing and a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my god. What an utterly, utterly, AWFUL movie. It's only redeeming features are 1) The special effects, 2) that the producers did not do the "PC" thing and recall the film to edit out shots including the World Trade Centre. Good for them.A thoroughly boring movie. Runs for so long you'll think the cinema has been trapped under ice for 2000 years. By half-way, you'll be praying for David to die in the current scene so you can get OUT of there. By 2/3 of the way through, you will want to drill a hole in your skull to let the boredom out. Nearly but not quite the worst movie I've ever had the misfortune to see on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst film of the year? Possibly definitely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the incredibly dreary start to the amazingly ridiculous ending, this was a film to sleep through (in fact one of my friends fell asleep within the first 30 minutes). There was nothing original about this film, it was very much a rehash of the 80's film D.A.R.R.Y.L with a dash of Waterworld at the end. This film hinges on you caring about the robot boy who just wants to be loved, but after about 10 minutes I was desperate for them to dismantle him and make Teddy the star of the film! Teddy won hands down on popularity, if the film had just been about him, Spielberg would have had a hit on his hands. Jude Law was good, but didn't really fit in with the film. All in all I'm just really sad that such a good idea could be ruined so completely...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the first time I saw the the trailers for A.I. I thought, hey that looks cool. And then I promptly forgot about it until one day when I was watching TV and saw the trailer again. One name, only for an instant, blipped on the screen: "Stanley Kubrick." I thought wait a dang second here... he's dead...But it didn't matter. The allure of a new Kubrick film after the spectacularly slow Eyes Wide Shut was just too much. So I sat and waited and waited to see the movie in the theater... and it was well worth it.While bits of the movie seem too Spielbergian to ignore, much of the movie was visually and mentally disturbing, particularly in the opening sequence when David and Monica are first getting aquainted. I think Spielberg did a marvelous job of depicting Kubrick's bleak look on humanity and his appreciation of sci fi. All in all, a great film for Spielberg, Kubrick, and John Williams, who had an amazing score for the film.The shots, particularly the one of David framed by the dining room light while watching his "parents" eat, are all well planned and, quite honestly, stunning from time to time. Artistically and emotionally riveting, A.I. is a film I will be purchasing at my earliest convenience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>warning, contains minor spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been sitting at my keyboard for quite a while now trying to decide what to write about A.I, the movie conceived by Stanley Kubrick and taken over by Steven Spielberg. What should have been the movie event of the year has left me rather perplexed. It's four days since I watched it, and I still don't know whether I liked it or not. Perhaps the fact that I have woken up at night more than once thinking about it, and that it still has me thinking shows it may be better than the sum of it's parts.The confused state it's left me in could be attributed to the confused style of story telling. Is A.I. sci-fi, a fairy tale, a moralistic story? It can't be pigeon holed with a plot that veers from light hearted scenes to ones that are so dark and menacing they're not suitable for children. It's as if there is a battle going on between Kubrick's dark austere style and Spielberg's childlike take on life. The robotic teddy is a case in point. As the constant companion of David (Haley Joel Osment) the first mecha to have feelings, it is aimed squarely at a young audience.The next thing you know, you're viewing a Flesh Fair, where mecha's are destroyed in a gladiatorial ring. The crowds roar in appreciation as acid is poured over one mecha and call out for more as another is shot through a giant propeller. It's into this big wide world that David is thrown after his human parents decide they can't have a mecha that is able to love and have feelings of jealousy. So we go from family in crisis to road trip when David meets up with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) at the Flesh Fair. Together they escape their oppressors and head off in search of the Blue Fairy, the only one who can turn David into a real boy. Sound familiar? Joe suggest visiting Dr.Know, who ironically knows everything. He resides in the heart of a vice ridden city of pleasure and is a cartoon character. It was at this point that I really had to suspend belief. In a effort to make A.I. suitable family fare, Spielberg lost the edge that Kubrick would have given the movie. But, and it's a big but, Spielberg must have got something right, because the nearly two and a half hours of A.I. literally fly by. The movie draws you in right from the beginning with it's pseudo psychology and before you know it you're at the end of a rather bouncy ride. This is helped by the excellent performances from Osment and Law. Osment inhabits nearly every scene and exudes a sense of desperate wonder. Law adds a comical edge to his character that helps to relieve the sometimes overtly preachy tone.Bottomline, A.I. isn't the type of movie you expect from Spielberg. It's a thinking persons movie with very little action and an almost lazy style, albeit punctuated by mind numbing images. Some scenes leave an indelible impression on your mind.I still don't quite know whether A.I. is a great movie or not. Would it have been better under Kubrick's hand? Unfortunately we'll never know. If you decide to see A.I. leave the kids at home, they won't get it and could end up having nightmares. And be warned A.I. will be with you for quite a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a Kubrick fan. Yes, I think that E.T. was a simple childish movie. And not, I didn't cry when E.T. almost dies (30 years now, so I was 12 in that time). As a child, I first came in love with Spielberg movies before appreciating Kubrick ones; specifically Close Encounters in 1979. But later, when I first saw 2001 and then A Clockwork Orange on video I was just engaged in the Kubrick works. Spielberg always made me be interested in his projects, but from that point in time I always saw in him some kind of genius of the entertainment industry, not an artist in the full sense of the word. When I first heard the rumor that he was going to be the director for AI (when Kubrick passed away), my first feeling was of disbelief. But, I was wrong. Spielberg really has created the most beautiful, uncompromised and bravest of his works. I have been reading all this bashing around AI, but I have been noted too that most of this bashing comes from the hardcore Spielberg fans and those victims of the wrong media campaign for this movie. Spielberg really put poetry in this work, and like the awesome art piece that is, is up to anybodies interpretations, I feel that this is why this movie has gathered so many mixed critics reviews too (from 2 to 5 stars). I feel now that Kubrick was not wrong in choosing Spielberg for directing this work, Kubrick was conscious of being not able to give the perfect sensibility to this film (that he told Spielberg to direct it), Kubrick's wish was to create a Fairy Tale for his adult public and I think that Spielberg really accomplished this purpose in a form of a beautiful poem that can be appreciated in multiple ways. For the end bashers: The end is a Kubrick idea, only subtle differences from the original intended, the main idea is there, and is a beautiful bittersweet coda in Spielberg's hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As much of Spielberg as there is Kubrick, and very, very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To many, A.I will be remembered as Stanley Kubrick's legacy, as it was the project he never got around to writing, and it is Steven Spielberg who takes on the role of director in what is really a coming-together of two of the main heavyweights in modern cinema. Right from the word go, it is clear that there could not have been a better man for the job. While a distinctly ?Kubrickian' tone, to coin a phrase, emerges later, the start is all Spielberg ? light as a major player, a clean, comfortable setting and the focus throughout is of a child: David, the one-of-a-kind robot programmed to feel love. While the opening may seem lifeless and insipid, it is merely a common trick employed by the director to agitate the audience and create a sense of unease, that stays in the picture long after the initial tones evaporate. This certainly works, as the first day of David's visit (a family has been chosen to look after him and try to love him back), especially in scenes with his ?mother' (Frances O Connor) there is an overriding feeling of discomfort, even though there is something vaguely comical about the way the robots speak and the way their mind works. However this does not last all that long, and once David goes off on his own (and even in scenes beforehand), a more real and menacing tone emerges, as the true nature of the differences between humans and robots make themselves known. Jude Law's character, the wonderfully cool ?Gigolo Joe' is vital to this, thickening the plot just before the mood gets overly pretentious. This also gives us an uncontrollably high level of emotion to deal with, especially to do with David, as played by Haley Joel Osment, who conveys such loneliness and despair that it's absolutely heartbreaking. His performance, which is pivotal, reminds us just why he burst onto the scene in 1999 with ?The Sixth Sense', and while at times it's a completely different role his ability still shines in the same way. With its strong performances and fascinating subject matter, there is no doubt this film is a gripping spectacle, but it always seems to maintain a sort of distance, never quite as engaging as you might expect from a film with so much emotion bubbling under. For example themes that touch our most basic instincts, such as protecting a child in danger, are all tainted by an air of uncertainty which permeates the entire movie. However this is a typical Kubrick trait and perhaps this is the mark that he leaves, or rather Spielberg leaves for him. No other living director has the genius Spielberg has to make use of an enormous arsenal of film knowledge and to make Kubrick's idea into Kubrick's film while still keeping you interested. Smart without pretension, accessible without ever failing to surprise us, and truly absorbing, Spielberg and the entire cast can look back at a job very well done.</fullReview>

Let me also state that when my husband &amp; I walked out, it was behind approximately 20 other people.It is quite certain that when Spielberg &amp; Kubrick (whom I both LOVE), when to pitch this movie to the studio, the following was said, "Picture this.... it's E.T. meets Clockwork Orange meets Cabaret meets Moulin Rouge meets Close Encounters meets Mad Max meets Peter Pan meets Toy Story."Now what kind of combination is that? It's A.I. and it was the most over-produced, non-sensical film I may have ever seen. Being a huge fan of both of these directors I am thoroughly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first: I like Spielberg. Generally. Jaws, Raiders, Schindlers List, wonderful movies, some pure fun, others even thought provoking. I also like Kubrick. I love Full Metal Jacket, Clockwork Orange and Spartacus. 2001 is great in visuals, too.BUT:A.I. makes me angry. I will not go into detail, but this film shouldn't have been made (this way).THIS FILM IS NOT SUITABLE FOR KIDS!!!!!!I am a hardcore horror-fan, I also like good, moving dramas and as I am 22 years old now, I think I can handle everything I see on screen. But then there was A.I.I know there are films that hurt physically (Tomb Raider, Pearl Harbor, any 2001 flop) but this particular film hurts me on the psychical level. Maybe that was Spielbergs intention, but this damn thing is f*#+ing overdone.The boy (and we all are supposed to see him as a real boy) is never, NEVER treated right and although you don't REALLY care for him, it makes you angry. The odd family scenes, the leave alone in the forest scene, the whole flesh fare... I will never ever think of showing that thing to my kids until they are at LEAST 16 years old. Although I am against censorship and for I think that kids can comprehend more than we adults think they are capable of, this movie is simply annoying. Spielberg takes a knife and digs into your chest just to reach your bloody heart.Mr. Spielberg, that doesn't work.Kubrick might have done this film properly, but he'd gone a complete different direction...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A muddled and uneven mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes too much talent can destroy a creative endeavor, which has to have been the case with A.I. Spielberg, who was responsible for creating the term blockbuster with such crowd pleasers as Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark, seems to be purposely alienating his audience by both pandering to critics and insulting the intelligence of his faithful fans. He manages to accomplish these two tasks efficiently, and in the meantime also destroys what could have been an inspired piece of social commentary. This film should not have been made, because only Kubrick could have made it. It was Kubrick's obsession for twenty years, and is severely damaged by the golden glow of Spielberg's patented lighting. A.I. is basically divided up into three acts. The first act is very much Spielbergian, in that it tries to pull on the heart strings without subtlety or shame. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to identify or care for the main character David (not a fault of Haley Joel Osment, who's acting was more than competent). It is interesting to note that Kubrick did not want a real actor to play the part, and for years had envisioned David as being either a real robot or a computer generated effect. What this indicates is that Spielberg missed the point that Kubrick may have wished to communicate, that we may not be expected to feel sympathy for David, but rather view him in the same way we view HAL from 2001, as a comment on our lack of responsibility for that which we create. The second act is the most inspired part of the film, primarily because of its visuals and also because it contains Jude Law's performance. Kubrick's much needed influence comes through here, and while it provides for several interesting settings and designs, this part of A.I. would be more at home in A Clockwork Orange, and seems freakish and awkward when sandwiched between the mediocre beginning and downright horrible and bizarre epilogue. The third section is what pushed A.I. from a simply average film to being simply awful. For some inexplicable reason, Spielberg decided to add a voice-over, which is downright insulting in its stupidity. Also, he attempts to leave the audience satisfied with little David's fate, cushioning any social impact the film may have contained. In addition, there are several other elements that are concerned with the evolution of artificial intelligence that may have been presented with greater purpose or significance in the hands of a more adventurous director. A.I. is a massive disappointment in that it is from the mind of a cinematic genius and handled by the defining director of an entire generation of filmmakers, yet it manages to descend into ambiguity without purpose, and lacks the ability to engage. This is made all the more frustrating by the fact that there is something worthwhile in this mess, yet it amounts to nothing.</fullReview>

Jude Law seemed a little 'actory' for my taste, he'sthe only one I didn't believe.

Do you also remember when Spielberg made intensely powerful films of such depth like The Color Purple and Schindler's List? I know, they seem so long ago. Since Schindler's List, one of the top 10 greatest films of all time, Spielberg has punished us with Jurassic Park 2, Amistad, Saving Private Ryan (the first 20 minutes was not enough to hold me through the predictability of the plot and the amazingly shallow characters), and now A.I.: Artificial Intelligence.

Again, the film is like the robot, David, who is a miraculous assembly of parts that don't add up to a meaningful whole.The "borrowing" from other films, such as The Wizard of Oz, Bladerunner, E.T., and, of course, 2001, is distracting and comes across as schizophrenic. Why create these forced scenes in order to advance the storyline?The bottom line is this: there is no story here worth telling. The notion of human "love" and affection is trivialized by focusing on a machine. We can't truly love robots any more than they can "love" us. Get over it!</fullReview>

I have never seen the Oedipus complex realized so crudely in any cultural artifact as it was in "A.I."The last section could have been brilliant in the hands of a mature master like the great Kubrick (granting the boy his wish to become human and then putting him in a cock-eyed world of "humanity" as envisioned by the aliens in a faux-happy-ending would have been a marvelous satire and served to elucidate the human condition), but in the hands of the praeternaturally immature Spielberg, it becomes fodder for the above musing on the director's mental health.A perfectly egregious film!</fullReview>

The only thing good I got out of this night at the theatre was a Sobe on Ice and chocolate almonds. It was not thought provoking, emotion provoking, entertaining, humorous, dramatic, or anything. How long did it last? Ten hours? I went into this movie without knowing anything about it. That is the last time I will be that adventurous. I should have known when I saw Stanley Kubrick's name on the screen to get up and leave but I thought I would give it a chance. I would have sat through Tomb Raider three more times before watching this again. I would also choose labor and delivery over sitting through this again. The only thing good about this movie was that it had Haley Joel-Osment. Poor boy. He will never live this one down. I have never seen an audience voice opinions at the end of a movie like we did. Someone really wanted to know if anyone in the theatre actually like the movie. No one did, or at least no one dared admit to it.

Additionally, The NEW YORK TIMES gave it a very good review. All the ingredients for what I thought would be a very enjoyable, really good film!Nothing could have been further from the truth. The film was absolutely awful. Although the first half hour seemed good, it went absolutely nowhere afterwards. It was boring, stupid and never-ending.David (the little boy in the film) wanted nothing more than to be a "real boy". I suggest you stick with Disney's PINOCCHIO. I can think of other words to describe AI, but I don't like to use that type of language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A.I. is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not only is it corny and sappy beyond my ability to stomach, but it continually insults the viewer and then pushes that insult just a little further.Characters in this movie act without apparent or reasonable motivation, constantly betraying what little we know about them.This is a bad movie -- do not watch it or you will wish you had not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than disappointing*SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of a Kubrick-Spielberg film that was being kept hidden under wraps from the public eye, I thought for sure that it would be one of Spielberg's best movies and a movie sure to make you think. What I got instead was a piece of drivel that you can hardly call a movie, especially not a film by a world-renowned director. The film was the laugh-out loud comedy of the year instead. It was so pathetic, unoriginal, and impossible that you had to laugh at it. I kept thinking that the film was going to get better as it went along, but it never did. It was one of the only films this year that I've considered walking out on. The acting in this film was awful; Haley Joel Osmond gave a basic performance that didn't stretch his ability as "The Sixth Sense" did. The rest of the cast gave sub-par performances also, excluding the one ray of light in this film Jude Law as Gigolo Joe and the mechanical Teddy. The scene selection was also horrible. Take the flesh fair scene where the robots are destroyed in front of an audience. Did anyone notice the remarkable resemblance to the scenes of "The Running Man". The end was very pathetic indeed. When I saw the alien ship 2,000 years later, I nearly laughed at its plausibility and value in this movie. A.I. said nothing important, had poor acting, had no memorable scenes, and will be remembered as a flop in an otherwise magnificent career of Steven Spielberg. A great performance by Jude Law doesn't save this film. I give it one star, which I only give to films such as Battlefield Earth and Baby Geniuses.</fullReview>

In fact, (although I value his artistic qualities), avoid Kubrik movies like the plague. But in this case, I thought the Spielberg influence would prevail.However, this is not a Spielberg-like movie at all. It has "Stanley Kubrik" written all over it! This has NOTHING TO TO WITH SCIFI! It is simply a love-epos with the added twist that the boy is a robot. But after the first 5 minutes, you'll have forgotten all about that and the SciFi background becomes insignificant.Go to see this movie if you like Stanley Kubrik-type love stories. You'll be very happy with this movie. For everyone else: RUN AWAY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one fo the worst movies of the millenium, up there with "Star Wars:TPM", "Mission to Mars", and the hilarious "Battlefield Earth". I suppose if one never contemplated if an artificially intelligent lifeform could have a "soul" nor had read any of the greater works of sci-fi that has dealt with AI, then "A.I." might seem poignant.This pseudo sci-fi fairy-tale takes you on a trip through a cut and paste Speilbergian wasteland. You'll join David for his search for the Blue Fairy, along with a robo gigolo and a cuddly robo bear.Warning : Spoilers Ahead. The bear was actually less annoying than some movie sidekicks (such as Jar Jar Binks) cause he seemed a bit angry. The bear kept making these grunts and growls whenever the plot started to stink, almost as if he was "really" pissed at being part of this lame adventure. Ironically, the bear seemed to be the smartest of all the lifeforms, having a foresight for what might happen in the future (such as saving a lock of hair from the mother so that David could become real). Go figure... 2000 years later Earth's new lifeform bring David's mother back to life thanks to DNA! They also tell us how subspace particles are related to life and how that life conduit can only be used once (I guess this is only true for organic life; not mechas), thanks Speilberg, you are truly a god! Tell us how it is! The movie's message isn't difficult to deliver, however, and Spielberg drives it home relentlessly. It will no doubt get some people thinking, for others crying, and a few of us laughing (the peak of this will be when the Blue Fairy comes to life as a Disney animated projection at the end to deliver the moral of the story).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS I like Steven Spielberg, despite his irritating inability to refrain from sentimentality and pompousness. I think he is a great filmmaker with a bad case of the maudlin. I was prepared to really like this movie. I hated it. This movie is a disaster. Bad storytelling. Bad story. The first half hour is basically mindnumbing exposition of scifi mumbo jumbo. It bored me to tears. Compare to 2001: no exposition, no speeches, nothing but astonishing iconic classic genius visuals. How people dare to put Kubrick and Spielberg in the same breath is beyond me. Next HJO shows up. He is a very professional actor but he leaves me cold. Not very likable. Very technical. I can't get worked up over his predicament because he is a robot, so why should I give a damn. The only person that shows a spark of life in this movie is Jude Law. The movie wakes up when he is in the frame. I liked Teddy too, I hope they market one in K-Mart so I can buy it. AI is not an intelligent film. It's a film for nerds that love big scifi words. Scores very low in the emotional intelligence scale which means in the maturity, logical, common sensical scale. It has a number of stunning visuals. Robot in the pool. Simple and devastating: classic Spielberg. And I loved seeing NYC underwater: that's where it deserves to be. But it seems to me that there was much more care put into the sfx than into the storytelling. I'll take Pinocchio instead.</fullReview>

Not that you can compare it to truly bad movies like "dude, where's my car", but it wasn't supposed to be bad, it was a huge-budget Speilberg flick. This made it all the more disappointing. Numerous gaping plot holes leave the story as just boring, non-engaging filler. Much of the movie simply did not make sense when you consider the characters supposed motivation. Speilberg did not engage us intellectually OR emotionally with this one for several reasons.And I LOVE Kubrik films. This one did him no honor whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this film with a great deal of anticipation and excitement. I've been a fan of Steven Spielberg's ever since seeing "Duel" in 1971. However, like "The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Spielberg covers no new ground in "AI." Just as "The Lost World" was a poor retelling of the 1976 remake of "King Kong," "AI" revisits ground already covered by "Star Trek: The Next Generation" TV series and films.Spielberg leaves unanswered questions already answered by STTNG and Isaac Asimov in his robot novels and short stories. In fact, I saw nothing original about "AI" at all! The film leaves too many loose ends and the films most interesting character, played by Jude Law, is left with virtually nothing to do. Too bad we couldn't be watching his story.The visual style of the film is very good, but we've seen it before in "Blade Runner." This film, like too many Hollywood films, is all style and no story. Chris Columbus covered very similar ground when he adapted Isaac Asimov's "Bicentennial Man." Spielberg would have done better for himself, and more importantly the paying customer, by reading the works of Asimov who dealt with artificial intelligence in dozens of short stories and novels written over a sixty year period.I left the theater feeling cheated after watching "AI" and wonder if Spielberg forgot that he once said a good story was the foundation to a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I should state that I believe a movie ought to be pretty darned good to go over 2 hours. A.I. isn't good enough. The characters are undeveloped and I found myself not liking any of them. Feeling sympathetic for a character, as I felt for David, doesn't mean the character was well-developed, however. The last twenty minutes or so felt like old Steven decided to try and re-live the ET magic. It was tacked on and just...kept...going...on.... This could have been a very good movie - shorten it, spend more time developing the background (my lord, but the narrator was ridiculous - we all get the Pinocchio metaphor - how could we not?) and characters.One question, though - didn't anyone consider that these adoptive parents would get bored with a kid who stays the same age forever - especially when their fake kid looks like all the other fake kids?</fullReview>

The utter lack of excitement or humor or anything else we go to see a movie for, it made my butt hurt in the theater chair. Spielberg is still the man, however, he is not the same man as Kubrick.Haley Joel Osment gave this film its only redeeming quality. He has outstanding range as an actor.

		<fullReview>AI seemed like a great concept that just got a bit confused. The first half hour or so seemed just fine, until you realize that it has been half an hour and the movie hasn't really begun yet. Character development was rushed to the point that you don't like or care about anyone (except Teddy). If the movie had ended after the second act, it would not have been that bad, but then came the third act. This part was totally unnecessary, and nothing more than annoying. As soon as the third act began, I thought that it would be a quick wrap up, but it went on for what seemed like an hour. Every time I thought they were going to wrap it up, there was a new development. It was as though the film makers realized that they had no ending, so they just kept adding "stuff" so that they wouldn't have to face that fact. I can only assume that the Federal Government stepped in and forced them to end the picture. This "film" was not art by any means, it was an experiment to see how much people will take before they start rioting and tear down the theatre (believe me, I considered it...) Please avoid A.I., those are two and one half hours of your life that you will NEVER get back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comment is difficult to make, as I've admired some of Spielberg's past movies. But this movie...this movie is TERRIBLE! First of all, I've never seen so many excellent camera angles...that were ripped off of another director, i.e. Stanley Kubrick. The bathroom scene was a blatant example (plus the fact that Gigolo Joe looks -- and dances -- a great deal like Alex from "A Clockwork Orange"). The tones of the movie shifted too rapidly. It went in between Kubrick's icy intelligence to Spielberg's emotions like a crazy sine wave. There is no one in the movie to identify with, or to root for. David's parents are despicable, Gigolo Joe wasn't on screen long enough, every "orga" human child is a spoiled brat, and David himself is creepy. The only good character was Teddy! Plus, for a movie that's supposed to be original, why did it rip off both "The Wizard of Oz" and "Pinnochio"...especially when there is no way David could ever turn into a real boy? Finally, I've never seen a movie with such a tacked on ending. Honestly! It's ridiculous to have aliens that are obviously more advanced than human beings philosophizing about the extinct human beings' "spirit" and "genius." To top it all off, the score is completely wrong for this movie. I'm sorry Mr. Spielberg, but your attempts at wrenching my heart strings have failed. You did, however, make me feel extremely sick at heart.</fullReview>

I don't know if it had something to do with Spielberg trying to stick to Kubrick's original ideas or what but this movie was laughable (literally). I was in a jam packed theater and the movie is somewhat flowing and it kept me very interested on a visual level. However, the last 40 or so minutes a majority of the viewers at this theater were laughing at scenes that were obviously meant to be serious and emotional. I too could not help but laugh at some of these over the top scenes as well. Spielberg had a couple of chances to end this movie in earlier scenes and save face. Instead he chose to take a Disney approach to movie making and the result is a bad movie. I am somewhat embarressed for some of the great performances given by Haley and Jude. They did an outstanding job but this movie was a big disappointment and no one should pay $8 to go see this. It is not good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If "Eyes Wide Shut" hadn't been such an iffy effort, I might surmise that Stanley Kubrick would be spinning in his grave with the release of Spielberg's take on his A.I. project. Something tells me he still wouldn't be best pleased to see his idea subjected to the Spielberg Schmaltz Machine.Revealing himself as totally bankrupt in the imagination account, Spielberg recycles bits from his Greatest Hits collection: the first sight of David (the artificial boy) recalls the first sight of the alien in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," the moon motif evokes "E.T.," the inexplicable teddy bear is a reborn Gremlin (with the voice of Hal the computer, from "2001: A Space Odyssey") and, most reprehensibly, the Flesh Fair smells of "Schindler's List." The cocoon-like bed in the boy's room even has the Dreamworks logo to lull the kid to sleep!But this would be almost tolerable if the story itself weren't so dismally flawed: full of inconsistencies and unmotivated acts. If humanity could create a robot (not to mention a child's toy) that can remain active for 2000 years, how could they not come up with a way to maximize or replace their resources so that the robots weren't necessary in the first place? If a mecha boy is destroyed by eating spinach (take THAT, Popeye), how does he remain untouched by being submerged in water? If all of Manhattan (with its underground power cables) is under 50 storeys of water, how does William Hurt's character maintain a home and laboratory at the top of a skyscraper? What on earth caused the creeped-out mother first to activate the love-imprint and then agree to abandon the loving son? Nothing in Monica Swinton's behavior as shown caused either act to make sense. And let's not forget: who the heck is providing the voice-over?The question about Monica nods to the odd undertone of misogyny in the entire film. Let's leave aside the startling entrance gates to Rouge City, where pneumatic babes with their heads flung back fellate each car as it approaches. The notion of the artificial boy appears meant only for mothers. When David's imprinting is activated, he calls Monica "Mommy" but Henry is still "Henry." Apparently, only mothers who lose sons are in need of this artifical support. The only compassionate female in the film is a mecha nanny at the Flesh Fair, who consists only of a body and a face: the camera makes it quite clear that there is no brain behind the features. I found myself consumed with curiosity about the nature of Spielberg's relationship with his own mommy.One of the greatest flaws, however, is Spielberg's avoidance of the question he poses at the very beginning of the film. One of the great scientist's assistants asks, "Once you've made a robot love a person, how do you get that person to love the robot? It's a moral question, isn't it?" Indeed it is, but Spielberg isn't going to waste his time on anything profound and moral. Too busy with his modernized fairy-tale, he won't even address what the nature of love is. Because what David evinces is not love, it is programmed obsession. The film, already mistitled (nothing in the film has ANYTHING to do with artificial "intelligence" -- except perhaps the making of it), isn't even dealing with artificial emotion.But nothing -- NOTHING -- in the film prepares you for the barrage of saccharine implicit in the last 15-20 minutes. Instead of ending this disaster where it made the best cinematic sense to, with David endlessly imploring the Blue Fairy to make him a real boy, Spielberg tacks on a nauseating and profoundly pointless coda in which David gets...well, what? What exactly did he gain? The ending was so manipulative (Spielberg's calling-card) and syrupy as to make this viewer need a shower.Save your money. Don't be Spielberg's enabler.</fullReview>

And it's our boy Steve doing it to us again! Just the notion that he resorted to using a superior alien life form to resolve his plot, however Kubrick may have intended it, was just too much to take. Funny thing was, one row up in the theatre, a group of people were making much the same comments that other reviewers on here have made: chop the ending at the ferris wheel scene. Filmies will no doubt adore the pic (it *is* well acted, impressive visually, and getting to see Manhattan under 400 feet of water was a treat), but I'd tell everyone else to avoid it.

		<fullReview>I honestly tried to like this movie, but it disappointed on so many levels. The story is choppy and new story lines are introduced in a near linear format. At points its unclear what direction the movie was heading. After awhile I just stopped caring. Top it of with gratuitous violence and overt sexual content that are meaningless to the story. I'm no prude, but they are marketing the movie to a PG-13 audience. The child abandonment aspect makes it horrible in appropriate for young adopted children.Disney knew how to stir the emotions of a child and deliver them back to safely with a parent by his/ her side. This movie shocks and disturbs the child without the confidence of a caring parent to protect them. There's one positive depiction of an African-American woman who discussed the conundrum of a machine programmed to love a human and possibility of a human failing to love a machine. This was a wonderful morality discussion. However, the next interaction with an African-American is an Amos and Andy, blackface robot being destructed in a gruesome `angry mob' display. We discussed the movie on our way home. The conclusion was disappointment and resentment for attempting to force tears. The trailers lead you to believe that a rejected child automaton joins a band of rebels fighting to achieve a superior goal. It's as if they mixed the worst aspects of Blade Runner, E.T., and Pinocchio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me not waste time, THIS MOVIE SUCKED! Speilberg should be ashamed. Only someone with the power that Speilberg has would ever be able to get a movie like this greenlighted. I am not kidding, SKIP this movie. It is a pathetic retelling of the old Pinoccio story. It was done much, MUCH better on a few different episodes of Star Trek: TNG.Let me say again, this movie was really bad! I mean I could not BELIEVE how terrible it was! And I don't think Speilberg shot it on actual film stock, I think he just used a paste of Honey and Sugar mixed together! Jeez! This movie was sooooo soppy-sweet. With the big, over-dramatic swells in the music. And Haley Joel Osmints character going on and on about how he "loves his mommy." Over and over again! This movie was so annoying! And it went on FOREVER! TWO AND A HALF HOURS of my life WASTED watching this complete BUTT-DRAG of a movie! This movie was so stupid, the script seemed as though it had been written by a twelve year old girl.I hated every FRAME of this long, boring pile of CRAP and I you are goofy in the head if you liked it.I am voting this movie a 1, ONLY because the IMDB rating system does not go in to negative integers. If it did, I would vote it a MINUS 150, because it basically took away a perfectly good 150 minutes out of my life!Avoid this movie at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie with the expectation of seeing a typical Spielberg feel good masterpiece, I was very disapointed. The movie was more Kubrick than Spielberg, very disturbing violence of a very sick, sick, sick, nature. The star of the show was a very kind boy tossed into a world completely devoid of hope. I almost got up to leave several times but stayed to the very end. Even the ending was a downer. If you want to waste your time and money or for some reason enjoy being bummed out go see this movie, otherwise go see something else. This should never have been rated pg and is NOT for kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film wasn't true to Kubrick's vision, the expectations of the genre or a film of this magnitude, Spielberg wasn't even true to himself. If this film was strictly a Spielberg film, I would be upset, but I would not feel betrayed as I am with the turn-out of this movie. I am a huge Kubrick fan and I do not, I cannot believe for one second that the Stanley Kubrick who made such classics as, A Clockwork Orange (1971) and Dr. Strangelove (1964) had anything to do with this very Spielberg mistake. I can sit here and write complaint after complaint of the content of the movie, from the shameless Chris Rock cameo to the unexplained and completely unrealistic conclusion to the never ending ending. Steven Spielberg has disgraced the memory of his own favourite (and mine) filmmaker Stanley Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I have been waiting in anticipation for this film for months, thinking that perhaps Spielberg would bring to light Kubrick's vision.. Instead I find that the film lacked an atmosphere, and that the Spielberg-Kubrick combination created some contradictory plot twists. The ending was quite poor; A very bizarre bit of obscurity that made no sense. It seemed as if it were trying to be deep and thought-provoking, but in reality wasn't, sort of like a high-school English class poem. A few seconds after the "creatures" (Whom I assume were evolved robots, or something of the sort) told him he could have his mother back for one day, and explained why with some obscure words about the time-space continuem, I walked out, almost outraged by the cinematic inconsistency. They could only revive his mother for one day..? When you clone something, it lives a full live span, this is scientific fact. A lot of it was anachronistic and extremely sentimental (Something us Kubrick fans were worrying about a great deal), if the ice caps melted (Which by the way, would take quite a long time from current projections), why was the culture seemingly the same as it is today, yet there are massive technological breakthroughs? The ice caps will not melt at current projections, for a rather long time, and for most of us, not in our lifetime... We do not wear the same clothes as did people in the late 1800s, and our culture is very different.I've only walked out of two films, Battlefield Earth.. and this. Not to say that they're on the same level, oh no, as a science fiction movie AI was not bad(Not great either), but trying to live up to Kubrick in plot, appearance, and cinematography, was obviously behind Speilberg's capability, and in my opinion, a complete disaster. I think that the man needs to watch 2001 and A Clockwork Orange once again before attempting to give homage to the late, great Stanley any more.</fullReview>

Unfortunately they threw together a cheezy as hell, grabbing at a way to tie this thing up, narrated ending. Whenever you hear the narrator in this movie all that comes to mind is that they were doing such a poor job of telling the story someone has to walk you through it.

At a time when teen suicide is a national problem, Mr. Spielberg has the robot boy committing suicide twice and it's presented as acceptable. I am an admirer of Mr. Spielberg and when he makes a good movie it's usually great but when he makes a bad movie its big time garbage. This is GARBAGE!!!!!!!!. A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.

		<fullReview>I went to see this film in a theatre for two reasons. One, I believed from what I had seen in previews that one of its merits would be its presence on the big screen (I was wrong since most of it was just talking heads). Two, I was anxious, like many people, to see what Spielberg would do with something that had once passed through the mind of Stanley Kubrick. In a nutshell, if there had ever been anything of merit in Kubrick's original idea, it had been "Spielberg-ed" out of it a long time ago. The irony of the title in relation to the handling of its subject matter is painfully obvious. Spielberg uses all the artifices of manipulative Hollywood cinema to have us believe that he is dealing with "intelligent" subject matter. Ultimately, he is doing nothing more than yet again playing at being one notch above the public, continuing his self-appointed roll as "teacher" (begun in films such as Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan) by treating us like we are stupider and more easily manipulated than anything Pavlov could have hoped for. When will we learn that 'complex and subtle' does not mean 'it made me cry'! So very, very unfortunately, this ends up being a thinly strung together story drowned in a swamp of overused and sappy music, plot holes so big they would make a first year film student blush and so little imagination one is duty-bound to wonder how this guy can so easily continue to make money off our backs. The only scene worth mentioning is the one in which Jude Law tries to explain to a sobbing woman why she should not be afraid to have sex with him even though he is a robot. It was the only scene that spoke of genuine(ish)human fears and the (possible) unusual problems one might face when creating an artificial human being.

		<fullReview>***lots of spoilers included***please continue only if you have seen A.I.******With all due repect to SS and the late Mr. Kubrick, this film was utter drivel. A promising first act centers on the potential for a life-like robotic boy replacing a human emotionally rather than mechanically. Plot, such as there is, soon veers off into fairy tales (pinnochio, wizard of oz) and finally screeches to a halt with a "waterworld" meets "close encounters" ending that drags on for at least a half hour longer than it should, culminating in a painfully saccharine ending. On the plus side, Jude Law is excellent, the cinematography and especially the intricate CGI are stellar, and the brief middle section which adroitly deals with racism, in the form of a demolition derby of used and abused robots is quite creative. On the minus side, incredibly slow pacing interrupted by moments of psychotic behaviour by the robot-boy, annoying psudo-narration, truly unlikeable characters (Are we really supposed to like "david"?) and Mack truck sized plot holes (The father taking home a unique prototype from work and having his wife sign for it later? The company never checking on the prototype? The most blatent and telling being after William Hurt has finally reunited with "david" HE LEAVES HIM ALONE to gather other people. I guess they don't have pagers or phones in the robotic future. ) I wont even go into the translucent aliens who can reincarnate the dead "for one day only" By then I was just counting the minutes until the torture ended. The film offers many intriging questions, then ignores them, such as the future is bleak as water levels have risen hundreds of feet and government dictates human reproduction to conserve limited resources. Yet the family we see lives a 'normal' suburban lifestyle, nary a mention of any problems.The pity is I wanted to like this film, in the end, I wanted to walk out on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst ending to a great movie ever; SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a majority of its running time, A.I. promises to be the best movie this year, and possibly one of the best films ever. There is hardly a wrong step in the script, acting, direction, scoring, set design, special effects, or cinematography for the longest time.Then, the film comes to a dead end: David, the robot child (mecha) played by Haley Joel Osment, is trapped underwater at the end of a long journey. His programming becomes caught on an endless loop, and the camera begins to zoom out. It would have worked as the end of the film. A depressing end, but one which the film lead to the entire time. Instead, Spielberg delivers the most outrageous deus ex machina I've ever seen in a film, or even a Greek tragedy. A narrator, a tool which is very out of date, begins to speak: "David stayed that way for two thousand years." In those two thousand years, another ice age arises, and with it the extinction of mankind. We see the frozen landscape that used to be NY City underwater, and through it flies an alien spacecraft. The aliens have uncovered David, and they revive him in order to learn all they can about the extinct human race. They bring David to a research center, designed after his former home, a la 2001: A Space Odyssey. The aliens, who have apparently learned English from studying Osment's program, choose to revive his mother, because that is what he wants more than anything.What results is meant to be touching, but it is the least truthful and most cloying ending you could ever imagine. This is a worse cheat than the bookends of Saving Private Ryan or the modern day grave sequence in Schindler's List, a scene that more or less diminished that otherwise great film significantly. The mood of the rest of the movie was one of mourning and cynicism. Human beings are shown to be liars and users, uncaring murderers. David's original owners abandon him because of their impatience, and treat him as if he is a toy, not a human being. And the most ironic thing about that ending is that, although all the cues tell us that we're supposed to be sentimental about this whole meeting, we know as an audience (or at least I knew; many people were, in fact, crying) that this mother is entirely fabricated. After she dies, which will happen when she falls asleep after the first night, David will be the subject of study for the aliens, as much as Dave Bowman of 2001 was in that film. If Spielberg would have held that irony at the surface, instead of burying it under craploads of false sentimentality, it had potential to be profound. I still could have done without the ridiculous looking aliens, but I also could have accepted it. The film ends on such a blatantly false moment that most of the audience, any who are intelligent enough to be able to identify and follow the themes of the rest of the film, will stumble out dumbfounded at the way Spielberg shoots himself in the foot. Others will coo like the dumb pigeons that they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As bad as summer movies can get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had awaited the release of this film with great anticipation. After all it is the first Spielberg-directed film in several years.What can I say? I was disappointed almost beyond description. The film should have been called AE: Almost Entertainment, though that description would be generous, because it's rarely entertaining. The most appropriate words to describe this film would be: boring, creapy, stultifying, offensive, insulting, boring, dumb, and boring.I dislike making a spectacle of myself by walking out on a film, but I made an exception this afternoon. I got up and left with about five minutes left, but I really don't think the film could have redeemed itself in that time.There are two good things in the film: Haley Joel Osment, who gives an amazing performance in an impossible situation, and Jude Law, who can't seem to give a bad performance, no matter how bad the film.In summation: Stanley Kubrick really MUST be rolling over in his grave at the mess that's been made of his final project. What a shame the studios didn't let him make this film, rather than forcing him to complete EYES WIDE SHUT first. Did Steven Spielberg really think he was equal to this film's challenge?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I used to say that I had never seen a bad Spielberg movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know where to start. I guess I should say at the outset that I made the statement to some of my friends recently, that I have never seen a Steven Spielberg film I didn't like. That was true. It isn't anymore. A. I. is...is...let me see if I can come up with a pithy, succinct, yet subtle statement regarding my opinion of this movie. This movie sucks. Okay, so it's not subtle. But, as the saying goes, two out of three ain't bad. You don't appreciate the term "sucks"? How about pure dreck? How about really, dreadfully, bloody awful? I cannot remember the last time that I saw such an egregious waste of acting talent, time, and money on what was billed as one of the blockbuster movies of the summer. Practically every channel on cable television ran "A. I." promos over and over. I fell for them. I couldn't wait to see this movie. I should have waited. The credits said that Spielberg wrote the screenplay for this disaster. If he was smart, he would take his name off of this script.The movie actually starts off with a great deal of promise. A couple has lost their son to some unexplained accident? He is in some sort of suspended animation, but they are told that the current medical technology isn't capable of saving him. So...they get a robot to replace him. A "special" one. One that can love a human. Okay. I'll buy that. This isn't going to be easy, but they'll learn to love him, right? Well, they do. The kid is a little annoying at times, but hey, he's a robot, remember? Then all at once, the real son who was thought to be a goner, comes back. An unexplained medical miracle. I wish I had a dollar for each example of all of the other unexplained crap in this movie. Oh dear. Now there's gonna be conflict between the real son and the one manufactured from silicon. Okay, maybe that will be interesting. Not so. The real kid is an annoying little brat and the silicon kid tries to kill him. Hey, here's some good conflict, right? Well, maybe not. Mom, the one who wanted him in the first place and claims to love him dearly, takes him out and abandons him in the woods. So much for motherly love. Neither she, nor the husband, nor the bratty kid make another appearance until the very end of the movie when Mom shows up briefly for the last scene. We never see Dad or annoying sibling again. When little David the robot gets dumped in the dark, scary woods, this abomination of a script just goes absolutely, stupidly bizarre, and that's the nicest thing I can say about it. From here on out we get a conglomeration of "The Wizard of Oz", "Pinocchio", "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", "Road Warrior", and probably a few other motifs that I didn't recognize. David the robot wants to become a "real boy". He has all kinds of adventures in his search. He should have gone to see Harry Potter, but I guess he wasn't available. Whatever. One of the most annoying, pointless scenes in the latter part of this movie is the sudden, and completely unexplained appearance of his creator, the part played by William Hurt. Will Spielberg or someone tell me what the purpose of this scene was? Please? Hurt shows up in the drowned city of Manhattan. He tells Davis a bunch of mysterious mumbo jumbo, and then he says that he is going to go get some people who want to see David and then he disappears. Never to be seen again. Huh? What was that all about? It just goes on and on. I honestly thought that this movie was over three different times. Here I am all primed for the final scene and then this whole jumbled mess takes off again. I distinctly remember saying to myself, "When is this going to end so I can go back out in the sunlight?" As things turned out, not soon enough. Save your money. Go buy your self an ice cream cone. This movie sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was Speilberg thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI (Artificial Intelligence) epitomizes what is wrong with the movie-making crowd these days. So many filmakers seem to be completely out-of-touch with the movie-going public. We want to be entertained and amazed, not bored and duped. Whatever happened to the art of storytelling? This is a movie that is overly-long and tedious. It tries to be grandiose in its philosophy, but misses the point time after time and eventually devolves into silliness. Its futuristic technologies are not consistent. It blatanly rips off old-time fairy tales in an attempt to save itself, and instead comes across as only ludicrous. Instead of having heart it settles for being sappy. The last half-hour in particular was an affront to my intelligence (artificial or otherwise).</fullReview>

While the movie attempted to evoke an emotional response, it failed miserably. Excruciatingly dull and predictable. The ending reeked of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Mr. Spielberg, please do not recycle your movies! Close Encounters is too good for that! Sex-bots, what more can I say! Overall a poorly acted, edited and directed film, but I guess even Mr. Spielberg can get it wrong occasionally. If Spielberg's name were not plastered all over this movie, it would fade into the background like so many others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg owes me $42. AI is a Bad Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI is a bad movie. People started walking out of the theater after about an hour. I stayed thinking it would have to get better. I was wrong.AI starts with an interesting premise but quickly devolves to where it becomes laughable. Going into a movie made by Kubrick and Spielberg I had very high hopes. The first chip in those hopes unfortunately came in the first few seconds of the movie where a narrator explains what terrible thing we humans did to the world (AI seems to take place in the near future, perhaps 2300).None of the characters are likable or even interesting, although Gigolo Joe did provide some nice comic relief. The mom who decides it's a good idea to drop off her "son" in the forest to fend for himself. Come on! The gratuitous wrestle-mania meets Robo-wars violence was disgraceful. The hokey Ewok-inspired sidekick teddybear made me go "pfffttt" whenever he came on the screen. The Close Encounters-inspired, all-knowing, benevolent heros at the end were like a 12-year old's school story, "and then I woke up from a dream...". The Star Wars-inspired "stay on target" scene was just a blatant rip off and I can't imagine why they bothered. There's more characters to hate but these ones jump out from my memory. Add to this the fact that the story is so weak and incongruous that they repeatedly have to introduce Obi-Wan like characters to explain why yet another unbelievable situation is actually plausible. Uh, that could happen. Really. No Really!Even all of this would be forgivable if the actual message of the movie wasn't so awful. "Just keep hoping all your problems will go away and they will." No need to actually do anything to work toward your goals, overcome any obstacles showing your strong character, or even be subject to those silly rules rational people call the physical laws of the universe -- like gravity. Just sit down and keep repeating, "There's no place like home." I hate to even reference a wonderful movie like The Wizard of Oz. AI is no Wizard of Oz.This is a bad movie. Stephen Spielberg should be ashamed of himself. At least if it were a Kubrick movie it wouldn't have a silly, cuddly, completely ridiculous ending. I blew $17 on tickets and $25 for a babysitter, but that isn't nearly as bad as the three wasted hours of my life for this incredibly disappointing movie. Go buy DVDs of ET and 2001 and have a nice evening at home. Kevin</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have anything good to say about this flick. It's pretty depressing. Perhaps this is because my own birth mother deserted me as a small child. Who knows?I'll not waste a lot of time evaluating all that happens; you know the story. I'll just briefly relate the things that bug me the most: My main objection is: David has no choice in anything that happens to him, and it's almost all bad. He goes from a potentially fulfilling situation to a lousy situation to horrible to almost certainly deadly to uncertain and then ends up pathetic. Swell. Why not give him a dose of 'mecha' Tuberculosis just for kicks??And then when he finally gets what he wants and needs, it's only for one day and then it's gone forever. Pathetic.The other thing that irks me is the notion that the Earth's great cities will one day be under 200 feet of water. There's no Liberal Agenda at work there, is there?? That's all the attention this flick deserves. I'll never watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artificial Intelligence -- The movie review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amidst a world deluged and decimated by the oceans bestirred by adverse greenhouse effects and where laws forbade children to couples save under a license , artificial beings (mechas) are created subservient to human needs.Professor Hobby (William Hurt, head of Cybertronics) creates a robot child that is capable of love.At the onset , a poignant topic seems to have been broached up by the question which is strikingly germane to the story that follows "If a robot could genuinely love a person, what responsibility does that person hold toward that mecha ( robot) in return ?"Professor Hobby responds with another provoking thought , "In the beginning, didn't God create Adam to love him?"A hapless couple whose child lay in terminal cryo-statis is proffered David- The artificial robot child.After some quaint encounters Monica accepts David as her child and things burgeon wonderfully for the mecha until Martin , the couple's child , miraculously returns .A kind of sibling- rivalry ensues between David and Martin. And Martin later convinces David to go to Monica in the middle of the night and cut off a lock of her hair.An indubitably human side of David is portrayed throughout the remainder of the movie wherein David's ingenuousness and artlessness serve to remove all conjectures that it might only be a programmed code that moves the mecha.There is something supremely touching in David's endeavours to get to the blue fairy so that he can be made "real" and Monika might love him more.While David flounders along with teddy in waters of Coney island the Wonder Wheel falls on their vehicle , David adamantly asks to be turned into a real boy, repeating his wish to the blue fairy till eternity.Here the movie almost seems to end with the masterpiece.Herein we are suddenly presented with brilliant surprise. Two thousand years have passed the ocean freezes in another ice age and Davids power has drained away.David is revived by alien hands and he walks to the frozen Blue Fairy statue, which collapses as he touches it. The now highly-advanced mechas have evolved into an intelligent beings and understand what David really yearns for.David's refractory , unyielding love for his mother even after two thousand memory drowning years , is shocking and soars beyond all selfishness of human love.The hair that David cut is used by the intelligent beings to revive David's mother for a day -- perhaps for eternity and the movie ends. The ending reflects the genius of Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. is pure magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Science-fiction has been one of my favorite genres ever. Of course, there are a lot of science-fiction movies that I have liked and praised throughout my entire life as a movie-goer. Some of those films includes: The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Total Recall, Blade Runner, Minority Report and Rollerball. But, when I saw A.I. for the very first time, I was thrilled and moved. A.I. Artificial Intelligence is a film that was written and directed by Steven Spielberg. The film tells the story about a young robot child named David (Haley Joel Osment), who is brought into a world where global warming runs amok and a giant megacorporation called "Mecha" developed robots for humans. The young David was made by "Mecha" by a scientist named Professor Hobby (William Hurt) . A young couple has just received news that their only son, Martin, slipped into a coma. So, the father of the family decides to bring home a robot from the company. The little boy is named David, and in the beginning of the movie and in the beginning of his new life with his new family, David is unknowingly not accepted by his new mother, Monica (Frances O' Connor). She and David can't seem to relate to one another. After Monica receives news that Martin has come out of his coma, the father, Henry (Sam Robards) decides to bring Martin home. But, there's a sibling rivalry between Martin and David. In fact, David is programmed to show unconditional love. But, his human family isn't prepared for the consequences. After David's protection system is activated by one of Martin's friends during a pool party, he hides behind Martin for protection, leading them to fall into a pool. The human family can't seem to understand David's capabilities on what he can do. One day, Monica decides to abandoned David on the side of the road, leaving him and a robot teddy bear named "Teddy" (voiced by Jack Angel). Now, all alone and no one to guard him from danger, David decides to ventured out into the open world, where his objective is to find the Blue Fairy that is mentioned in the famous fairy tale, Pinocchio. Later on in the film, David meets another robot named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law). He, too, is also made from "Mecha". So, Gigolo Joe and David team up together as they roamed around the open world of technology by trying to find the Blue Fairy that David is obsessed with. His obsession leads him to the bottom of flooded Manhattan, where he encounters a statue that resembled the Blue Fairy. As mentioned above, A.I. was written and directed by Steven Spielberg himself, but another director, Stanley Kubrick, also was in the development of making A.I. back in the 1970's. Kubrick's ideas was to have David be an actual robot instead of a actor. But, Haley Joel Osment is so good as David. He plays David so precisely through emotion and authenticity. The art-direction of this movie is great. I mean, I have never seen a future quite like this. One of my personal favorite scenes is when David and Gigolo Joe get to Rouge City. Rouge City is perhaps the best looking futuristic metropolis since Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. This look of the future is so good-looking and so extraordinary that we are actually living inside this movie. Another thing that was brought up during the movie and even after the movie was the combination behind Kubrick's ideas and Spielberg's original ideas. I believe that both of their ideas worked. You have this robot child that has the ability to love, but the family that he is adopted from doesn't seem to love him. Instead, the family loves Martin, more than they loved David. Yet, robots in this future are the lower existing factor of this world. Spielberg's ideas makes the movie worked, also. The reason why is because it's obvious that in his movies, the young boy or young man questions his appearance, identity, existence and even, his love. This is one of the first of two science-fiction movies that Spielberg was involved in. The following year, he directed Minority Report starring Tom Cruise. What I like in both movies is the vision of the future. It is so optimistic, yet it is not clichd or predictable in any shape or way or form. A.I. dares us to ask questions about technology. Can we cope with it? Can we reason with it? Can we accept robots as humans? These are questions we can't answer, yet we can see where it leads us. Those questions are just as important as anything that is original. Still, A.I. proves to be a new sci-fi classic from director Steven Spielberg. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 1/2 3 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that definitely ended up with the right director...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg directing a project originally meant for Stanley Kubrick is, for some film lovers, an idea of hell. However I think the story absolutely found the right director, who, despite being famous for over-sentimentality, takes this futuristic fairy tale (Essentially just updated "Pinocchio") and makes it personal and relatable. It's actually surprising at times how this story, which is a kid's story in disguise, is one of Spielberg's most adulterated movies.The film is made up of three very different segments, all tied together by the main character, David, played fantastically by Haley Joel Osment. It still surprises me that he is no longer famous, since he had more fantastic performances (Forrest Gump, Sixth Sense, A.I.) than some major actors have ever had. Osment brings across the robotic side of David through his slightly impersonal side, but also the emotion and pathos of the child. The first segment, which takes up roughly the first half of the film, deals with the idea of being different and being accepted. It shows the struggle that David's mother is having in accepting him as part of the family, knowing him to be a robot and not her real son. We also see the sibling rivalry between the real son and the robotic son, who only wants to be loved by his mother.The second segment is when Jude Law enters, and deals with the loss of innocence. David is thrown out of his simple household life into the dark world of a twisted anti-Mecha destruction fair, a whole city built on sex and a murder. Jude Law's performance is fantastic as the robot gigolo, and he proves himself to be a strangely effective mentor and carer for the child. The 'Dr. Know' scene is really interesting and Robin Williams is the perfect voice for the role. When eventually David is trapped staring at the Blue Fairy statue, you see just how much he longs to be loved, how he is only a child, and it is a feeling that the viewer can easily build up a connection to.The third segment is strange but acts as a fitting conclusion to the story. The futuristic robots seem slightly out of place because the majority of the movie doesn't include them, but David's brief reunion with his mother is very emotional, and Spielberg leaves it on a fantastic ending, leaving what happens next to be ambiguous, but making us know what really happens. "A.I." has to be one of Spielberg's best movies in years and it's proof yet again that he is one of the greatest living directors. The film is visually enthralling, superbly acted and tells a story that we all have a connection to in one way or another.</fullReview>

Emotional, futuristic, idealistic, dramatic, humorous, advanced, wonderful...Even now, 12 years later, this movie manages to continue one- upping the rest.The special effects has not (surprisingly) dated in the least. Sure, to some the FX is not up-to-par with today's standards. But it's not exactly unrealistic.If you allow yourself to get lost in the movie: You'll see how wonderful it is.

		<shortDescription>Beautiful sci-fi with great emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twelve years before his death the legendary Stanley Kubrick worked on conceptualizing a science fiction epic called A.I. Along the way he collaborated heavily with Steven Spielberg, eventually allowing him to direct it. Kubrick passed in 1999 and Spielberg finished the film for release in 2001. In many ways, A.I. Artificial Intelligence is the final film from Stanley Kubrick. For this reason alone it is a must see.In the film, Haley Joel Osment stars as David, an android who has been built to love. But, when granting a robot these kinds of human emotions you run into a lot of speed bumps on the way. These speed bumps are things that David encounters and must overcome as he journeys to find the Blue Fairy who will make him a real boy so that his adopted mother, Monica, will love him the way he wants to be loved. A.I. throws us into a world where artificially intelligent robots run rampant to the point where they are just a regular thing in society. However, David is one of a kind, and so is his story.This film makes its intentions quite clear throughout. It wants to be an incredibly emotional and incredibly heartfelt science fiction film, more so than any film we've seen before. I would say that, for the most part, it absolutely succeeds. It's an exquisitely moving film that is fueled by a sci-fi backdrop. David's quest for self discovery and his longing to be real is an enthralling and captivating story. David is as real as any human being in emotion, which makes it all the more difficult to see him as an android whose emotional connection is all artificial. It's the challenge that the film puts forth and the moral ground that it covers. It makes you look to the future and consider if artificial intelligence is really something that could pay off in this magnitude, or is it really this necessary? Not only does A.I. provide a heart wrenching story, but it is set against a magnificent and wondrous science fiction world full of landscapes, cities, buildings, and vehicles that all look astounding. This is a conceptually brilliant film that never falters as a visual spectacle. It's certainly on a grand scale, one more grandiose than the story at hand, but it doesn't hurt the film. The only things that really keep A.I. from being a masterpiece are small issues with dialogue and performances, and the fact that it's emotion can be somewhat heavy handed and force fed at times, teetering on melodrama rather than sincerity. These things don't keep this film from being great, though, because it is still highly original and a marvelous spectacle to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Fatalist Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review will contain spoilers, meant for audiences that have already seen this movie.Many questions popped up in my mind as to the authenticity of this film. Immediately I began to wonder about Professor Hobby and what I personally foreshadowed to be Dr. Frankenstein. I thought, already, that this movie was flawed. When a reporter sitting near him asks him the moral question along the lines of "What would be the human responsibility when machines love us?", I thought absolutely nothing. End of movie.As the scene drew to a close, I knew this was not over. We had only seen 10 minutes of the film, and that sickening motorization of the female prototype as it put on makeup gave an eerie feeling. I had not realized that there was more to AI than just motor functions. Neither did the media covering Cybertronics. And that is what I figured would be attempted here.It turns out this is not a sci-fi horror. This is not I Robot or I Am Legend. The simple fact is that humans are not the I, but They. AI are the creations, which the movie shows us essentially evolve as the the story progresses. At first you have this box TV with legs saying 90 years ago he was the hit fashion on Sharper Image magazine or the likes. When it came to David, I had to question his authenticity.David is supposed to be a first-rate android. That means he is at the height of the evolutionary chain at the start of Professor Hobby's expansion into the unknown science of love robots. Before he receives his "board chip", which puts a sort of finalization on his love schematics, he is completely a utilitarian robot designed for basic interaction. With the chip implanted, he becomes more lifelike and the mother likes him.Of course, as this is a fatalist film, something goes wrong. He shows incompetence to act as a normal human child and functions more as an alien life-form, putting the family he is assigned to in awkward positions and has the innate ability to harm. Inevitably, like Frankenstein, he is a freak. But not of nature, by manifestation of artificiality, which I believe to be one of the two main plots.Somewhere towards the end of the first act, his parents agree that he needs to "thrown away". That is where this movie completely fails in its first plot, which is to somehow say that AI has an emotional connection with humans. For starters, they don't present the motive for Professor Hobby creating loving machines besides curiosity. The parents that buy the first love child don't even explain why they want him besides longing for their son's return. So they buy this fake child to replace their sick son? There are some extreme morality issues that are flat-out ignored by humans in this film.I would have given it a 4 out of 10 if that was all to be seen here. Instead, it gets better. Soon after, David is thrown out with Teddy the android bear(who I actually had a personal connection with), into an android landfill. To make things worse, this place turns androids into Public Enemy #1. There are actual android hunters like the one played by the scummy character of Brendan Gleeson. Now the story just took a sharp right turn into Nature vs Artificiality, which can explain about 2/3 of the film.Man is trying to destroy artificiality before it consumes nature. It started with Greenhouse Gases. We saw what it did to New York City. It seems at this point in time there are alternate sources of energy for cars at least, as we seen people driving vehicles without exhaust pipes. We are continuously fooled into thinking there is going to be some co- harmony between AI and humans. But when Gigolo Joe says that humans are jealous of AI because they will outlive humans, we know where this film is going.Not too far ahead, we are reminded of this fantasy that is hope is nothing but a fairy tale in the form of the "blue fairy". It leads us back to Professor Hobby, who we find out created robots out of his own selfishness. He couldn't live with the fact that his boy was dead forever. So he created a hundred Davids. The mastermind of greed attempts and does not falter in trying to convince us that he created something wonderful. In truth, he has created unvalued commodities, numbers on an assembly line.Lo and behold it DOES go down to the deep pits of the underworld, after a ridiculous encounter with a mannequin blue fairy at the bottom of the ocean where Manhattan used to be. Here is the prime example where the first plot fails at epic proportions. Due to his limitation in programming, there is no distinction as to whether there is a loop in his memory board, or he is THAT desperate for love that he asks the blue fairy to make him a "real boy" for 2000 years in the depths of the ocean.Eventually the movie ends with one of the worst movie endings of all time, or quite a good ending if you think about it symbolically, which leaves out the human condition. It involves a world where artificiality has won over nature, in which it looks like almost everything is mechanical or cybernetic, whatever is not considered natural. There is no organic life left on Earth, humans are extinct also. Essentially they do a reverse effect, having the AI be the Creators of artificial humans to bring back David's "mommy".All-in-all a great fatalist piece, a terrible exploration into the "why" of creating AI humanoids, and a failure in making artificial life seem "official". For a happy version of this film, I suggest seeing Bicentennial Man. I also believe they are one in the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. Artificial Intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a futuristic world where humans and robots coexist in a shaky relationship, a robot named David (Haley Joel Osment) is taught to love and is given to a family. Being the first of his kind he is sorely misunderstood and a series of unfortunate events leads to David being on the run. All David wants is to be a real boy, though, and be loved by his mommy Monica (Frances O'Conner). So with his new found friend, Love Bot Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), David travels out to find the Blue Fairy of Pinochio fame to make him a real boy so his mother will love him.AI was originally the brain child of legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, but as he was working on it he felt that the sensibilities of the film better suited a filmmaker such as Steven Spielberg. Stanley Kubrick approached Spielberg with the idea that Kubrick would produce the film, and Spielberg would direct. Of course, Spielberg was excited at the chance, but also reticent at the fact that this was the brainchild of the great Stanley Kubrick. They worked and worked on the project, Kubrick even had voices recorded that eventually appeared in the finished product (including those recorded by Chris Rock, Robin Williams, Meryl Streep, Ben Kingsley, and even Jack Angel who performed the voice of Teddy) until Kubrick had much of the concept art and even the complete treatment. Eventually Spielberg pushed back and asked Kubrick to direct and he would produce, and Kubrick relented but was unable to film the movie prior to his death in March of '99. Out of respect for his friend for the project he was originally asked to do, Spielberg picked up the work on AI and finished the film that Kubrick spent more than 12 years visualizing.AI is a flawed masterpiece. Combining the strengths of two very different filmmakers is definitely the way to create an interesting work, and bringing out the sentimentality of Spielberg and the cynicism of Kubrick makes for great interplay and a certain tension between the two different sensibilities. On the one side you have the power and endurance of love, and on the other side you have the moral dilemma of man playing god and than dehumanizing it's creation. When juggling these two images of modern society Spielberg is at his best, and most of the movie is as good, if not better than anything else the director has ever committed to film.The acting in this film is superb. Most of the movie revolves around Haley Joel Osment who was in his prime at the time (an unfortunate thing to say for a talent so young at the time and so good), and does he shine. Playing the first of his kind to feel love (or is it obsession) you truly feel for a robots plight, one of the few movies to actually grab you in that way. As his companion through most of his plight, you can tell Jude Law as Gigolo Joe is having a blast giving his "Love Bot" (read: sex toy) a bit of the smooth edge of Fred Astair. All of the performances in this movie truly shine though.The problem, and what makes this movie flawed, is Spielberg's recent obsession with overindulgence and the need to place pieces from his older movies in his newer movies where they don't belong. First off, the ending of the movie should have been cut off. I'm not typically the type of person who will hold anything against a long movie, and it's not that this movie is long, it's that the last half hour is completely unneeded and somewhat ridiculous. Some of the acting choices make the last 30 minutes really feel more like outtakes than an integral part of the film. To add to that though, and secondly, Spielberg felt the need to inject scenes that he had planned for Close Encounters of the Third Kind into the end of the movie, confusing audiences as to what's going on in the end with the alien like robots.Over all, I have to say that I did enjoy this movie, and it could have very well been a masterpiece and in ways it is, only if Spielberg hadn't followed his need to overindulge this movie wouldn't have lost steam. I do recommend it though, it's a movie that works well on multiple levels, for either just entertainment, or for further exploration into it's deeper meanings.4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, this movie had a powerful message!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the near future machines are being made of people that have most human qualities, but cannot do simple and important things such as love, but one man decides he is going to change that and he builds a child to use as his experiment. The child is given to the parents of a child who is dying and their only instructions is that once they show the kid love and program him to love them, that he will never love another family and must be destroyed, if they give him up. The woman starts to fall for the kid even though he is strange and needy and has qualities that are very unlike any of human nature. Suddenly the families real Child, Martin, gets well and he is jealous of the "robot" and taunts him into scaring the parents. The mother doesn't like the idea of it, but she fears the life of her family so she takes the child out to the woods and leaves him to fend for himself, and can't bare the thought of him being destroyed. The child soon finds out that mechas, as they are called, aren't looked upon too kindly in the real world. He meets up with an A.I. that was created for sexual pleasures and the man becomes his protector of sorts. The little boys only wish is to become a real boy so his mother will love him and he knows of the story of Pinocchio and looks hard to find the blue fairy that will help him become real, not aware that she isn't real, but his journey becomes one of the greatest stories of love I have ever seen on film.This movie has been in my collection for many years and I had no desire to watch it. I thought it would be Sci-fi garbage and I was wrong by miles. This movie made me cry it was so powerful. The big picture here is about love. They created a machine in hopes it would love, and it turns out it has a stronger love than most humans could dream of.The editing was great. Spielberg's direction was good, the music was good and the production and effects was top notch. Kubrick had held onto this for a long time and I am glad he finally turned it over.I normally don't care for the kid actors and had not liked Haley Joel Osment before, but this movie made me change my opinion on him and thought he did a great job. I was happy with all of the casting, William Hurt, Jude Law, Brendan Gleeson, Jake Thomas, Robin Williams, Jack Angel, Meryl Streep, Ben Kingsley, and Chris Rock all deserve nods...I also love Ministry and glad they were on this movie.The movie was a surprise to me, it does have some slow parts, but for the most part it's entertaining from beginning to end. Great story, production, and acting and nice effects with a touch of Aliens at the end. A great film for those who like sci-fi and for anyone who wants a true movie with love being the message. 7 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001, Dir. Steven Spielberg) In the future, artificial intelligence has involved in such a way that a family can now accept a near to life like child. This is exactly what the Swinton family does, but when things get worse for the relationship between the family and this new child, they send it out to survive on its own. With only the name David (Osment) and a passion to become a real boy, the child becomes friends with Gigolo Joe (Law) and sets off to make it become a reality.Whilst not one of Spielberg's best films, A.I. does have some enjoyable moments. Whilst the movie does start off slow, it is the introduction of Jude Law that really gets it going. But with an ending that is far different to what it was heading in it, you feel slightly disappointed about it all.We run now. - Teddy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most visually astounding films I've ever seen. I was completely blown away by how aesthetically pleasing it was. Spielberg has a glorious eye for stunning images and the cinematography is some of the best of the decade. It was all just so beautiful. I was in complete awe during the entire film. As for the story, it was a great commentary on society's refusal to accept anything unique. They see these mechas as a sign of evolution and something different than what they've become accustomed to living with, and in turn feel the need to eradicate them in the most gruesome and disgusting way. The performances from the entire cast are great. Jude Law delivers the second best of his career with a wonderfully charismatic portrayal of a mechanical gigolo. Frances O' Connor was surprisingly brilliant as the highly confused mother who becomes further and further lost with what to do with her life. Haley Joel Osment was also pretty good. The film would make my top list if it wasn't for the ending, which was one of the worst I've ever seen: It was just 15 minutes of me loudly saying "You've got to be kidding me." OK, so David is a robot but he can freeze for over two thousand years, and he can just be completely revived by aliens who coincidentally found him. Yeah his circuits wouldn't fry or anything, like they did when he ate freaking spinach. Then, aliens just randomly have the power to bring back people if they have some part of them? Um, OK. Oh wait, good news is that Teddy saved a random piece of hair from over two thousand years ago!! Damn it, Teddy, go die. Oh, and I forgot to mention that the aliens can bring people back for just one day. Great work aliens. Two thousand years in the god damn future, you have the technology to bring people back but you can't do it for more than one day? I hate you. Oh I also forgot to mention the fact that somehow David and Teddy survived but NO OTHER mechas survived. Yeah right. The worst part about this sappy love fest ending hasn't even occurred yet. Somehow when they bring back his "mother", her love turns him into a real boy, he cries, falls asleep and dies. You've got to be kidding me. The super technologically advanced aliens can bring back people who died, yet they can't turn him from a robot to a real boy? Alright, I got over that. But then his fake mother is back for one day and somehow her unrealistic love turns him into a real boy. Damn you, A.I. go jump off a cliff</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been so many bad movies. But there has to be one absolute worst, and (so far!) this is it. A.I. manages to be bad in more ways, on a bigger budget, based on better raw material, than any other movie ever made. Bad in a way that totally redefines all previous concepts of badness. Bad enough to makes Plan 9 from Outer Space look like 2001: A Space Odyssey.And yet... even A.I does have ONE redeeming value. Now, when Drama 101 teachers need to demonstrate the cardinal sin of "deus ex machina," they have only to show the last reel of this misbegotten piece of junk.

		<shortDescription>A miserable idea that Spielberg manages to develop into a great failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's "Artificial Intelligence AI" is one of the worst movies I have seen so far. The most impressive thing about this film is how it can get more worse and worse with every minute. There is no end to it - after half of the tragedy one thinks that there could be an end to it, but Spielberg just adds more unrealistic things to it. It's a Sci-Fi movie, but that does not mean that it doesn't need to explain anything. It is also a fairy tale, but still the director could have tried to entertain at least some of the grown ups sitting in the audience.Humans are the cruel ones, the first build up artificial intelligence and then they kill the machines, who all seem to be very nice and full of feelings - although they do not have, only the little boy has. Still these robots talk and act as if their primary mission in "life" would be the protection of the weak and forgiving their destroyers. Oh please Steven, tell us about the Christians in ancient Rome if you want to bring tears in our eyes, but don't come up with a miserable idea that you manage to develop into a great failure.And then, at the very end of the whole mess, when the aliens hang around and the story has long crossed the point of no return, Spielberg gives the child, that has gone through suffering and pain, a single day of happiness. That's it. I assume this should tell us something about being human and life in general. But it doesn't. It only tries to induce some sentimental feelings in the audience ? without succeeding.The issue of the machine that wants to be human was treated much better by other films, foremost of all "Blade Runner" but also "Bicentennial Man" was an acceptable movie, that is also suitable for younger audiences. Watch those, but avoid AI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masters ultimate piece of work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest love stories ever told in a package that is one of the best movies ever produced. The story of a defenceless creature (albeit a robot) cast away by the only person he loves yet is unable to feel anything else except that all-encompassing love. Spielberg takes us on a subtle roller coaster ride of emotions through a masters palette of styles. One of the darker sides of humanity is shown when a caring mother will abandon her adopted child for reasons she does not fully understand herself. Yet woven through the story of desertion, disappointment, betrayal, and terror is an overwhelming sense of love and courage. All of it through the innocent eyes of a totally subservient child-being. We may be able to build creatures that show us unconditional love but what is the outcome when we abuse it?... Eternal unconditional love no matter what is reflected...a concept in itself that is staggering. The style and pace is utterly mesmerising, the sets are stunning, the special effects are so good they're barely noticeable and the acting is superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst expensive movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of what needs to be said about this movie has already been said by the previous nay sayers. I will add just a few things.At the time I saw _A.I._ (in the theater) I was taking an upper-division course on computers at my University, AND doing an in-depth presentation on artificial intelligence. (Just to show some credibility, I will add that one of the four questions on our final exam was about my report.) This movie got nearly everything wrong about its subject matter and title. I'm surprised Kubrick (or Spielberg) didn't do his research. The movie has little meaning without the premise holding up, and even as a morality tale it fails. Its bald allusions to _Pinocchio_ and _The Wizard of Oz_ come off as contrived and laughable, but the movie was so long and dreary that it doesn't work as a comedy.When my wife and I saw it, the theater had maybe 30 people in seats at the beginning. Halfway into the movie, there were less than a dozen people left. I felt embarrassed NOT leaving, but I couldn't help wanting to see this train wreck.I have a friend who is a film major that thinks that computer graphics have been the downfall of legitimate cinema. I think his view is extreme, but I would say that CGI cannot make a movie good, but it can help make it bad (e.g. the Star Wars prequels and A.I.)The only good qualities _A.I._ has are the acting and maybe the music and cinematography. These elements are vastly overshadowed by the tripe that is the rest of the film, though.</fullReview>

And then we find out at the end of the movie that David was frozen for hundreds of years and he can only see his mother for one day, after all of his searching for her. It was heartbreaking; I couldn't stop crying. It was depressing, and it is my opinion that the screenwriters must be emotionally devoid to come up with something like this. Have they no hearts? My whole family was bawling. None of us liked this movie for this reason alone. It just took away from all the other good things.

		<shortDescription>Kubrick misunderstood, good movie though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Stanley Kubrick's work, and A.I. has become a point of contention in his career. What surprises me about Kubrick fans is the constant use of words like "chilling, disturbing" to describe his work. Kubrick's work is nothing more than an honest look into our own humanity, presented to us in an objective setting. It seems to me that the most "chilling" thing about his work is our own reluctance to examine with honesty our own human condition. A.I. does this but Speilburg brings in a new element that Kubrick (in my opinion) would never have included in the film: empathy. This seems to me the reason why this project was handed over to Speilburg. As unfinished as the movie was, it is a gift. The visual effects did not disappoint, though some wonder what the movie would have been like under the direction of Kubrick. Haley Joel Osment was spot on with his performance, calling into question his own realness. In the end, after watching this movie, i was left depressed, which is what happens when you fuse the styles of a post-structuralist with a pop movie icon. The effects were far more long lasting and much harder to shrug off than 2001 or A Clockwork Orange (not a measure of goodness by any means) I could go on about how Speilburg didn't understand Kubrick's vision, but someone could write a thesis on that. It's a good movie and worth watching. It's a part of Kubrick's portfolio, like it or not:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I totally love this movie!! Sure it's got it's faults but I'm just totally in love with it. I will admit on the first viewing of this movie I was disappointed. I expected David, the robot boy to evolve and move beyond his programming. I think I expected David to move beyond the love he felt for his mother.However on the second viewing I realized the bind that David was in. He had been programmed to love one person and one person only. His mother. His suffering was the result of programming that he had no control over. Does this make his suffering any less real? No, because his creators had designed him this way. In the opening scenes of A.I the question of responsibility is raised. What right do we have to make a robot who can love if we can't love them back? David loves and he is driven by this love forever. Sadly the person he loves rejects him so David is forever locked to seek for a love he can never have. I can't help but feel for David, sure he may only be the result of what has been programmed into him but regardless of this there is no doubt that he suffers and man created that suffering. Technology as it stands today does not possess the skills to create a being such as David but if it did this movie raises the question of moral responsibility. If we could create a 'David' what responsibilities do we have towards that creation?</fullReview>

And yes, it is plenty deep and moving on a level Kubrick could achieve sans the bleak tone. The stark, cold Kubrickian universe just wouldn't play right for the warm human element this story requires.

		<shortDescription>Why make us believe in something that does not exist?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember learning about Santa Claus? The disappointment was tremendous and the first betrayal to the spirit. Why make us believe in something that does not exist? This is an underlying theme in Artificial Intelligence. David, the robot wishes to be real. It is kind of like how humans seek immortality. Does it exist? Probably not but it is wiser to believe. The film goes on to suggest that humans are acting unconsciously as a whole in creating immortality. Creating God in a way. If we have the capabilities to program the human condition into robots then there is no need for the flesh.Logic will lead. The spirit is in question. A.I. plays on the idea that love breathed life into David; pure unconditional love for his mother. This love drives him to the end of the world to find his creator.A beautiful and lyrical film. 2nd time viewing was even more fascinating. The end bogs down but hang in there because the film has a unique philosophy on a possible outcome of our existence; spirit and machine. Not likely, but it is the passion; the passion of Christ that is. A.I contained more passion about Christ than The Passion of Christ. The film suggests that David is pure love as was Christ. There is an argument in the film. It is covered oh so cleverly because no one hears it. David does not mean to deceive yet that's what he does, thus beginning the next step in evolution. Why would humans let this happen? Because David is a child. No. He is machine. When David is about to be fried at the Burning Man rally the Host preaches to the crowd not to be deceived by the child. He is a machine and will take our children away. The host is booed and harassed as David yells out that he does not want to die. David's cries and perfect resemblance of a boy is that of the AntiChrist, the great deceiver. At least that is what the spirit would tell us. David threw the stoned that destroyed the human race. "I do not want to die" The Host loses.A.I. has so many beautiful moments. It is a great achievement. Overlooked by the populous most likely due to the eccentricities. It seems to suggest in the end that there is no Santa Claus and that believing in Faerie Tales might be the best way to glide through life because it is beautiful to be alive and to love is the best way to go. ****</fullReview>

It has everything that a good movie should have: an interesting plot, excellent acting (especially Haley Joel Osment) and beautiful music (thanks to J. Williams). I strongly recommend this film - even if you wouldn't like it, it will still make you think. The film is not really (or at least not only) a sad tale about a robot child but it presents a very pessimistic picture about the mankind in general and primarily about our lack of responsibility.**** possible spoilers **** I don't know how Kubrick would make this film, but Spielberg did one great thing: he chose Haley to play a robot. Haley is so convincing and moving that you do believe he is a robot. At one point of the story I believed that the Blue Fairy would indeed make him real.I agree that the film has some weak and illogical points (e.g. David under water - no one was looking for the stolen amphibicopter ?), but altogether the film is great and WELL WORTH WATCHING !!

		<fullReview>I loved the movie because it raised a lot of questions for me about the nature of love, commitment, what it means to be human, the future of our species, so many others. Plus, the movie showcases the quest for love that drives most of us throughout our lives. I am one who liked the ending... who knows what our world will be like in 2000 yrs. Perhaps humans will no longer exist but their legacy will. I think this film will gain more acceptance in future years. It gives the film-goer much to think about and ponder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not very well-received when it initially came out, but I believe that it was due to the timing of its release. It came out about two months before 9/11. Most people couldn't or wouldn't think of the deeper meanings in this movie at the time, be it the idea of artificial beings having real thoughts emotions or even souls; or the idea of humanity being able to accept these artificial beings as their own. These themes were explored in the Robin Williams movie "The Bicentennial Man" that came out two years earlier, but I think that A.I. was far better in terms of story structure and the overall tone of the movie.Considering the number of recent posts lauding this movie, I think the tragedy of 9/11 and peoples' mortality has begun to weigh so much more heavily on our society that a movie that poses such deep questions is more easily understood by people today.This film was loosely based on Brian Aldiss' short story "Supertoys Last All Summer Long" but digresses greatly from the initial point of that story. While the sci-fi story wasn't bad, I think that Kubrick and Spielberg did a phenomenal job in progressing with those themes than did Aldiss; though Aldiss did have some small contributions to the film when shortly collaborating with the late, great Stanley Kubrick before their egos took over.Spielberg really proved he could do sci-fi w/o resorting to cheesy special effects (with the notable exception of those ridiculous Hounds costumes in the movie) or trying to tidy up little plot point for the sake of pleasing the audience. This films ranks amongst his all-time best after "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starting with Kubrick's genius should have made this work a "snap." Upon Kubrick's death Spielberg picked up the project begun by Kubrick, and proceeded as planned. I must say that like the rest of the mainstream world, I love Haley Joel Osment's younger performances. He has never let me down, as a movie goer. If he is in a production, I can rest assured that his performance, if nothing else, will redeem the money spent. Haley Joel Osment is, in fact, a bright and shining NOVA in his portrayal of the futuristic Peter Pan; the little boy who could never grow up. It is a whimsical, beautiful, tragic masterpiece of a performance to match the same qualities in this production. Whimsical. Tragic. Beautiful. A Masterpiece.No spoilers, nothing else about the movie itself. I bought it before I'd seen it because of the wonderful review it got from my love, and I watched it. It's been on the shelf ever since. I don't ever want to see it again. It broke my heart so thoroughly that I don't ever need to see it again. I will never forget it. This is a definite must see for anyone with a heart.It's worth a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film should have been finished by Kubrick but wasn't due to his untimely death during Eyes Wide Shut and was then finished by Spielberg. In some aspects Spielberg makes the film more accessible but at a concession to the art and style that Kubrick would have wanted. Still, though, this is as dark as I've ever seen Spielberg get (with exceptions of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan). The vision of the future expressed here seems at this point in time that some of it could hold true (same goes for aspects of Minority Report and 2001). Powerful performances from Osment and Law. Also enjoyed the cameo appearances, especially Robin Williams and Ben Kingsley, but seeing Al Jourgenson and Ministry thrash out on stage at the flesh fair was fun too. People often complain that the ending seems to drag on, but I thought it most suitable, although some parts of the last 30 minutes could have been removed as the pace is slowed considerably from the other parts of the film. The film is divided into 3 parts, with the third part arguably being the weakest. I was expecting the ending to be different than what the tone of the first two sections conveyed. Nonetheless I was still blown away by this film! I think people have either been too harsh in their appraisals or perhaps just got bored out of being used to our "technologically-advanced" postmodern culture, and then being desensitized from that. I bet those same people can't sit through 2001: A Space Odyssey either. Their loss, I suppose. Only time will tell if artificial intelligence will come but I wouldn't be upset if it did.</fullReview>

After a quick check I came up with the following numbers of comments for each movie: Artificial Intelligence: AI 1,761 Saving Private Ryan 1,517 Minority Report 923 Schindler's List 466 Jaws 345 Raiders of the Lost Ark 286 E.T. 210 Close Encounters 104Hands down AI has drew the most feedback.

		<fullReview>The following comments contain no spoilers as such but probably require you've already seen the film to understand.It seems Spielberg's modern-day classic, Artificial Intelligence, has received the same confused animosity amongst viewers as the machines themselves within the film.Only very rarely do the studios offer films of depth, complexity poignancy and brilliance, and so perhaps it is understandable then, that when they do, average film-goers don't know what to make of it. Practically every Kubrick film was viciously maligned by the masses upon release, and have since found their way on to the "Greatest Ever" lists. Will AI receive the same reverence in years to come? Maybe, but probably not, Spielberg has made too many (perhaps equally brilliant) digestible crowd-pleasers for it to stand against.Many believe the ending was too out-there, and should have ended in the sombre depths of David's spiritual dissatisfaction. That is obviously quite reasonable given the impact of that scene, but please consider the following. A: such an ending would have given everything David had endured previous to that moment no significance, and worse still, would make a statement far too cynical even for a Kubrick film-that the meaning of our lives is to devote ourselves to a futile cause. I: such a concept (though I may not personally believe in it) already exists as a legitimate scientific theory. Spielberg doesn't make this stuff up.In all fairness, this film can only relate to certain viewers. The sexual content (though sparing and correctly contextualised) and the heavy themes make this film inappropriate for children. The fairy-tale construct and child &amp; teddy dual protagonists could alienate adult viewers. So who is this movie for? A: it is for film lovers who appreciate intelligent story-telling. I: it is for those who can relate to David's quest to discover the meaning of his existence and evolve. Spielberg is obviously such a seeker, but who can blame his audiences if they're just hanging out for Indy 4. I give AI 9/10</fullReview>

This far-fetched, depressing and fundamentally flawed movie was torture to endure. It tells the tale of a misunderstood robot who seeks the love of his human mommy, the woman who left him out in the woods rather than explore the explanations for 2 mishaps. This video simply would not end, it was one unlikely downer after another. If you are looking to take a good mentally clubbing by a depressing movie, go see "Monster's Ball."

		<shortDescription>The Last 20 Minutes Hurt This Film Immensely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some Spoilers Possible. There are so many good things to say about "A.I.". However, the last 20 or so minutes of this film almost destroy the end product completely. It is the not-too-distant future. The world's ice caps have melted due to global warming and robots have been created to keep things going and to cut down on the consumption of food by humans. Scientist William Hurt has just revealed his latest creation: a mechanical boy that can be programmed to love (Haley Joel Osment). Meanwhile parents Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards have about given up hope on their own frozen comatose son. Robards brings Osment home one day and eventually they come to love him as they did their own son. Of course the real son is cured and trouble ensues. This is when "A.I" gets to the heart of its message. Osment is to be destroyed, but is let go by O'Connor instead. Now Osment gets to be around his "own kind". He meets a pleasure robot (Jude Law) and they embark on a journey to find someone who can turn Osment into a real boy (ala "Pinocchio"). Osment is unique in many ways, but in many ways he is just another piece of equipment used by humans. "A.I" is a spooky film due to the fact that it seems that Stanley Kubrick's influence is over most of the project. Steven Spielberg's direction is eerily like the late director's. There are many things in "A.I" that are similar to techniques used in "Dr. Strangelove", "2001: A Space Odyssey", "A Clockwork Orange", and even "Eyes Wide Shut". Camera angles, old soundtracks, elaborate set designs, and general themes from Kubrick's earlier films are all prevalent. Overall "A.I" is a curiosity that loses its way during the film's long finale. It stumbles the last 20 minutes and it feels like Kubrick died before he finished the script and then Spielberg (or someone) just cut and paste material at the end to make it seem like Kubrick did it. It is well-chronicled (or rumored) that Kubrick had this project for decades, but could not find a way to make it work on the screen. This sounds reasonable considering the final product. The performances are also suspect. Haley Joel Osment is excellent. He is just as good as he was in "The Sixth Sense" (maybe better), but he lacks the support he had in that film. Jude Law is solid, but his part is not big enough. He needed more screentime and his part should have been explored more. All the humans are boring, dull, and uninteresting. Frances O'Connor does her best, but Sam Robards is unimpressive and William Hurt's part could have been eliminated all together. The voice of reason in the film is a robotic teddy bear that is given to Osment early on. He is on par with the HAL 9000 from "2001". The film is good, but like the robots in the film it is far from perfect and has shortcomings a mile long. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A boring yet emotionally wrenching movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a very promising beginning, with possible development on family life, or the possibility to love a robot, etc... It then dragged on to an entirely different story about a robot who loved his "mommy" and who is helped around by a gigolo robot, while trying to find a fairy that would make him real.These three points are what made my mind:-Awful discontinuity in the storyline, with an ending that included amazingly stereotypical aliens and a robot happy forever with his mommy-Amazing capacity to warp one's feelings... I wanted martin's character to be more developed, and i thought we were supposed to feel SORRY for him, he had cancer for Christ's sake, and i finally find out that the poor David is the one we're supposed to "root" for. This actually shocked me, in a way that i thought "how can someone actually feel sorry for a robot that was supposed to replace a child who survived, and then that same robot tries to take the mother's love away from his real counterpart?"-The way it never seemed to end... I mean, this movie had like four possible endings, three of which were "tragic" yet bearable. (in all three of them, David dies an honorable death while searching for his mommy or in despair) but our dearest Spielberg had to choose the one with the fancy aliens with TV's in their heads -.-Overall, i ended this movie with a messy mush of feelings in my head, but it's not one of those movies that try to do that (unlike minority report, great movie) it just left me thinking "what am i supposed to feel, cause all i feel is a deep hatred for David and his mommy, and i'm quite sure Spielberg didn't intend that..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anyone here read Frankenstein?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AI is a monstrosity. It is extremely disturbing. More than the contents, it is the very fact that the film was made that disturbs. To me it is clearly a retelling of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, yet of all the comments and reviews I've come across about this film I haven't heard "Frankenstein" once. They don't recognise it because it's poured over with sugar ? Spielbergian sugar. The monster is so deeply buried in the sugar that people end up commenting on the surface texture of the candy, or just the wrapping. OK, who let a sugar coated monster into society? It's not just the film-makers, because they knew very little about it. It's the whole lot of us ? the audience, the professional reviewers, the education system that stifles our thinking, the rampant commercialism that doesn't allow us to see beyond our next incoming dollar, all of that is responsible. And therefore AI is a monstrosity that reflects our own selves. That's why it's so more disturbing. Those who recognise it are horrified. Just read through the comments posted here and you'll see what I mean. People are saying that they were bored, but their passionate comments sounds more like anger to me. They wish that they never saw the film, and I felt the same way too. I felt dirty, used, and very angry. More so because I had to see it with my kids. I just hope they forget the experience quickly enough.We have a scientist who wants to make a robot who can love. One of his colleagues correctly points out that love only works both ways, and if the scientist can't love his circuitry back then he can't have a loving robot in the first place. To this the scientist answers back, "Didn't God create Adam to love him in the first place?" OK, so he's playing God. No, in fact it's worse. He wants to go one better than God, because God loved Adam back, but the scientist doesn't feel the need to love his machine at all. The first is called Satanic megalomania. The second is plain lunacy. It appears that the makers of the film adhere to the second school. So we are pitched into a story where we are supposed to believe that a mother can love her adopted robot child. But the script soon discovers that this isn't possible, so we are left with an abandoned robot in a hostile world, crying out incessantly that he want to be real and wants to be loved. At this point the makers of the film have forgotten the original question, "Can you love a robot back?" It's now all about, can the robot child get what he wants, a loving mother. It can't be done for real, so let's get in the super-sophisticated alien technology to make him a clone mother for a day. In a nutshell, the ultimate freak-show.If you can't love the robot back, then what you have on your hands is the worst monstrosity. Victor Frankenstein realised that in a flash, as soon as he saw the monster twitch into life in front of him. I think Stanley Kubrick saw it too, and that's why he abandoned the film mid-way. But Spielberg doesn't notice anything amiss. I think Spielberg is the real robot child in this whole saga. He is a creation of high tech and youth pandering society. He is all childish optimism, and buoyed by commercial success, he has stayed that way. He believes that there is nothing that technology cannot solve, and if not now then "bring in the aliens to do the job". So when Kubrick's abandoned project fell into his lap, he said, Oh, all this needs is some alien-induced sugar. When a little doesn't work he puts in a lot. What we are left with is utterly creepy and disgusting. To me, it's Spielberg who is crying out, "I want my Mommy!" And it is we who are flying in horror, knowing that we cannot love this inhuman thing, and whose only hope for happiness is to have a clone Mommy for a day, and then dream of her forever after. And then again, it's not all Spielberg's fault. Who encouraged Spielberg in the first place? Where is the intelligence of Mary Shelley in this day and age? What is technology doing to us all? People don't like this film because it raises too many questions about what we are becoming. How can such a film me made on a $90M budget? How can it get a 72% rating on Rotten Tomatoes? Why does nobody cry "Frankenstein!"? How can the scientist at the centre claim serenely that he wants to go one better than God, and yet fail to elicit any comment from viewers? ? Disturbing indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artificial direction..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This started as a Stanley Kubrick project, not so? You know what's the difference between Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg? Spielberg is not a thinker. He can only go as far as your Indiana Jones and your Jurassic Parks. When he tries to make thoughtful movies, he only accomplishes a huge sense of melodrama (your Schindler Lists et al). He's not a bad director. He's quite good at creating fantasy landscapes. But when you compare a "Clockwork Orange" or an "Eyes Wide Shut" with any Spielberg film - it's like comparing the theory of relativity to 1 + 1 = 2.The good bits in "Artificial Intelligence" have mostly to do with the visuals, and first and foremost the futuristic ring where they killed robots for show - ancient Rome style. That was excessively bleak and misanthropic for Spielberg standards, and the direction pulled it off with paroxysmal neon style. The same can be said for when David prays to his blue fairy in vain and ad infinitum, submerged in the ruins of the abyss. Spielberg also enters Tim Burton territory with the weirdo Las Vegas-styled megalopolis where David and Gigolo Joe go to learn what they should do next.Other than that the film is a collection of stereotypes, unnecessarily slow-paced and draped in huge doses of melodrama, indulging too much in the fairy-tale-an quest of David just to raise but a few simple issues, i.e. that man is dreaming for the ideal but is brought down by the merciless Darwinian sense of evolution.The aliens epilogue is at best silly, and the quasi-oedipal touch with David reuniting with his "mother" ranges from boring to corny. The idea of an exploration of humanity via a robot's perspective has been done better in the past ("Blade Runner" anyone?), and so has the faint parallel with religion (i.e. god creating man, man creating robot). Essentially this is a sci-fi adaptation of Pinnochio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AI is a film with much to appreciate. The story is good, the performances are excellent (with Osment being startlingly good), and Spielberg, who rarely disappoints on the visual side of his movies, does not do so here - it looks fabulous and the effects are flawless. And, in David's abandonment, it contains one of the most emotionally horrifying scenes I have ever seen in a movie.If AI had run 10 minutes shorter then I would have loved it unreservedly. Had David been left, trapped underwater, looking up at the Blue Fairy and asking her to grant his request to turn him into a real boy, Pinocchio-style, then that ending would have been satisfying and right - uncomfortable, horrifying even, but right.But instead there is this coda tacked on whereby David is thawed out from frozen underwater New York by benevolent aliens and given a happy ending. It is corny, it never convinces and, to be frank, it goes some way towards dissipating the goodwill built up by the rest of the film.Cut it off, throw it away, and slap "The End" on the fade before the coda, Mr S, and then you will have something bordering on a masterpiece instead of something which leaves you with the sugary taste of schmaltz in your mouth.</fullReview>

Suspending all disbelief, the boys plight can evoke sympathy, at first, that is. After the tenth irrational "I WANT MY MOMMY!", you want the boy to fall in a bucket of hazardous waste. This movie drags on. It honestly would've been better if the boy died somewhere along the way. Oh, and all the other characters were worthless.

		<shortDescription>A unique project that could have been much better......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg, how could it go wrong? Most assuredly I'm afraid. The circumstances outlining the production of this film are a might unique. Kubrick, master director of such masterpieces as "The Shining" and "A Clockwork Orange" had an idea for a magnum Opus, a film to end all films. This was supposed to be AI. On his last legs he requested that his personal friend Spielberg complete his film for him. This apparently seemed a good idea at the time, but turned for the worst.First off, the film was unfinished. Speilberg had an uncompleted script and instead of going with what he had and adding on material, where needed, he revised the entire script. I'm sure Kubrick's original vision would have been a little more traumatic, than what Speilberg ended up with. Sure such influences as the "flesh fair" and the scene where Hailey Joel Osmont decapitates himself scream Stanley Kubrick, but all in all the film became just another drawn-out version of Pinnochio. A boy yearns to be real and all that. Not very original. Speilberg left on an ending which seems a little out of place. I feel he was trying to be like Kubrick. Now on to the positives.This film is a visual treat. Never has a film looked so inspiring(except for the superior Bladerunner). This Neo-Tokyoan landscape is simply breathtaking, especially the flesh fair sequence. It SCREAMS atmosphere. Gigolo Joe, Jude Laws character was superbly acted and funny as hell, but severely underdeveloped. Osmont was believable as the boy robot "David" and William hurt was fine as the inventor. The acting was good, and aside from the visuals that was about it.All in all, A.I. was a fine family film, that I'm sure will be watched for years to come. I'm just disappointed in Speilberg's attempt to be Kubrickian. This film is slow as hell for the first hour and a half then speeds up amazingly. This film really needed "spit and polish".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gracefully profound tour de force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I. is one of those films that leaves you thinking seriously about a lot of things for a long time after it's over. It touches on some very essential questions on the meaning of life, and what constitutes being alive. It does this in a sweeping panorama that begins with a single human family and ends with the future of intelligent life in the universe. It is told almost in a fairy tale fashion, such as Peter Pan, or Alice in Wonderland. In this way, Spielberg sets himself a herculean task: make a great film in the style of another great filmmaker whose style is very different from your own. I believe he mostly succeeds, but not without also putting much of himself in the finished product as well. This is by no means a bad thing. There are many worse amalgamations than Spielberg doing Kubrick. I find this film very attractive for a number of personal reasons, but I think it will also strike a deep chord with many viewers if they are willing to meet it on it's own terms. It is not so much a prophecy of the future as it is a study in how a prophecy of the future can reveal profound universal truths about all times and all experiences. IMHO, it's a masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Conflicted Identity Crisis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a great series of ethical questions just dying to be asked here, but they're buried beneath so many layers of glossy effects, shameless sentimentality and routine overacting, it's hard to say whether they're worth digging up. A.I. is quite Kubrickian at heart - complicated, fascinating and occasionally bizarre just for the sake of it - but also so thoroughly lathered with the strokes of Spielberg that it could almost function as a parody of his career. That duality is often mesmerizing, but also quite destructive. There are a few moments where this picture shines brighter for those combined efforts than it ever could under a single master, particularly in the fleshed-out world itself, but they're frequently outweighed by the long stretches where the two visions clash loudly and horribly - as the entire third act can attest. An aspirant, visually stunning genre-straddler, it's an uneven, long-winded showcase of the best traits and worst indulgences of both directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man should cultivate his natural intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amazing film because it reveals why we, humans, should not play with artificial intelligence. To make robots that look like human beings to the point of being fooled completely by them is a rather easy task. But that robot is nothing but a machine as long as it does not have human feelings and first of all the capacity to love. The second drawback of such robots is that they do not grow or age. If you give the capacity to love to a child robot, he will be able to love but not to grow. He will remain a child forever though his love will grow more and more intense since it will feed on non-material energy. The genial element Steven Spielberg introduces in that story is a competition with a real boy and the subsequent disposing of the robot by the woman he calls his mother. He then attaches himself to fairy tales, to Pinocchio and the Blue Fairy who could change him into a real boy. That turn in the tale transforms the story that could have become over-sentimental into a magical and deeply ethical story. We discover what humanity would do as soon as such human robots existed. It would organize hunts to catch the stray ones, the abandoned ones, those chased by the police or any authority for crimes they had not committed but they had been made guilty of by the real criminals to save their own skins. The presence of these robots would cover up a new wave of crime that could go unpunished. So the human beings could organize some circus games with these robots as gladiators, but not gladiators who would die after a severe and honorable fight, but as sacrificial victims on the altar of the human dignity that is infringed by those robots. Shower them with acid, throw them through fire and through fans, hack them down with saws or all kinds of axes, etc. In front of that horrible fate, our boy and his gigolo of a partner on this trip will manage to escape due to a last breath of humanity in the audience of those games that will liberate them. And off they go to the big city of games, rides, casinos, brothels, music-halls and so many other attractions essentially performed by robots of all types. They are looking for the Blue Fairy. Then their trip will take them to underwater New York, the twin towers proudly dominating a sea of water. There David, our little robot, meets with his creator and escapes to the underwater world where he discovers the Blue Fairy of Coney Island where he is trapped by some accident and survives two thousand years of freezing which will bring the water down of course. That shows how absurd a project of producing robots who can feel and express sentiments is: these robots are bound to suffer at the hands of humans and many humans are bound to become cruel and sadistic, and to suffer in return, when confronted with the extreme demands in love and passion of these robots. But the film goes one step further and makes the story finally luminous. Extra-terrestrials arriving on earth and discovering the lost civilization of the earth completely wasted in the vastly human produced or amplified glaciation. These extra-terrestrials have powers that enable them to read the memory and the most subtle desires of David and to recreate the environment in which he met with maternal and filial love. But his demand to have his mother resurrected raises a question. When one has run one's time, if you revive or resurrect them then they are what they were at the end of their time, and that is dead because they cannot live beyond their time span. Then the story becomes full of sunshine. The young David will keep his desire and his demand, even though it will be entirely artificial and will only last from sunrise to sundown. And there maybe he will be a real boy when he goes to sleep with his mother who will go to sleep for ever. He will, so Steven Spielberg says, finally visit the world where dreams are born. Does it mean he will not wake up? Does it mean he will wake up but the recollection of this day with his mother will be the dream he needs to go on living, and maybe discover new forms of love or new people, even Extra Terrestrials, he could love? We don't know. Steven Spielberg ends his story on a sleeping boy going to dream and a sleeping mother going to eternal inexistence. Why on earth do we want to create robots that can feel sentiments when we have so many human beings around us we could love, which would improve our society and our world?

		<shortDescription>Child Safety Alert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Artificial Intelligence' is, without any doubt, one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. Watching it I was reminded of Micheal Jackson's insistence that sleeping naked with other people's children was perfectly normal, or Paed. Townsend of rock band 'The Who' claiming that his paid visits to child-pornography web-sites were all in the name of innocent research for a book. A book, by the way, that never seems to have been written.Over the years I have developed a concern about Steven Spielberg. His pre-occupation with little children - especially 'pretty' boys - has left me with a very uneasy feeling.His great career debut was a movie called, simply 'Duel'. And it was an absolutely scorching thriller. Yet since that time we have seen him concentrate more and more on 'family' movies, with an emphasis that seems to be overly weighted upon childhood. It may be that I do the man a great dis-service, just as I do Messers Jackson and Townsend. Still; the nagging doubt remains.'Artificial Intelligence' dwells upon a little 'boy' robot who seems to be obsessed with a search for his 'mommy'. We follow this tiresome electronic dope through a series of adventures and mishaps in a movie that seems to last all weekend. Time and again we are plunged into some intimate, atmospheric emotional close-up in which the camera lingers like a voyeur. It may be that this boy really is an excellent child-star, but I don't think we need to study the minutiae of his facial expression and body-language quite so often, quite so long and in quite so much detail. He's a confused little android - okay; I get the message. I got it in the first 15 minutes or so.But no; it doesn't end there. Spielberg luxuriates in this maudlin expression of vulnerable infancy time after time, milking the moment for every drop of sentimental slush, whilst a nauseatingly romantic incidental music (as usual) hammers the theme home with all the subtlety of an orchestral train-wreck. The scene in which those preposterously fairy-kind aliens thaw him out and re-unite him with his 'mommy-for-a-day' is without doubt the most powerful emetic I have ever sampled and should not be attempted by anyone with an adverse gastric condition.Coming after 'Empire Of The Sun', 'Close Encounters', 'ET', and 'Jurassic Park' (each with pretty little boys) it's all a creepy bit too much. Then, of course, there was 'War Of The Worlds'; and despite there being no children prominent in Wells's book, or indeed the superior 1960's movie, nice Uncle Stevie couldn't resist his hankering for innocent young flesh - a little girl this time. Even in the seminal thriller 'Jaws' the police chief (Roy Scheider) had a nice plump little boy, though he was himself clearly old enough to be - well, Uncle Stevie. With each outing it gets longer, more intimate, and more schmaltzy.I think it's high time Mr Spielberg began concentrating on 'adult' movies for a while like 'Saving Private Ryan'. Not just as a change, but as a change of direction, and Leave Those Kids Alone.Frankly, I shudder to think what his next effort will be like. Just don't be surprised to find Whacko Jacko given a starring role.Anyone fancy 'Nice Uncle Stevie' for a babysitter? Perhaps Gary Glitter then? Don't you wanna be in their gang, their gang?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you could be Punished for making a bad movie, Stephen Spielburg would be hanged, drawn,and quartered for this one .I have seen many a bad movie but A.I.is the worst, Makes me angrier than any Film I have ever seen ,(Hook comes a close second) Why did Spielburg feel it was necessary to deconstruct Osamu Tezuka's" Astro boy" when Disney made "Lion King" a copy of "Kimba" another work of Osamu Tezuka, they at least make a fist of it. Back to A.I. what is Spielburg trying to say ? if the robot had real human feelings he would have got over it like we all have to when we are rejected. There are many "holes in the plot of this "stinker" the biggest is, The parents of A.I's real son has been "dead (Frozen)for many years but is resurrected, But 1000 years later the super aliens Can't bring anyone back for more than 24 hours ? Bah!!! I HATE this film and its FAKE sentimentality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On of My Favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start off by saying that I generally do not like sci-fi movies. I am, however, a Jude Law fan so I decided to watch it one evening. This movie ended up being one of my favorites. In fact, I now own the movie on DVD. The cast does a great job of portraying their characters. The movie has sad moments, funny moments and some suspense. Based on other comments I've read, some people did not like the ending. I did like the ending, although sad. I thought the ending was the perfect "closing" to this movie. I felt that they did a great job with the scenery and costumes. I would highly recommend this movie, to both sci-fi fans and (like me) non-sci-fi fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under-appreciated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a mixed reception this modern take on Pinocchio is sadly under-rated. Spielberg creates a vast and magical world set in a technology obsessed future. Robots are used for service and also sex as well and at the same time. The film follows a young robot boy David, who has been given human emotions, the first time ever that this has happened for a robot. He is given to a family to substitute for their ill son. As soon as the son is better though, the family decide that David cannot live with them and they abandon him in a wood. He is found by robots on the outside of society who are hunted down and destroyed. David goes on a quest to find his family again. The film basically has a tragic sense to it and explores the relation between human and human emotions. The effects are amazing and visually this is fantastic. The film is fantastical and takes David through many places and long into the future to. He meets robots, people and aliens on his journey before the films tragically and touchingly melancholic ending. Haley Joel Osment proves once again that he is immensley talented. ****</fullReview>

This has to be Spielberg's crowning achievement -- yes better than ET, Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. This movie combines the sci-fi joy/fear of technological advancement and futuristic doomsday scenarios with the purity of an emotional story of a "boy" seeking the love of a mother.Its three distinct, but inseparable, acts are woven into a perfect whole where a simple lock of hair becomes the answer to a quest and a dream.

		<shortDescription>A Rare Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie worked on me at a very deep level. I didn't expect to be so moved, but in the last scene, I found I began to cry -- to sob audibly. I can hardly remember ever being that moved by a movie, with the possible exceptions of "It's A Wonderful Life" and "Schindler's List."I do think it is a shame that a lot of people only saw the surface of this gem, and, thus, only were able to judge it on the basis of comparison to other science fiction and/or fantasy-type films. So, they compare special effects, possibilities of androids, casting, etc. People have also complained about its length. But, I found that the length was no accident.Also, absolutely integral to the movie was the music, which fit the on-screen action to a tee. John Williams has never done better.If you have seen this movie and only saw a movie "vision" of the future or a look at the human condition, please try again, you have missed the subtle but extremely powerful essence. Don't think so much. Open your heart, because this movie is all heart (despite the outward look). It will, if you let it, move you to your very soul. Artificial Intelligence is a masterpiece. 10 out of 10. Bravissimo!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Artificial about Human like Intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I doubt that I'll live long enough to see A.I. like that portrayed in this movie. Even so, I very much welcome the technology. It'd be a wonderful thing to have a friend with unlimited memory and learning abilities. Just download a program and he/she could teach me to play piano, go for a run, drive on long trips, go do errands, etc... A friend without the humanity factor. I thought this movie was great. Maybe I'm just to human but the ending made me cry. It's a welcomed futuristic movie. Most futuristic movies dealing with A.I., the humanoids turn evil. An example is the movie West World. I've always been found of this genre. I thought the casting of the actors and actresses were fantastic. I enjoyed it, it's a movie I'd watch again. It's one that makes the viewer think, at least it do me. The moral issue started arising in my mind as the movie went along. What kind of rights would a humanoid have if they had feelings?I applaud this movie and marvel at the great effects. I thought Teddy was so cute, reminded me of Teddy Ruxpin the talking bear. I liked this movie very well. I give it two thumbs up. It's really takes a good look at what the future may hold if technology progresses in the field of A.I. We aren't there yet but it's great to dream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing the film A.I. Artificial Intelligence numerous times, I have arrived at the conclusion that this is one of the best films ever made. This film fits together perfectly on every level, and it's story is life changing.Artistic and creative, A.I. successfully brings films to a new level of motion pictures, both superficially and emotionally.Anyone who denies the greatness of this film, denies filmaking in general. He denies humannity, emotion, dreams, life.He denies love.A.I. is a blazing beacon in the dark storm of "safe" movies. Its story, albeit abstract, has more meaning and worth than almost any other movie.If you haven't seen the film, don't read another pixel. Go and view the most powerful movie of the century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a ridicoulous rating. What's wrong with you people. Do you not understand the greatness of the film. It is an extremely emotional movie that I bet everybody didn't even understand. It was a wonderful story about a little robot boy who goes many places just to find his mother and find out how much she loves him. All he wants is to be a real boy so his mother can love him like a normal boy. Doesn't that sound like a great movie. Sure it's a little long but no movie is perfect. All those people who are disapointed about Speilburg directing, stop whining and accept the fact that Kubrick wasn't able to do it. Besides, Kubrick wouldn't have given it as much Humanity as Speilburg did. A.I is pure magic. 10/10. Some people just don't understand the greatness of a wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern day fable of the highest order... Stunning, Impressive and deeply moving!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without doubt one of the most misunderstood films of recent years. Poor Steven Spielberg. He misjudged the ability of an audience to actually THINK during a film and not just eat popcorn and stare at the pretty lights.This film is not a serious discussion of the use of Artificial Intelligence. This film is not a standard science fiction story. This film is a fable or fairytale in the same mould as Pinocchio with similar themes and issues. It is MEANT to be fantastical. It is MEANT to be ambivalent. It is MEANT to challenge your preconceptions.If I see another reviewer use the words 'typical Spielberg schmalz' I think I'll scream. There is a reason Kubrick wanted Spielberg to direct this film. His inate ability to convey emotions on screen made him perfect for this material - Kubrick simply couldn't have done it and he was all too aware of this fact.So what about that ending? At first I too thought 'what on earth is going on?', but I knew that there must have been some sort of significance to it all. I think it will surprise many to discover that it is actually closer to Kubricks original plan than any other part of the film. Sentimental? On the surface, perhaps. But look beneath that veneer and you will find an endingthat is more disturbing, ambivalent, deep and intrigueing than you could possibly imagine. Why does Spielberg use a different film stock for the ending? Why does it coincide with the first moment David closes his eyes? Why does the sun suddenly rise behind David? Is this real? Is David dreaming? Is it truly a happy ending?When you think of it in this way does the ending remind you more of Spielberg or of Kubrick? For me it is classic Kubrick, similar in style and outcome to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY - ambiguous, hopeful, different, challenging. Anyone who can't see this has just missed one of the greatest tricks that Kubrick has ever pulled.A.I. is a misunderstood masterpiece. You owe it to yourself to find out why. Give it another chance!4.5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>underrated, and misconceived true meaning of plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my previous comments, I attacked the reviewers,whom I acknowledge have their own points of view. I will now address the movie. A.I.was not just a viewing treat,it was an experience.The subject matter in its content,probably make most people cringe,because it clearly exhibits are human frailties,and shortcomings.This was well crafted for the intelligent mind,wherein,the story is moved along by results of our poor insight into the future. Yes it does give us a somber conclusion,which when you think about is has been expressed in other movies, e.g.Soylent Green,On the Beach,etc. Like God,we create these A.I's,but lack the judgment of co-existing with them,without conditions and convenience.This is illustrated profoundly throughout the movie.Even at the end the last generation of A.I.'s still hold an admiration for humankind,which is more than their human counterparts have done.In their historical study of humans,with all their faults and weaknesses,they still hold us in awe.I won't touch the Kubrick/Spielberg collaboration,because Kubrick is not around to review the results,If he were,He would approve.The message is very dark,and conveys a helpless and inevitable conclusion,which most of us do not like to address,which is why,we do not have the foresight to prevent the conclusive results. I viewed this movie with my ten year old son,when it was over I asked him what he thought. He gave me a 2 word answer,"Man Sucks". This profound statement He shared with me,confirmed that He had understood the message.Look folks,this movie is not dependent on special effects,but it's visual and emotional effects have more power,than your normal movies,which deal more with the fantasy and concepts that are not realistic.We like things that are bigger than life and ignore real life instead.See this movie again,but this time pay attention to the message.Compare the beginning sequence of results of global warming which we still don't admit,to the end result global freezing,which felt it was self-explanatory,or should have been,our proclivity for destruction.The message I got was not gloom and doom,but, rather a warning.Some film directors,and writers have the guts to address our shortcomings,and if they can,why can't we?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Considering numbers of reviews,with a lot of confusion, severely underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>some of the caustic comments I've read, reflect a certain proclivity for the irrelvance of some critics. I cannot imagine anyone, with an adequate I.Q. not admiring the genius of 2 great creators and innovators. the negative comments usually come from watchers who cannot figure out roadrunner plots. They rely very shallow on special effects and do not appreciate a movie, where they have to think. Increasingly, we are seeing a vast difference of opinions between IMDB and AFI list of the greatest movies ever made. the difference is simple, generational and lack of taste. The great masters offered tremendous entertainment over the years, most of the comments are part of our cynical confused society. The common complaint by your users is usually critical of the lenght of the movie, which confirms their intellect and lack of attention span. you cannot teach piano to someone who is not gifted, It is sad, that Mr. Kubrick, and Mr.Spielberg, were not able to co-direct this movie, However in the absence of kubrick,spielberg,got it and the style of one of his heroes is reflected.this movie was made for the big screen, and, t.v.doen't do it justice. the negative reviewers, would probably find fault in the Bambi movie, get a heart folks,because that is what the movie is all about. the dismissal of our humanities, which is an ongoing process. Machines,that have more passion and genuine goodwill. I believe what makes most viewers dislike this movie, is the illustration of the darkest side of our ultimate destiny, and, that makes them uncomfortable. The conclusion of the movie is not corny,it is a summary of our cruelties and frailties. Pretty sad when the I.A.'s have more humanity than us. A similar message was expressed in Soylent Green and that made a few people squirm, the human condition is illustrated only too well, that is why the users comments are negative, like looking in the mirror,eh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A.I is probably the most different movie you will ever see.It's almost three movies in one,and the blending is magnificent. As this was a project of Kubrick,It got exactly the same reviews that his films have at the beginning:very mixed reviews(at least in the english speaking countries)and praise in the European ones;and the box-office result was more similar to Kubrick than Spielberg-although it made probably more money than any of Kubrick films- I suppose as other great Sc-fi films like Blade Runner and 2001(they were even more panned)we have to wait at least 10 years for the official worldwide praise that it got in my country(It's considered to be one of the best sci-fi films of all time and one of Spielberg's best). Now,I know some of you will hate this film with a passion,but why?If you don't like the story You have to appreciate the direction(which is brilliant),if you don't then the acting(Which is amazing)if you still don't than what about cinematography,editing,special effects,make up,art direction,sound etc...It's impossible to completly hate the movie unless you have something personnal against It. The problem with this project Is that as It is a Spielberg movie It becomes more mainstream-too many ordinary people saw it(people who only generally like action)when it should be viewed by more independent based oriented genre viewers. As I end,I have to say that this is still one the most fascinating,passionate,beautiful movies ever made and you have to see It more than once to fully appreciate It.And in Europe it created a cult following-destined to become one of the greats of sci-fi sometime,somewhere in the future.How long It will take I do not Know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually ended up seeing A.I quite a bit later than its screen release, when it came on one of the cable movie channels, simply because of some of the scathing reviews. And also why I will never ever see another movie again depending on reviews - I will make the decision myself to see it excluding such things. The movie is a true masterpiece and the fact that I was blubbering like a child at the end, wondering why I was 'leaking' so severely was interesting in itself.The whole issue has to do with the fact that people feel that it was a Kubrick film that was Spielbergised. You know what - people should see the movie and forget this issue - enjoy the fairy tale and see it for what it is. Forget the whole 'oh Kubrick would have ended it 20 mins before the end' because while I did imagine for a moment that the film was about to end at that scene, the movie moved forwards. And I actually loved what Spielberg did for it. I would not want the heart ache of the Kubrickised ending, I want the more peaceful ending of Spielbergs. And more importantly, people need to stop overanalysing the 'realism' a film that is simply a fairy tale told with various issues in mind - of life, of what really is important within it and how the little robot boy who was in reality more human that most 'humans' themselves! How a mother and childs bond is something that simply can never be described, something that Spielberg drives in and Kubrick may actually have missed, and the biggest question of what life really is, and whether it needs to only be flesh and blood?So many questions, it is profound yet told beautifully and the acting is superb. It is a combination of work of two of our greatest directors and people should be happy with it is as it is. I suspect people that are so cybical of it are those that go in neither willing to think or feel, but simply to experience - the typical popcorn movie goer. Unfortunately A.I manages to be ironic one last time by unintentionally pointing out via the film that those people that really enjoy this movie are likely more human than the A.I like 'robots' that will overanalyse and criticise it without attempting to 'feel'. The simple truth whether you like it or not.Finally, I am glad I have another movie that I can add to my 'personality test' list. The first was 'The Blair Witch Project' in which I reasoned that if you did not have a personal dislike of horror movies AnD you saw it in decent conditions, especially audiowise and still disliked it, you were lacking in the rather important requisite for intelligence, a decent imagination. In A.I, I simply feel that if you do not like it, you are simply less human than you should be :)Go see it, and find out which you are ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sci-fi with brains at last!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially, I refused to watch this film as I just couldn't stand watching another lame action/sci-fi with re-hashed weak plots and five-minute-wonder stars, that are secondary to a variation of the same old (unimpressive) computerised special effects (Independence Day, Armageddon, Fifth Element etc). However, I gave in and to my surprise this film actually had a psychological element and characterisation.Uniquely layered with the ironic portrayal of the age-old story of Pinocchio in a futuristic setting, the film successfully combines the Arts with the Scientific, padding out what would have been more sci-fi bubblegum. I even have to admit that Haley Brat Osmont was outstanding and - yes - he made me cry at the end - A LOT! The film preys on fundamental insecurities embedded in the child in all of us, enmeshed in a cold, clinical, world of robots. Allegorical and heart-rending - who cares whether the special effects were good?! Not for spongy-brained meatheads!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's sad when some moviegoers/critics just refuse to acknowledge the beauty, genius, and scope of Steven Spielberg's tribute to Stanley Kubrick, "A.I." I still remember the fuss it was creating with my friends, who saw it not too long after it came out (I had never seen it in theatres), and were complaining and ranting incessantly about how horrible it was. I remember thinking: "Wow...it sounds like a disaster from what they, and others, have been saying...can it really be all that bad?" It was apparent that most of their criticism was aimed at the film's rather long-winded and awkward ending. Granted, I agreed somewhat when I saw it the first time - thinking, "Man, would I have ever been ANGRY if I were seeing this in theatres, what with all its false finishes!" However, looking at the rest of the movie - believe me, not even the famously maligned ending (which, admittedly, almost ruined the whole viewing experience for me) could sway my opinion towards the negative.It's become very clear to me upon multiple viewings that "A.I." is, without a doubt, severely, tragically underrated. One can see why, unfortunately; the jarring clash of Spielberg's and Kubrick's visions/styles probably unnerved many people, and left a bit of a strange aftertaste. Nevertheless, with Kubrick being my favourite director, I came to appreciate their combination. Honestly, I found it quite refreshing that Spielberg especially was going down such a rare path in terms of mood, and I thought in the long run, he succeeded in making this change. Certainly, the film can be a little too dark and/or suggestive in some scenes (and yes, I agree that this is by NO means a "children's film"), and it obviously can't suit all tastes, but for me it was (and is) a daring, memorable, and absolutely stunning work of art.With gorgeous cinematography, slick visual effects and amazing acting, "A.I" is definitely one of the most incredible and breathtaking films I've ever seen. Its pacing is epic, its themes are clear, and its story is timeless. Yet another cinematic masterwork from Mr. Spielberg, it is truly one of my favourite films of his.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I avoided this film when it was in the theatre and then when it came out on DVD, perhaps because it appeared to me in the trailer to be just another Spielberg fairy tale with the usual light show. I regret now not having given it a chance. Osment was his usual brilliant self as the prodigy and Jude Law was incredible as Gigolo Joe. Their performances both deserved recognition by the academy. It was a rather lengthy film, but I really never got tired of David's episodic adventures, particularly after he'd met his own capering Scarecrow. It was an interesting look at a society which had built in it's own obsolescence. Asimov's 'I, Robot' had a similar theme.Give it a look! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film, but only if you like to think...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great movie! But only if you care to actually think while you watch. Many movie-goers want to be spoon-fed the storyline, this movie actually makes you think about the role humanity plays in its own destiny.Many have said the multiple endings were "added on", but if you look at the original Kubrick screenplay (what was completed), they are not seperate endings, but rather a progression of thought, start-to-end.Spielberg took some liberties with the touchy-feely side of the movie, but never varied from the original story line that Kubrick wrote. This movie is a trilogy, written in three parts, presented as the same.In a nutshell, if you don't understand, or can't "figure out" the movie, then stick to less demanding fare like "Scoobie Doo" or the like. On the other hand, if you are a "thinker" when you watch a movie, then this one is definitely for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not discuss the whole movie here since that has been done many times already. I think the whole movie is brilliant. But what I want to state here is that - despite the criticism - the ending is brilliant too. It is realistic and it completes the story by stating that unconditional love eventually will be rewarded.One of the most striking statements of the movie, presented as a message between the lines, is that robots are better capable of love than humans. Not so irrealistic as we would think initially! I believe it is even the quintessence of the film.In that perspective the ending fits perfectly. Mankind who is troubled by so many fears (most of which are non-realistic and only prohibit progression) have ceased to exist. But their genius lives on in the androids. It is a beautiful and happy future scenario for this planet. I love Spielberg for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brave Spielberg Honors Kubrick By Defying Film-Snobs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The loudest opinions with regards to this film have inevitably been from the semi- professional film critic/cynics, sneering about its length and ignorantly slamming it for its supposed 'sell-out' epilogue. As per usual, these people are so busy analysing each frame of the film, that they have entirely missed the point of the story and what Spielberg has set out to do.Lets get this out of the way; Spielberg is not a fool, he is of course going to know that the current fad for 'ambiguity' would not bode well for the wonderfully conclusive (Fairy tales aren't ambiguous) A.I, he would have known that the running time would have impressed neither the critics or the average seat-filler. The fact that he stayed true to his vision despite this knowledge is a testament to his bravery as a director and a screenwriter.In my opinion, Spielberg's two-fingered salute to the current fad of quasi-intellectual porn for quasi-intellectual people (as well as their assumptions as to what a Kubrick film should be) would have delighted Stanley Kubrick.Haley Joel cant really be faulted in a part in which appearing merely functional would be a test for even the greatest of actors and Jude Law revels in his part as a cockney Valentino gigolo.This is a fairy tale; from Ben Kingsley's warm, childlike narrative, to John William's beautifully manipulative music all the way to the wonderfully schmaltzy (and refreshingly absolute) finale.This is a beautiful film....I recommend that if you are an actual lover of story on film (rather than a miserable scrutinizer) then you should watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated, and one of Spielberg's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** I'm not going to say too much, because enough has been written about this movie. I'm just going to say that it is a fantastic, complex, brilliant work of art, and most people simply do not get it. Here's a few pointers to perhaps help the A.I.-illiterate:1) Complaining that the movie does not faithfully reflect Stanley Kubrick's vision is not a valid criticism, as Kubrick asked Spielberg to direct it because he wanted it to be made with Spielberg's sensibilities.2) The movie is a fairy-tale, which is implied through the beautiful narration by Ben Kingsley; this is why the finale is drawn out--David (Haley Joel Osment) IS a real boy, because he has real feelings, real emotions and can feel real sorrow, pain and joy. The fact that he is synthetic on the outside is irrelevent. The entire ending of the movie, is his wish finally coming true--for real.3) Still on the ending, and this may be open to interpretation, but...THERE ARE NO ALIENS IN THIS MOVIE!!! The beings that dig David up at the end are highly evolved ROBOTS. Mecha. They are to David what we would be to a Neanderthal. Like 2001, they represent eons of evolution, years after the human race has become extinct and machines have become the supreme beings on the planet. Think of it as a benign form of THE TERMINATOR's computer generated machines. Not an interpretation the Christian Right likes very much, but the correct one at any rate. At least in my opinion.Look at it this way. If they are aliens, then their appearance is pointless and makes no sense in the context of the movie. If they are evolved robots, then it is an extraordinary, meaningful finale which parallels Kubrick's 2001. Which makes more sense now?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent flick...Teddy rules...lighten up critic masters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reviews of this Speilberg-Kubrick flick are way to harsh in my opinion. Given any other creaters/directors I wonder if these way too-serious critics would be so plentifull. If you can overlook this issue and just watch this movie for what it is; a series of moving film frames that continue for 2 hours or so to occupy the void time in your so called intelligent life, then there shouldn't be any reason any typical open-minded movie-goer shouldn't enjoy it. I myself believe its a time-less classic , and often timeless classics are misjudged, often maligned for not contriving to a certain cookie-cutter standard. Critics often mention multiple flaws related to their own beliefs of how the characters and story should'a/could'a have been like this or that, bla bla bla. They simply forget that sci-fi movies are a unique genre that need more space from ones own fit of their own movie world. There are just so many things you can say about this spacy semi-dark flick. But the simplest elements of this kind of movie are usually the best. For me it was the Teddy bear character. How can a movie go wrong when one of its major characters is a cuddly stuffed enigmatic talking teddy bear sidekick that saves the day. It gets no better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is an incredibly sad story, yet Spielberg's other masterpiece, Schindler's list was equally exquisitely sad. Human emotion expressed so devastatingly well by the robot boy David is just as real as any expressed by a human. Any little child sent away from home (think of young Scrooge so sad on Christmas day and far from home) and longing to see mama and or papa will identify with David and truly feel his pain. The movie works on several layers successfully, it is science fiction in the truest sense, it is spectacle, think of the cities of neon and the demolition derby. It is perhaps satisfying to those longing for their daily dose of violence. There is plenty of that here. Halley Joel Osment's performance is the lynchpin, if you identify with him, then the internal agony reflected in his incredible eyes will haunt you for some time after. Frances O'Connor's performance as David's mother is a tour de force. We cannot forget Joe Gigolo, by Jude Law. All I can say is My goodness. This is a film to last a century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of sheer brilliance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always said that whenever a Steven Spielberg film is released, it's not just a film release, it's an event! A truly brilliant filmmaker, Spielberg has given us such masterpieces as Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., The Color Purple, and Schindler's List. He has dazzled us with visual affects, horrified us with the most fearsome creatures in nature, and broken our hearts with sentimental stories that have touched us in indescribable ways. Now, the master filmmaker brings us A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Starring Haley Joel Osment as a robot boy who only wants to become a real boy. His interest in becoming a real boy is to achieve a true love that only a mother can give. Sound familiar? Perhaps the story of Pinocchio comes to mind. A.I. is a futuristic spin on the classic children's tale, Pinocchio. The robot boy that Osment plays is named David. He is chosen as an experimental device for couples who have either lost a child, or who are not able to have children. Entering his new home, his owners decide to keep him. Monica, played by Francis O'Connor quickly falls in love with the David, as he takes the place of her own son who has been in a coma for nearly five years. However, as time goes by, Martin, comes out of his coma and comes home. Feeling jealous of his new robot brother, Martin quickly finds ways to set David up for disaster, as if two young siblings were fighting for the approval of their parents. Monica's husband, Henry, played by Sam Robards, decides to get rid of David due to David's nearly accidentally killing Martin in a swimming pool mishap. Monica makes the difficult journey to set David on his own into the wilderness because if he is returned to the factory that he was manufactured, he will be destroyed. A very heart wrenching scene to watch, David pleads with Monica to go home. But Monica can't risk any more accidental danger that David could bring to Martin. It's up to David, his teddy bear properly named, Teddy, and another Mecha robot that David meets along the way, named Joe, played by Jude Law, to find a way to become a real boy; and in so doing, go home and be truly loved by his human mother, Monica. A.I. proves to be a very poignant film to watch. There are moments in the film that will bring one to tears and challenge the very idea of what love is. Can a person ever truly love a robot that perpetuates a human? A moral question that is asked in the beginning of the film and the answer to the question that comes from the creator of David, Professor Allen Hobby, played by William Hurt is, `In the beginning, didn't God create Adam to love Him?' The idea of filling an emotional void with something non-human is not a new idea. Beyond the concept of ideas for films, people have been doing it for centuries. All the lonely people out there whom without some form of companionship, be it friendship or love, fill a void with something to help them keep their minds off of their loneliness. This isn't the case with everyone; some prefer being alone to having to deal with others all together. But the best example I can draw is that of the character that Tom Hanks played in the recent Robert Zemeckis film, Cast Away. After being stranded on an island with nothing more than washed up packages, Hanks created a friendship with a volleyball, which he named, Winston. Although it proves to be something that audiences laughed at, it also added a sense of heart breaking sadness for the main character and the audience when he lost the volleyball at sea. Watching Hanks cry like a baby is very sad, but what's more, is that the audience can feel that character's pain. As such, the idea of creating some kind of companionship with a non-human possession is not uncommon. Could it be done with robots in the future? I wouldn't be surprised. In fact, the character that Jude Law plays is a gigolo. He is a lover-model and provides sensual pleasure for his female patrons. Who knows how far the idea of artificial intelligence could go if allowed. Whether or not it should be done is a whole other argument. Beyond the technicalities of the science and morality of artificial intelligence, A.I. is one of the most amazing motion pictures that I have ever seen. Based on a short story by Brian Aldiss, the idea for creating a film adaptation first was conceived by Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick and Spielberg toyed with the idea of which director would direct the project. However, after Kubrick's death, Spielberg decided that he would take the directing reigns in honor to the late Stanley Kubrick. When watching A.I., it's easy to notice that the ideas projected are that of Kubrick's. The futuristic world is cold and bleak. A movement has begun against Mecha, or robots. In fact, the film shows scenes of a `Flesh Fair,' in which people delight to watching the destruction of the Mecha robots. But the film is clearly Spielberg's baby. There is so much emotion in this film, from it's obvious love for family and friendship to the films beautiful and poignant score from composer John Williams. The soundtrack also features a beautiful song performed by Lara Fabian and Josh Groban called, `For Always,' which does not appear anywhere in the film. The performances in A.I. are great. And the films ending is one that is bittersweet in every way.I haven't been so emotionally moved by a Spielberg film since E.T., or Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Unfortunately, the Academy Awards chose to deny any real nominations to A.I., beyond that of Best Score, and Best Visual Affects. A.I. really was 2001s Best Picture, although I can't really complain about Ron Howard's film, A Beautiful Mind winning. Nonetheless, A.I. is really under-appreciated for its beauty and greatness that no other film in recent history has matched. I wish I could thank Spielberg for making this film. It proved to be one of those times when going to the movies will not be forgotten. It's moments like those that make watching films all the more worth it. We can learn something about the world around us, and take away a message or a feeling that cannot be matched by anything else. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prior to seeing this movie, I expected something quite different. That is, I expected more of a science fiction movie about robots. And, actually, after watching the first half, I wasn't sure I wanted to see the rest. Then, I figured out that this isn't a SciFi movie, it's a fantasy adventure, and as I followed the adventure I was drawn in!! I was so moved by this film that I wept profusely, afterward. Something that has never happened to me before. Perhaps having children of my own had something to do with it.Anyway, suffice it to say, I think this movie is well worth the watch. Just don't expect some SciFi action film. As another reviewer mentioned, expect what Spielberg does best - play on our heart strings!!I do have to point out, though, that while we are able to "feel" for this robot, he isn't a robot! He is a person acting as a robot. That is a very different thing. I don't think we will really know how we will react to a robot, until we have them - as real as they are in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. So why is this movie so misunderstood? I believe the answer is that most people have trouble investing emotions in a character that is, after all, a machine. Once you accept that a machine can and may someday be able to exceed the sum of it algorithms you will be able to appreciate this movie. The film opens with Professor Hobby (William Hurt) proposing that a company makes humanoid robots (or "mechas") that can love. There are already plenty of mechas that can simulate `love', but Hobby want a mecha that can actually love. Professor Hobby realized this dream with David. It is made clear throughout the movie that David is not just a computer program like the other mechas. Even the unruly mob recognizes this when they demand David's release. David demonstrates this difference when he damages his wiring by ingesting spinach. Roger Ebert criticized this and asked `wouldn't a mecha be programmed not to put things into its mouth?' Mr. Ebert missed the point. David is not to be thought of as a computer program because he has real emotions and is no longer constrained by a pre set program. The question becomes what is humankind's responsibility towards such a creation? The answer clearly is that we have an ultimate responsibility. Unfortunately in this case humankind has not evolved enough to make this decision. In fact, the masses are reminiscent of the mobs during the French Revolution who were hungry for the blood of French Aristocrats. Of course, humans pay the price for their barbarous nature by destroying themselves.The irony is that David holds the best qualities of man. Even the aliens realize that David is the highpoint of human culture. Rather than embrace David humans turn their back on him. Even after the human race has extinguished itself David waits patiently to be reunited. I found this to be tremendously poignant.One further note. I have heard complaints that there are too many endings to A.I. I disagree. I found myself pulled deeper and deeper into the movie with each successive layer. This works itself into a crescendo with an ending that is bittersweet. I have to say I thought about this movie for many weeks after I watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why this movie is good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that this movie is greatly misunderstood by so many people. It is unique in that this was a joint collaboration between Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Since Kubrick died it was Spielberg's job to finish the film. It is because of this that the film blends elements of both directors. It is not entirely a Spielberg film and nor is it entirely a Kubrick film. I think Spielberg did a wonderful job to integrate both there styles into this move and I think it succeeds. I think most people expect to see a movie that is entirely Kubrick's, like 2001 a space odyssey or a clockwork orange. Then other people expected to see a typical Spielberg film. To expect that is entirely unfair and these people turn themselves off before the y can get into this film. This film is I admit very deep and not for everybody. It requires a lot of thought. This is a movie in my opinion that raises certain questions in us such as the true nature of love, what makes us human, and what is death. These issues are very troubling to deal with. In Spielberg's film here the answers are not clear. They are ambiguous which is why many of us fear death, because we simply cannot be a 100 percent sure as to what will happen. This movie makes us think about it and this is hard for people to deal with. Once such an issue that causes a person so much grief enters the person will automatically shut off and say this movie is terrible, but it is really because they are afraid to go along for the emotional ride and maybe begin to think about these issues and start to explore them. Some people can simply not do this. These people usually prefer Steven Segal beating people up with pool sticks. I believe that this movie is for someone who is willing to go on an emotional ride and be ready to confront certain emotional issues in themselves. The hardest person to confront is ourselves. We may not like what we find. I have never seen a film that provoked such deep emotions in me. That is why I love this film. My advice is to go along with the emotional ride although it may be troubling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg really got himself in a tough position; to bring a great idea to the screens and make it as unique as Stanley Kubrick would have done it and etc. I'm not a fan of Spielberg's work and I love about 99% of Kubrick's work (they just work, no "artistic" motives here). To summarize this very long, hypnotic, 'difficult' film. It worked, even though I had my guards up when Haley Joel Osmment was mentioned as the artificial child and Spiel' as the director. The actors were right on the spot (especially Jude Law was brilliant thanks to his attractive robotic appearance and great acting skills) as Osment was suprisingly good. The only thing that I didn't like was that Spielberg little too much linked Pinochio to the plot. (maybe a spoiler) The narrative voice at the ending simplified and explained things a bit too much. No questions left to be asked. Perhaps to make the film more bearable and watchable for larger audiences? One of the most unique hollywood (mainstream?)film in a while, especially if done little buffing on the hard edges. Hopefully this helps Hollywood to take more chances and risks. As one can see, it's worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beware anyone: this is not a sci-fi movie, at least not following the typical meaning we usually give to the term "sci-fi". Kubrick himself knew it, when he asked Spielberg to direct this project, on which he has spent so much time. As Spielberg said many times, A.I. is a sort of modern fairy tale, with all the faults and the qualities you can find in this genre. As any other classic fairy tale, it can move or horrify the audience at the same time and it indeed contains some moral teachings. But it also contains a lot of humanity, which is uncommon to find in other movies labeled as "sci-fi". You may not like it, but anyway, this movie to me is a great piece of cinema, one of the best movies I've seen in the last years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I'm no Speilberg fan ('cept for Jaws) and that Osement's whiney li'l voice alone gives me agitta, but let's face it, the kid can act and Speilberg has given us one of the all time great endings!Unlike boring, pretentious, bloated messes like 2001, Bladerunner, and all 37 parts of Star Trek, this movie actually has a message other than "beware of the future". Unlike all 27 parts of Star Wars and the 10 new Hobbit movies, it's not some "good over evil" drivel. The message here is about the failures of both blind faith and technology.I feel bad that you sci-fi geeks had to sit thru something that offered a li'l warmth and truth and didn't offer enough costumes for you to wear to your future conventions. I also feel bad for you Kubrik fans that didn't get something completely deep, dark, and jaded, but in my opinion at least, you did get some reality. And coming from Speilberg's saccherine touch, not many would have expected that!As for the story, Robokid spends the last half of the movie looking for the Blue Fairy, on a quest for a miracle. He finds this Blue Fairy and waits, and waits, and waits. Much in the same way that many of our oppiated masses wait, and wait, and wait, at our churches, synagogues, mosques, and what have you. But self-created, imaginary gods, have no miracles.Technology on the other hand, can come close to offering a miracle, as seen with the robo-aliens, but in the end, it too falls short.In the end, the dead (Robokid's mom) stay dead and the never living (Robokid) stay never living . Only MEMORIES can change this!When Robokid awakens, he will know that thru the memories of his mom, she will, in part, live on. Thanks to these same memories which he holds dear (and no thanks to anything the robo-aliens could possibly do, nor anything that the Blue Fairy did) he too, despite never getting the blood, tissues, muscles and organs that he yearns for, will, in part, be human. The last of the humans at that.So save all the technical flaws, bloops, and blunders about DNA, or ice ages, or anything else for the "Goofs" section of IMDb and try to appreciate the simple message in this FANTASY. By the way, I am a big Kubrik fan myself (Full Metal Jacket features another all time great ending about life and actually being alive) and do have a "goof" for ya:Coney Island, where he finds the Blue Fairy, is no where near Manhattan!!! lol</fullReview>

Then HBO started showing it, I turned it on one evening as I lay on the couch and I've watched it 10 times since. This movie isn't made to be seen with the intent of downing a large bag of popcorn and a slurpy. Don't wait for the big explosions or car chases. There are no hot sex scenes. There are some actions scenes added mainly to keep the average viewer awake. I don't think they advance the story that much. It's a fairly dark movie. Slow moving in part, especially the end.It offers an artistic view of the future of our world. It puts you in a believable future. The focus is on the desire of beings to love and be loved. A rather melancholy tone runs throughout the movie. I think if you can identify with David you'll understand the mastery of this film. Have you ever felt lonely or abandoned? OK This isn't your psychotherapy session but I think this is where the heart of the film falls. When you want something so bad, you'll do anything to get it.****OK HERE COMES A SPOILER, MAYBE******* That is why the end of the movie is so important. So many people hate the end of the movie because it is so slow, almost unbearably the first time you watch it. It's like following the day in the life of a boring mother and child. But the fact that it is so unexciting is what now makes it so important for me. David wasn't searching for some amazing supermom who brings him to Disney World or buys him a dog. He only wanted to spend time with her and be loved by her. No matter what they were doing, making coffee, washing their hair, or sleeping. It's this desire to be with HIS mommy that makes the love story so incredible. It's moving to think that someone, a real boy or a robot, could love one person that much. See the movie more than once. Think about a love you've lost or longed for. The journey to find them is sometimes a rather tedious one. But when you find it, the smallest things seem so important and so worth the journey. See if you can identify. I truly think it this is a great story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Although it is kind of slow in the beginning portion, the story peaks later on into a much anticipated ending. David is a lovable robot that, despite what the creators claim, is a "real" boy in everyone's heart, except for his mother Monica's. This fact just makes him all the more endearing. David sets out on a quest to find the blue fairy from Pinocchio (this part makes me believe the writers were on Ecstasy or something, lol :D)because he believes the fairy will change him into a real boy, so that his mother will love him. I am leaving out a lot of details, but I can't tell you what happens. You'll just have to see the movie!_.-~*DeBoRaH*~-._</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot stomach a movie that is so much maudlin claptrap yet takes itself so seriously. I am so resentful of Steven Spielberg for wasting three hours of my life. Haley Joel Osment was annoying and creepy as the clingy little freak who should have been programmed to understand and accept rejection.Why was the doctor still in New York if it had all collapsed and been drowned by the rising oceans? What was up with the stupid mouth bridges leading into the city? When did the mother suddenly really love the little robot and start rationalizing to her husband that it was more than just a novelty? Why was the teddy bear the smartest, cutest, most believable character in the movie? How can they say "and then he sat there staring at the blue fairy for 2000 years" and have that be an acceptable transition to the completely stupid ridiculous ending?If it hadn't taken itself so seriously, maybe I could have hated it a bit less. If it wasn't so pretentious, maybe I wouldn't be so driven to hunt down Steven Spielberg and demand the 3 bucks it cost to rent the movie back. If it wasn't so annoying, maybe I wouldn't still be flaming about it on a movie website.I give it 1/2 star, for the snuggle bear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful, but flawed movie. For the most part it shows an honest attempt on Spielberg's part to emulate Kubrick. But Spielberg is Spielberg and Kubrick is Kubrick - they are wonderful directors when following their own vision, but they don't mix well. The first act of the movie is very good. It sets up the exposition in a minimally irritating way and then gets into the story. Hayley Joel Osment shows his incredible talent as he goes from the emotionless robot to one with too much emotion.The second act suffers from the "Gee Whiz" syndrome - they try to show off too much in too short a period of time. Here's a wonderful place with just a hint of the story. Sorry, can't explore those ideas we have to rush you off to another neat locale with great production design and just a hint of backstory, and whoosh on we go to the next.The second act ends with a Kubrick ending - it has a certain mix of irony that reminds me of Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange. The movie could very well have ended there, if Stanley were directing. But it is not a happy ending and certainly not a commercial ending.Once Kubrick has had his ending, his influence leaves entirely - the film takes off in a completely different direction. The first two parts were strictly hard SF - it was very much based on merely extrapolating the present - any leaps they made were believable. Then it takes off into fantasy and the audience has to shift paradigms. When you ask the audience to suspend belief, you have to make sure to replace it with something, and you've gotta be careful to avoid breaking that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick's collaboration has produced nothing short of a fantastic failure. While both directors work marvelously well on their own, in, "A.I." the two have fabricated a film that, when considering all aspects of its content, understandably has extremely mixed reviews. The story of the movie and the goal of the protagonist have sudden changes, never staying consistent. There are arguably three chunks to the movie, and each one feels like it could belong to an entirely separate movie. In the beginning, the location is in a family-type house, where the protagonist, David, is introduced. David, being a realistic robot boy, is faced with challenges he is not ready to face. Then, the story is changed from his troubles in being accepted into the family, to coping with being abandoned by the person he loves most, Monica, and trying to get back to her in a dangerous world. After a long sequence of futile cat-and-mouse chasing events, David ends up thousands of years in the future, where he finally concludes his journey by meeting a clone of Monica, provided by the extremely odd alien-robots there.The casting was well-done. While some characters, such as Gigolo Joe, were rather unnecessary, the actors did a fantastic performance. Haley Joel Osment, who played David, successfully played out being a robot, slowly evolving to appear more and more human-like. Some characters could have been fleshed out a bit more, including how the actors played them, such as Henry, played by Sam Robards. The visual effects were stunning, and almost made up for the complex and crumpled plot. The mixed use of practical and visual effects brought out the best in the art direction, making it feel as if there were no effects at all. The robots with parts missing, or the entire city of Manhattan underwater, all of it mixed together and felt incredibly real. The effects became somewhat out of hand once the last third of the movie was reached, as there was a bit too heavy of a "futuristic" feel, especially with the ridiculous looking alien- robots.While there are many stunning parts to "A..I" there is no denying that it had more than its fair share of failure moments. There was the clich of assumptions and no questions being asked when Henry continually wreaked havoc on David's reputation. There was also the classless continuation of mature jokes from Gigolo Joe, which half his lines seemed to consist of. Not to forget the sheer ridiculousness of the immense jump to the future, which included the far-fetched creatures that dwelled there. If two heads are better than one, then why was this such a flop?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sci-Fiction version of Pinocchio was wooden and unpleasant. Artificial Indifferent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie wasn't very interesting in my opinion. It was just downright sad, and depressing. Based on Brian Aldiss's short story "Super-Toys Last All Summer Long". The movie follows the story of David (Haley Joel Osment), a robot boy uniquely programmed with the ability to love looking for love. Abandoned by the mother Monica (Frances O'Connor), he is programmed to care about. In an attempt to gain Monica's love and acceptance, David becomes determined to find the blue fairy from the story Pinocchio so he can become a real boy. This film has always been pet project for Director Stanley Kubrick since the 1970's. The film development suffered years, partly because Kubrick felt CGI was not advanced enough to create the story. In 1995, Kubrick handed the project to his friend Steven Spielberg. Under Spielberg, the project never gain any momentum Kubrick's death in 1999. Since the death of Kubrick, Steven Spielberg felt like making the film would be a tribute to his friend's filmmaking career. What we got wasn't a film for the audience, but a film for his friend. Spielberg made the film as he believed Kubrick would have wanted it, to the best of his abilities, and no matter how well he pulled it off, he would have been screwed by the audience due many factors. It's a mix between Kubrick's chilly bleakness and Spielberg's warm-hearted optimism to the point that the film is lost in the direction it wants to go. Surprising, it's seem to me, that the directors switch roles, with Spielberg wanting the film to be all dark and tragedy, while Kubrick wanting to do a more family friendly movie. The beginning and the end is all Kubrick's ideas. So what we got was two different movies, playing as one. The logistics of this movie are just silly and there is so little charm that I cannot look past. Based on my own opinion, I didn't find David to be very entertaining. I just found him creepy. Haley Joel Osment did a great job portraying an android, but it didn't had the charm of the 1999's Six Sense film. It was a void of a performance because of that factor. It's a robot. If the robot had more human characteristic, it might have been not as boring. I found Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) more entertaining than David. Why wouldn't he have a movie about him? He has a very interesting story. He's in trouble because he's framed for a murder by a jealous ex-lover, and thus, is on the run. That would be more a story, than this silly Pinocchio rip-off. Why not have HAL 9000!? I think he's more human that David. Ever since he died, Kubrick's films have been subjected to a wealth of analysis, writers hitting upon hidden meanings everywhere. The movie felt like a very dark vacuum of nothing, no hope and no reason to hope for. The movie has that Mary Shelley's Frankenstein feel to it, humans discard the moral and ethical of creating life without thinking of the very thing need to create that life: love. I felt the cruelty of the human characters in this story was incredible. I mean absolutely cruel and callous. There were very few likable characters and it hurt the film. For David to ever quest for Monica's attention, is like watching a domestic abuse victim wanting attention from her abuser. There were hundreds of different ways than abandoning David. Reprogram him, change the settings, wipe his memory, adjusted his abilities. Any parent that abandoned isn't worth being a parent in the first place. I don't like Monica as character, and for David to seek her out is sick. They stick to the people that treat them bad, because they feel like they deserve that treatment. Maybe it's a metaphor for children seeking closure and forgiveness after a parent abandons them so it makes David more human. I don't know, but to me it seems like an awful idea for expectations that will just be shattered. That's why for me, it was hard watching this film. I didn't want David to find the Blue Fairy, because I thought Monica wasn't a good mother in the first place to gain his love. I like the ending with the truth was revealed that he will never get what he wants, but in the end, we got the cop out version. Kubrick was the one who wrote the extra 15 minutes 2000 years in the future, against the suggestions of fellow writers. Spielberg decided to keep it to best realize the vision of his friend. It isn't a sweet ending scene at all. It's really quite tragic as well. The 'double ending' was what drove the final nail in the coffin for me. Visual, the movie was wonderful. The score by John Williams amazing. The acting is great, but overall, it was a no-win situation for Steven Spielberg. Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst movie from Steven Spielberg. As much as critic want to say its Steven Spielberg's fault that he ruined what was presumably Kubrick's vision. It wasn't Spielberg that add all the cheesy, emotional business. It was Stanley Kubrick's mistake. Stanley Kubrick might have reach God like levels since dying, that might angry some of his fans if you find anything about him to criticize, but he was pretty human to me. While I am a huge fan of Kubrick's work, I just don't like this film. But if you enjoy it, then more power to you. I felt like my time was wasted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artificial Intelligence is an engaging science-fiction adventure that melds Kubrick's chilly bleakness with Spielberg's warm touch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If not for his untimely death, this would have been Stanley Kubrick's next film after the mixed critical reaction he received for his last film Eyes Wide Shut (1999). His unfinished project was taken on by his long-time cinematic pal, the illustrious Steven Spielberg, who as a tribute to the great director of Dr. Strangelove (1964), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and A Clockwork Orange (1971), decided to complete the film for him.Written by Spielberg based on Kubrick's early material and vision, Artificial Intelligence is at times brilliant and immensely thought-provoking. As a science-fiction film, this is one of the genre's better Hollywood entries. It may have suffered scathing criticisms from people who disliked the extended ending (which I admire and will try to rationalize its importance), but it remains to be a very well-told and identifiable story that has its roots in Pinocchio and realist fantasy.The story tells of a robot boy called David (Haley Joel Osment) who is brought home by a loving couple to "replace" their comatose son, Martin, who would never wake. Set in the distant future, the creation of "David", a mechanical human-like companion who is programmed to love, turns self-aware and seeks to become a real human after the miraculous recovery of Martin leads to a competition for love from Monica (Frances O'Connor), their mother. Because of a series of misunderstandings, David is left to survive on his own outside the comfort of home together with Teddy, a talking toy bear who can think.For most parts, Artificial Intelligence is a film chronicling the journey of one persevering robot as he attempts to find his "Blue Fairy" who he hopes would turn him into a human so that he could return to Monica and be loved again. The existentialist nature of Spielberg's film allows viewers to question the idea of human consciousness. What makes us humanly real? Is it because we can differentiate truth from falsehood? Or is it because we are living flesh and blood? By similar extension, what makes a Mecha humanlike? Is it because they look human? Or is it because of their capability for reciprocal compassion and love? Spielberg's direction is mostly assured, and with Janusz Kaminski (Schindler's List, 1993; Saving Private Ryan, 1998) photographing the film, expect a visual feast for the eyes. The use of visual effects, which is nominated for an Oscar here, while unabashedly cool, retains a measure of hypnotic allure. There are moments in the film in which only Spielberg could have conjured up. For instance, the shot of Teddy's silhouette against a huge, bright moon, which references E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982).In addition, the heavily-criticized final thirty minutes features some impressive visuals, with one particular moment evidently a homage to Kubrick's 2001 ? that of a box-like vehicle floating across a desolate icy landscape. Speaking of which, it is with an acute sense of irony to note that the final act was what Kubrick had actually envisioned ? the idea of moving thousands of years into the future ? faithfully and boldly recreated by Spielberg but unfortunately thought of as overindulging in Hollywood sentimentality.In my view, I feel that the final act is very important as it gives the film the closure that it needs ? a measured, subtle, (and even meandering) philosophical ending that not only tugs at the heartstrings, but offers composer John Williams to finally perform the full main theme in all of its beauty and melancholy, which until then has only been heard in parts. Artificial Intelligence is an engaging science-fiction adventure that melds Kubrick's chilly bleakness with Spielberg's warm touch. But for better or worse, it is the latter's imprint that is more influential here.GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visually stunning and narratively complex, it manages to combine Spielberg's and Kubrick's sensibilities without feeling too uneven. Basically, it's a three act work. The first act feels like typical Spielbergian family drama, with the (relatively) light tone and comedic aspect. It raises issues of humanity, but never really tackles them, leaving that for the second act, a dark, imaginative piece that manages to be both entertaining and deep. It's my favourite bit of the film. By the third act, a lot of enjoyment has faded from the film, leaving a deeply though-provoking work that I still don't think I've got a handle on. The gradual shift from light to dark is accomplished well, and the end isn't as frustrating to me as it is to others, but it's more of a flawed masterpiece than an out-and-out one. The visual effects are downright incredible, and Jude Law's performance is terrific, and the visions of the future that this film shows are simultaneously thrilling and terrifying. Still, it's not perfect, but it's pretty close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "serious" Spielberg bombs out AGAIN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it. Spielberg, as a director, is generally lousy at making serious movies, partly because he fills them with so much sentimental slop. This movie tries to be emotional and fails abysmally at all levels. (Similarly, many posters on this site who saw War of the Worlds also were appalled at Spielberg's apparent lack of ability to make us feel any emotions for THOSE characters, either, particularly Tom Cruise). Part of the problem is that the film, as a whole, is so sadly lacking in continuity that the viewer gets lost in the mishmash of scenes and characters. None of it came together or made sense.The first half of the movie, the viewer is led to believe that this movie has something to do with families and family relations, love, etc. OK, I can buy that. The problem is that approximately half way through the film, the filmmakers "pull the rug out from under the viewer", so to speak, and send the storyline careening off in a completely different direction from the first half. NO explanation is given for this lack of insight or continuity -- the viewer is simply supposed to continue watching. As viewers, though, we get lost. The family is all of a sudden completely OUT of the movie. Why did we waste the first half then on something that would be meaningless? The last hour and a half of the film, the storyline spins out of control in all directions. It is as if Spielberg intentionally wants to confuse, annoy, irritate and befuddle the viewer. I was wondering, what in the world is this movie about, anyway? I'm not certain I have ever figured it out. Then, you get to the end and it is a real stinker. Let's feel bad for some little robot-boy that we were made not to care about for the previous 5/6ths of the movie. What?? If I wanted a film with no storyline, I would rent "Open Water" again. No thank you.I do have to say that John Williams portrays the film's sombre moods very well. However, the preachy dialog and the disjointed incomprehensible storyline made this movie a bomb. Skip this one!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard that Stanley Kubrick had planned to make this his next movie, but put it on hold to create "Eyes Wide Shut." His friend and colleague, Steven Spielberg, completed this project after Kubrick's untimely death. I wasn't certain what to expect from a Kubrick concept brought to life by Spielberg. Spielberg is a master director, but his occasional history of dipping into the maudlin would not seem to be a good filter for Kubrick's cold case studies.The story is an odyssey about a robot child who has been programmed to love, and it would seem an equally odd choice for Kubrick. The robot, David (played by Haley Joel Osment), finds himself on a quest to become human, and hence fully lovable. This story might have been treated too coldly by Kubrick, just as one could fear Spielberg surrendering to his overly sentimental side.I was startled to see how well the two styles meshed. Spielberg's emotional infusion delivered a sharper sense of real pain when thrown into sharp relief against Kubrick's classic futuristic vision. The result is a heart-wrenching play of relationships, family, and responsibility, woven into a future of rampant decadence, conflict, and fundamentalism. It's as if Kubrick's originating influence scrapes any potential sap off of Spielberg's emotional treatment, laying bare a raw, disturbing core of human feeling.The actors all deliver solid performances, but occasionally the different scenes seem to belong to different directors. Compare William Hurt's (per usual) understated performance with Robin Williams' manic turn as a giddy database interface. In a sprawling tale such as this, however, it hardly matters. The story line moves from a harsh, Orwellian (Kubrickian?) drama to the strangest buddy movie I have ever seen, and then leaps even further into the future. The protagonists journey from an astringent suburbia to a Roman-style coliseum, from a high-tech metropolis to a progression of hushed apocalyptic vistas. Jude Law's performance as a robot gigolo is a real treat, and Osment is by series eerie, disturbing and touching. Osment's scenes with Frances O'Connor are particularly effective.This film will bore those who crave action or a more familiar storyline. For those who can surrender to the film's rich textures and epic narrative, the personal and societal questions it poses are interesting. What are our responsibilities to our possessions? What if those possessions were sentient? What is love without responsibility - is it still love? Where will our evolving science take our culture if it continues to outpace our ethical evolution? Some questions are answered, but most are not; they are left to roll around inside the viewer after the film.The ending seems inspired by that famous collaboration between Kubrick and Arthur C. Clark, and has confused a lot of people. Hint: there are NO aliens in this movie (as much as one might have doubts about William Hurt). Spielberg's master hand instills a beautiful and effective poignancy into the ending. If one can buy into the blend of high-tech sci-fi and strong, emotional content, this film delivers a nice punch. It is an ambitious fable that is well-told, beautifully envisioned, skillfully acted, and originally rendered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can I be honest? I think this is one of Spielburg's better movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not kidding when I wrote that summary. Artificial Intelligence:AI is a very captivating and astonishing achievement from Steven Spielburg. And I do think it is one of his better movies along with Schindler's List, ET and Jaws. For one thing it is beautifully filmed; the cinematography was gorgeous and the special effects were absolutely jaw dropping. The direction is very refined, and while reminiscent of Pinocchio the story driving this film is resolutely dark, ambitious and even daring. The acting is extremely impressive. Haley Joel Osment proves that he is a fine child actor in a truly astonishing lead performance, and Jude Law in one of his better performance matches him perfectly as his protector. Many complained of the character of Monica, personally I had no problem with her and Frances O'Connor makes the most of what she is given. There is terrific support also from Brendan Gleeson and Robin Williams (as the voice of Dr Know). That teddy bear, voiced by Jack Angel, is really rather cute. Some of the film is intensely moving thanks to the remarkable and eerie score from John Williams, however there are some parts of the in-general well written screenplay that are close to over-sentimental. My only other complaint is that the "feel-good" ending felt rather tacked on. In conclusion, a rather bleak, ambitious but daring and compelling movie. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The love child of Blade Runner and Pinocchio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you took Blade Runner and crossed it with Pinocchio, and slapped Kubrick's style on it, you'd end up with AI. The problem is that AI is not as good as Blade Runner or Pinocchio, and after the hype and gushing reviews that have surrounded it, it is a colossal disappointment. The story, of the young robot child David, has numerous plot gaps. As I was watching it, I started to think that I must have been disappearing into a parallel dimension every five minutes, then coming back having missed an idea being fully explored or a plot device being explained. The fact that the film kept missing parts out was almost a relief, as not since the English Patient had I been so acutely aware of having numb butt cheeks and wanting to take a stroll outside before the end.The story is about the young robot child, David (played by The Sixth Sense's startled-rabbit boy Haley Joel Osment). David does not realise that he is a robot. He is rejected by his human 'mother' who cannot accept him, so goes to New York searching for the Blue Fairy (from Pinocchio), and meets his creator - he wants to become a real boy. In 1982, Ridley Scott made Blade Runner, and against a visually stunning backdrop, told the same basic story, only better, when Roy Batty approached Eldon Tyrrel asking for "more life". I cared about Roy Batty, Rick Deckard and Rachael, but in AI, I can only bring myself to care for the Teddy, who alongside the strutting Gigolo Joe (Jude Law on top form), is the main highlight of the film. Haley Joel Osment is very good in his role, portraying as he does a robot that is so convincing as a human that he becomes weirdly over-human. Call me a child though, but I would have liked to see him being put together - it may have re-enforced his artificiality. Spielberg appears to have been so intent on respecting Kubrick's vision for the film that he forgot to direct it with his own head on - thus the film leans closer to Kubrick than it does to Spielberg. After having seen Eyes Wide Shut and AI, I can't help but think that Kubrick should have called it a day when he directed Full Metal Jacket. Both films, even though Spielberg directed the latter, are disjointed, frustrating and over-indulgent. AI finally loses touch with reality altogether, in a sequence which is reminiscent of the end of 2001. It is almost as if, being presented with such a fantastical sequence, that we should be dumbstruck with awe and ready to fawn over the film. I'd argue that maybe the ending is just daft. AI is an amazing looking film, which reminded me at different times of 2001, Blade Runner, ET, and even Back to the Future II. The SFX are very impressive, but this is to expected. The film is tinged with poignancy when the twin towers of the World Trade Center make an appearance towards the end. AI may well get better with age or further viewings. Maybe Spielberg will release a better cut ten years from now and do for AI what Ridley Scott did for Blade Runner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a lot of reasons for disliking this movie, but the one that stood out to me was it's poor understanding of themes which have been widely explored by various authors, and it's trite morality.Let's start from the beginning. The opening scene shows the directors of CyberCorp discussing the next step in Mecha - a robot which can love. In real world discussions of AI (as well as in many well written science fiction novels), there's been a lot of thought put as to what exactly AI means. Is the sex-bot in the opening scene self aware? Obviously it's capable of abstract thought (love making takes planning, after all, as well as subtle judgements of one's partner), but is it capable of learning? Video game makers have already developed AIs that can adapt to the player's strategy, but they're not capable of innovating; of creating strategies that the makers didn't originally intend.So, for argument's sake, the sex bot has complex mechanisms for executing language, analyzing human emotion, and adapting to her partner - but not the more abstract ability to innovate or to self-reflect. The next step, then, would be to build a robot with an imagination... oh wait, we just want a robot that will love? Well, define love for me? Is it really that hard to program, if you already have the sex-bot program? Don't get me wrong, like any other human being love is one of my primary driving behaviours - but at the end of the day, isn't it just a fixation on one person combined with a positive-feedback loop? It's hardly a major challenge to AI writers, and if Michael Chrighton can be believed, they'd already developed it back in the 70s (re: Terminal Man). Heck, I've played Civ 4, and if you play your cards right, you can get some of the other AIs in that game to 'love' you.You know... taking what I just wrote into consideration, maybe David's dialogue was pretty realistic, after all...Now, do you see what I just did there? I wrote an interesting, plausible, and easily-understandable piece on the development of AI. Instead of the Star Trek techno-babble about 'mapping neurons,' the CEO at the beginning of the movie could have said something like this; framed the moral question for the rest of the movie. But of course A.I. didn't do this, because it's *not really science fiction!* A couple of other points, that I won't belabour too heavily, but need to point out: how smart was Teddy? If you were building an intelligent toy for small children, would you give it full reasoning ability, or would you just give it a simple 'comfort' algorithm? Free thought and independent thinking could make the thing dangerous; Keep It Simple, Stupid. Second of all, why do all the humans act as if they've never seen any of the apocryphal literature about Robot Wars? What is this, a zombie flick? A remake of Karel &#x10c;apek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) would have been more relevant. Even though he wrote it in 1921, it was more forward thinking (let alone original) than this movie was. A.I. was is not science fiction, it's just a fairy tale - and a very poorly plotted, disjointed, and morally ambiguous one at that. As another reviewer here pointed out, Pinochio sought self improvement to earn his way into being a real boy; David never seeks to improve, and just wants a magic pill.One final point - if the Mecha are generally considered 'sub-human', and behave in predictable algorithms which deny any sympathy, then torturing them would be about as much fun as holding a fan blade still so that it makes a clicking noise. So why is humanity so vicious in their persecution? This was just another stupid Hollywood movie for stupid people who like to put on airs of intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daring, but Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think there is a person on the planet who doesn't love Steven Spielberg, or can at least appreciate all he has done for cinema. He has directed and produced so many classic films, and most notably for the Science Fiction genre. But I have to say, I think A.I is overrated. And to be quite frank it becomes a mess midway through. I thought the movie would be the boy trying to fit into his new family and the trials and tribulations. But once the mother leaves him it dives into an unsatisfying territory.Without any true stars leading the film besides perhaps Jude Law, your stuck with Haley Joel Osment, who his best role is still Pay it Forward in my opinion. I realize he is a robot, but he becomes whiny for most of the movie. But there were parts I really did enjoy. The scenes with the mother were a definite highlight. In particular, the ending scene with him laying there with his 'mommy' served as a pleasing ending to an overall disappointing sci-fi.I was completely thrown off by the Aliens who come in 2000 years later. I just thought I was going to see a movie near the same vein as the upcoming Transcendence and not some 'Aliens take over our world after we all die' type of movie. I also really hated the scenes with Jude Law. I think he's a great talent but his presence was goofy, even if he was just meant for comic relief. This is just another one of those movies I think is highly overrated, like Blade Runner.5.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those gagging on the glut of cinematic junk food should welcome this brilliantly made visionary work that's bursting with provocative ideas. A robot boy (Haley Joel Osment) programmed to have feelings is abandoned by this flesh-and-blood mother (Frances O'Connor) and tries to find her.A.I. Artificial Intelligence is an ambitious, overblown, hugely interesting futuristic fable, a technically dazzling riff on Pinocchio with debts to Stanley Kurbrick. Whole sections misfire, but the overall thrust is a darkly imaginative quest into the subconscious, and the twists of the fairytale narrative are less consoling than they initially appear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was simply a beautiful film. Very much like Kubricks classics. The story was extremely original and the acting and emotions were top-notch. One of the all time best performances of a child actor, I can say anything else. I disliked the ending though. What was the point of damaging the film with that stupid overly happy ending? Before that I could actually have rated it 10. I mean, think of how powerful it would have been if it ended with David being trapped at the bottom of the sea for all time. It would have been a metaphor for something above most of us, but I guess this was Spielbergs work. I still rated it 9/10 because of all that happened before but the ending was seriously poor.I would like to add that I think Spielberg is a great filmmaker, his only problem is that he don't always see the endings that work because he always want them to end with a smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way Too Many Too's In Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg wants to make memorable movies. Well.. he succeeded again! Only this time I'm being a bit cynical.Normally Steven grants me heaps of enjoyment with the larger part of his curriculum but with A.I. he really missed just about every chance to make something out of it. He wanted to create a modern fairytale, but if this one was told to me as bedtime story I would have had nightmares.For me there are too many "too's" here: too long too boring too much aimed at tear-jerking too much showing off know-how on the technical side too much overacting by Haley Joel Osment who single-handedly kills the entire movie too unbelievable too much sidetracking from the story and I can go on like this for half an hour.... The only reason I still give it 1 out of 10 is that visually it is really good (which is only sticking out because the rest is so bad)Getting back to Haley Joel Osment (who in my opinion is the biggest reason for my disliking this flick) Haley Joel Osment is a very good actor; "The Sixth Sense" being a mayor breakthrough, and to give another example, I really enjoyed him in "Secondhand Lions". The problems with H.J. is that HE KNOWS he's a good actor. This gets in his way as I think that he wants to show everyone how good he is (it's probably his youth). In "A.I." this leads to overacting which in my case has led to a lot of toilet visits... and stomach emptying.Sorry y'all, but that's my verdict.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It goes to show not to listen to critics or hype. I stayed away from this movie because of that. I came across it on HBO and kept seeing it from the middle. Each time I caught it drew me in.The layers and textures of this film reach past the cold exterior of the subject and reach deep down into the core of our humanity.This is masterfully expressed in the most subtle of ways like a water painting,the music fit so well and made the story understandable. I was totally unprepared to be affected or touched by this movie. the story proves that love transcends all limits prejudices and setbacks.The development of the mother/son relationship demonstrates that when a mother (parent) imprints the value of love into their child, that love will return to them later in life.(Even though he was too late to find her before her own life ended) that love she taught him was stronger than any amount of time. So much so he had to confirm it because he knew within himself she would never intentionally abandon him like she did.When he finally found the blue fairy,he got an honest answer to his quest which made his last day more satisfying to share with her. How many of us wish we had the chance to spend a day with a loved one.I haven't cried so much since "something for Joey".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting and writing was so bad I couldn't even make it past the first 20 minutes of this film. Overrated poorly-made film that was just riding on the coattails of Haley Joel Osment's short-lived early Sixth Sense fame. Utterly forgettable. IMDb says I need 10 lines of text to fill up this review, but I can't even think about that much to say about this film. Hyperbolous dialog that makes you say, "No one, even in some fantasy future time period, talks like that." Can I stop writing yet? Admittedly, i'm not a big sci-fi fan. Mostly because most science fiction movies, like this one, are stupid. But i couldn't get past the over-dramatic exposition to even make it into act one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A most thought-provoking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best way to describe "A.I." is that it is a cross between "E.T." and "2001: A Space Odyssey." Two of the most creative and talented film-makers in all of cinematic history (Spielberg and Kubrick) come together to make one of the most confounding films ever.The story concerns the creation of a robot child named David who is more human in terms of emotion then most others of his kind. After being abandoned by his surrogate parents in the woods, he resolves to find the elusive Blue Fairy who can make him into a real, live boy.OK, so the film also has some allusions to "Pinnochio." That might overwhelm things for some but this film is a feast for the eyes with some of the most astounding visuals ever put on celluloid. Also, in true Kubrick fashion, there are many thought-provoking questions and ideas. However....The films has it's flaws, not too many but pretty egregious nonetheless. Among them: the lead performance by Haley Joel Osment is both obnoxious and annoying, the end goal (the aforementioned Fairy) is absolutely ridiculous and the ending is a complete, Spielbergian joke. Oddly enough, the acting is just OK but nothing special.Regardless of it's faults, this stands as one of the significant films ever mainly because of it's unique pedigree and the controversial legacy it has since spawned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dramatic, frightening piece; with a real air of both mystery and tragedy at the centre of it all. AI is worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can see the flashes of genius in Spielberg's 2001 film Artificial Intelligence: AI, the flashes of genius that Kubrick himself would have been proud of. The project began life as a Kubrick feature, but was handed over to Spielberg who then fittingly rounded the piece off following Kubrick's death. I think the film would've sat quite nicely with the already vast collection of widely recognised great films the man made. As it happens, Artificial Intelligence: AI is a film that manages to combine ideas, themes and writing that produces genuine emotion with the latest and greatest in special effects to deliver something close to remarkable. The film is a wild; all encompassing; unpredictable and adventure fuelled tale of a young cyborg boy on a Pinocchio infused journey to uncover who, or what, the Blue Fairy is, and where they're based so that the boy may become 'real'. To merely say that it is quite the visual and emotional experience, would be understating it somewhat.Haley Joel Osment plays the young, robotic boy of the title; a certain David who's initially adopted by the Swinton family in the 22nd Century, the husband and father of which is named Henry; and is an employee at the company that has made David. David's purpose is to come across as son-like and as real as possible, thus injecting love and well-being into the household he's assigned to. Any complaints or criticisms in the past about whoever in regards to child actors coming across as wooden, or robotic, in their skills sort of take a jab back here, as the child-actor lead is indeed, a robot in what is a performance by Osment which works.David is a son that doesn't need feeding, educating, sleep nor too much attention in regards to constantly keeping it entertained. It creeps about, it follows its newly acquired family and it does and says simplistic things. After a while, David's presence sparks off a troublesome relationship with the Swinton's real son, a certain Martin whose problems with disease have rendered him half machine anyway by way of his artificial legs. Martin and David's antagonism is born out of Martin's sadistic and naive response to the new family member, further instilling a somewhat unfortunate sense of humans being ill suited to the technology on display. These sequences also get across a sense of who are the real individuals you ought to be afraid of; a sense that Martin is nastier and more frightening than David is, despite David's collection of initial eerie, ominous scenes and actions. What these early house-set sequences tap into, is the human race's supposed difficulty in dealing with technology and modernity they themselves have created and allowed to spill out into the hands of others whom are either unsure of it, or might misuse it. It's here a somewhat sly allegory to the sorts of weapons certain nations have access to, or are supposedly in the process of creating, might be read into.As the film appears to be bedding down into a household set; domestically driven; family orientated drama about human beings, and their (in)ability to co-exist with machines in an ever changing world, it jumps ship and broadens out to become something else entirely. The film adopts a relatively routine, familiar even, arc of the singular strand variety; that is to say it is a raw character study of how one individual will cover a number of different locales, forever discovering himself and things about other people as they get ever closer to their goal. David's journey takes him from a down-to-Earth home in the 22nd Century; to the 22nd Century equivalent of a red light district; to some sort of derby gathering during which old and worn out robots are blown apart for sake of entertainment (which sounds like the premise for some more recent, inferior science fiction films); right the way through to ocean covered, post-apocalyptic cities and the items buried deep within the fathoms.David's journey sees him accompanied, on and off, by two other machines; both of whom are designed to serve human beings in some form, and one of whom struggles in this role in what is a further example of the clashes between man and machine when they have an altercation with a human that'll see them go on the run from the law. This character is Gigolo Joe, a sweet talking; built in jukebox sporting; male prostitute droid played by Jude Law, while the far smaller Teddy (Angel), a mere child's toy, talks in a monotone manner expressing the best possible course of action as David flits from one set up to another. Teddy's low-key and gruff, electronic voice complete with constant referencing to the lead by his very name, 'David', echoes HAL's referencing of another respective lead, by way of 'Dave', from a past Kubrick feature.Like that respective film; Artificial Intelligence: AI begins at one point, a relatively low key and familiar enough domestic locale, before branching way off the beaten path and into the uncharted realms of the fantastical. It isn't quite the experience of 2001: A Space Odyssey, beginning at the dawn of mankind and going right the way through to everything that came with that respective film's finale, but it's of that scope and of that aspiration. There's a lot of ground for the characters to cover in Artificial Intelligence: AI, both physically and emotionally, and the film never allows the spectacle of its locations and special effects to overwhelm nor consume the heart-felt, often harrowing quest the lead is going on. This achievement, on top of what is a riveting and heart-felt adventure, is enough to recommend the film to a pretty high degree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!! Just what the world was waiting for--a combination Spielberg/Kubrick movie--what a disaster! A couple get a robot boy David (Haley Joel Osment--very good) to replace their "dead" son. They grow to love him and vice versa. Then (with no explanation) their "dead" son is alive and living. They get rid of David and he's on a quest (with a walking, talking teddy bear) to find out how to be a real boy. He's helped by a way over the top Jude Law playing Gigolo Joe. The film is too long (2 1/2 hours), boring and confusing mishmash of previous Kubrick and Spielberg movies--that's a real problem, it prevents this film from having an identity of its own. There's the robot boy (Kubrick), the loving family (Spielberg), the walking talking teddy bear (VERY Spielberg), a city called Rouge full of sex and womens bodies (think a PG-13 version of "Clockwork Orange"), a very eerie NYC under water (Kubrick) and a snoozy half-hour ending with aliens (direct descendents from Spielberg's "Close Encounters") and endless, deadening moralizing about him being a little boy (Kubrick again). The movie could have lost 20-30 minutes easy--way too slow. The tone of the film is very cold and clinical like "2001: A Space Odessey" (Kubrick). I didn't give a damn about any of these people or their problems. A few things kept me in my seat: the incredible special effects; Osment's quiet restrained performance (this kid is a wonder); Law going over the top constantly (and enjoying it) as Gigolo Joe and (I hate to admit this) the walking talking teddy bear. Just completely adorable!Still, I can not recommend it. Too slow, too cold and a boring, absolutely stupid ending. And what was William Hurt doing here? A big disappointment. Not a horrible film, but considering the talent involved a real disappointment. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came to check the rating after I finished this movie for the 5th time, only to find out it was not only below 8, it was below 7! There are some people who couldn't "feel" this movie and gave it 1 out of 10... It certainly has lots of unrealistic and unexplained parts, but none of those are really relevant to the story anyway! It's a story of a child wanting his mother's love, and that child happened to be a robot, the scientific details doesn't even matter. It's a fairy tale about human emotions, consequences of robotic invention, and love. If it's hard to connect these concept to scientific fiction, then look at it as a drama! I personally don't think there's anything sad about the ending. It's a dream come true, like David (the main character) said himself; he basically died happily ever after with his beloved mother, and that's very pleasant to me.The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because the movie is too long; it can be quite tiresome from time to time.</fullReview>

Don't plan on "vegging" with this film. The character of David draws you in as you watch. I think his desire to be loved is something we all desire and strive for in one way or another. His experiences of sibling rivalry, abandonment, and pain reach us deep inside. His journey for the Blue Fairy is one we all take in some form. Hopefully, each of us finds what we are looking for. Thanks to Spielburg, who did an excellent job, and I would definitely see it again. Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.I. Artificial Intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was due to be made by Stanley Kubrick just after he finished Eyes Wide Shut, he did start it, but Golden Globe nominated Steven Spielberg took over direction when he died. Basically Prof. Hobby - The Visionary (William Hurt) has the idea to create a robot who can love, i.e. creating a child robot that will love in the way a real child loves its parents. The couple that take the robot child, David (Haley Joel Osment), months later are Monica (Bedazzled's Frances O'Connor) and Henry Swinton (Sam Robards), as a replacement for their real son Martin (Jake Thomas), in a coma. Monica can't cope with trying to love a robot, and when Martin returns home all healthy she just can't take it anymore, and she sumps her in the woods. When David eventually finds civilisation, he finds a community of Mecha robots, and he forms a friendship Gigolo Joe (Golden Globe nominated Jude Law). Remembering the story of Pinocchio, David wants to find the Blue Fairy to make his dreams of being a real child come true. Somehow, this Blue Fairy does appear to be reality, but he cannot be transformed into a real boy to be loved by his "mother" Monica, she instead grants him the wish to have a day with her loving him like her own. Also starring Brendan Gleeson as Lord Johnson-Johnson, Ken Leung as Syatyoo-Sama, Sir Ben Kingsley as Specialist, Robin Williams as Dr. Know, Meryl Streep as Blue Mecha, Chris Rock as Comedian and Jack Angel as Teddy. It is very odd viewing this film, I felt uncomfortable during the mother trying to love a robot child, I got confused with the Blue Fairy thing - even with robots being reality in the story, and I felt a little sickly during the wish granted sequence. I will say it has got some alright performances, and an okay story I suppose, but it is the special effects that are the only good reason to see it. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Visual Effects and Best Music for John Williams, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Original Score. Worth watching, at least once!</fullReview>
