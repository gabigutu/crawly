		<shortDescription>Not nearly as good as the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Experiment is a 2010 American thriller film directed by Paul Scheuring and starring Adrien Brody, Forest Whitaker,Cam Gigandet and Maggie Grace.The film is also a remake of the 2001 German film Das Experiment, which was directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. The experiment begins when 26 men are chosen to participate in the roles of guards and prisoners in a psychological study that ultimately spirals out of control. $14,000 for two weeks, it is easy-earned money. The study examines aggressive behavior in an artificial prison setting. At first the tenants are divided randomly into prisoners and guards, but soon a spiral of violence begins. I had some hope for this film because I remember seeing the original Das Experiment more then a year ago and enjoying it. Although brutal the film was brilliant in the way it explored human nature, human instincts, and one's moral compass. It's actually quite surprising that it took such a long time (9 years) for Hollywood to assassinate, pardon me, remake this very interesting story which is actually based on the Stanford prison experiment that took place in 1971 and was highly criticized afterwords. The problem with this remake is that, as in most things Hollywood, it's all about big name actors and big fights and nice camera angles. What's most important, the characterization and the character development which are the things that make this story, were completely thrown aside. One of the consequences of doing so is that the film felt extremely rushed and therefor the payoff wasn't that great. I didn't think there was real tension, and the film lacked that gritty look of the original, instead it looks sharp and polished. Also, it's one thing to put your own spin into a story but this remake eliminated an entire dimension of the original film. I'm talking about the people behind the cameras, the scientists watching and conducting the experiment. They played a big part in the original and in this remake they are nowhere to be seen and it truly diminished the story. Regarding the acting, I thought Adrien Brody did a pretty good job and Cam Gigandet was delightfully nasty as he usually is. On the other hand, Forest Whitaker was absolutely awful. In almost every film that see him in, he acts like he has a speech impediment and to be honest, it adds nothing to his performance. Overall, The Experiment it's somewhat enjoyable but not nearly as good as the original. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another crappy USA remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's as if the title 'The Experiment' refers to Hollywood finally trying to create a remake that surpasses the original. It's a pale and poor remake of the brilliant German movie 'Das Experiment', which blew my mind first time I saw it. None of that with 'The Experiment'... Even the presence of two gifted actors (Brody and Withaker) cannot rescue the poor cinematography and awful diluted script. I couldn't even properly empathise with the main character played by Brody. His actions seemed ridiculous put against the prison-experiment backdrop, so terribly written so that there isn't any true logic to his rebellion. It's also very obvious he's not doing half the acting that Moritz Bleibtreu performed in the original. The casting was terrible, even before the experiment, I could immediately identify which characters were to become guards, and which ones prisoners. Mix this with the poor script-rewrite that put in unnecessary scenes and dialogues and that took out some of the most brilliant scenes in the original, and you get a straight-to-video production that will never be looked back on by movie fanatics anywhere, anytime.If you have bought, borrowed or downloaded this copy, please burn or delete it. You will be much better off getting Das Experiment instead.The Experiment has failed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to Destroy a German Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The German "Das Experiment" is one of the best and most powerful movies of the Twentieth-First Century. Tense, powerful, having a wonderful screenplay and outstanding direction and performances, it is another great example of how the absolute power corrupts. "Das Experiment" is a must-see movie, which will certainly provoke reactions on the viewer.Hollywood, as usual, made a remake showing how to destroy the German masterpiece. The decadent Forest Whitaker is awful, and he should have paid more attention in the acting of Justus Von Dohnanyi in the original film, as the sadistic Berus, instead of using grimaces. The writer and director Paul Scheuring is ridiculous, using sexual premises and sadistic situations freely. I feel sorry for the ridiculous reviews from viewers that have not seen "Das Experiment" and are happy watching this silly American crap. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): "Detenç?o" ("Detention")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterful American remake..NOT!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'This was a surprisingly intense film that I'm so glad I watched. The concept was great and this was even before I found out it was based on a true story.' Like the sound of the above? Well don't bother watching this awful American Remake , watch the original German award winning film 'DAS EXPERIMENT' which this snippet of a IDMB review was taken from. 'The Experiment' lacks the intensity of the original. I found myself caring very little about the characters. Don't be fooled by the employ of fantastic actors such as Forest Whitaker and Adrien Brody. There inclusion was a bit like employing Tiger Woods to play in the FIFA Football World Cup, sounds good on paper but awful to watch. The story has massive holes in the plot which remain unexplained and an ending that is about as satisfying as a chicken nugget. Overall the rewriting of such an intense drama and fantastic story has completely ruined it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely horrible. Watch Das Experiment instead. Please save yourself the trouble.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>it may not actually deserve a 1 rating, but i just finished watching the movie, so i still have a disgusting taste in my mouth, so to speak.so, the original, Das Experiment, was an amazing movie. it was completely believable, for one. i find one of the worst qualities of a bad movie is believability. i can get over bad acting, or any of the other cliché signs of a bad movie... but if i cant even believe that what is going on could possibly be going on, it can be HARD to watch.i can believe that scientists would hold an experiment of this kind... i can (reaching) believe that they would offer $1k per day to participants, considering the circumstances of the experiment. what i cannot believe... *if you don't know yet, they are not allowed to hurt anybody physically, or the experiment is immediately supposed to be ended* is that the guards would, without circumstances changing, in one scene, continue this 'humiliation without physical harm' by dunking the main character's head in water over and over... then turn around, and in the very next scene, beat the crap out of one of the guards who broke the rules.i cannot believe, that after all the 'prisoners' saw the guards beat the crap out of the other guard, that the prisoners would not do SOMETHING. they sat there... as they outnumbered the guards... and watched the lead guard KILL one of the prisoners. STILL NOTHING. completely unbelievable... at one point, one of the guards has decided that he has had enough, that the lead guard is crazy, and basically begins walking out. the lead guard stops him... by saying some more crazy stuff... if you were standing next to somebody, and they said they get off on humiliating and beating the crap out of somebody, and you said, "thats crazy! Im leaving. you are insane." and they came back with something just as crazy, you don't stay... you leave. he didn't even threaten him.the guard who wanted to rape that prisoner? completely unnecessary. actually, correction... they didn't weave it into the plot... at all. it felt like its own little gross side show.the ending... good god.i have to stop for a second on that one... its that horrible. i kept hanging on for the ending, because i wanted to know why they didn't end the experiment. i don't need to get into details, but suffice it to say, they all ended up riding a single bus home, the rapist, the raped, the killer, and although he wasn't shown, probably the killed. it wasn't some profound or poignant statement about humanity or something... it just seemed stupid, and again, not believable.at a couple points, they were trying to some sort of statement about humanity, social evolution... it was not effective whatsoever.IN SUMMARY! Not believable at all. you do feel a bit of that revenge satisfaction at the end, but it is minimal, to spite having waited for an hour plus. the acting was mediocre, to spite some big hitters being called in.If you like the premise... if you want to see it done right, believable, emotionally charged, and with an ending that will knock your socks off? watch Das Experiment.would somebody please.... stop Americans from remaking foreign films? just stop it :|</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Brody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tragedy of this film is really two-fold: First, if you are a fan of Adrien Brody or Forest Whitaker (and respect them as brilliant actors), you have to empathize with their probable shame of having participated in the film at all. As you watch 'The Experiment', it's not difficult to imagine the two actors sitting in some dimly lit bar each day after filming, drinking whiskey together in silence.Second, the script is poor. Or under-researched. Or over-researched. Maybe both. Maybe their were too many producers sticking their noses in. I don't know.Sigh.Imagine that you're a famous film producer and I'm pitching a movie idea to you...Ready? 'The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted by Philip Zimbardo in 1971. Students were selected and divided into 'prisoners' and 'guards'. The doctors stood back and watched the bedlam.'What do you think? Me personally, I want to make this into a film right now. What's more, I want Oscar winners Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker to act the hell out of it.I don't want to change the story. I don't want to take it into the 21st century. I don't want to ramp up the violence for effect. I don't want to make a big Hollywood production. I want to stick to the guts! Stick to what makes it interesting! Now imagine you are Adrien Brody. He hears the pitch. He's in! Probably takes a pay-cut just to be involved, the opportunity is so great to show off his talent. Same with Whitaker! Next thing you know the script is spiraling out of control! Someone wants more sex scenes! Someone wants more violence! Someone is looking at test data and decides there needs to be a rape scene! More brutal beatings! And Nazis! Let's get a Nazi! Never mind the implausibility or it all! But Brody's committed. He hangs in there and gives the best performance that he can. But it's lost.'The Experiment' is an example of Hollywood flying off the mark. It's a perfect opportunity gone wrong. It's badly edited and shouldn't have been released.Why then, you ask, the 3 out of 10 rating? Why not a 1? Near the end of the film, as the predictable climax approaches, Adrien Brody's acting saves the film. Somehow he has miraculously breathed enough life to his character that you suddenly feel connected. It comes out of nowhere.Brody rules.Forest Whitaker is also good in the film, but the lines he seems forced to read are so contrived that it's not worth commenting on here.I didn't hate it. But I felt bad for those involved.Maybe you should wait 'til you see it on TV some late night before you fall asleep. You can flick over to the Food Network or something during the boring parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Listen to the Idiots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, I'm a type of guy who doesn't like to get pretentious. Give me a black-and-white Dawn of the Dead and a color version of Dawn of the Dead, and I'll definitely pick the latter.The people complaining about the Hollywood remake in THIS movie, though, going on and on about the movie **dare I say it?** Das Experiment, are kinda like those guys who'd go for the black and white version of Dawn of the Dead.Don't get me wrong-- that's understandable. Some people like the plots and scripts in old versions. I can buy that.What I CAN'T buy, though, is giving this movie a 1 out of 10 because Das Experiment was better. I mean, dude, the acting was God-driven, and I have never been so angry at a character in my life. When I saw that crazy Whitaker get that hell-pounding from Adrien Brody at the end, I felt a burst of adrenaline pulsing straight through my brain and just jumping up and down. I have not experienced that kind of satisfaction in a long time.Look, the movie's great. Tension, check. Atmosphere, check. Acting, double check. The only things that bothered me were a couple of plot holes and the abrupt ending. I was kinda hoping they'd show more of what happened after. I get that the movie was based on the Stanford Experiment, but plenty of fact driven movies have blended creative elements in for entertainment.But dammit, the movie was great. You're missing out big time if you don't watch it. Yeah, I get it, you guys think the German Das Experiment film was the real thing. But remakes don't always have to be crap, and The Experiment was amazing on its own.Conclusion: think of all those 1 out of 10 rate reviews that mention Das Experiment as people who like the black and white version of Dawn of the Dead. They're just trying to sound smart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important Message, but a movie with flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off: I am German and i've seen the original Das Experiment many years ago. I wouldn't call all Americans dumb because they remake foreign movies. In fact this movie is better in some ways, like the acting of Forest Whitaker, which reminds me like a evolution from a stay-at-home-dude to his interpretation of Idi Amin.But the movies share a big problem. The original experiment was the Milgram Experiment, which was in the 60s if i recall correctly. The difference to the movie experiment is, that they originally used completely sane men. So that's why this study had such a big impact. They stopped the experiment at a earlier stage, but they were right at losing control. So in the movies there are psychopaths, Nazis, misfits and even an emo. I think that weakens the message of the movie. It should not be saying: Maniacs and psychopaths are capable of violence, oppression and humiliation. The message of the movies should be: Every man is capable of violence, oppression and humiliation. But it is possible to prevent such things if we ever arrive a level of empathy, philosophy and post-capitalism, then we could prove that humans are more than monkeys with funky weapons.So apart from the message the movie is OK. Don't expect an action flick, so everything's fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspension of disbelief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was well acted and could have been good. Well, it had Adrian Brody and Forrest Whitaker in it, and they are body wonderful actors. This review has several spoilers in it, so don't read further if you are thinking of seeing this one and want to be surprised.The main problem is that the film did not define the universe in which it operated. If they really needed me to suspend my disbelief THAT much, they needed to give me some guidelines, like a good science fiction would have done. The three major drawbacks in my ability to get sucked into this film's universe were:1) no lab personnel on the premises... NONE... AT ALL. They lost me right there. They were all in some isolated facility in the middle of a corn field with no supervising personnel, 2) we never even saw any lab personnel watching the cameras, commenting "no, don't stop it yet", and 3) even after the diabetic 051 got his skull cracked, they didn't flash the red light. After the guy was lying there twitching having had his skull cracked, and the red light didn't go off, I was done. I did finish watching the movie, but it really made me feel stupid for doing it.Adrian, Forest... do you need work THAT badly? Get a job at McDonald's... don't make any more garbage like this one, please. I want to be able to trust your name on a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Experiment. Definitely doesn't get the credit it deserves. While its extremely fast paced (even though some say its slow - which is not true), It has an interesting and intriguing storyline with great actors and some twists which, all in all, made me confused, excited, worried and even gave me an intense hatred for some of the characters. Whoever you are, I think you'll enjoy the film all in all. Try not to compare it to what most say it's a remake of - it's its own film and should be acclaimed for its self, without comparison to other versions. Fast paced and constant tension building throughout, which is just what I love in a movie. While it is not hugely thriller-like, or physiologically stimulating as may be expected, it is a great movie, especially for younger viewers (15+ as stated). Some explicit, adult natured themes should be expected, so kids should stay well away from this movie, however the worst stuff is fee and far between, so can be avoided - although you'll be missing some of the best parts of the movie.Don't listen to those who say its awful - it's a great film, and don't knock it because of others opinions. Make your own judgement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Experiment is flawed, or is it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a film. At first the development of the characters is well worded and driven, which leads seamlessly into a frenzy of moral adjustments later on in the film, when the plot has thickened so much so that the edge of the seat is perhaps the only place to be for the next hours viewing.This is very much an actor's film, gritty stuff that can only be carried by the brilliant acting that is in "The Experiment" both lead roles are almost Oscar worthy. The supporting cast manage to pull their weight too.The whole story and concept of this film is brilliant, very very dark, but very very brilliant. You are often kept guessing as to what happens next and it is very unpredictable, very hard to call how this film is going to pan out. Many times it's a thriller, with hardly any comedy, if any, but this film did not need comedy.The dark and derelict feeling this film gives you is riveting, and there is many a moral lesson to be learned here, the main character really does carry himself well through his trials and tribulations and you are often in awe in how well he handles the situations he finds himself in.This film will leave you better off after having watched it, sure it's uncompromising but you will be pondering the significance of it for many days after.The ending of this film, although probably the correct way to do it, still left a feeling that you had been short-changed somehow, the makers could perhaps have given you an extra 5 minutes viewing to wrap things up, but when all is said and done, "The Experiment" comes highly recommended.Out of 10 for the following facets: Acting: 9 Grittyness: 9 Charm of characters: 8 Moral reflections: 9 Overall: 8.5.

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't mind the bad review up there, whether you've seen or not the German original version, The Experiment still remains an excellent movie with two great actors (and a great plot): Forrest Whitaker and Adrien Brody. Interesting movie that shows that even if we all pretend to have some kind of moral, we all still remain animals that will bite to defend our pack. Sometimes you watch a 96mn movie and it feels like you were watching The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston (don't mean this is a bad film, it's just very long), but this one is the total opposite! you'll be annoyed when the credits will appear at the end. Also, if like me you're a bit sick and tired of the current Hollywood buzz which consists to make many spy movies with a huge budget, you will enjoy that film, because it's quite simple, only few rooms needed at location. So the question is: are you a prisoner?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you're looking for a story that shows the goodness of mankind, or a tale of subtle changes in personality, move on, cause this isn't that... the premise and result of this film are simple and two fold... if you like violence, it gives you all you can have, both psychological and physical. As I said, the premise and result are twofold: the first is that of showing all sorts of violence in as raw a manner as possible, without being vulgar. It does this most successfully. the second premise is showing one simple thing: we can and will all be broken under the right pressure. this is shown by the character played by Brody, not a violent bone in his body, yet before the end of the film, this all changes.... Overall it is a very impressive production, considering the basic concept of the story. The acting work is convincing, the set design eerie. And the photography superbly effective. In the end you may not feel sympathy for any specific character, though I certainly did, but if you don't come away knowing that we are all just animals, I would suggest that you take the advise Brody gives his main counterpart in the film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brody and Whitaker Rule!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film and director Paul Scheuring keeps a nice pace going throughout the movie. No surprise there. Scheuring should know a thing or two about prison plots. He was the man behind the Prison Break TV series that ran on Fox for 5 seasons. The Experiment also has a heavy prison storyline but with a unique twist that makes this movie stand out. You see, this is an "experiment", as the simple title let's on. 26 men are chosen to participate in a group study in a prison environment. Unlike Prison Break, these are not actual prison inmates. In fact, they are required by the experiment administrators to not have ever been incarcerated (though one participant somehow slips through). 5 of the men are chosen to be guards, while the rest are chosen to be prisoners. They are isolated and given a list of specific rules which are to be followed to a tee. If the men fail to follow the rules, they will not be paid their nice compensation of $14,000 each at the end of the experiment. They have two weeks to last, and so you can image how this will turn out. At first glance it seems the men are randomly chosen, but as the movie progresses, we see through their behavior and beliefs why they were chosen. The men were given specific questions during the interview process, and based on their responses, we began to see later on in the film how it all plays into the outcome of the experiment. It's a great element that gives the characters depth. But make no mistake about it, it's the power struggle that develops between Adrian Brody's character Travis, a prisoner, and Forest Whitaker's character Barris, a guard, that makes this movie great. Both are excellent actors that nail their parts. Whitaker in particular shines through as a momma's boy who's first taste at having authority takes him over the edge. Whitaker also has a way of making these intricate facial expressions that lends his character even more depth.Maggie Grace stars as Brody's love interest; a relationship that is mostly forgettable. Fisher Stevens has a short role as the slightly off-kilter doctor in charge of the experiment, and hip hop star David Banner even puts in a respectable performance as a guard with a heavy conscience. But mostly, it's all Brody and Whitaker in this film.The film offers some real insight into the human psyche and how our beliefs, values, and environment can shape it. In the movie, just when all hell starts to break loose, the men are brought back down to reality and realize the gravity of what the experiment has done to them. On the bus ride back home from the experiment site, Brody's character summed it up best when asked by another participant did he still think humans were higher in the evolution chain than monkeys. He takes a slight pause to reflect and responses, "Yes, because we can still do something about it." Great movies like this not only entertain us, but also give us something to take away from it. Watch the movie, it's great!</fullReview>

Interesting story, slowly built, tensed, well portrayed characters (not just the main two), excellent acting (Brody and Whitaker especially), but in the end unfortunately fails to materialize all that in to something more. Apart from the plain ending and unnecessary undeveloped female character, everything else was done right and it is a gripping thriller indeed.Probably the most important is that the movie succeeds in the main idea, catching the human nature and its transformation placed in certain conditions. As expected blinding of power and rebelling makes the violence slowly but surely spreads and the movie becomes more disturbing, answering my question why is it going straight to DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had been sat on our shelf gathering dust for a few weeks, I had picked it up for a whopping ?1.50 but we had not made the time to enjoy it. Time, at the moment, is a luxury we don't have so when we manage to clear our schedule and watch a movie, and it is a bad one, it feels like a waste of time? My time was not wasted.The Experiment is a remake of Das Experiment, which is based on a German book called Black Box which took inspiration from The Stanford Prison Experiment. Since watching the film I've read up on the Stanford Prison Experiment and ordered a copy of Das Experiment, that should hopefully highlight that I thoroughly enjoyed the remake. Unfortunately Black Box is not available translated into English so that'll stop me obsessing too much.Time to review the film? Loved it. It is slow paced (eventually picking up speed in the later scenes) but wonderfully so. I didn't feel bored and couldn't keep my eyes off of the screen even during the horrid bits. The cast are all very good, each adding their own element to the film but for me the best thing about it was the fact that I felt involved in the movie, physically uncomfortable watching some of the scenes, praying for them to end and yet at other times I was clenching my fists in excitement, lifting my legs up and holding my breath as I experienced the fight scenes.This movie is a treat and should be loved by more of you!

		<fullReview>Wow, I loved this movie so much. So you know the storyline. I was interested the whole time. Usually I get bored while watching movies and will play on my laptop or iphone during the movie, but this held my interest completely. Towards the end, I was actually feeling really pumped and was obviously rooting for the "prisoners".I can't believe all the negative reviews, clearly they have no idea what makes a good movie, because this movie is amazing. I was literally drawn into the emotions of all the key players in the movie. Yea sure, they didn't devolve deep into the characters pasts, but it the movie shows reactions of the now and those reactions and emotions are acted beautifully. I could feel the pain the characters were feeling, I could also see the craziness some of the characters were showing.The movie sends a clear message of, treat people like animals and they will act like animals.The acting in this movie is wow, amazing. The script is well written. The camera angles, the lighting everything was great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is not about Stanford Prison Experiment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, please let me suggest that this movie is not about Stanford Prison Experiment. It doesn't claim that it presents what happened in 1971 at Stanford' basement. The experiment in this movie was done somewhere else by someone else and it seemed illegal to me. That's the point. Please keep it in mind while watching.Moreover. Is The Experiment a remake of 2001 Das Experiment? I guess not. Two movies share the same plot (prison experiment) but each one has its own characters and story line. Good thing is you could watch both movies excitedly about what will happen next. Fahd(2001) is a reporter, Trevis(2010) is not. Stories are quite different as well. 2001 has at least 3 researchers working around, 2010 has none.I assumed what story writer want to tell us is the experiment in 2010 version is an illegal action. The researcher brought men to the location faraway from town, let them be, and didn't give a damn. All the researcher did was collecting information heartlessly, let guards played bad guys as they pleased. So it drove prisoners crazy.For me, this story makes sense more than 2001 which the experiment was employed in town with only 3 researchers who were unable to control the situation. And I kinda don't like the idea in 2001 movie which let outsiders get involved too much, I mean, Fahd' girlfriend and researchers, 2 women, on top of that. The experiment was supposed to be Male-Only experiment, was it not?I won't say that which version is better or more original-like for both of them are not completely original-like at all. I watched both, and both of them enjoyed me a lot. Horrifying and disgusting. That's enough for watching movies. If you want to know what happened in 1971 -real- Stanford Prison Experiment, don't waste your hours watching these movies, go watch the documentary named "Quiet Rage: The Stanford Prison Experiment" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mixed dram and traumatic behavioural experiment ,measuring the phscology of prisoners at the same time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a kind of action- drama, about the prison experiment . Being a daily topic increases the rate of watching, I think. With the purpose of an behavioural experiment , 26 people are brought to come together. This study is expected to continue for two weeks and in the end of the experiment , if they obey the rules they will take a mount of money. Using violent especially forbidden thing. Chosen people are taken to a remote place, they are divided into two group as an guard and prison. Actually everything goes on normal way as the scientists wanted but on the 6th day the events is getting more complex and experiment gets out of control because the guards feel and consider themselves superior to prisoners and begins use this badly . We can see the similar thing in our real lives ;when someone is given a high position ,they feel themselves more powerful as an status. It is related to our main personalities and If the conditions are changed so the behaviours of characters also show a change actually they have to do so because of physcological side. The main propose of this experiment to see how they behave while they are in restricted conditions , at the frame of rules. Also, how long they bear this hard situation is another thing wanted to display to us as an human being.The most important key point is psychology is hold up in this movie.For me it is good time while I watch ,and I understood one more time that the violent is not related to body , especially to be under pressure like phsycologic is an violent.</fullReview>

The Experiment is a brilliant film and it goes to all odds to preform what it aims for. It is violent, disturbing, dark, funny and sad. I'd call it a genre busting version of a film! The main theme of it is disturbing, it's intention is to disturb and I definitely think it should be an 18. It is very graphic, gruesome, disturbing and upsetting in places. Some parts are quite slapstick and comical; however most of it is rather disturbing. Watch with caution as it is very disturbing and may upset the light hearted.

		<fullReview>The human ego can be a dangerous thing.. I was intrigued by the idea of the film, and the greed that drives each of the characters. Adrien Brody did a fantastic job of portraying a man that is consumed by his desire to be reunited with his lover. As the story progresses, his conscience becomes entangled in the daily battles of completing the experiment, and simply trying to survive. Average men who have become guards lose touch with reality and become enthralled with their new-found power. As the lines of reality blur, the guards begin tormenting the prisoners. As the power struggle within the experiment seems to escalate, the line of humanity is crossed. Prisoners soon become the victims of unspeakable torment. The film begs the question, "when have you gone too far?" Each character in the film has their own fatal flaw, and ultimately those flaws will be their greatest enemy inside these prison walls. Ultimately, one must decide.. who lives and who dies in this ultimate test of humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Facile treatment of a complex subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an intense portrayal of the human instinct to dominate and control. The opening images of animals and insects in conflict (rams butting heads, a praying mantis consuming a fly, even microorganisms devouring each other) signal the thematic connection to the conflict that plays out in this film?research subjects randomly assigned to roles as prisoners and guards and left to their own devices. The guards are given only a set of five rules they are instructed to enforce, and they are foolishly advised to avoid the use of violence. The devolution of order into chaos is reminiscent of "The Lord of the Flies" (and there's even a character who resembles the pathetic Piggy?and shares his unfortunate fate). But the film itself is a bit too facile and loose?there's a good deal of action but little in the way of character development, and the ending arrives violently and abruptly. Even the presence of two Best Actor Oscar winners, Brody and Whitaker, cannot rescue this film from its mediocrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly dreadful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of the film seems tailor-made for drama: a number of men are placed in a prison-type situation as a psychology experiment. What great fodder for dramatic interaction! But then... Oy. Do they ever screw it up. The action (such as it is - and it ain't much) is predictable, the motivations for all are ridiculous and unbelievable, and the entire experiment happens far too quickly (yet the film drags so much) that it's impossible to buy into how the plot could have gone from Point A to Point Z without any points in between. If you watch it drunk or high maybe it would be funny, at least (or even just watchable) but viewed sober...it's just torture. Which may have been the intention of this experiment all along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good because of Brody and Whitaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll give it a seven. Brody and Whitaker are both good. The movie is somewhat low budget and the script isn't the best, but the themes and the character analysis is actually pretty good. I pondered the themes throughout multiple viewings. You can tell both actors put work into their roles and wanted it to be a success. I don't know why people are complaining, because compared to 90% of what else is on t.v. this is way better.As an aside, the progression of the protagonists can be seen as sort of a self character study for the viewer. You get to see what types of personalities are more power hungry and apt to infringe on other people's lives, what types of people stand up for goodness, and the others that fall in between. Brody's character is a peace activist and also an underachiever, perhaps the script writers wanted to show that these types of people are usually oppressed even though they feel the occasional desire to protest. Over the course of the film his character's psyche is peeled back like an onion to reveal his true underlying self; a fighter for good. Brody's character doesn't have it in him to oppress, and it takes being put into an ultimate situation like this, where his sense of safe civilly adhering human is completely stripped away. He has nothing left to do but fully be the 'savior' type that his personality type is at its core. This may sound stupid, but I sense a unicorn-ness about Brody's character. The ultimate good versus evil. Which can be read between the lines of this movie.Whitaker's persona is the opposite of light and good, it is dark and oppressed and thus seeks to oppress. He has become what he was raised from. Backstory vignettes show how his mother was domineering and he still lives with her at age 41. He begins the story as meek and polite and god fearing, but further into the story you see that those were just covers for his true quiet desperation. And once he is placed in a position of power he gets to embody all of that pain that made him feel powerless throughout his life. Like a tortured animal that wants to see his trauma wrought upon another, in a very sociopathic way, his character can't live without experiencing that. It is unfortunate, but as is seen in this movie, that is why there are roles in society for people brought up like this; prison guard. By the end of the movie, and after empathizing with the characters, you see that humans are just the products of their environments. I would say it is good versus evil, but Whitaker's character is too complex to fully write off as true evil, he is a naive human grown in an unideal home, and I feel bad for him. Brody's character, though more enjoyable to watch and the 'hero' of the story, is somewhat less fulfilling, because he has obviously been raised into a life that has given him freedom and light, he is sort of the fool, as he is in most of his films, and so in a broader sense is regarded with less depth. But as is seen in the last bus scene, it's all about choice, and in the end everybody has one. And Whitaker's character chooses to be dark and Brody's to be light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite an interesting twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading through the reviews, I was taken back to when I watched it.For my educational course, watching and reviewing the behaviour of characters in this film is a necessity.Having not watched the original, I am basing my experience purely by the Stanford university prison experiment.The link between Travis (Brody) and Barris (Whitaker) struck me as significant, before the experiment had even begun. It was inevitable that they would be pinned against each other, however I had no idea it would elevate to the extent it did.As mentioned in a previous review by somebody, there were 5 rules to be followed by the prisoners. If these are broken, then the guards must react accordingly within 30 minutes of the incident, or a red light will go off, signalling the end of the experiment. This red light quickly becomes the obsession of Barris, who relies upon this and seems to worship it (A godly reference). Barris plays this role EXTREMELY well in my opinion, pouncing on every occasion there is to uphold these rules that the guards have been given.The guards are not to use violence, if they do, the experiment will end. As stated once again in the same previous review, the experiment doesn't end when Benjy (Cohn) is killed by a blow to the head. However I thought this reflected very well upon the nature of the Stanford University Prison Experiment, where Zimbardo quickly adapted to the role of a prison warden, overlooking any of the guards gross misconduct. This act was very well done, with very little interference by the leaders of the experiment.The ending was quite strange and not what I expected at all. I had expected some chaos to be imminent at times, however not on the scale that closed the film. The slow motion during the riots adds to the effect of the defeat of the guards by allowing you to capture their reactions in every frame; fear, anxiety, horror.Overall I enjoyed this film, partly because of the alienation that the guards felt towards the prisoners after the experiment had been ceased. This film, I felt, reflected exceptionally well on the reality of the experiment, where events got out of hand very quickly - With the people taking on the role of a prisoner or a guard, having their behaviour and thinking shifted perpetually by the perception of their character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Experiment is based on that very well known experiment that took place in Stanford University's basement where a mock prison was constructed and twenty-four applicants were divided up and given the vague roles of either a "guard" or a "prisoner." The motivation? A decent pay cut, around $15 a day (the film counterpart ups the pay to $1,000 a day). Guards were armed with intimidating, militaristic outfits, while the prisoners were ill-equipped with a smock and no underwear. Originally set to be a fourteen day test, the experiment ended after day six due to drastic measures taken by the inmates and guards that could've been fatal. Abuse was common, the issue of inferiority plagued the prisoners until they tried to force a rebellion, and borderline torturous acts were committed by the guards.The film is the American remake of the German picture Das Experiment, as of now, unseen by me, but not totally written off. I'm not entirely sure if a film based on the prison experiment could effectively be made. This is one of those cases where history and facts overshadow fictionalization and dramatization. I believe a documentary would've been far more suited for this subject.We are met with Adrien Brody, playing Travis, an Atheist softie who agrees to partake in a psychological experiment held by a local organization along with twenty-three other people. Early on, he meets Michael Barris (Whitaker) who seems to be a content and well-managed individual, but when he is given the title of a "guard" and Travis the title of a "prisoner," their true sides come out, and abandonment is quickly brought forth.Much of what I explained above occurs in the film, but in a seemingly muted form. Nothing is ever very explicit or, for that matter, truly interesting. The cinematography is some to commend, perfectly personifying the prison as the one instigating the violence. The atmosphere is so gritty and real that we can see it takes a drastic effect on the people.The whole event feels like Lord of the Flies come to life. Both Golding's timeless novel and Philip Zimbardo's 1971 experiment prove that when stripped of all things just and civil, humans will scram for security and the gray idea of "what is right?" before completely forgoing all the former rules, recognizing this is a new place, and furthermore, begin to act on their id, their desire to feed their consuming savagery. This is definitely taken into consideration in the film, and is the highest point this picture has to offer.But as far as a worthy retelling of the events, it's pretty thin and underwhelming. The film was directed by Paul Scheuring, who directed some episodes of the FOX crime drama Prison Break, and that is exactly how it plays; like a Television crime drama. The performances, mainly by Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker, and the exceptional cinematography elevate the film to a passable status, but The Experiment lacks essential character development essential to furthering ones feelings towards its prisoners, and, instead of playing like an superbly intense film, it plays like what it is; an American remake.Starring: Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker. Directed by: Paul Scheuring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never has a film disappointed me as much as this. As a psychology student I was really looking forward to watching it as it is based on the Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE). In both the film and the SPE a group of individuals have agreed to take part in a psychology experiment where they are placed in a 'mock' prison. They are assigned to the role of either prisoner or guard. The experiment quickly spirals out of control as the participants adopt the stereotypical characteristics of the role they have adopted. Unfortunately, it is at this point that the film crashes and burns. It degenerates into a film that insults our intelligence.**Spoilers below** After the experiment begins we do not see the experimenters behind the cameras. We know they are watching because we see the lens on the camera changing focus and watching. When one of the prisoners is killed, why do they not stop the experiment immediately? This is one of the big flaws in the film. I know with films we are meant to suspend belief, but come on... and when the doors are opened and they all walk out and are allowed to walk away as if nothing happened? Two people were dead... that is not nothing. What really annoyed me the most though, is that what really happened during the SPE was interesting enough to have made a good movie which challenges our beliefs about how we would behave in the same situation. It didn't need to be ruined by giving it the Hollywood touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was recommended to me as being 'a very good movie', and maybe only this created a bit the disappointment. Like with a lot of this kind of action movies, there is nothing more than raw violence that hits the lens. There are some attempts to bring up a bit more of the psychological background, but as to be expected this all remains so superficial that it almost disturbs the storyline. Of course there is a lot more potential in the idea of the movie. A lot more that could even have made this a much stronger movie. A tad more social and relational context. But at the end of the movie it feels as you just wasted 1.5 hour time expecting something that wasn't even there: a proper clarification why this experiment was necessary. Such a poor ending was something I didn't see for a while.</fullReview>

Pay $280,000 to prove psych profiling is accurate? Why did Brody's character not do anything sooner? Didn't make any sense. Poorly written and just no reason for it. Milgram experiment wasn't about the money it was to show what happens when you blindly follow instruction. This film introduced psych profiling at the start to render the rest of the film entirely pointless. 0% science. 0% useful. This film gets 0%. I kept expecting it to be satirical like something from Swift. No. Just terrible. Did the writer even read the original studies? I couldn't watch the whole film, just fast forwarded to the end. Wow. It goes public as well. Very believable. Just remembering it now makes my blood boil. If you like shouting at ridiculous characters then give this film a go. But if you have any power tools handy then lock them away or you may just drill out your kneecaps with confused angry boredom. I'm off to see my therapist again. Peace.</fullReview>

The real experiment took place in the basement of a building, not an entire building. Nobody in the experiment died, there wasn't any violence that took place in the real experiment. It was ended WELL before anything that happened in the movie took place in real life. Forest Whitaker's character never existed in real life. Only a few of the guards developed sadistic tendencies.There was a "riot" that took place in the original experiment, but that only occurred in one cell and never got violent. Paul Scheuring did no actual research regarding the experiment besides watching horror movies. Next time he decides to try and make a film based off of a real event, he should try to learn about the event before shooting a movie as bad as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Mankind On A Higher Evolutionary Scale Than Animals???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This lackluster sociological study gone wrong poses the perennial question: is mankind higher than animals on the evolutionary scale? "Prison Break" writer &amp; director Paul Scheuring argues that mankind is higher on the evolutionary scale because we can correct our problems. Unfortunately, "The Experiment" doesn't share so much as a glimmer of "Prison Break's" brilliance. Moreover, Scheuring's film constitutes a remake of Oliver Hirschbiegel's Teutonic film "Das Experiment" (2001) derived from Mario Giordano's book which was inspired by the notorious real-life Stanford prison experiment. Originally, college students participated in the real Stanford experiment that took place in 1971 and sought to document what would happen if morally conscious people were in a morally ambiguous situation. This claustrophobic yarn is presented in a straightforward fashion, meaning that humor is conspicuously absent from the action, but the gravity of the situation yields few rewards. You'd think with his background in the "Prison Break" series that Scheuring should have been more adept with his adaptation, but "The Experiment" degenerates rather quickly into a standard issue jailhouse drama that neither leaves you with a good taste in your mouth or a sense of catharsis about its dramatic upheavals. It is clear in retrospect why Elijah Wood withdrew from this debacle after several days of shooting.A government think-tank hires 26 individuals and offers them $14,000 for two weeks and then divides them into guards and inmates in a facility out in the middle of nowhere and then watches what happens for two weeks. Of course, the guards usurp their authority and take advantage of the prisoners who outnumber them and eventually turn on them and overpower them. The surprises are few and far between in this one-dimensional sociological film. Travis (Adrien Brody of "Predators") answers a want-ad in the newspaper to participate in the study after he is laid off from his job at a nursing home. As you can imagine, Travis qualifies as the most sympathetic character. The cast fares better than the threadbare, woebegone material. The bespectacled behavioral scientist (Fisher Stevens) who coordinates the study tells guards and inmates alike that they must not strike each other and warn them that the study will be suspended if violence erupts. Furthermore, they point out that a red light will come on and they study terminate without them getting their paycheck. The scientists don't do a good job on the background check of one inmates, Nix (Clifton Collins, Jr. of "Brothers") because he has served time and is an Aryan nations guy. Forest Whitaker is well cast as a guard named Barris who lives with his mother and needs the dough to pay the rent. No sooner does the meek Barris don his guard's uniform than he goes off on a power trip. Scheuring shows Barris getting a hard-on after he bosses around another person. Later, Barris decides the best way to punish Travis is to urinate on him as well as shave his head. Aside from the opening and closing moments, "The Experiment" boasts an all-male cast. Before he joins the experimental study, Travis meets pretty blond girl Maggie Grace during a peace rally and they decide to visit India. At fade-out, Brody makes it to India and Grace kisses his scarred knuckles. Poorly done from start to finish with a plot that is predictable as a boulder tumbling down a mountain side. Some of Brody's scenes in a pipe-like enclosure bring back memories of "The Jacket."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Takes Too Many Liberties In Portraying The Stanford Prison Experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted in 1971 by psychologist Philip Zimbardo. It selected a random group of people and divided them into prison guards and prison inmates and then placed them into a recreated prison on the grounds of Stanford University for two weeks basically to see how they would adjust to their new roles. The experiment was controversial and was aborted after only 6 days and its results and methodology are still considered questionable. "The Experiment" is a sort-of recreation of that experiment, starring Forest Whittaker as one of the pretend guards and Adrien Brody as one of the pretend prisoners.The movie is extreme in its portrayal of what actually happened. Conditions in the actual experiment were apparently pretty bad (which is why the experiment was aborted early) but this movie exaggerates conditions. I can understand dramatic licence, but if one really wants to learn about the details of the Stanford Prison Experiment, there's a lot of material available, and the movie shouldn't be taken as an accurate depiction.Having said that, the movie does make a psychological point, I suppose. Whitaker's Barris and Brody's Travis are basically pretty normal seeming guys who get put into situations in which their basic personalities and life experiences are put to the test. Barris is 42 and lives with his mother - a kind of powerless guy who suddenly finds himself leading the "prison guards," while Travis is a "peace-nik" who engages in anti-war rallies and doesn't believe in violence, who ends up as the leader of the inmates responding to the abuse they suffer from the guards. I suppose the point is that our basic personalities and how we react to circumstances are directly dependent on our circumstances. That point was made, but on the whole the movie took too many liberties with the actual experiment and as a result came across as little more than a fake prison movie, rather than as an account of the experiment.

		<fullReview>Sadly, you cant vote 0/10 but signed up just to warn others if you have not already witnessed how bad this film really is! Das Experiment i have not seen yet however sounds much better than this. The problem for me in this film was not the acting, the acting was great to be honest.26 men get sent to do a prison experiment over 14 days. Some are set to be guards and some set to be prisoners, and there is 14,000USD each at the end of the experiment. There are 5 Rules.The Main Rule: No Violence or the red light goes on and its off &amp; no-one gets paid.There are cameras in all rooms bar one in this film. So why when a man died through lack of insulin for his diabetes and a series of beatings did the experiment not get called off. Why when a man got tied up, raped and another man urinated on &amp; beaten. What an absolute pile of rubbish* this film really was. this happens about 25 minutes into the film so why watch the rest of it. Finally when the prisoners get sick of the bullying and mistreating, they fight back and beat the guards then all of a sudden, the lights go on and its game over. Strange that! And then for some reason, it shows only 1 man (forest Whitaker who plays the main guard), gets paid for it. Did the others get paid? How did they all get on after? Why were they all fine as soon as the doors opened with each other despite one person dying and everyone taking A beating.This film is quite possibly the worse film ever made, storyline makes no sense and its idiotically played out. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This is why films like this go straight to DVD and don't get released into the cinemas. Its because Hollywood would go BUST! Biggest Waste of 92 minutes of my life. 8 Rubbish was an understatement as you cannot swear on the reviews!</fullReview>

There are strict rules to follow, and things quickly start to escalate out of control.One of the best parts of "The Experiment" was the great cast. There was a lot of good talents on the cast list, and people were doing good jobs with their given roles. Especially Adrien Brody performed memorably."The Experiment" is, however, the type of movie that you will watch once, and most likely never again, because it just doesn't have enough contents to sustain multiple viewings.A mediocre movie that could ultimately have been more interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a difficult film for me to review. I've never seen the original film that this is based on, so I can't comment on that. However, I have studied Reicher and Haslam's prison experiment in depth and know quite a lot about Zimbardo's study.Without any prior knowledge about any of the above. 'd rate it average. You don't particularly gain anything from watching this film. You just learn that everyone is capable of pretty much anything given the circumstances.This film is different to other films... It's interesting how money motivates them. All of them are free to leave at any point so that is never the issue unlike other films. But all of them need to stay because they all need the money.In terms of Reicher and Haslam and Zimbardo... It's interesting to see how the film makers have put the film together.

		<fullReview>I thought this was a alright movie actually. I have just watched it again in fact. you have 2 main actors Adrian which is a prisoner and Forest which is a guard. they started out as friends in the beginning but turned enemies cause one got put on the guard side and the other a prisoner. Forest turned into the leader of the guards and Adrian the leader of the prisoners. I would have to say there was a couple weird spots where Forest pee's on Adrian and stuffs his head in the toilet but other then that the acting was great and I would have to say it was way better then the original. Thanks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is based loosely on (a) US sponsored psychological experiment in which a prominent psychiatrist ran amok creating a prison in the basement of a noted liberal University. It follows in the steps of a German film Das Experiment (2001), highlighting lack of originality in the US theatre.Very different from from the real life experiment in which the participants, recruited from students between semesters received rather chincy emoluments, the movie version claims that the test subjects, were offered stupendous incentives for their collaboration.The film correctly states that volunteers were assigned roles and that as the experiment went on the participants fell into the roles that were given them. Like the German film, the experiment devolves into ever increasing dosages of violence.In the US version, the feel good ending is even better than the German version. Travis (Adrien Brody) one of the prisoners has such a will to resist the torture and degradation that he busts out. Everyone follows him and they all receive their handsome checks.In real life, there was no busting out but there was some busting back in. Some who had under intimidation quit the experiment returned and applied to be re-instated. They had formed a camaraderie with the others in the project and wanted to see it through.In the film version the consequences for the authors of this fiendish experiment was severe. In an investigation that follows, the mad scientist, a rather small and squat gnomish sort behind the experiment, is indicted.In real life nothing of the kind occurred. Jocularly speaking of the escapade a quarter century later, the real life psychiatrist hosted a US sponsored college course on psychology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch a lot of movies and this is my first review. I have not seen the original movie but with Adrian Brody, and Forest Whitaker I figured this remake would at least be decent.The acting was OK, the idea behind this movie had so much potential. In my opinion instead of doing a crappy remake they should have taken the idea and twisted it or made it into an entirely different movie. Spoiler alertThis movie could have re-deemed itself at the end. By the time the ending comes your waiting for the big climax, the guards to get what they have coming to them, but it ends up being a 5 minute fight. Then to top it off they all ride the same bus back!? Really??? I understand when the door opens they all go outside as if nothing happens almost in a shock like state, but on the bus you see the characters come back to reality.In the end I was just expecting so much more, especially with Adrian Brody being one of the leads. If your bored and need an hour and a half to waste and want to watch an interesting movie then this will do, otherwise don't even waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe not as good as ''Das Experiment'' but I think it's still good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original ''Das Experiment'' is a great film, but this isn't bad either. Personally, I enjoyed this movie a lot and think for an American remake it is quite good. And to be honest it actually improves some things as well. One of the things I liked in particular was the atmosphere and in my opinion, the cast was great. Great performance from Adrian and Forest. Not to mention, the awesome scene with the guards attacking the inmates in slow motion while Fluke YKK plays in the background. And also, the scene when the prisoners break free is very entertaining and much more thrilling than in "Das experiment'' not to mention it also improved these following things I didn't like in the original film: the prisoner uniform and nude sex scene's and flashbacks of 77 and with the woman he loves.Now there are some negative things about the movie which would of been improved if it borrowed from the original a bit. The first thing is that the events unfold way too quickly and also, there are a lot of prisoners that we are hardly introduced to which means that it would have been much better if the movie was a little bit longer. Also, this movie doesn't show was what is happening on the other side while the experiment is on. Now I think it makes it more interesting, because of the fact that we don't see scientists and other people who are in charge of the experiment watch it leaves the feeling that the characters are much more isolated than they should be, which is a good touch I'll admit. This movie lacked some character development and was a little bit shorter. I think the remake is good in it's own way and shouldn't be called awful or shouldn't be a victim to an angry soccer mom who watched the original film and started raging and trashing this film senselessly, because it was little bit different or either not as good.In conclusion, I believe that this movie could of been much better if it was longer and had more character development along with more Guard Vs Inmate face offs like in the original (the original slightly more scenes with guards insulting the inmates and would of been great if Brody's character had camera-installed glasses at least for a short time) I'm still going to give it a 7 out of 10 since the movie did satisfy my demands and turned out quite entertaining in it's own way. In my opinion, it deserves 6.7 at least instead of 6.3 but I believe the amount of haters and fans is fair. The movie is good for a watch or two for sure.Like I said, in the original we could see the reactions of doctors and how they were talking to the guards outside, but in this movie we couldn't which did give it a good sense of isolation if only it had more development and some other things that the original had it would of been even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watch this if...you enjoy psychological thrillers, but don't expect this to blow you away. It is very run of the mill for this genre.Acting/Casting: 6.5* - Brody and Whitaker don't disappoint in the lead protagonist and antagonist roles. The supporting cast also gives a pretty solid performance and this is the strongest area of the film.Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 5.5* - This is a well put together film, but does seem to have some spots that are a little slow. I also felt the ending was a bit abrupt, which took away from the movie overall.Plot/Characters: 5* - A group of research participants are put in a prison and split into groups of guards and prisoners. They are told to obey certain rules or no one will be paid. However, the envelope is pushed leading to extreme circumstances and the situation eventually comes to a head. The premise is intriguing, but I was hoping for more after watching it.Entertainment Value: 6* - I enjoyed the movie, but I guess I went into it with some high expectations. It isn't a must-see movie, but might be worth checking out if you see it while flipping through the channels on TV.My Score: 6.5+5.5+5+6 = 23/4 = 5.75Email your thoughts to filmwatchinfool@gmail.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This would have been wonderful. Lots of very talented people and a very interesting script. However... The love story here is the most unnecessary thing every! Why on earth would we care that the lead character gets to India for a girl that he has known for 6 days? Pointless. I would have had a much easier time with everything that happened if the time-line of the film had been more like 6 months instead of six days. It seems lazy of the filmmakers to expect us to imagine that a couple of days of in-your-face exploits would drive a group of basically non-descriptive people to riot in an experiment that they stand to loose a lot of money in. The premise goes to hell, in my mind, if you ask me to believe that regular people would choose to revolt rather than get a paycheck. After all, they answered an ad that promised 14000$ for 14 days of work. These are not the type of people who have real hefty expectations of their work environment. Overall, I think the thing that saddened me the most about this film is the contrast between Brody and Whittaker. They are both actors who I respect immensely and its unfortunate to see them played against each other in this way. The movie would have been fine with the difficult of normal people thrust into different roles w/o the race card being played. Maybe that was not the intent of the writer/director but in my mind it was an obvious connection that didn't need to be made. Black guy gets megalomaniac and white guy gets vicious. Thanks for the cookie cutter racial rant. Also, the guard w/the eyeliner was a wonderful addition (if only there were a sarcasm font!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good remake held together by some fantastic performances. It changes enough, but still feels familiar. Brody is a pacifist here, not a reporter, and he's just looking for some money. Actually, money is the main drive behind the actions of the characters, which removes some of the beastly nature. Here the guards feel forced to act so as not to lose their money. Same goes for the prisoners. We are also told at the beginning that violence will not be tolerated, making it a bit stupid that when violence does arrive nothing is done. This could have been justified by showing some cutaways of those conducting the experiment. Most of the flaws</fullReview>

If you are dumb enough to be surprised obvious movies, read no further.I saw this movie. I never saw the German one. I didn't know about the Stanford Prison Experiment. I have to ask, what did you think was going to happen? Brody better then average, as he probably should be. You can't have a face like that (he is slightly better than ugly) and not be a good actor. He made Predators a decent flick (and it shouldn't have been). By that same premise, Whittaker should be a far better actor, and he is not. One more thing on Whittaker, what a disappointment. With creepy looks like that he should be able to do some great parts.This movie is completely predictable and somewhat painful to watch. The beginning sets up OK and got me interested but...I can't imagine anyone would have put up with that starting on day two. I would have thrown a punch and canned the project.Probably worth a dollar IF (note that is a big if)there is nothing else you want to watch. This is purely a "I'm bored" movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the worse problem of the movie was the script. It didn't really make too much sense even though, the difference to the original was more to: peace maker with high values realizes he can do anything to stay alive/make it even with abusers(experiment stops- as if the idea of the experiment was how long it would take to turn a peaceful guy into a fighter), rather than the first film: journalist instigates in order to have a story.Even so, with all the effort, the story is too thin. In my opinion, the remake should have been like this: Das Experiment based on a book, the book based on a real experiment.The remake should have avoided at all costs Das Experiment(and the book) and make a new script based on the real experiment(very horrific in itself)- plenty of material to work with just by reading what actually happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this movie as an actual Prison Officer myself I have heard a lot about this experiment from other officers and colleagues. So I was looking forward to seeing what it was really all about.So the movie is a little slow at the beginning and just feels like its just goes through the very predictable motions to the end without too many surprises or explaining properly why each of characters behaved the way they did especially would of liked more back round info on Whitakers character we get some but not nearly enough that's if we are to believe he evolved as quick as he did or to the degree he did After all this movie is supposed to be about a study on human behavior and I think we as an audience deserved a little insight to why each person became the character they transformed into, Without this its just another prison movie one we have seen time and time again, so I was really hoping to see a fresh look on this EXPERIMENT with a insight into my world and what I have to deal with each day. Sadly they only thing we see give man a little power and he thinks he is a king, give him a lot and he thinks he is a God. But that's true in all walks of life and careers not just the prison system.To sum up the acting is fine Whitaker and Brody both give fine performances even though Whitaker's character is over the top just wished it was a film about the human psyche and not another prison flick with a very predictable twists and turns</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't agree with those who say this film is boring. I found it to be very entertaining with a good development, not too fast neither too slow."The Experiment" has an interesting premise about people being arrested and filmed. However, this premise has been used in several past films, showing that it's no innovation at all. "House Of 9", "Cube", "Cube Zero", "Saw II" and some others have the same issue, but with better mystery and a supernatural atmosphere. This one just shows what we're all aware of: power changes man's head. And if the person has a tendency to be authoritarian, like Whitaker's character, it gets even worse. I found some scenes very disturbing and difficult to see, I don't like seeing people being humiliated and tortured, whether they deserve it or not.The good thing about this is the ending. I thought the writers were about do deliver a frustrating ending like the ones I mentioned, but fortunately here we have a way out of the house (unlike "Cube" mainly) and it's not that depressing. Watch this movie as an uncompromising entertainment and you'll be satisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have ever taken part in a game called the Prisoner's Dilemma you'll get the starting point for The Experiment. A group of people respond to an advert in a newspaper for well paid volunteers for two weeks work. A mildly irrelevant back story explains how Adrien Brody gets to volunteer, and interview recordings explain the back stories of important others.At first the film sticks to a plausible plot but then things go awry and the storyline simply nosedives into the badly, badly flawed final fifteen minutes or so. But it is not just the plot line that is poor. The script lacks courage. The acting is pretty average and spoilt by silly background music for what is supposed to be a tense, psychological thriller. The ending is pathetic, truly pathetic.Perhaps you get the message I didn't enjoy this much but if truth be known I was deeply disappointed in this film. The subject matter is exceedingly rich in promise and this film just blows it all away for cheap, poorly done "shocks". Three out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power hungry, the pacifist and the conformers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film with a message about losing sight of what it means to be a civilized human being in modern times and if violence should equate into our decisions and motivations when interacting with each other. It goes beyond the usual white lab coat behavioral experiment when an elaborate scenario is created that takes a group of participants, who want to make a chunk of change, by simulating the conditions in a state penitentiary for those who've never been in to demonstrate if power would be abused.After Travis (Adrien Brody) gets laid off from a nursing home, he protests a war and finds love. She wants to go to India, he doesn't have cash, so he spots an ad in the paper offering $1000 a day for an experiment. How hard could it be? Soon enough the participants fill out paperwork (easy), get individually interviewed (sounds fun), put through visual tests (not so great) and then sit through an orientation with a speedy talker (show me the money!). He makes it all sound so "safe" and "secure," expect a clue comes when he slips in that some subjects will be deprived of their civil rights. Get 'em to say yes a bunch of times and anybody making a pitch won't have any trouble dodging that no. Off they go.They're brought to an isolated location and are to be locked in for two weeks by themselves with only cameras to watch. The test subjects are divided into two groups of guards and prisoners and given specific rules that they must follow or else nonviolent disciplinary action is to be given from the guards. If the guards don't follow accordingly a red light will be turned on in 30 minutes and the experiment will be terminated resulting in no one getting paid. Some focus on the money and block it out. Others can't handle the stress of dropping what pride, beliefs and creature comforts they had beforehand. And then there are those that take it a little too seriously either because this is their chance in life to be taken so or they actually enjoy taking advantage of others when granted the go-ahead from a higher authority. Soon enough the weaker start to fall in line and the stronger step out in an attempt to stand by their points. Two personalities collide on opposite sides with Travis (Adrien Brody) representing the prisoner's rights and Michael (Forest Whitaker) helming the guards with no-nonsense, totalitarian order.Part of this was based on the real life Stanford Prison Experiment conducted in 1971. However, there are some differences, as this attempts to show how it would have ended up if the head scientist wasn't directly involved in the decision making processes during the experiment, as well as it doesn't have him set a tone to guide a certain way. Results also happen within only a few days out from the start with here poor impulse control such as alcohol abuse, as well as gross humiliations, torture, attempted rape and a few of the guys might have been dictators in a past life with their penchant for well timed out speeches. Yeah, it's all going to seem exaggerated, not necessarily for what could be done, but how the specific scenes were set up as it didn't completely put the audience in their shoes and its believability starts to dwindle after more and more scenarios are stacked on.It's strange to set this in modern times, as there are stricter ethical guidelines and background checks that would test for mental instability and diseases due to the original experiment. It made it seem like these trained professionals went out of their way to deceive and purposely show inaction to see results without actually explaining or showing why--by being kept completely in the dark, it almost makes them diabolical. Not to mention if there weren't several dominating personalities in guard positions (which seemed to be purposely put there)--or even prisoners who took it seriously at first, however you look at it--it's questionable whether this would have gone the same.They didn't try and make this an exceptional case out of a bunch, but the only one tested apparently, which isn't enough to see if it was just a fluke. It seems over-elaborate to jeopardize their professional careers as there are now established rules in place; as well as for the sum of money they were giving out and the design of the facility to put all their eggs in one basket. It also only shows how a set of people temporarily put in authority positions will react in the heat of the moment resulting in their perspective being off to find a reasonable middle ground--rather than in a real and established prison system that would have a guideline in place from an extended period of trial and error.The ending winded down a little too easily as they were well behaved going in, animalistic inside, then instantaneously regretful, so the filmmakers could quickly put the blame elsewhere for what the participants did. As a cinematic experience that goes for entertainment value alone, "The Experiment" has some particular areas where the actors shine, has a steady pacing that wasn't in one area for too long, and it still left room to think about some "what if?" questions even if it seemed to have somewhat of an agenda that leans towards a certain side at points. Though it's a movie where more of it seems fine at first as everything is happening so fast, but when the brain settles down afterwards too many questionable things occurred and it might make one's head spin more than inspire productive debate.

		<shortDescription>Good... but not great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an American remake of the 2001 German film, Das Experiment. I should say, for the record, that I haven't seen the original and so I can only judge this one on its own merits. Rest assured that the original is firmly on 'The List' for future a viewing (and reviewing). The story is based on the infamous "Stanford Prison Experiment" conducted in 1971. A group of individuals were taken to a makeshift prison where they were split into two groups, the guards and the prisoners. It sounds like it might be an interesting concept and to some extent it is? I'll tell you more of my thoughts after this brief summary.I should first say that for taking part in the experiment all participants were to be very well paid. This meant that all kinds of people were attracted to sign up. There's Travis, the peace loving guy who wants money to follow a girl to India, there's Barris, the repressed guy who has to stay at home and look after his mother, and many others. The one thing they all have in common though is that they need the money. Having been split into their respective roles things start off quite jovial enough. However, the guards are warned that they cannot use violence, but must maintain discipline. Also, the rules must be strictly adhered to and failure to comply will end the experiment and nobody gets paid. This causes tension amongst the guards as the prisoners begin to rebel against the rules. One guard, Barris appoints himself the leader and singles out Travis as the chief troublemaker. As the level of the guards' retribution escalates, it's clear that something is going to give, and when it does it's going to be bad.A decent cast, including Adrien Brody as Travis and Forest Whitaker as Barris did a decent job of what I found, at times, a rather uneven script. Also worthy of a mention were; Cam Gigandet as Chase, Clifton Collins Jr. as Nix and Ethan Cohn as Benjy.There is much you have to take at face value and that doesn't really help the narrative all that much. I did actually find it quite engrossing for the first two thirds, but it did get a little predictable towards the end. The ending, when it finally came, was a bit of a disappointment I'm afraid. Over all, it's quite watchable for the first two thirds, but not something I'd give a second viewing to.My Score: 6.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would say this film is good, although after reading the reviews i will definitely be watching the German original, i only watched this one because i didn't have knowledge that it was in fact a remake. What attracted me to this film is because i did a degree in sociology and psychology so therefore, i have studied the zimbardo stanford prison experiment which is what the film is based on. I wanted to see how this panned out. I have done much research into this experiment, the finding, and on some of the reviews it says it's not believable, but a lot of things in the film where actually what happened in the original study, therefore they may seem like something like that wouldn't happen but it actually did. There are parts of the film that didn't follow the experiment which made me mad, they got paid much more than in the original therefore more reason not to stop the experiment. Also if i remember rightly in the real experiment, each participant got paid whether they lasted the entire time or not. The storyline about the diabetic, well that didn't exist and although people were severely distressed no one died, which is not a good element of the film. I saw another review about they wereleft in the middle of nowhere which also i didn't find very good part of a film because the experiment seemed to not be an experiment they just seemed to have been left on their own and to their own devices. Prison guard, in the study was zimbardo himself and i would have liked to have seen that part of an element to see how it panned out. The one thing i did like, is not right at the end but what happens when the prisons overturn the guards, because in the original study it is called off on day 5 i think, but in the film it goes beyond that, which to me kind of signifies something that could have happened if the study hadn't have been called off when it did. I will watch the original because no doubt it will be better, but i still found this a gripping film, however, i don't think i would have understood what was going on, if i hadn't a full previous knowledge of the original psychological experiment, what the film should have done is mentioned the original story and what is was finding out, ebcause there is no mention of the reasons why, i just know why because i studied the research in psychology. If you're going to watch this film i would suggest looking up zimbardo and his study first then you get more of an overview of reality and what they have tried to do in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had a great concept, assign certain characters as guards (middle aged guy who still lives with his mom, frat boy on a powertrip, etc)make the meek/liberals prisoners, give the guards a set of rules, throw everybody in a makeshift prison for 2 weeks and see what happens.The result of this would probably be fascinating every time but this movie could have benefited more from a few questions being asked, like who were the people organizing this.And why the chief perpetrator was supposedly paid in spite of what he did and especially when the experiment didn't last 2 weeks.There's a reason why some movies even with great actors aren't given a theatrical release, this was the directors 2nd movie, he's more of a producer and it showed. I didn't see the German original and I don't see the point comparing, I judge every movie on its original merits and this one could have been much better with a little more thought and application.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the surface, this movie was a mediocre interpretation of the results of the Stanford experiment. Personally, I find it quite hard to believe that complete strangers would start raping and murdering each other after a mere six days, especially if they knew that they were in an experiment getting paid. I do not doubt that things like this occur in real prisons, but in an experiment where all they have to do is get along for 2 weeks and they will make $14,000, I am a bit skeptical.**This is my personal interpretation and I don't care if you agree or not**Contains spoilers I was about to turn this movie off until I had an epiphany. As soon as Forrest Whitaker said "that red light is all we have," it suddenly hit me that this movie is about religion. More specifically how religion is a prison and causes people to do crazy things. The guards represent Christians and the prisoners represent every thing non Christian. The cameras represent god, who is supposed to always be watching and will protect them. The guards are given a list of rules or "commandments" that they must make the inmates follow, in order to please the men behind the cameras (god). When the inmates refused to be oppressed by the guards (Christians) who are forcing their rules on them, they begin to fight back. One of the guards rapes an inmate and Forrest Whitaker, who at the beginning was a devout Christian, goes crazy and kills someone, all in the name of keeping the experiment going.Conclusion: Religion is a prison and causes people to do crazy things in the name of god, but ultimately there is no god because the people that were supposed to be watching allowed one man to be raped and another to be murdered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This flubs in a big way the point of the original 1960's Stanford experiment of observed situational identity. So what, you will say. This is the American remake of the German film adapted from a book. It makes for an awful movie is what. The point Zimbardo was trying to illustrate, was that if the images and experience you surround people with have some persuasive force, they will readily adapt to their part in the narrative. It is an exercise of deeply cinematic interest, next to other things. Kuleshov's Effect.To make his case, Zimbardo selected only the most psychologically sound candidates. The point was that self is fluid and anyone can change. In the American remake, you have a religious 43year-old man who lives with his mother, a binge-drinking womanizer, a homosexual, a neo-nazi ex-con.Of course there is nothing inherently wrong with being overly religious or a homosexual, yet the film subtly insinuates, by selectively focusing attention on the fact, that there might be, and that it can be cause for friction and violence.The religious guy turns out to be the most abusive, hoping to please an unseen 'omniscient' father behind the camera. The pacifist leads the resistance and is revealed to be an animal no less violent than anyone else. It's lame and predictable, the whole thing a cheap and tawdry excuse for psychological abuse.You get stock reversals and conflict instead of really fluid self. And you will know this is entirely made from cliché, by noting the pacifist's girlfriend awaits him somewhere in India to pursue together spiritual peace and enlightenment in some ashram.Read up on guys like Satchidananda whose Yogaville involved a lot of similar psychologically abusive moulding of character, because someone here sure as hell didn't. Forest Whitaker is particularly bad as the unhinged warden of this straight-to-video schlock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior Remake Of A Not Very Good thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any film that has a couple of Oscar winning actors in it must be worth seeing . Why then did I never hear about a Hollywood remake of the German psychological thriller DAS Experiment ? Probably because it went straight to DVD without the slightest fanfare . Hmmm you release a film with two Oscar winning actors to the DVD store that's selling the latest mockbusters by The Asylum ? To be fair and it's sad to mention this that not a lot of people would have remembered Forest Whitaker's best actor Oscar let alone seen the film that he earned it in . Adrien Brody like F Murray Abraham is a contender for least successful career after winning best actor gong on Oscar night so to be brutally honest both men are well regarded but not massive box office draws so it's not shock of the century a film like this didn't get a cinema release For those of you who remember the original as not being all that great this remake tries to enhance the source material . From the outset we're shown violent scenes from the animal kingdom . There's no right about this and no wrong about this . It just is and morality is purely subjective , something this film hints at very strongly at the start . People are greedy by nature and what THE EXPERIMENT does well is introducing a very clear motive for the characters . They want the experiment to be a success so they can get paid , so no violence which means the guards find ways to bend the rules . The film then starts breaking its own rules on the subject of internal continuity and before long prisoners are being beaten up and tortured . The whole movie falls apart by this stage because it's impossible to believe that none of this is being supervised by the scientists . I think the original movie gave an explanation for this( I only saw it once a long time ago ) but here there is none and goes very over the top . If you haven't seen the 2001 German original then you might like it but I was rather bored by it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad writing is just... bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from the two principal actors, there is little in The Experiment that would recommend itself to viewers. I wish that it had starred Steven Seagal and Dolph Lundgren so that I would relegated it immediately to the trash bin of film where it belongs.The writing is lazy and bad. For the writers to introduce a central plot element - a character with diabetes - and to have no idea of how the disease actually affects someone is mind boggling, especially since it is such a common and widespread disorder. For a diabetic with a low blood sugar to ask for insulin is like treating the victim of a rattlesnake bite by also having a scorpion bite him, and then dosing him with arsenic until he feels all better.The characters exhibit the same lack of depth shown in the writing and research. This movie works on an emotional level and the filmmakers quite clearly prefer that you check your brain at the door.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Unsettling But Brilliant Film About The Consequences of Giving Power To The Wrong People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Experiment is not the first of its kind, but its one of those that is watchable and enjoyable in my view. Casting Adrien Brody, and Forest Whitaker two Oscar winners against one another in a film about a psychological thriller where in a group of 26 men are chosen to participate in an experiment examining the roles of power, the conflicts and workings of those in a prison; between the guards and prisoners. Whitaker as the head guard, who comes from a dominating mother at home he has lived a sheltered, controlled and secular life looking after her as his own life suffered. He is given the chance to have power for once as a guard overseeing the prisoners of the experiment, as Brody plays one of the prisoners who soon becomes a leader to them.Obviously, the exchange of power has its problems as Whitaker's character is unhinged and mad with power, while Brody is a man who never thought he'd be a violent man or much of a leader either. The Experiment examines, those who should not be put in positions of power if they themselves have never had even just a tiny bit of authority as having too much at one moment can turn them insane with power.However it also examines the faults of the prison system, that guards use their power for their own goals of manipulation. Whitaker and Brody shine in one their more unknown roles, however not any less searing. The casting of the film was very well done, and other supporting characters like Twilight's Cam Gigandet does well in the film as one of the unhinged guards. The environment is well shot, a penitentiary and the bleakness of the cells and containment. The story is possibly where it lacks, it is not the most original plot for a film. It has been done before, and in a few cases done better but The Experiment is still a good film.If you want a film that explores the depth of the roles of power and authority, and how they can corrupt even the most mild-mannered person The Experiment is a good choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its a flop Hollywood remake of German movie Das Experiment. As usual both Broody and Forest were great with their acting, but i wish i hadn't seen German movie to give bias review of this movie. This is a proof of how Hollywood some times spoils the remake of good foreign films. For first timers watching this movie comes as treat - as it talks about human psychology and question the evolution from animal to humans. The Hollywood narrated whole movie with the concept of larger animal, or powerful animal prey on weaker ones. But, actually the whole idea of the movie is about "how power corrupts" - bring in people from same background, friends, or siblings; once given a power it tends to corrupt, which is powerfully demonstrated in this experiment. pretty interesting book "black box"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very disappointing film all around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen Das Experiment, but I'd read up on the Stanford Prison Experiment and was very intrigued as to how that premise could be transfered to the screen. This film, unfortunately, is surprisingly badly executed. The first few minutes aren't all that bad, and Scheuring presents an interesting basis amidst all the cheesiness: exploring the darker side of human nature and just how high up the evolutionary chain we are. The idea is to pit some people into a barely controlled prison simulation where one group takes the role of guards and the other one plays the prisoners. In the actual experiment, the first day was more or less uneventful and then the situation spiraled out of control. The guards, either personifying their roles stereotypically or for some other reason, started to abuse their power, and the experiment had to be cancelled prematurely. However, what this film does is turn what was potentially a great storyline into a clash between the overwhelmed prisoners and the inherently, almost cartoonishly cruel guards.The whole purpose of the film is lost when the "guards" are written out as intrinsically violent and mostly flat-out insane. The characters are unrealistic and, perhaps in an attempt to simplify the plot, mind- numbingly clichéd. In fact, the amount of sane people involved in this "experiment" is five at most... out of twenty-six. The film goes downhill from the moment the filmmakers decide to try to amp up the suspense, and the ending is almost incredibly stupid. The film doesn't even achieve the "so-bad-it's-entertaining" status because, despite the fact that it tries to put forth a serious issue, it is so overly simplified that it ends up insulting the viewer's intelligence. The only reason this has a three instead of a one is because the cinematography is good and both Brody and Whitaker do the best they can with their crappy characters in this god-awful screenplay; unfortunately, it's not nearly enough to save it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contrived and slow plot makes for a boring ride to a known end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Experiment as you know from the summary is a film about psychological tests performed on everyday citizens put both in the role of prisoner and jailer in a makeshift prison. They are videod and given a regiment of "normal" prison life to discover how they will react or change from their principals stated during initial interviews. Sounds interesting but ultimately nothing much happens. We are not invested enough in the character to truly believe they would behave in the manner presented. It follows the expected formula to a tee. Of course the guards power trip, of course the prisoners band together, of course we will need escalating events to bring us to our already predicted conclusion. Brody and Whitaker are great here, they bring as much passion as could be expected. However, their backstories are just not flushed out enough to bring empathy to the portrayals. It was like watching a fight and rooting for the guy you knew was supposed to be good. No one really learns anything about themselves, nor do the events really matter more than the shock value they provide for the screen. Sadly, I thought this could have been much better and while the original doesn't stray too far behind, at least with the relative unknowns in that film, we could connect and believe their struggle.Maddis</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday i watched the original Movie Das Experiment and i was really looking forward to see what Hollywood made out of it. My expectations were that Hollywood would surpass the German Version.Boy was i wrong! I watch movies to see a at least somewhat believable which is thrilling. The original version is really tight, full of tense and is still very believable and therefore really fascinating.In the Experiment the took out the whole dimension of the researcher, their discussions in the group. Because of this after watching 1h of the experiment i felt like "what?? it is totally ridiculous that the Stanford psychologist would tolerate that, since the rules of the experiment were pretty precisely laid out in the movie".In the original movie, there are given good explanations that are believable but still put constraints on the story and this makes it a masterpiece to watch.In this movie instead there are just shown the cameras not a word of explanation why no one interferes and the movie just abandons it own rules. Once this happens it is totally boring to watch. In the moment a movie breaks its own rules anything can happen and you just sit there and say well i don't care anymore.So i have to say this Germany just makes better Nazi-movies ;) Watch the original movie it is so much more intense, thrilling and believable at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Forest Whitaker and given the right script he excels at playing the villain, however I do not believe that this script was right for him. The movie for me, was extremely slow moving right up until the last 15 minutes. I also felt the ending was rushed and left no explanation of why exactly this particular experiment had taken place or why it was allowed to continue so long after breaking the rules given by the scientists. This being said if you enjoy films that aren't overly thought provoking with over the top violence, you won't lose anything by watching this. For this film to rate higher for me I would have enjoyed a little more depth into the psychological meaning and exactly why certain characters personalities changed almost immediately within a prison environment. Also to have the characters backgrounds explored a little more as the only actor I really felt for was the comic geek.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Torture Porn At It's Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen "Das Experiment" and I know of the Stanford experiment that the idea of this film is based, so I could watch this film without too many preconceptions.The setup seemed reasonable enough: choose 26 men, transport them to a sealed building in the middle of nowhere, make some guards and the rest prisoners and watch what happens.Unfortunately it goes rapidly downhill from there.There are too many characters and not enough characterisation, so when things start to spiral into Hell, we don't know the victims well enough to feel anything about them, other than what we'd feel if they were in a news report. There is no indications given as to why the guards were chosen to be guards, so we don't know whether how the behave in the film was predicted or whether they were just a random choice and then represented the innate beast in everybody walking the streets today.There are rules to the experiment, like no violence, but these rules are quickly broken and there is no retribution from those supervising the experiment. Indeed, once the men are in the building, the supervisors aren't seen again, not even at the end.Once it becomes clear that the men are on their own, the film predictably degenerates in torture porn of the worst kind, with death the inevitable result. And still the experiment continues.Cue full scale riot and the doors open, everybody walks out and the violence ends, just like that. And still the supervisors don't appear.And then everybody gets changed into their street clothes, they all get on the same bus, and they all go back to the big city. WHAT?!? In the middle of a full-on riot the doors open and everybody stops. Sorry, no. The guards would be pummelled into the ground, or they'd run off into the fields, chased by the inmates. And the inmates would NEVER get on the same bus as the guards.From a premise that could explain how we are just 3 days away from barbarism, exploring the psyche of normal men, pulling exhausting, harrowing performances from the lead actors, we end up with another torture porn movie of senseless violence where things happen because the teenage audience are thrilled by it, and not because the events are realistic.Yawn.</fullReview>

I have never seen the original version of this movie but I believe it's better than this one because how could anything be worse than this movie?First of all, since everyone in this movie, guards and prisoners alike, is motivated by money, why wouldn't they at least all TRY to get through 24 hours with civility. There is no possible way that I can wrap my head around the guards (who aren't really guards) getting inflamed egos and big heads within 1 day, let alone the escalation by day 5. I mean really, by day 5, FIVE!, a guard already wants a blow job from an inmate? Really. And there are no cameras in that room? How could they have a room with no cameras if they have all these rules? And what about all the violence that they ignored? That red light should have been on when Whithaker kicked Brody over in the chair.The character development is nonexistent and the writing is terrible. Definitely one of the top ten worst movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

This should have been so much better.The holes in the plot are so big you could drive the bus through them.The guards are told that if they use violence the experiment will end without them being paid. We are never told why after several sickening assaults this rule is not being enforced. Even after the guards' ringleader has clearly lost the plot, twenty men walk meekly back to their cells and do nothing (even the token 'previously convicted hard-case'). Apparently, you can grab a knife by the blade without cutting your hand at all! The script could have been written by schoolboys (actually, they may have done better). There should have been some real exploration of the psychology of the situation. Instead, the violence and depravity escalates with out any believability, while the characters remain stubbornly two dimensional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Literally every single review up here mentions the original, and that irritates me to no end. The whole point of remaking a movie is to allow the director or writer to bend the story to fit their idea of what it could've been. So sure, this may be worse than the original, but that shouldn't take anything away from the overall enjoyment of the film. Pretty much, a bunch of volunteers are placed in a fake prison as either a guard or an inmate so some scientists can study (I assume) the effects of a prison situation on the mind. Personally, and you could say that I'm overexamining the movie, I believe that it's a commentary on the corruption and cruelty of organized religion. To me, the prisoners are the believers, imprisoned and ruled over by the red light (god), which is the deciding factor to the guards, who are the religious officials. This might just be my biased opinion, but to me it all adds up. The thing that really lead me to believe this was the $14,000 hanging in the balance. It represents heaven, and if you break any of the five rules (or ten commandments) you lose it. After coming to this conclusion, I watched the movie again and found examples backing my idea all over. I have a fairly biased viewpoint, though, so I might just be finding these things because I'm looking for them, but I'm not sure. All around, though, I think this is a pretty good movie. It certainly does not deserve the lashing reviews it has gotten, but then again, I think that about pretty much every movie. It may have some slightly unbelievable events, but I think the acting is solid enough to redeem it and make it a solid 8 out of 10</fullReview>

You know that experiment where they call people in to push a button and every-time they push the button they hear screams on the other side. But as long as they aren't liable, most of them push it anyways. Well it's kinda like that, except it's taken to a whole another level. Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker are good with their roles. The plot is basically a prison experiment. Where innocent civilians that volunteer for the project is chosen to play the prisoner or the prison guards. But a simple experiment goes out of hand when the ugliness of human nature begins to rise. The thing is a lot of the characters actions don't make much sense nor is it all that clever. I know it's to movie the story along but it's done in a way where it gets annoying sometimes. Like they chose people with single digit IQ's for the project or something.

		<fullReview>The concept, script, and writing are the real losers here, and deserve only one or two stars. The only reason I gave it 5 out of 10 overall is for the decent acting and for the simple fact that it was compelling enough that I watched it through to the all too predictable ending. There's just SO much about this movie that is absurdly unbelievable and unrealistic though that it's hard to watch it past the halfway point without seriously picking it apart.For a bunch of people that are ONLY there because they desperately need the money, and considering that seems to be the primary motivating factor that justifies all of their actions throughout the film, ironically they seem to do everything within their power to break the rules of the experiment and ENSURE they won't get paid. Since that's the ONLY reason they've given up their freedom, their civil rights, and 2 weeks of their lives... the LAST thing any of them would do is break any of the rules, or even ALLOW anyone else to break the rules, since it's an all or nothing situation where everybody gets paid or nobody gets paid.Literally, one moment the guards are committing acts of violence against the prisoner(s), something they've been told will immediately terminate the experiment (and their pay), yet the next moment they're chastising and ultimately banishing one of their own for getting some insulin from a prisoner's bag to try and save his life, because the rules state that they can't bring ANY outside items into the prison. Seriously folks? Now if everybody had been following the rules to a tee, and they'd all gone to great pains and made personal sacrifices to make sure they didn't break any of them, THEN perhaps I can see them doing something as ludicrous as with holding life saving medication from a prisoner for fear of breaking the rules. However, that same guard that wouldn't allow the insulin to be given to a patient for fear of breaking the rules and not getting paid, doesn't seem to have a problem with getting his entire CD collection from his personal belongings and listening to them, never mind that it violates the very same rule.The whole devolution thing (the primary theme of the movie, aside from the usual "our Government is bad" drivel that can be found in most Hollywood movies) as we're expected to believe would happen, MIGHT be a little more realistic if the experiment lasted 6 months or a year. But the story line has everyone acting out their roles neatly after just ONE DAY, with the guards drunk with power and the prisoners throwing down their trays and refusing to listen to authority.In the end I can see liberals, conspiracy theorists, anarchists, socialists, America bashers, and people that blame the government for everything they feel is wrong with their lives, just lapping this movie up, which doesn't surprise me since it came out of Hollywood. That no doubt accounts for most of the 6.x rating it currently has on IMDb, and the 3 stars it's garnered on the cable guide. Doesn't matter how lousy a movie is, if the theme is that our government, our country, or the human race in general is bad, especially Western civilizations, it's going to rate at least 3 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inhuman Nature IS Human Nature.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be." -- Kurt Vonnegut, Mother Night.Based on the infamous 1972 Stanford Prison Experiment, THE EXPERIMENT brings a group of men together in a mock prison, randomly choosing some to be guards and some to be prisoners. The result: everyone ends up belligerent, backbiting, exploitative, uncooperative, vicious, violent and pathologically inept at dealing with others; in other words, just like normal society. We needed a prison experiment to tell us Mankind is no better than a cage full of simians? Didn't we learn anything from PLANET OF THE APES (1968)?Adrien Brody is Travis, a pacifist and peace activist recently out of a job, who answers a Wanted ad seeking volunteers, paying $1000 per day for two weeks. At the check-in, Travis and a roomful of disparate characters are told the Rules of this mock prison by the leader researcher: No violence or the experiment is terminated; heed the Guards, abide by the Rules; watch the Red Light, which would light up if any of the rules were breached, terminating the experiment. Cameras would monitor the prison 24/7. When Travis is screened by the researcher, he is asked "What about religion?" His answer: "No." Researcher: "So how do you base your ethical decisions?" Travis (points to his chest): "Here."Excellent. Every one of us know what's right and wrong. We don't need a devil or god to tell us so. Life is circumstantial morality. Travis meets big, gentle Barris (Forest Whitaker), who goes from his sad doofus character to Idi Amin Dada within 24 hours of donning the Guard's uniform. Originally made in Germany as DAS EXPERIMENT, this American version retains the claustrophobia and spiraling madness of the experiment itself. A dramatic retelling of the actual Stanford Experment, the movie is by no means a staid documentary, but an action thriller; characters are not meant to represent anyone in real life; the mood and tone is captured, of the human animal losing control of its carefully constructed façade of society.And in this study of mankind, we discover the human animal is, in fact, as base and uncomplicated as any given "lower" animal. The Guards take pleasure in dehumanizing the Inmates, while the Inmates fall into a pattern of blindly following directives from the Guards. That's the general rule - but there are exceptions. There are Inmates (like Travis) who do not suffer emasculation lightly and rebel against the tyranny of the guards, and there are Guards who do not succumb to hurting others for the sake of authority. Some viewers will argue that these exceptions are the traits that define our humanity. I differ - if they are exceptions, then by definition, they are NOT defining human traits. When Barris takes unbalanced control of all the Guards and Inmates with a bestial force, he uses the red light like every coward uses religion: "The red light is the only way that we can know..." whether we are going too far. If he is using violence and the red light doesn't light up, it only affirms his cruelty and makes him feel empowered. He's relying on an outside source to make his ethical decisions for him, therefore abrogating personal responsibility. When Barris is responsible for almost letting a man die, he points to the cameras: "Do you know what's on the other side of those cameras? We're being watched 24 hours a day by people who know what they are doing. If there was a chance that somebody would die, do you think they would let it happen?" Like the metaphor for an invisible god who hears nothing and does nothing while Its supposed creations kill each other in Its name. WE OURSELVES deep inside know right and wrong. So instead of acting even more like beasts because the red light stays off, the Inmates and Guards should ask, "What kind of beast is behind the red light?" Just like religions should ask themselves, after countless centuries of spilling blood in the name of their gods that don't lift a finger to help or hinder, "What kind of beast is behind our religion?" (No, He doesn't work in mysterious ways. I'm guessing He doesn't work at all.)From all accounts, the misfire of the Stanford Prison Experiment proved it a disturbing success, revealing the intrinsic, systemic problem of all prison environments. It explains every prison incident from Attica to Abu Ghraib, and gives us insight into how the guards and governors are as much to blame for the scandals and mismanagement of the prisons as the inmates who committed crimes (real or technical) to get themselves there in the first place. By Day 4, the violence has escalated to the Guards using their nightsticks violently, regularly. The red light stays off. We only THINK we've evolved past fierce creatures. The most amazing fact of this movie and the actual Stanford Experiment is that conditions turned pear-shaped in so short a time; at Stanford, the planned two-week psychology experiment had to be terminated after only six days! What kind of loaded springs are we homo sapiens? Are we so fragile that placing us in a hostile environment - whether we're good or bad - makes us gravitate toward hostile?Truly we are merely just a planet of glorified apes! It's a madhouse. A MADHOUSE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Presentist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is based on the Stanford Prison Experiment which is a textbook example in freshman level sociology courses ever since it was conducted in the 1970s. I was expecting the deep emotional experiences that the actual students went through or something similar. The actual experiment was far more remarkable because the participants didn't get paid and they were allowed to leave at any time without any repercussion. It was conducted in a basement of one of the buildings, so everyone was only a staircase away from the rest of the campus. The treachery from the guards to the inmates became so intense, it was actually the professors that called it off early, on Day 6, instead of letting in continue to Day 14. The amusing question that everyone asked the inmates later on was, "Why didn't you just walk out? There were no locks or bars or containment."The whole result from the experiment was that social roles and our need for structure is so immense that we stop seeing our own individual circumstances in order to be part of the group. This movie was typical of the last decade and had a strong collective capitalist current running through it with the anti-war pacifist turning to violence when a limit was reached and with the powerless church going black man that has a overdue power trip when put in a position of authority. Very Darwinist in its approach, almost outdated in today's esoteric and spiritual era, even though it has been a very recent paradigm shift. Nice revenge and loyalty elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shame about the last act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not watched the original ( or even knowing there was ), I can only review this film on it's own credits. The opening Thirty minutes is engaging and promising. Brody's character is likable and the whole concept of sending a large group of civil men into solitude is intriguing.However, this film is plagued with unnecessary actions and scenes. Hollywood finally introduced it's true colours in the second half of the film by introducing rape scenes that put you off the story, clichéd antagonist and while the violence was OK to watch, it was still not needed.At times you wonder what has happened to the men behind the cameras. Also, you will find it hard to believe that just after a day or two inside prison, that civil men, with no criminal offences, can harm one another like they do in this film.Ardien Brody is brilliant despite the script running of the mill. The acting all around, is brilliant. The first Thirty minutes was intriguing and opened up many possibilities and surprises. But unfortunately, the last act was the act where it totally forgot about the script and instead, focused itself on sex and violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mutated Version of What the Stanford Experiment Was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of people, looking to earn a quick buck, sign up for a behavior experiment. But that may have been a really, really bad idea. The experiment causes even the pacifists to turn violent, and there is no one to stop them.This film could have been easily forgettable, but luckily they somehow secured a great cast, and I think that may have saved it from being just another American remake. Starring Adrien Brody as the pacifist (perhaps even hippie) Travis and Forest Whitaker as Barris, these two can carry the film on their own, with or without the ensemble cast.I have to give a shout out to Fisher Stevens, who plays the professor Archaleta. I'm saddened that after some bigger hits (notably "Short Circuit") Stevens has been reduced to doing bit parts. But even more sad is the inclusion of Maggie Grace as the hippie Bay. Not that she does a poor job, but that the character is completely pointless, has no development, and her scenes only add another five or ten minutes on to the film -- which would have been more powerful without her.The experiment shown in the film wouldn't hold up by standards today, as the safety of the people involved is now a top priority. This may have been indirectly addressed, though... I'm unsure. What I can say is that this was adapted from a 2001 German film, which was adapted from a book, which was loosely based on the Stanford Prison Experiment. I think it's safe to say that this film has nothing to do with the original experiment (it is very, very loosely based)... but I'm not sure how close it is to the other sources.While you might be able to rent better films, this is not something to automatically pass up. If you're into survival, or enjoy these cast members, or like prison stories, you may really like this one. I was pleasantly surprised, and of all the films I see, it was one of the best in recent weeks.</fullReview>

As this is a straight to DVD movie it surprisingly has a good cast and doesn't suffer from small budget diseases.The Experiment has the potential of being a great movie but never reaches it's full potential. To me it felt like certain events were rushed. This could be by the lack of explanation of the motives and the background of certain characters.

		<shortDescription>Hollywood storytelling + a psychological experiment = a mediocre movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stanford prison experiment was about group dynamics when people were assigned roles of prisoners and guards but the movie only revolves around the two main characters most of the time, with others being almost entirely absent. As group dynamics do not really get into play, they miss many opportunities for personality development, which is what made the actual experiment interesting in the first place.Due to the complete lack of character development (with one exception) the movie feels rather dull and the behavior of the characters, as well as their backgrounds, suggest that the researchers had knowingly picked individuals who had mental or other problems in the past. Even though the plot is about as linear as it can get, it is still full of holes.The German version is much better, not because The Experiment is a remake but because it is dumbed down way too much. A typical reality-watching simpleton may find the remake easier to follow, though.Even with its flaws, I give it 7/10 because the basic premise is interesting and the movie is refreshingly different. The set and the cast were certainly good enough.</fullReview>

No guards cared to step up to their insane leader (minus one). They all fight to the death at the end then the door opens and they just all stop. Absurd. So bad. Incredibly predictable poor writing.

		<fullReview>I thought this was one of the better films I've seen lately. I'm surprised at a lot of the negative reviews this movie has been given. I thought it was good. I know nothing about the original so can't compare it to that.A group of scientists hire regular guys to play roles in a prison experiment. Some are guards and some are prisoners. All they have to do is follow rules to earn 14000 dollars. Some rules include no violence, must eat all the food, and prisoners are not to talk to guards without being spoken to first. The rules seem simple but it only takes a day before some of the prisoners start getting fed up with it. It all starts when one guy won't do 10 push ups. I mean who would not do that for thousands of dollars. Then one guard, played by Forrest Whitaker, gets caught up in the power and things on downhill from there. His nemesis is prisoner 77, played by Adrian Brody. Whitaker and the other guards start getting violent; however, the experiment isn't stopped like promised.It's like one guy in the movie says, caged animals turn on one another. That's what happens in the end.FINAL VERDICT: Check it out.</fullReview>

It was definitely like a train wreck, terrible to look at, but impossible not to. I most definitely was not expecting some of the events that took place.

		<fullReview>26 men has been chosen to join the roles of Prison Guards and Prisoners for the experiment for two long weeks. The prize is $14,000 a person if they can last two weeks for this experiment. Travis (Oscar-Winner:Ardien Brody) is hoping to get the money for a long deserved vacation and Travis is called Prisoner 77 for the study. Barris (Oscar-Winner:Forest Whitaker) is seemingly normal man, who never had power in his life. Barris is one of the prison guards. This experiment is in a isolated area. At first, the experiment goes well until the prisoners slowly starts acting like real prisoners. It seems that Travis is the lead of the group. While the Prison Guards are getting more sadistic and powerful. Travis would never expected this strange experiment to be deadly real.Written and Directed by Paul Scheuring made an effective thriller, based on the original German 2001 film titled "Das Experiment". Oscar-Winners:Brody and Whitaker are terrific in the movie. While Cam Gigandet and Travis Fimmel offers scene-stealing performances as the brutal guards. Originally made for theatrical release, somehow this feature went Direct-to-DVD instead. Which it is too bad, because the movie is powerful and brutal at times. Despite some silly dialogue, especially coming from the worst Prison Guards in the movie.The Canadian DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Unlike the American DVD and Blu-ray. The Canadian DVD offers some special features like interviews, B-Roll footage and behind the scenes featurette. "The Experiment" has an few flaws. The first, i wish the movie was much longer. Especially getting to know some of the Prison Guards and Prisoners better in supporting roles. The feature also lacks an satisfying conclusion. But still, strong performances by Oscar-Winner:Brody, Oscar-Winner:Whitaker (His role shows shades of "The Last King of Scotland"), Gignadet and Fimmel makes this picture worth watching. Usually talented character actor:Clifton Collins Jr. is sadly wasted in a underwritten role as one of the prisoners. Super 35. (****/*****).</fullReview>

Each is assigned the role of either prisoner or guard and given 5 basic guidelines to which they must adhere.This film was thought provoking and stirred up heated discussions among my family...I ask you one question; If Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker's characters in the film (keeping in mind that Adrien was a "Hippy" and Forest was a 42 year old man who still lived with his mother) were assigned the opposite roles of prisoner and guard, would the prison environment have been the same?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After several minutes from the opening of this one, I started to think on terms like "I've seen this before". And yes, I did: 'Das Experiment', which I saw some years ago on cable. So, expect nothing new here, but a very convincing acting from every cast member and a small therapy on our most aggressive behavior that breaks loose when no one else but ourselves are in charge... which is more or less our real world now.The movie managed to keep me inside its plot since the opening credits, which is a remarkable accomplishment. We are embarked on the story of a few man with different Personality Disorders ? and this should be understood since the fact that every human being has some degree of PD ? volunteered to take part on a behavior experiment where social conditions of a prison are recreated by them and the surrounding environment.Enough from the plot, my thoughts on it. When someone said something like "we (humans) are on a higher evolution step from the monkeys" and someone else refutes, I immediately refuted along, not because of what the movie had shown already, but because of the social background and the factual experiment that took place on the early 70's that this story relies on. The story is a reflection of our systematic tendency to sex and aggression, the basic, limbic motives that drives us as animals, whether we are confined on a "controlled experimental environment" or we are "out there". That reflection can be taken as a macro one, while taking the males Guinea Pigs as the sample, or as a micro one, if Adrein Brody's character is the only thing you study during its 96 minutes of running time. At the end, I doubt 77 accepted his real condition. You can be as pacifist and rational as you think you want, but you're still a mammal, a primate, and it just takes the perfect condition to let it out. Was he comfortable with it? He denied himself and try to put back on his rational mask? See it and answer that to yourself.Technical aspects, nothing new, a few nice shoots, a perfect story.Whether you see Das Experiment or The Experiment, you are facing, basically, the same thing. I personally choose Adrien over Mortiz. Besides, Whitaker, that maniac freak, performs just perfectly.The Experiment: we haven't evolved at all. We are just the same predators wearing ties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of men apply to participate in an experiment whereby they would be paid $1000 per day for 14-days. They will be broken down into prisoners and guards. There are 5-Rules all must abide by. No violence is permitted against either group. If violence does occur a Red Light will come on and the experiment will be terminated and no one will get paid. All participants agree. This is based upon a true story (experiment) that occurred in Stanford, California in 1971.In the beginning we are shown animals fighting each other and this is brutal and bloody. I never imagined Giraffes fighting, but there they were in front of me. I guess when enough is enough anything is possible. So the question may be do we change our behavior because of innate impulses or does behavior change due to situational circumstances. The debate goes on. Prisoner #77 is Travis (Brody) and is considered the leader of the prisoners. Barris (Whitaker) assumes a leadership role as the Lead Guard. On the way to the prison each was cordial telling each other they are doing this for the money. However, once inside and roles determined by the organizers of the experiment, things change when the prisoners start to rebel over small things like not eating everything on their plates. Cleaning the plate is one of the 5-Rules. The Guards feel the need to take actions to maintain discipline and things get worse for the prisoners from there on. The Red Light is watched by the Guards and when it doesn't come on after certain actions, the Guards feel justified in what they do to the prisoners. Things get really bad now. Much of this is really tough to watch. Telling myself "it's only a movie" didn't help because these things have actually happened either in the real experiment or somewhere in the world. The acting by all is first rate. Some of the things you will see may remind you of Abu Ghraib. We never see the organizers of the experiment while things are going on so we don't see any debate among them to terminate the experiment or not. If you read up on this actual experiment in 1971, you will read that there was much discussion among them. But, in here, not a peep. And, the ending begs many questions and you are on your own. Again, this was extremely tough to watch. Definitely not for children. Not for me either. You?Giraffes fighting? Those seemingly gentle creatures? Hard to imagine, but there they were in front of me.Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, a rape. Nudity: Male backsides and a photo from a Girlie magazine. Language: Yes</fullReview>

It does so somewhat successfully. The main characters, Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker, are portrayed to act wildly out of their characters' personalities after being in the experiment. Though the behavioural changes of the guards are very evident; their psychological transformation is less evident. I would have liked more portrayal on the psychological journey of being a prisoner.

		<fullReview>Firstly, I buy every movie that Adrien Brody is in. This way, given his usual 'un-flawed' performance, I won't be disappointed if the movie sucks. This movie did not suck. Add to that the fact that Forrest Whittaker also starred, it was win-win. I have come to trust the fact that Mr. Brody is going to turn out an unforgettable performance in whatever role he undertakes. My husband has come to expect the same .I am rather surprised at the number of reviews here that found the movie's entire premise to be totally unbelievable, since it was based on real events. Those who already knew this fact, but still found grave fault with the movie for exaggerating the violent aspect of the experiment's confrontations...I'll agree that the physical violence was exaggerated, but after having read the story of the actual Stanford Experiment, I feel that the real violence, the emotional toll taken on the participants was actually downplayed. This may in part be due to the producers wanting to hedge their bets for bringing in box office numbers to help with the distribution of the movie. Who knows...Had this movie delved into the emotional damage suffered by the unfortunate subjects of the experiment, it would have been a completely different sort of film experience..one that would have needed to convey that this atrocity actually happened somewhere, and why more wasn't done to expose the outcome.Many people in these boards continually revile American copies of foreign films. Certainly, some suffer in the reinterpretation, but many of these original films would have gone completely unnoticed, since they get very limited distribution in this country. There are myriad films I've learned about and enjoyed immensely only because I saw the American version of it first. If you like the American version well enough, most will go on to see the original, and go on to form their opinion regarding their preference from there. So the foreign version thus will be given a second life thanks to the American 'copy'..tribute might be a better choice of terminology in many cases.So I loved the movie. Might I love it a little less after seeing 'Das Experiment'? I doubt it. I know it will be profoundly different, but I'll always remember those performances given by at least two fine actors in this version..and I'm happier still that the mail came today, and therein appeared my copies of 'Splice' and 'Predators'. =)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a great cast of Forest Whitaker and Adrien Brody starring in same movie that has a great experimental story that been adapted from a German movie which was kinda loosely based on an experiment so called Stanford prison experiment( which was real but i don't exactly know ,guess i wasn't there so , (kiddin)).A group of ordinary people are made guards and prisoners and left them in a isolated prison with some rules ...and let the experiment begin ...this is not like other movie where there is fight everywhere because they are criminals or something, this shows your behavior, your self respect, and your soul. This is a really good intense movie on a straight forward story , which is really well done by Paul Scheuring (director).I don't know why these guys trying to pull this movie down, but if you take my advice just give it a chance, this will definitely move you , make you feel the pain &amp; torture, make you break the walls and get yourself out... well i think i don't have to tell the outline of the story as you can see it in IMDb. But i m definitely gonna buy the DVD.........WATCH IT !!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie, don't listen to anybody who says differently!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who says this is bad is just one more jaded movie goer. This movie was amazing and I loved every second of it. It's much better than the original and Brody and Whitaker and amazing in this. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat and you won't be able to stop watching. This film deserves so much more credit than it's getting. Anyone who says this is bad has no idea what they are talking about and doesn't know one good movie from the next. It seems like now a days people are so quick to criticize anything. Like so many people out there are just too many people that have no idea what a good movie it and by posting negative reviews it makes some people think it's not good and they don't watch it when they should. But I am telling you that THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME AND YOU NEED TO SEE IT. YOU WILL NOT BE Disappointed. THIS MOVIE IS INTENSE AND WILL KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT THE ENTIRE TIME!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story itself is not complicated and not some fiction. It is about human nature and what can happen when personal gain and obtained power over others can reveal real face a person. In this movie, actors have demonstrated it perfectly.Leading actors are great as usual. Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker made this movie look very real. Fear, humiliation, aggression, disappointment, and aggression are well demonstrated.I rate it 10 and recommend to anyone who likes movies without just spectacular bang bang boom action.Great job! Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had to watch twice...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid AB fan, I was very excited, almost too much to view in it's entirety initially. Once again I got pulled into his character Travis and lost sight of the film itself, which explains why I got more out of it the second time. Definitely kept my attention which is a task at times and I enjoyed the individual characters more than the movie as a whole. I felt it portrayed the prison/guard -master/slave roles on a mediocre level but that had more to do with organization of dialogue than acting performance. Somewhat irritated by the comparison with The Jacket scene/claustrophobia reaction but never too irritated if it involves AB:) Would have love to see the roles reversed with AB playing the oversexed jackass for once instead of the victim...just a thought...overall entertaining...</fullReview>

Non-violence.The truth of this film, I believe, is that as a species, we have yet to learn how to live in a non- violent way because violence has been a part of who we have always BEEN. Non-violence is a learned behavior and any behavioral change takes time, conscious effort, and a passion to succeed. I, too, am of the opinion that we CAN and WILL change the future.

		<fullReview>THE EXPERIMENT ? CATCH IT ( B ) The experiment is a low budget, direct to DVD psychological movie with two Oscar winning actors. The movie is quite depressing and gritty overall. In the beginning after watching some gruesome documented footage, we know what we are getting in it. Though the director didn't push the envelope in the end but still the best thing was it ended on a happy note. Though they didn't show us did forest Whitaker was blamed or arrested for killing the diabetic patient or not? Adrien Brody did a good job, I think till now he should be a master of crippled looking thin weirdo in prison after working in movies like (The Jacket, The Pianist &amp; Splice) and above all he got Oscar for looking like that in The Pianist. Forest Whitaker was at his best, he did a really fantastic job. Cam Gigandet &amp; Travis Fimmel were effing Hot Bad-Ass, though at one point I thought Cam died after trying to rape that weird Dude (Jason Lew) but thanks God he was alive in the last footage when they are waiting for the bus to pick them up. Maggie Grace is really charming though she is only for couple of scenes but still she shines on screen. Clifton Collin Jr., Matt Harwell, Jason Lew and all other supporting actors did a fine job. I wished the director would have showed some more in detail what exactly happened once they were out so it would have more lasting impact but nonetheless it was a good attempt in such a low budget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE EXPERIMENT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Academy award winners Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker star in this direct to video psychological thriller based on the novel 'Black Box' as well as the 2001 German film 'DAS EXPERIMENT', which was based on it as well. The film is written and directed by Paul Scheuring (creator of the TV series 'PRISON BREAK') and co-stars Clifton Collins Jr., Cam Gigandet, Fisher Stevens and the always impressive and stunning Maggie Grace (although in a small underdeveloped part). The book and earlier film were written by Mario Giordano and loosely based on the real events of the famous 'Stanford Prison Experiment'. In the experiment 24 undergraduates at Stanford University were chosen to play the roles of prisoners and prison guards in an imitation prison set up in the basement of the Stanford psychology building in 1971. The experiment was ran by a group of psychology researchers organized by Philip Zimbardo. The experiment and Zimbardo have been highly criticized as he allowed the experiment to get out of control; participants adapted to their roles far too easily and excessively and some were tortured and traumatized from the process. It was ended after just 6 days, as opposed to the original 14 it was scheduled to last.In the new film 26 volunteers are hired to participate in a similar experiment where some are chosen to play prisoners and others guards. Many are desperate for the $14 grand they're promised upon completion of the project and therefore go to great lengths to see it successfully played out. It's explained to them, by the head researcher (Stevens) that if certain rules aren't followed, like punishing a prisoner for disobedience, the project will be terminated and no one will be paid. It's also informed to them that if any participant strikes another, in any violent way, the experiment will be stopped. As with the real experiment the participants quickly become obsessed with their roles and go to excessive and abusive extremes to demonstrate their position. Rules are broken and the project continues as things get completely out of control. Brody plays the peaceful and rational voice of reason in the project that the other participants playing prisoners learn to idolize and Whitaker plays the mentally unstable and sadistic role playing prison guard that puts himself in charge.The movie is over the top and I'm sure much more extreme than the actual events that took place at Stanford University but at the same time it's somewhat believable and true to human nature. There are situations in the movie that definitely stretch the realm of reality but the acting is so good and the direction so effective that the viewer kind of overlooks them and continues to remain hooked on what's going on before them (at least for me). I thought the film was completely involving and, for me, really got under the skin. This was thanks in large part to Brody and Whitaker chewing up the scenery. The supporting actors are all good as well but having these two heavyweights anchoring the film really made it something worth watching. Once the film is finished and done you question a lot of the logic and believability of what went on but while it's playing out it's a hell of a ride. It's almost like the film is playing an experiment on the viewer, I love a film that can evoke such a powerful and emotional response. It has it's flaws but this is definitely something worth checking out. The studios really blew it by not releasing this in theaters.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4rYA-j3f3c</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Saturday morning movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Experiment was a fun movie to watch, but was far from good. Adrian Brody and good ol' Forest Whitaker were pretty good in their roles, but the plot was not that strong. The majority of the film was shot in one prison cell block and you could tell it didn't have much of a budget. It was amusing to see that the characters would snap so quickly within like 7 days. Including a great scene of Adrian Brody getting peed on. The movie was fun to watch but was far from a masterpiece and you can defiantly see why it didn't make it to theaters. The only real problem with the movie was the ending. Your looking forward to an epic beating and then, the doors open, and the experiment stops. Really weak ending, but worth watching.Rating = D+- VideoGameHollywood.com</fullReview>

The story kept building up and the ending wasn't as I anticipated. One of the best movies I saw lately. I do hope we'll see more of this kind of movies and not movies that use special effects.The director toyed with my thoughts and my heart was on a full "Le Mans Race", pumping like crazy till the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Lord of the Flies" in a Prison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Experiment" is a very disturbing film because it purports to show the true nature of humans. A scientist gets together a bunch of men, all strangers, all attracted to the experiment by the $1000 a day payment. All these men had to do was to get through two weeks in a prison environment, or else they would not get paid.At the onset, a few were selected to play roles of guards, while the rest became the prisoners. Within the next day, a power play among guards and prisoners ensues which then escalates into an uncontrollable "Lord of the Flies" scenario, a battle pitting the common good against individual needs.The central characters were well essayed by the Oscar winner lead actors. Adrien Brody plays the most outspoken prisoner, Travis, in an effectively gritty manner. Forrest Whitaker plays the shy and lonely Barris, who discovers the repressed Idi Amin within him as he played guard. The rest of the cast were also okay, but were mostly playing caricatures.I found out that this film was released direct to DVD, which was unusual for a film that features an Oscar winning cast. Maybe the producers were thinking that not many can sit through the difficult scenarios this film shows, and they may be right. I personally cannot believe that this experiment can turn out in this violent way in real life so quickly, but then again, we also know what people can do when desperately strapped for money. It would also be interesting to watch the original 2001 German movie about this same experiment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave it 10/10 because the idea is excellent (maybe not original - I haven't seen the original movie, neither did I read any reviews). It shows that being left along with our fears brings the best (or the worst) out of us... When the push comes to shove, it truly defines what people will do in extreme situation, and most people don't know what it will be until it happens... When you walk with your wife or a loved one and witness the gang beating up on (hopefully the guy) or a woman, and THEN there will be a moment of truth. Either walk by and act like nothing happened or ELSE (maybe you end up dead defending what it's right, or live happily ever after if you survive, - if you step in).

		<fullReview>Before watching this movie I was not exactly sure what to expect since it seemed like a mixture or genres, but man was I in for a surprise. The story line is really great, with plenty of action and character building at the right times. Once again Adrien Brody pulls off a stunning performance. I have been watching a lot of movies recently and this one is a must watch, it really gives you a perspective on how the basic fabric of even us humans is and even though we are living in a civilized world and time, we have forgotten that we are also animals and will act like them given the right environment. The movie was really touching in this aspect and I feel that it has shed some light on my life as well as anyone else who watches it. The ultimate battle us humans fight is within ourselves and this movie cleverly displays that with a perfectly written script! Must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right off the bat, when I say 'worst film ever made' I'm excluding titles that are generally poorly reviewed. This movie on the other hand has garnered some above average reviews on this site and attained a user review score of around 7/10. How this has happened is completely beyond me, because I can without a doubt say that this was the worst movie that I have ever had the misfortune of viewing. Acting: Adrien Brody is mediocre at best and his acting doesn't add or take away from the film. Everyone else on the other hand is awful. I now regard Forest Whitaker as one of the worst actors starring in big pictures today. Every scene he's in apart from maybe the first few it sounds like he has a speech impediment, and I know for a fact that he does not. His serious lines come off as laughable and every time he screams a line I have to bury my head in my hands, it's that awful. Plot: This is what not only drove the movie off of a cliff for me, but lighted it on fire and defecated on it. The plot is ridiculously non-sensical and for the most part just made me f*****g angry. Instead of saying 'Hey, all you have to do is eat your meals and not hit us for two weeks and then we get 14,000 dollars' the characters feel the need to be hostile to one another for no particular reason whatsoever. Really, it makes absolutely no f*****g sense, they generate conflict out of purely nothing and the prisoners act like their wives are being raped in front of them when they're asked to do 10 f*****g push ups. For Christ's sake, it's just such utter bull s**t. At one point when violence is used and there is no intervention wouldn't the characters say 'Hmm, well nothing happened so I guess the experiment is off' and just f**k off and go back home?! And if you agree with all the things just one of the f*****g characters does in this movie then you are just stupid to an insane degree.Completely un-relatable and unbelievable characters, the worst plot ever and terrible acting make for what is, in my opinion, the absolute worst movie of all time. Honestly, I want to find the director of this movie and just punch him in the f*****g mouth. I cannot understand how people are even given the opportunity to make such complete garbage. The first time a movie has actually made me mad at it. And to those people that say this movie is a venture into the violent nature of humans and explores what power can do to people, you have got to be kidding me. This isn't how people act in real life unless they're clinically insane. If you want to look at something that explores the violent nature of humans read the Lord of the Flies because the characters act like REAL HUMANS.1/10 if I could give it a 0 I would.</fullReview>

That's what drove me to view the movie.Great storytelling of how; when subjected to a different environment, the human psyche can go to places beyond regular recognition. Being a fan of psychological thrillers this film did not disappoint. Adrien Brody is without doubt on his way to become a memorable actor, Forest Whitalker's character was intense! Along with a 5 star cast of fresh faces.Overall this film is unique in its nature, gripping and moving scenes as bit by bit the animal awakens in morality's peace loving face.It's more then just an experiment...it is mind games</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main theme is that we are superior to the primates because of our will to do something about our defects. We do have some social genes from the bonobo's, thank Darwin. The conclusion from a lifelong study of human nature brings Dr. Zimbardo to realize that the same mechanisms that can be contrived to show our violent underbelly can also be constructed to elevate us. That is the movie I need to see.We have spent enough time demonstrating the slide, we need more Hobart Shakespearians, more Gary Ezzo's and the science that shows the stresses on the hippocampus can be alleviated, IMHO.Like the intro to this movie and the trailer that Brody had to endure while being screened, enough already. When folks are less stressed I believe that a great wave of creativity will ensue that will elevate the human cause. String theorists suggest that we are 15 Einsteins from understanding the universe. Lets find them, nurture them and populate the stars as Hawking desires. Peace is not Poverty. Smedly Butler told us years ago. We need the next generation of Zimbardo's to show the possibilities.

		<shortDescription>The Experiment of trying to promote subconscious racist viewpoints.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it was very entertaining and I did enjoy it, however, once again, Hollywood can't refrain from its ignorant views on racism.First I was quite offended by the comment about India in the beginning of the movie when they are discussing their big plans on a visit to the city of Varanasi. The girl casually says she'll go to an ashram, do some self-reflection and eventually have sex with her Guru.Why is that Hollywood can't help but ridicule and demonize Hindus? Why is it that on one hand the Westerner wants to go to India, but loves to degrade the indigenous culture of India? Perhaps it is subconscious racism and a white superiority complex created by enforcing lies and misinformation about cultures to demonize them and also keep colonial myths alive of the constant lust for white women by men of color.The you have a black guy who is the villain and the white guy comes to save the day....Surprise, Surprise. However, it doesn't stop there, the black guy is a devout Christian, while the white guy is a liberal hippie. Makes me wonder that if the White dude is such a liberal hippie, why did he find it funny when his hippie girlfriend was ridiculing the spiritual culture of the Hindus. Makes you wonder doesn't it? Okay, lets not stop there. There is a White Neo-Nazi supremacist character, and guess what? He's one of the heroes too! Wow, you actually start liking him and thinking he's cool.Whoever sat down and did the character sketch for this movie has a subconscious racist mind and probably needs to seek help.Besides these observations, the movie was quite enjoyable, however, I liked the original "Das Experiment" much better.Hollywood will always be an idiot when it comes to cultural sensitivity and so will the actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Stanford prison experiment was a study of the psychological effects of becoming a prisoner or prison guard. The experiment was conducted in 1971 by a team of researchers led by Psychology Professor Dr. Philip Zimbardo, Ph.D., at Stanford University. Twenty-four undergraduates were selected out of over 75 to play the roles of both guards and prisoners and live in a mock prison in the basement of the Stanford psychology building. Roles were assigned at random. The participants adapted to their roles well beyond what even Zimbardo himself expected, leading the guards to display authoritarian measures. The experiment even affected Zimbardo himself. Five of the prisoners were upset enough by the process to quit the experiment early, and the entire experiment was abruptly stopped after only six days. The experimental process and the results remain controversial. The entire experiment was filmed, with excerpts soon made publicly available, leaving some disturbed by the resulting film. Over 30 years later, Zimbardo found renewed interest in the experiment when the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal occurred."</fullReview>
