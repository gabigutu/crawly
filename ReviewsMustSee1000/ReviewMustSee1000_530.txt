		<shortDescription>A model involved movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would not be surprising if some day a film school professor chose 'También la lluvia' to illustrate a course about committed pictures, for this Spanish-Mexican co-production is indeed a model of its kind. Intelligently written by Paul Laverty (Ken Loach's regular collaborator since 1996) and competently helmed by Icíar Bollaín (a Spanish actress turned director and, incidentally, Laverty's life companion), 'También la lluvia' examines a social and political event that took place in Bolivia in 2000, the Water War, when an American Water Company tried to privatize the drinking water service in the town of Corachamba, implying a tariff raise in an order from 40% to 300%.To tell his story, the writer could have adopted the committed filmmaker's standard approach: «display of injustice/negative impact on the group concerned/reaction of the most militant/confrontation/resolution of the conflict». Instead, he imagined the coming of a film crew shooting a movie in the surroundings of Carachambo, getting involved gradually? and against their will - in the troubles affecting Corachamba. So do the viewers, who identify with them without having the feeling they are being manipulated by the authors.Such a concept also gives 'También la lluvia' added value, making it function on several levels. It enables Laverty to: - inform his audiences about a little known historical event - unveil a hidden chapter of history (through the subject of the film shot within the film: the first opponents to the Conquistadores, Jesuits Bartolomé de las Casas and Antonio de Montesinos) - have the two stories echo each other and enrich each other - cast a spotlight on Bolivia, a neglected country, and on its Indian population - depict complex characters (the more idealistic ones shying away from direct action when confronted to danger while the more reactionary display unexpected bravery)Helped by Iciar Bollain's sure-handed direction and by the excellence of the cast (Gabriel Garcia Bernal as Sébastián, the tormented director ; Luis Tosar as the cynical producer ; Karra Elejalde, impressive as the provocative star of the film in progress ; and - the revelation of the film, - the amazing Juan Carlos Aduviri, who inhabits his role as the Indian actor/activist Daniel), Paul Laverty manages to teach, move and entertain, while avoiding dogmatism, bias and over-simplification. Just what he is accused of by the flock of bleating French film critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>correlation between conquistadors and corporations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first got wind of the political situation in Bolivia around the time of the 2003 protests, and then during the 2005 presidential election that brought coca farmer Evo Morales to power, making him the country's first indigenous president. Oliver Stone's documentary "South of the Border" partly told the story of the World Bank-inspired water privatization in Bolivia: the World Bank forced Bolivia's government to pass a law making it illegal for people to collect rain in buckets since it would have broken the monopoly on water ownership.Icíar Bollaín's "También la lluvia" ("Even the Rain" in English) tells the story of the privatization, contrasting it with Christopher Columbus's genocide against the Indians. Filmmakers Sebastian (Gael García Bernal) and Costa (Luis Tosar) arrive in Cochabamba to make a movie about Columbus's arrival in the Americas, and the Taino Indians' subsequent rebellion against the occupation. But the events depicted in their movie begin to play out in real life: when the government sets out to privatize the water supply, the actor playing Taino leader Hatuey is one of the leaders of the protests.The movie - which is dedicated to Howard Zinn - obviously has as its main purpose to show the parallels between indigenous resistance 500 years ago and today. But more than anything, it should offer incite into the roots of the wave of progressive leaders who rose to power in South America during the first decade of the 21st century. I definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contemporary Conquistadores: Gold Equals Water</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EVEN THE RAIN (También la lluvia) is a brilliant metaphor of a story written by Paul Laverty based on an actual event and directed with considerable skill by Icíar Bollaín, the great Spanish actress, writer and director. This film is one of those rare 'docudramas' that bring to light historical 'secrets' that beg to be shared. In 2000 an American water company bought the water supply from the Bolivian government and the citizens of Bolivia were banned from collecting rainwater which had become corporate property. This resulted in a violent protest against the government by the indigenous Indians and the citizenry of Cochambamba, Bolivia who claimed their rights to the natural gifts of nature - even the rain. Laverty and Bollaín expose this injustice through a well-conceived story within a story. Spanish film director Sebastián (Gael García Bernal), his cynical producer Costa (Luis Tosar), and crew including Antón (Karra Elejalde) have come to Cochabamba, Bolivia to shoot their film about Christopher Columbus (played by actor Antón - Karra Elejalde) and his first explorations, revealing the way the Spaniards treated the native Indians: Costa has chosen the place because he can get cheap labor in using local actors and extras to keep within the small budget of the film. Sebastián is the compassionate one who wants the Indians treated well, hiring a mouthy young Indian named Hatuey/Daniel (Juan Carlos Aduviri) when he claims he and his family are being unjustly overlooked as actor candidates. The filming goes well, with the exception of some minor glitches for particular scenes the Indians find too dangerous, until a conflict develops over the governmental privatization of the water supply. Daniel becomes an activist against the government who plan a 300% increase in price of water - the average daily income for the Indians is $2. a day! - and the conditions in the city become unfriendly for the film to continue. Bloody violence and chaos breakout and many citizens are being killed or jailed. It is at this point that the caring Sebastián finally decides that he and his crew must flee, and with some role reversal, Costa stays behind to protect Daniel's family. According to Bollaín, 'It was the gold 500 years ago, and now it's the water, which is the gold of the 21st century. Before it was the Crown of Spain and the pope who approved the conquest. Now it is the new theologians, the IMF and the World Bank. Again it's the word from above, saying, 'This is right.' The Spanish filmmakers in the film-within-a-film are caught in the middle. They have the attitude of neo-conquerors - they go there because it's cheap. But they're also trying to make a film that casts a different look on the conquest. And it's an adventure.' Iciar Bollaín directs this epic film with great dignity and with a keen observation of how history, even inadvertently, repeats itself. The cinematography by Alex Catalán and the musical score by Alberto Iglesias add immeasurably to the film's success. The cast of extras is exceptional and very well directed. Both Gael García Bernal and Luis Tosar deliver intensely considered performances as does Juan Carlos Aduviri as the key central figure Daniel. Hopefully this film, nominated for Best Foreign Film in the 2010 Academy Awards. In Spanish with English subtitles. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie tangled the present with the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie; a movie inside another movie, a movie out of another movie. Told a story when the Spaniards under the command of Christopher Columbus brutalized and ransacked Bolivia, then the government was bought out and mustered in the big corporate came in modern time to raped the country, took away the local people's water resource, the well, the water supply. Just like what the demonstrators said: "They need the vapor from our breaths, the sweat on our brows, they even want to take the rain dropping from the sky(Even The Rain)". The third storyline is the movie company that wanted to take advantage of the poor country's poverty and high unemployment, getting the cheap labors to shoot the movie. "The truth got many enemy, the lie got many friends", "You don't understand, water is our life", these dialog are so profound and true. Unfortunately, the movie crew was in the wrong time and at the wrong place encountered the explosion of the street riots and the demonstrations. This is a very complicated movie but shot so well to portray all the involving parties and single person got their own demons, dilemmas, tensions, numbness, helplessness, and hopelessness,self-denial, cowardice, depression and frustrations. The complexity of this movie was so vividly painted on the big screen. This is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engaging and powerful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"No problem can be solved from the same consciousness that created it" - Albert Einstein In a film within a film, director Sebastian (Gael Garcia Bernal) and producer Costa (Luis Tosar) are shooting in Cochabamba, Bolivia in the year 2000. The film they are working on proposes to depict Christopher Columbus' exploitation of the indigenous native population in his voyage to the Americas and the effort of two priests to stand up to the Catholic Church. Written by Paul Laverty, the regular screenwriter for British director Ken Loach, and dedicated to the late progressive historian Howard Zinn, Iciar Bollain's openly political drama Even the Rain takes on the past history of exploitation of native populations, showing a parallel to current history.The film developed through Laverty's desire to dramatize the life of Bartolomé de las Casas, a Dominican friar who becomes an anti-slavery activist in defiance of the church and his native Spain. Shot in the high Andes because of budgetary constraints, Even the Rain attempts to conflate three levels of exploitation: the historical treatment of the Native Americans by the Spanish conquerors in the 16th century, the actual attempt by Bolivia to cede control of the country's water supply to a British-American corporation, and the filmmakers' cost-cutting that results in the Quechua population being paid only $2.00 an hour as extras.Opening with a "La Dolce Vita" shot of a wooden crucifix being transported to the mountains by helicopter, the film moves to an open casting call in Cochabamba as hundreds of Bolivians line up to audition for a role in the projected film. Turned away by the producer when the quota of locals is filled, Daniel (Juan Carlos Aduviri), a vocal political activist demands that the Bolivians be hired even after they are told to leave. As a result of his strong personality, he is selected to play the role of Hatuey, the first Indian to be crucified for resisting the Spanish and Christian empire.A problem arises, however, when Daniel becomes the leader of a local group protesting the social injustice entailed in Bolivia's privatization of its own water supply (a true event that forbade the native population from collecting their own rainwater). Even after Daniel tells him "You don't understand, water is life," Costa demands that the young actor give up his political campaign to concentrate on the film which needs him desperately. As the director, Sebastian likewise must walk a thin line between balancing his ideals with his powerful desire to present a revisionist history of Columbus to the world. "The protests will be forgotten, but the film will last forever," he argues.Tosar is outstanding as the arrogant producer who is drawn unwillingly into the political protest. Overheard on a phone call, Costa brusquely tells a foreign investor how he is putting one over on the locals, not realizing that Daniel, standing only a few feet away from him speaks English. Eventually, however, Costa is forced to choose between the success of the film and the demands of his conscience staring at him relentlessly.Even the Rain tells us that understanding the past is meaningless unless that knowledge can be made relevant to the present day, a lesson that the characters must learn the hard way. In lesser hands, the film could easily have become didactic or preachy, but Bollain maintains a steady hand and the result is an engaging and powerful film that not only speaks out loudly against injustice, but does so with poetry and passion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EVEN THE RAIN, directed by Icíar Bollaín, is a compelling film which attempts to explore the history of global economics using a kind of cinematic metaphor. Bollain's film focuses on a multinational movie crew that travels to Bolivia to make a film about Christopher Columbus, and examines his agenda of religious, cultural, and monetary exploitation of The New World. The production company hits a snag when locally violent demonstrations breakout against corporate ownership of indigenous water rights, and threaten to make the completion of the film impossible. The movie shows that the issues of wealth, ownership, and power are just as contentious today as they were five hundred years ago. Corporate giants of our era employ the same greedy strategy in an attempt to steal wealth, power, and access from the uninformed and defenseless. Although the ethical issues in the film are sometimes presented in a slightly heavy-handed manner, by the end of the feature, it is evident that the application of rapacious economic policy hasn't changed much since monarchs ruled the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie within a movie, and parallels from Columbus to modern Bolivia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even the Rain (2010)There are so many stunning, powerful, dramatic, believable moments to this hard hitting film, you wish so much that there weren't a few unreasonable gaffes to the plot and characters. It's frustrating when a film is almost amazing, because you are reminded of what it was not.But also what it is, which is pretty thrilling and clever.First, the contemporary setting is based quite closely on the true events of local Bolivians in the third largest city of the country, Cochabamba, fighting for rights to their own water supply. A private (Euro-U.S.) firm has cornered water rights and when the locals try to use their own handmade supply system the police come and interfere. It's maddening to the point of anger on both sides of the screen. In a way, this local uprising against injustice is the movie, the core of the events.But what makes it actually fabulous is the way it told through the eyes and cameras of a large film crew working on a movie about Christopher Columbus arriving on the shores of America and mistreating the natives. Yes, a parallel that is obvious but handled with dramatic aplomb. There are many moments showing the shooting of the film, and it transports the viewer instantly and beautifully to the Columbus events, which are epic in their own way. But the characters are part professional actors from other countries and part local (and underpaid) extras, some of whom are involved in the water protests when not filming.So there are several layers of action, tightly interwoven. The disdain and fear of some of the outsiders is believable (the man playing Columbus, Karra Elejalde, is amazing, world weary and tough, taking both sides as needed). Some of the circa 1500 history of resistance by the natives and even the brave defense of the natives by a Spanish priest is inspiring. And the way it still applies 500 years later (500 years!) is depressing. And energizing.There are some other small problems, maybe the result of editing down too much later, such as the inclusion at the start of black and white video footage, a documentation of the filming, that you think will then become news footage (or not) but then it just disappears as a component of the film, completely, for no reason. And then the tumult of the last half hour with riots and roadblocks is great stuff, really well done, but so highly improbable you have to just write it off to generous screen writing. We aren't really able to believe the wholehearted change of attitude of the producer (played with intensity by Luis Tosar), but it makes for great interpersonal (and sympathetic) dramatics. And finally the director of the movie within the movie is played by the ever beautiful Gael Garcia Bernal, but in fact he's too weak and thoughtful a type to be directing this sprawling and frankly unmanageable movie about Columbus. But these objections actually only came up for me later, thinking back. While immersed, I was really immersed and impressed. It's an ambitious, smart, and pertinent movie, with great and enjoyable complexity.</fullReview>

It was interesting to see a film set in that region, we don't see very much from that part of the world. There are also some historical facts about the conquistadors that I wasn't aware of and so it even educated be a little! I love the way it slowly dawns on the crew that the mistakes made 500 years previously are still being made today!

		<shortDescription>Idealist director and stingy producer go to Bolivia to direct a film about iconic figures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a director named Sebastian (Gael Garcia Bernal)and his crew formed by his executive producer named Costa (Luis Tosar) and actors realize a controversial film about Christopher Columbus (Karra Elejalde) Bartolome De Las Casas (Raul Arevalo) , Montesinos (Carlos Santos) in Cochabamba , Bolivia, local people rise up against schemes to privatize the water supply . Spain Conquered the New World for Gold 500 Years Later, Water is Gold Not Much Else has Changed. Costa has chosen this place because the budget of the film is tight and extras are cheap , as he hires a rebel native (Iduviri) . The only thing that matters to him is his professional pride as a producer that the film is made on time and within budget.This is an interesting and thought-provoking film dealing with actual events and past deeds as the first explorations and the way the Spaniards treated the Indians at the time, the Cochabamba revolts , being well interwoven by the screenwriter Paul Laverty and the director . Top-notch main cast as Gael Garcia Bernal as good , idealist filmmaker and Luis Tosar as selfish producer who wishes hire supernumeraries, local actors and extras on the cheap. Very good cinematography by Alex Catalan . Emotive and sensible musical score by Alberto Iglesias . The real events in which this brooding movie are based result to be the following : The Cochabamba protests of 2000, also known as the "Cochabamba Water Wars", were a series of protests that took place in Cochabamba, Bolivia's third largest city, between January 1999 and April 2000 in response to multinational participation in the infrastructure and management of the city's municipal water supply. Demonstrations erupted when Aguas del Tunari imposed a large rate increase, reportedly to finance a Dam project, a week after taking control of the Cochabamba water supply system. In a country where the minimum wage was less than US$70 per month, many dwellers were hit with monthly water bills of $20 or more. Starting in early January 2000 massive protests in Cochabamba began with Oscar Olivera among the most outspoken leaders against the rate hikes and subsequent water cut-offs. The demonstrators consisted of peasant Irrigators who entered the city either under village banners, or carrying the Wiphala; they were joined by retired . Young men began to try to take over the plaza and a barricade across incoming roadways was set up. Soon they were joined by pieceworkers, sweatshop employees, and street vendors . Anarchists from the middle-classes came from the University of Cochabamba to denounce the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and neoliberalism. The strongest supporters of the demonstration were drawn from the city's growing population of homeless street children .Protesters were able to halt Cochabamba's economy by holding a general strike that shut down the city for four straight days. A ministerial delegation went to Cochabamba and agreed to roll back the water rates; still the demonstration continued.On February 4, 2000, thousands marching in protest were met by troops and law enforcement . Almost 200 demonstrators were arrested; 70 protesters and 51 policemen were injured.Throughout March 2000 the Bolivian hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church tried to mediate between the government and the demonstrators. In the meantime, the Coordinadora made their own referendum and declared that out of fifty thousand votes, 96% demanded the contract with Aguas del Tunari be cancelled. The government's reply under Hugo Banzer was that "There is nothing to negotiate.In April 2000, demonstrators again took over Cochabamba's central plaza. When the leaders of the Coordinadora went to a meeting with the governor at his office they were arrested. Though they were released the following day, some, fearing further government action, fled into hiding. More demonstration leaders were arrested, with some being transferred to a jungle prison in San Joaquin, a remote town in the Amazon rain forest on the border with Brazil. The demonstrations spread quickly to other areas including La Paz, Oruro, and Potosí as well as rural areas. The protesters also expanded their demands calling on the government to resolve unemployment and other economic problems.Soon demonstrators had most of the major highways in Bolivia barricaded. The protest even inspired officers in four La Paz police units to refuse to leave their barracks or obey superiors until a wage dispute was settled.The motion picture is originally directed by Iciar Bollain . She has worked as a leading actress in selected films like The South (1983) by 'Victor Erice', Malaventura (1988) by 'Manuel Gutiérrez Aragon , Land and Freedom (1995) by Ken Loach, it became an acclaimed audience's and critics' choice ; Leo (2000) by 'Jose Luis Borau' that won the Best Actress nomination Goya Spanish Academy Awards and Nos Miran (2002) . She is a prestigious producer , writing and directing since then both documentaries and fiction films. In 1995, she wrote and directed her feature film debut, ¨Hola, ?estás sola?¨ (1995), awarded with Best New Director in Valladolid Festival and was nominated for Best Directorial Debut by the Spanish Film Academy. The film became one of Spain's 1996 box office hits. Flowers from another world(1999), was her second feature film and was awarded at Cannes Film Festival 1999, Best Film in the International Critics' Week ; ¨Take my eyes, 2003¨, was her following film as writer and director, winner of 7 Goyas Spanish Academy Awards, including Best Film, among many other international awards.

		<fullReview>A hot director, Sebastian, decides to retell the story of Columbus' discovery of the new world and put it in its proper perspective. For that, he and Spanish producer, Costa, decide to set the action for the movie in Bolivia, a land that has no bearing with Columbus arrival to the Caribbean island of Hispanola. The only reasoning is to engage the cheap Indian population in minor roles and as extras paying them $2 dollars for a whole day's work.Unfortunately for Costa, he manages to upset some of the would be extras when they hear his comments about what he thinks of the people rejected for an audition. Little did Costa know the reaction of Daniel, one of the rejected aspirants for the audition. This man is no fool and he takes issue when Costa speaks his mind belittling the locals, mostly natives. Sebastian, the director sees something in Daniel, a spunk that matches the fire he wants to get in the character of Hatuey, the Indian leader that challenged the invading Spaniards.There is another subplot going for the film, in that some locals vow to fight the foreign company that is trying to buy the water supply in their country, and who in turn, will be charging the population for the use of the usage of water. The film crew has shot locations in the area where the protests take an ugly turn, complicating things for the Spanish backed production. Costa, gets personally involved when Daniel's daughter has to be taken to a hospital to receive treatment right in the middle of the worst riots.Iciair Bollain, an actress turned director, has done much better with two of her previous films, "Las flores de otro mundo", and "Te doy mis ojos". She showed an affinity exploring social issues, loneliness in the first instance and domestic abuse in the latter. In this film, working with Paul Laverty, a frequent collaborator of Ken Loach, she has tried to make some sense of the exploitation of her ancestors in the new world, with mixed results. Ultimately, the target seems to be the foreign company that was trying to exploit the Bolivians, a real incident that was viewed as an insult.Luis Tosar plays Costa, a cynic Spaniard, who was more interested in making a cheap film exploiting the locals than making a statement about the ills of the imperialistic force that enslaved the locals. Gabriel Garcia Bernal plays Sebastian. The surprise here was Juan Carlos Aduviri seen in the dual role of Daniel and Hatuey, the victim of the conquistadors, who shows dignity in the way he approaches his role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Iciar Bollain's film 'Even the Rain', a Mexican film crew travel to Bolivia to make a film about the historical exploitation of indigenous Americans by European settlers. But they're motivated by the low cost of filming, and, when the locals who play the movie's numerous extras get involved in a political revolt, it's unclear whose side the film-makers are really on. The crew includes an idealistic director, his hard-nosed producer and mentor, and a cynical, boozy leading actor: but the characters are in no way clichés, and the way that they develop is a key part of the real film's success. Gael Garcia Bernal is as usual good as the director, but the whole cast is excellent, the film raises serious questions about the control of common assets, and even the film within a film appears to be something one would pay to see. The sad thing is that the issues explored - a world where even the rain is privatised - are very real in the actual world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic theatre - but only regarding the form...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely have i been so hesitant on how to judge a movie - it seems at the same time exceptionally good and rather weak, both with respect to it artistic form and its political content.Regarding the content, as mentioned by several commentators, a guiding theme of the movie is to make you feel and understand in which ways not much changed about the oppression of the South of the world by the North and of First Nations by immigrants to the new world; and even more importantly, that for bettering this, it's not enough for the average European to just be good and help the poor, because that merely leads to the paternalistic and condescending behaviour shown by the film's protagonists towards their indigenous workers. In short, the depiction of the dialectics of oppression, privilege and solidarity - in particular the voluntary, cheap, incomplete kind of solidarity - is relentless and far above average.On the other hand, the supposed topics of the movie are hardly even touched: I learnt a lot more about the Cochabamba water war from the user comments here on IMDb than from the film itself, it doesn't really explain what that war was all about. There is a bit more material about Columbus, De las Casas and their time, but it's all fragmentary, symbolist, and doesn't form a coherent picture, as it would be needed to really understand anything about history.Regarding the artistic form, i'd call this "Epic Theatre" in the Brecht'ian sense, as flabbergasting as that may seem in our post-modern times: Not only by the fact that the plot of the movie is "turning a movie", but by many other details as well, the spectator is frequently made aware the s/he is watching a play. To name just one example: People read from historical letters, then actually go on to comment why they read from those letters, and propose interpretations of the text, just like Brecht's chorus. Or imagine, in a movie, actors telling the stage director: "There are more important things than turning a movie" - and walking away from the scene. Fragmentation techniques, interruptions, contrast and contradiction, all these defamiliarizing elements of Epic Theatre abound, and even elements of the typical simplistic and abstract scenic design can be found in some parts of the movie in the movie. The overall effect is intense, this is certainly exceptionally artful, very unusual and worth seeing. Unfortunately, there are several artistic defects as well. Most of the characters are rather schematic and not very convincing, in particular in their change and development, and some turns of the plot seem contrived and artificial. Even worse, the Epic elements are not used for their proper purpose, which is making the audience think, deeply understand the social conditions at hand, and critically reflect them. Sure, the alienating effect is sufficient to make you aware that you are watching an explicitly political movie - but as i said, information is missing to really understand and reflect the alleged topics. You are merely left in diffuse indignation about the injustice of the world, with some equally vague hints that it's both possibly to individually oppose and collectively fight injustice. That alone is not news, really; the depiction of both options is neither very convincing nor in any way specific.Altogether, i deem the movie far from perfect as a work of art; but it is so diverse in its content and form that there are certainly many ways to view it, and more than one aspect that's worth seeing. Thus, i recommend you see for yourself, i don't think your time will be wasted.</fullReview>

There might have been one scene that was not that clear to me but I got the general idea of it anyways so it was not really a big problem. If this was an American film the problem would have been solved in the movie, so it different from American films. To my understanding the problem was not resolved in this film. This film taught me how people in other parts of the world are living today and that people do not have the things that we take for granted all time. Also this film sort of taught us about the past which I taught was very interesting. It showed us how the British were treating the Natives.

		<shortDescription>Good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that the most interesting part about this film, was how there were truly three different stories taking place, for the most part, irrelevant to each other. The story of the water crisis in Bolivia which launched the protest, the filming process, and the actual plot of the film being made, which was about the Bolivians. I think that an important aspect of the film was how drastically the two main characters changed! Sebastien and Costa were generally pretty selfish regarding their film they were making. However, I think towards the end, Sebastien began to understand that sometimes life is more important than a film! When Costa explained to him that he had to go the hospital to try and save the little girl, instead of finishing the film, I think it really opened Sebastien's eyes, as he would've been out of place and selfish to try and stop him from saving a life. I also think that a good and worthy discussion topic for this film would be the bad light that was shed on the government who were taking the Bolivians' water. However, I can understand both sides of the crisis; although it's not fair for their water to be taken away, it is the only rational option. If there is a water shortage, I think the government HAS to come in and take over the situation, because ultimately they are trying to do what is best for everyone, and the people of Bolivia alone could not manage the water crisis, since it's such a huge and fragile job. At the beginning of this film, I didn't really like it because I was a bit lost and confused as to what was going on, and why there seemed to be multiple different stories taking place. Then, the film grew on me, and I started to understand what was going on. Also as the film went on, for me, it got more interesting and more action started to happen. This film also put into perspective, once again, how lucky we are to have been born in countries such as the U.S, (or in my case, Canada!) For the most part, we have all the resources we need in order to survive, and do not have to worry about whether or not we will be allowed or denied access to a basic survival need, like water. I feel so lucky not to be somewhere like Bolivia, because I cannot imagine the stress and trauma the Bolivians go through, just fighting for water! To us, water is a simple thing and is available at all times. What do you think you would do if we got our water suddenly taken away from us? What do you think Americans in general would do? Do you think they'd start a big protest like the Bolivians?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie with Lessons for All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even the Rain is a movie inside a movie, that illustrates both problems amongst people both in the present and past. This movie a dramatic plot that kept me on involved in the movie, paired with the great acting of course. I really enjoyed the history side of the movie, as Even the Rain open with the casting of members for the main storyline. In the main storyline, the main focus was on the directing on another movie depicting Bartolomé de las Casas, a priest during the exploration of the new world, North America. Not only did this movie entail a historical storyline, but it also included another which were the people of Boliviá, who were fighting police that were taking away their water. Thus the movie continued weaving through both stories and creating tension between the leaders of Boliviá, the people of Boliviá, the actors and directors from Spain. This international film, in Spanish, was a very insightful film on both the problems that las Casas faced and present problems that Bolivia's nation faced. With the developing of characters willingness to help each other throughout the film, the film packed a punch. I would recommend this film to anyone, as it has lessons for all who watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Power of Yaku</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that Even the Rain was a very inspirational film. It educated the viewer about Christopher Columbus and Bartolomé Las Casas. I enjoyed this film because the water crisis in Bolivia correlated with the Spanish Conquering of the Natives. The Bolivian revolt, led by Daniel, started because the government of Bolivia wanted to increase the taxes on water because it was too cheap to obtain. This triggered the Bolivians because they do not make enough money to afford a tax raise on water. Daniel, who is a rebellious person by nature, leads the revolts, and also plays a major role in the movie that Sebastión and Costa are filming. Daniel ends up getting beaten up, and arrested, nearly ruining the entire movie production. Later in this film, Costa realizes how important the water or "yaku" crisis is to the local Bolivians. It was very impactful to see Costa evolve during this film. He started off as a rude character, who didn't care about the local Bolivians or the Native Americans. But by the end of the movie, he was willing to risk his life for the Daniel's daughter, Belén. Another theme of this movie was how the characters of the movie, like Christopher Columbus and Las Casas. have different views on how to treat the Bolivians, correlating with their roles in the movie. For example, a Las Casas supported the Native Americans, which meant that he also supported the Bolivians. Columbus on the other hand, was the conqueror of the Natives, so he did not really care about the Bolivian Water Crisis throughout the movie. This was proved at the dinner when all the characters talked about "Yaku" or water and their roles in the movie. Overall, this film really opened my eyes to all of the prejudice, and lack of common, daily resources in Central and South America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I thought was pretty cool about this movie was that it was a film about shooting a film. I also like the parallel structure of the story of the film that's being filmed and the film itself. The film that's being filmed is about Christopher Columbus and his expeditions in the New World. The film itself sort of has a similar take with the fact that the film crew is Spanish and they are coming into a foreign country and completely ignore the current life if those who are already there. I also liked the evolution of Costa, one of the lead producers/directors. In the beginning, he starts off as a very negative and ignorant character towards the Bolivians and their water crisis, and just wants to film the movie. In the end of the movie, he shifts to a more compassionate character that decides that the safety of those in the riots and the wellbeing of the crew is far more important than the movie he is filming. On the other hand, his partner, Sebastian, shifts from what Costa becomes to what Costa was. In the end, all he cares about is the finishing of the movie, what scenes they have, the money they're going to make, etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very complicated film to watch because there were many things occurring at the same time. It was very puzzling, and there were many ideas needed to be put together in order to understand the story. Although the film was complicated, it was also very fast-paced and exciting. There were many parts in the movie that really captivated me into the story -- I almost felt like I was there. For instance, when Costa was asked by Belen's mother to accompany her while finding Belen to save her, Costa debated on whether to go or not. This scene made my classmates and me to become very nervous. Finally Costa decided to go, and I was a little relieved. It is truly amazing how good movies can make the viewers feel like they're really there. It is a depressing view to see how these Bolivian people were risking their lives just to provide their children with clean water. Clean water is something most of us in the U.S. take for granted, but for them, it is everything. Money was bribed, people rioted, and people risked a lot in attempt to get clean water. This aspect of the film empowered me to think more about this topic and hopefully get involved in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even the Rain Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not expect this film to be the way that it is. I expected the film to be about only water and potentially a water crisis. I never expected that Christopher Columbus would be involved. I did enjoy the fact that they placed in parallels between the film about Christopher Columbus and the Bolivian Water Crisis. Overall, I really enjoyed the film. I found it strange that there was no clear "bad guy" in the movie. In most American films, there is a good guy and a bad guy. Mostly the good guy wins. In this film, everyone seemed to be both good and bad. The native people were fighting for their water, but they also attacked people before they were attacked. The water company that was coming in was helping the people to get water, but it also charged a great deal of money to the people. The government had to outsource the water, making the people angry, but if the government hadn't done so, the people would have no water at all. Also, just like Christopher Columbus came into America and exerted his power over the natives, so do others. The water company from America and Britain comes in and places a large price on all of the water, making it almost impossible to buy. Also, the production team working on the movie comes in and imposes themselves on the people. They pay them only two dollars a day while the rest of the crew lives in a highly expensive hotel. In the beginning of the film, it seemed like Costa cared more about the film and about the money then Sebastian, who seemed to care about the people more. But as the film continues, Sebastian becomes more focused on the film. And Costa risks his life to save Belen, a girl who was an extra on the set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure that I've ever seen a film like Even the Rain, where the plot of the movie involves filming another movie. It's really cool to think about, and I think they did a great job. The producers were able to explain things that took place hundreds of years ago involving Columbus, Las Casas, and the Indigenous Indians that they experienced; while also showing the water wars that took place in Bolivia between the government and citizens. Here in the United States, I am fortunate to never have to experience the lack of water or suffering that these Bolivians had to go through. If I were in Daniels shoes in this movie, I'm not sure I would've been able to do what he did. Lead a bunch of people in a rebellion against the government, sounds pretty scary to me. I understood most things about this film except for the title of the movie. What does it mean and where is it represented in the film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was very interesting and also was not at all what I expected it to be. The title of the film in no way gives away the fact that the film is about another film being filmed inside the film, and all the problems and conflicts affect this inside film. It was a based off of a real event that happened in Bolivia where there were water shortages and huge conflicts about this shortage and the over-sized demands made by the government. Throughout the film the (what I would call two main characters) change quite drastically and almost switch roles. I don't like that the viewers never really find out what happens to the film that they were filming there considering that the entire movie was really about that movie being finished, but other than that ending part I think that it was a really well put together film with some great actors that filled the parts well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie - my 2 favorite aspects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first started watching this film, I had no idea what to expect; however, as soon as the first few scenes ended, I already knew that I liked it. As the crew filmed the movie about the arrival of Columbus and his treatment of the natives, the parallels between that ancient oppression and the current oppression of the Bolivian natives by the government became strikingly clear. I thought it was such clever, creative way to really show the extent of the current oppression. While many people may think that the way that the Spanish treated the natives doesn't happen anymore, this film showed that it still happens. Another important aspect of this film was the character development that occurred throughout. In the beginning, Costa, the producer/crew manager, and Sébastien, the director, have differing views on the film. Costa just wants to make the film and seems to care more about it than the problems of the natives while Sébastien expresses more concern over the natives and doesn't worry about the film as much. As the movie continues and things get more complicated with Daniel, a feisty native with an important part in the film within the film, Costa finds himself caring more about the troubles of the natives, specifically Daniel's daughter, Bélen. At the same time, Sébastien is willing to put his crew in serious risk to finish the film and insists on continuing until the very last moment when the crew decides to head home. Overall, I really loved this film and all that it stood for. I would give it 5/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even the Rain starts out with producers of a film hiring actors for cheap labor. It is interesting to see a movie made about a movie. Sebastian and Costa are the movie makers (possibly producers or directors). They have to find a way to make a movie that seems to be underfunded. They find a local of Bolivia, Danielle, who seems to do a great job. At the same time of acting, he leads a protest against a 400% tax raise just to get drinking water. It's crazy to see that the government thinks somehow the people are supposed to pay this increase overnight. I really liked how Sebastian and Costa changed as the film progressed. In the Beginning, Costa just likes the cheap actors and Sebastian is the one who wants to give all the actors a chance to audition. However, in the end, Costa comes to build a relationship with Danielle and even saves his daughters life. Sebastian became more concerned with finishing the movie and even tells Costa not to go help her. Also, I really enjoyed the scene when all the people involved in making the movie were at a nice restaurant and the waiter tells Costa what the word for water was in the native language (yuka); eventually, the film ends with Costa opening a present from Danielle. The present was yuka.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even The Rain is a great movie that has many different bribes and change in character among the leads. I enjoyed watching the movie very much, as my eyes were always on the screen waiting to see what came next. For the most part everything was explanatory, but it was very confusing on who to decide was doing the right and wrong thing. The water company is charging the poor communities a very hefty bill, and the people revolt back at them by burning the bills and starting deadly riots. All of this is going on while Sebastain and Costa are trying to film their movie about Christopher Columbus and the Indians. It is definitely not an American film, as America was called out as one of the countries in charge of one of the water companies. I realized that every country has a different outlook on a world issue, and that not every country sees everything with the same point of view. I wouldn't have done anything different than the main characters in the film, as they did what they were meant to do in Bolivia. Which was to film their movie. Obviously I would have paid the actors more, as 2 dollars an hour just isn't enough to live, and it isn't enough to pay for the new water bill. The ending of the film wasn't surprising at all, it was very expected. Daniel (the main poor citizen) was in charge of the rebellion against the government and the water company, he jeopardizes the film as he gets put in jail. Which later leads to another bribe from Costa to the Police Chief. The film was very interesting, as Costa went back and saved Daniel's daughter from her life threatening injury, which was a complete development of character. Sebastian did the opposite, he left the area to bring the crew to another part of Bolivia to finish the film. As he developed into a film crazy director. You will have to see the ending for yourself, but it was very interesting, and a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a nutshell, this is Novocento 2.0. However unlike Bertolucci's story of downtrodden Italian peasants whose fate doesn't change no matter how bravely they struggle against their oppressors, this story that weaves Columbus's rape of the indigenous peoples of America with the bloody repression against the 2000 Cochabamba water riots ends in victory as the multinationals Bechtel and Suez are forced to take their greedy hands off of Bolivia's water. That was of course followed by the crowning victory of Evo Morales's presidency, Morales being one of the leaders of the Cochabamba rebellion.This is an epic film worthy of all the people who collaborated in it and devoted their lives to telling the stories of the oppressed and exploited. One might say it is their collective masterpiece and that its director the beautiful Iciar Bollain is their spiritual child, the embodiment of their collective dream.The film is as much about the American aborigines of the 16th century as about the unsubdued Ayamara Indians of Bolivia and the transformation that the left-leaning intellectual film crew and their hard-headed capitalist producer go through in the vortex of the social upheaval into which they inadvertently wander for no better reason than the availability of dirt-cheap extras.It is interesting that the only one in the film crew who comes out of it all with shining colors is the producer, who unlike the others whose lives are rooted in abstractions, has always lived firmly rooted in material reality. Luis Tosar plays the apparently conscience-free producer's profound moral transformation with gripping intensity.The real star of the film isn't as you would expect Gael Garcia Bernal, who plays the director of the Columbus movie, but Juan Carlos Aduviri, who landed the part of Daniel, the leader of the Cochabamba rebellion, as fortuitously as he does the part of the aborigine leader Atuey in the movie-within-a-movie about Columbus.Ms.Bollain's steady hand on the helm and crystal-clear vision is felt throughout the film. For some reason she hasn't directed anything since. If you ask me, she doesn't have to.</fullReview>

This film is right on the money, showing a believable crew making a low budget movie with anti-imperialist intentions showing how Columbus was nothing more than a vicious exploiting thug. I particularly like the way the cast, director and producer are getting on with the job of making a product within a budget and the stress the producer endures when his actors get precious or even more, when his indigenous not so stupid extras get stroppy too. Of course its neo imperialism that raises its ugly head to show that the sins of the past are very much in evidence today as the 'natives' are still fighting for their land and their water against the crushing power of multi national 'free market' companies seeking to expropriate their natural resources with the help of corrupt local politicians.

The plot is superb, drawing on modern themes, it sweeps you into many layers of storytelling. Thesurface of the film within the film, within the film, and the undercurrent of the water war, right out of modern headlines, but likely unknown to many western viewers. Plot twists throughout. An unpredictable ending. Realistic almost documentary style to the filming . The ensemble cast is just tight and believable,much like a Mamet piece. The superb acting of the native cast, wholly believable in the roles, makes the movie draw you in as if you are watching real life happening in front of your eyes. The tension between the well meaning modern young Europeans ( and ultimately, us, the Western viewer) and their inability to deal with what they have helped create, gives the film it's importance, I think that if you like tight dramas, modern thrillers that don't rely on huge amounts of FX but simply excellent storytelling, you'll love this. Should it be on your shelf for viewing more than once? Absolutely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films like this break my heart. I could see the point, the end goal of the film. And yet, a series of mistakes screws the whole point up and what you're left with is a heavily flawed film with moments of potential. And so comes "También la lluvia" (Even the Rain), Spain's official entry for Best Foreign Film of the 2010 Academy Awards.The film centers around a production of a movie about Christopher Columbus (like we really need another one) in Bolivia in the year 2000. Costa (Luis Tosar aka the bad guy from Miami Vice) is the penny-pinching producer of the flick, while Sebastian (Gael Garcia Bernal just for you ladies) is the artistic director determined to make the best film ever. They end up casting the hardworking "Indian" Daniel (Juan Carlos Aduviri) as the legendary Hatuey (native who first defied the Spanish conquerors). But as the two filmmakers learn, Daniel is one of the leaders of the disgruntled native population in Cochabamba, Bolivia who are beginning to make their moves to protest the multinational interference with the city's water supply. Thus, the film's production is put into conflict with the 2000 Cochabamba Water Wars.First I'll get the positives out of the way: the film is wonderfully shot against the Bolivian countryside and the film does an excellent job of capturing the chaos and build up that led to a very violent and very real protest in Latin American history. Bernal, Tosar, and Aduviri all turn in great performances with what they are given. But they're not given much to work with, because the script has no idea what it's trying to do. A good portion of the film is dedicated to the rehearsals and stage setup of the Columbus film, while another portion is dedicated to the building up of tensions regarding the control of water in the city. As a result, you barely get time to know the three leads who time and time again change their motivations.Sebastian wants to tell a Columbus story, even though he himself is hellbent on filming a particular scene involving Franciscan missionaries arguing about enslaving natives and another scene involving Hatuey's moment of infamy. In other words, the film's focus ends up changing completely. Costa is heavily concerned with the film's budget that he purposefully has the film shot in Bolivia to get cheap native labor and extras. However, he begins to grow a conscious when he offends Daniel that he is offering dirt money for all his hard work. Then he goes to right back to penny-pinching to make the film. Finally, Daniel looks like he is concerned over his daughter's welfare, but he ends up carelessly getting hurt during the protests that also end up deeply injuring his daughter.I could see where the film ultimately wanted to go. It wanted to show how after 500 years, Latin American natives are still being brutally oppressed by foreigners and are being used for cheap labor to further the foreigners' own purposes. But the film never gets to that point. It's too busy showing the Columbus film's production and the conflicts among the actors. We are treated to many scenes involving the actors bickering among themselves and about the social-political situation. As a result, we have even less time to develop the other leads' stories. I say leads because not one actor, in my opinion, could honestly hold title to the protagonist since we keep following several character arcs that ultimately are never resolved. Also, some minor characters turn in some awful performances when their characters are needed to push some important plot points. Worst of all, the leads make some crucial decisions that have no set up to explain why they would behave in a certain way. As a result, the audience is left puzzling why they would act in that way. That being said, the film is thankfully short at 103 minutes and I can't say I was bored during its runtime.Even the Rain desperately wants to make a connection between modern day exploitation of indigenous Latin Americans and the historical slavery of said indigenous cultures when the Spaniards came. The lead actors turn in great performances with what they are given and some great cinematography is used. It starts out meaning to say something, but like Bernal's young director, it doesn't know what to focus on, and ends up not being able to say anything at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but difficult to understand everything because of some unreadable subtitles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this move in the theaters because there was a dearth of good movies out that I hadn't seen. I generally rate a movie on entertainment value, quality of the production, and quality of the acting. All were good here and I might have enjoyed the movie even more if it wasn't for one major flaw. The subtitles were in white and blended with the background, especially for the outdoor shots. I just saw a movie with subtitles that were white but with a black background behind them. That made them much more readable. The dialog, especially in the first third of Even the Rain comes very quickly and when you have to struggle with the subtitles you miss a lot while only being able to get the general gist. Any nuance is easily missed. If the film comes out with better subtitles on the DVD version, I may rent it on Netflix to see what I missed. I think all professional movie critics should include in their rating of foreign language films an indication of the readability of the subtitles. I wonder how Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post was able to give this movie three and a half stars out of four if she had the same problem with the subtitles that my wife and I had. Maybe movie-making hasn't progressed as far as we thought.</fullReview>
