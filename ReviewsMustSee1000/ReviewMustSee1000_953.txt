		<shortDescription>overall, he makes a fair point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever you may throw at Michael Moore's methods, there are some points made in the film that are valid. FACT: The United States has a gun-related homicide rate that is totally disproportionate to its population when compared to every other country in the world.By the end of the film, however, Mr. Moore has already discounted the ownership of guns as a cause, and the blame lies firmly at the feet of the selective and sensationalist media. By far the most insightful comments in the film are made by Marilyn Manson - namely that there are certain businesses and politicians in the United States that capitalise on on fear.I don't see this as an anti-gun film, but more an observation of a country that is so completely gripped by fear, that it is spiraling downwards into deep and dangerous paranoia. That this fear is driven by certain forces for profit is sickening and it needs to be uncovered.When I see so-called 'gun nuts' or apparent racists being interviewed, I feel nothing but pity for them. Their views have been formed by nothing less than the media saturation they are exposed to on a daily basis.I guess these things are far more apparent to those of us who live outside the USA and witness the continual aggressive acts it perpetrates upon countries that are far too small and weak to defend themselves.Watch this America, then "South Park, the Movie" and after that take a good long look in the mirror.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Bowling for Columbine,' is a very thought provoking film.Perhaps the first thought it provokes in any US resident is that the most sensible thing he or she could possibly do is move forthwith to Canada. It's nearby, they speak English almost indistinguishable from standard American, it feels `lighter over there,' you get government health care, there are plenty of guns but very little killing, and you don't even have to lock your doors.The fundamental question `Bowling for Columbine' asks is: What's responsible for the exceptionally high level of killing in America? Not a lot of guns, Moore points out, because other countries have that. Not a violent history, because other countries have that. Not a love of violent movies, video games, and so forth, because other countries love all that too. Not poverty, unemployment, and ethnic diversity, because lots of countries have more poverty and Canada has as much ethnic diversity and more unemployment. Two things, according to Moore, are primary causes: the US media, which, as he shows, fans up fear constantly among the American populace; and the government in Washington, which solves everything by bombing people somewhere. There's a third thing that emerges more subtly: a gun culture, which leads to the absurd notion of self-defense, perpetuating the violence and the fear and the racism. In this the leading force is that powerful lobby, the National Rifle Association. The result of this lethal combination delineated by Moore, particularly since 9/11, is that Americans aren't very happy people: they live in a constant state of rage, perturbation, and fear, when they're not disolved in tears for the dead who're falling in the houses and streets and schools of the country on a daily basis.`Bowling for Columbine' isn't ultimately very cheery or uplifting stuff. True, it has lots of laughs, but most of them are ironic - a little sick-making, when you think about it -- and at American expense. Those of us who live in the USA and don't actually regard moving to Canada (or somewhere else) as a real option, aren't walking out of this polemical documentary feeling any too cheerful. One may quarrel with Moore's style, though it seems questionable that so many reviewers have expressed disapproval of his personal appearance (what's sloppy dressing got to do with it?). One can hardly quarrel with most of Moore's basic facts or the urgency of his subject or his commitment to it. Because of its significance to Americans on both personal and national levels, "Bowling for Columbine" has to be considered the most important (and it's becoming the most watched) US documentary film in many a year. This is being recognized in all sorts of ways, first of all with the special jury prize at Cannes. We shall see what the Academy has to say.It's impressive that Moore and two young men seriously injured at Columbine were able by their confrontations to shame Wal-Mart into taking handguns and ammunition out of their stores - and Moore appears to have been surprised and impressed by this result himself.Moore has seemed crude and simplistic and confrontational in the past. His methods have not radically changed, but they've modulated into something subtler and less self-serving, such that he has an ability to talk more easily with potential adversaries -- bank employees giving out rifles with new accounts; Michigan militiamen; even Charlton Heston, the haughty President of the National Rifle Association, who invites Moore into his house to film a conversation. True, Heston ends up walking out of the room after a while, but he doesn't have Moore thrown out. Nor does Wal-Mart. This is significant. One is tempted to call Moore's methods (as he wields them today) not crude and simplistic and confrontational, but direct, simple, and honest. There's something unimposing and Middle American about his overweight slouch and scruffy baseball cap crowned head. If he lives in a house worth close to $2 million in New York now, you can't tell it from looking at him, and that consciously maintained persona, if we choose to see it thus, aids him in moving through Littleton, Colorado and Windsor, Ontario, and the other places where he got the footage for this devastating, yet simple film. For credibility among US gun-toters like Heston, Moore has an ace in the hole: he's an expert marksman and a lifetime member of the NRA.Heston walks out because he hasn't good answers; in fact he really hasn't any answers at all. His explanations for why the USA is so violent are ones Moore has already discounted, and he can't justify his brazenly fronting for the National Rifle Association in Colorado and Michigan right after the child murders by children in those two states. Marilyn Manson (the artist accused of complicity at Columbine because the young killers liked his music) in contrast has not only good answers, but also the greatest zinger in the film. When asked what he would have said to the youth at Columbine after the murders, he says: `Not a word. I'd have listened to them. That's what nobody has been doing.' In between telling interviews, Moore has various ways of documenting contexts: an animation, recited statistics with images, and astonishing film clips like the Fifties one of cops admiring how realistic some kids' toy guns are, and the one from a metal-detector company pushing for dress codes in schools, showing a boy with baggy pants unloading a whole arsenal. What's laughable are all such solutions that don't even begin to get at the problem - that are just profiteering from chaos and insecurity.It's encouraging that so many people are seeing and commenting on this movie. When it was over, I wished the lights would go up and there'd be a discussion group held right there in the auditorium. There was a lot to talk about. Not everything was by any means clear, nor were all the facts to be bought without question. But in one way or another, `Bowling for Columbine' brings up all the most central issues in America today. Michael Moore makes you laugh and cry; but most important, he makes you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that should be mandatory for all politicians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes Mr. Moore may lean left, and yes he may not be the most objective documentarian.However the facts stand: America has many, many more deaths attributed to guns than any other nation. It's a sad truth.Unfortunately Mr. Moore has been vilified for asking why. And typical of the "head-stuck-in- the-sand" mentality of the far right, they are angry for his work, not at the facts.This movie is well done and if you're left, right, in-between, gun nut, or responsible gun owner it is definitely worth viewing.I suspect most of the negative comments posted about this movie at IMDB and similar sites are by people who haven't seen the movie. They're just angry at what they perceive the movie to be.It isn't a movie about gun control. It's a movie that merely ask why so many deaths.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentary by Michael Moore about the NRA and America's fascination with guns. Much of the footage deals with Columbine and the case in which a 6 year old boy shot to death a 6 year old girl. It all culminates in an interview with the head of the NRA Charlton Heston.Riveting, chilling, hilarious and absolutely incredible movie despite what your views are on the gun issue. Moore's views are definetely anti-gun but he does try to show the opposite side also. Moore questions why there are so many killings in America by guns and almost none in other countries. He gives no real answers to this question but he raises a lot of interesting points and theories. I walked out of the theatre very shaken but, in a way, exhilirated. This is truly a great documentary.I'm not going to review this fully--it's a movie you should see for yourself. A definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A liberal's critique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was entertaining and interesting, but in certain ways it left me wanting. Michael Moore himself is somewhat irritating, and I found myself wishing he kept more to the background than he does. At the same time, the conclusions that he draws are compelling and pragmatic. This movie was not designed to be an argument. It was not designed to sway the viewer. It was designed to fuel the fire of the already convinced. Though I think that this is Moore's intent (concluded from interviews I've read), I feel that goal could be reached at the same time as convincing a few fence-sitters, and that would have made the film more powerful. I have two main complaints regarding this movie: First, I felt that Michael Moore sometimes crossed lines in his interviews that in no way seemed to further his cause or drive his point home. He interviews people as though looking for his answer, not their answer, and particularly seemed to be trying to strike a blow at the conservative masses. I thought this distracted the genuinity and plausibility of the conclusions that he drew. It must be said that the conclusions that Moore drew are of a nature that strikes at conservative politics. However, I felt that the facts he represented spoke for themselves, and that the blows should not have been dealt to conservative interviewees by asking questions designed to get emotional responses out of them.Second, I found some of the statistics needed to be qualified with per capitas or percentages. When comparing the United States to England, for instance, it is important to take population differences and density into consideration. Straight statistics do not apply. I think the statistics were somewhat skewed by this oversight, however according to some rough guesstimates I made, it wouldn't have diminished Moore's point, only made it less dramatic (which would, indeed, have strengthened his case). These two complaints hint at an even larger problem, however, and that is this: Because Moore presents his case in this way, he can never hope to have his message truly heard by anyone who isn't already on his side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major funding from Canada?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this for the first time and pretty much like it. But something kept nagging at me. I am a pretty liberal person and believe in Gun control but I really have always liked Charlton Heston and couldn't believe he was as bad as he's portrayed here. So I did a little research and found out that his speech was so horribly butchered by Moore that he totally changed the meaning Heston was going for. Also Moore inserted a shot of Heston waving a gun over his head that was taped at a NRA function a year later in some other location and then cut in so it looked like it was part of his speech in Denver after the Columbine shooting. Moore never mentions that the meeting was planned way before the Columbine shooting and couldn't be canceled realistically in that short period of time. Other things found out. The Footage of the Dog with the gun is faked. The bank at the beginning mailed the guns to customers from a warehouse 400 miles away. They didn't hand them out in the bank the way its portrayed and the guns in the bank were models. The Foreign death statistics don't take into account police shootings(the US figures do) and they are not adjusted for the differences in population and a few of them he took the lowest death toll in a given period instead of an average???The scene with Dick Clark was another one that I just couldn't believe. Is he really that rotten? Turns out the the six year old's mother had lost custody of all her kids and was a convicted drug dealer. She had three children all from different father's and her son was not in her custody and living with a drug dealing uncle in a crack house with guns and Knives all over the place. Moore conveniently leaves all this out and tries to make Dick Clark the bad guy for employing the kids mother at minimum wage. When Moore approaches Clark he does it at the worst possible time. Why? because Moore WANTS Clark to get angry and close the door in his face. I'd shut the door in his face too. What's going on here? The list goes on and on and I'll leave it up to the inquisitive viewer to do a little research into how this films was made as almost all of the major points Moore is trying to make have been altered or major points left out to get his personal view across. And what's with Canada being portrayed as something almost bordering on Utopia? Did Moore ever mention that the film got major funding from Canadian government money through a Canadian production company!! And I have friends in Canada and they LOCK the doors! I agree with what Moore is setting out to do but the film really never draws any conclusions and his tactics are not in line with what's considered Non-fiction. I almost felt Moore's tactics were as disturbing as the subject matter. When you have to distort the truth to such an extent and not even realize or admit to it, based on the way Moore defends everything in the film as the truth, is a very disturbing trend. This film has a tremendous power to influence people and they should really know the whole truth not Michael Moore's truth. Anything else truly is "fiction"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie makes me feel that it is the first time i just remotely understand the American society. Michael Moore explores the darkest side of America - the society built on fear. Fear of terrorists, fear of the coloureds fear of your neighbor. It appears that americans have lost perspective, not noticing the real dangers of life: pollution, traffic, e.t.c. With TV-channels telling stories only about violence and terrorism and populistic politicians scaring people to vote for them Americans trust only in themselves.Michael Moore tries with this movie to make the Americans consider and think for themselves being rationals, and to tell the rest of the world how the American society works. Really something to think about... See it, its necessary</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most thought provoking movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What has become of the United States? Is there any difference from the United States that was formed by Puritans and tried to escape from persecution under the British flag? Has there always been a different mentality for the American than that of any other nationality of individual? After September 11th Michael Moore the director and writer set out to make a documentary that addressed these and other embedded questions that are addressed everyday in our news media, school systems, homes, stores and street corners. Attempting to address all sides of the issues as a person of the media Moore used not only his own experiences, his connection to the NRA, but also other persons opinions that ranged from Charlton Hesston, the well known president of the NRA and famous actor, to the average American that was confronted with the violent acts that resulted from the accessibility of fire arms. This documentary took a new approach to the display of information. Not only was animation used to explain history, American's imbedded fear of their own neighbors, but it also used rock music ( gave a beat or a pulse to the film that progress from slow to fast as the intensity of the issues progressed), sarcasm, interviews, and casual conversations. Moore traveled the country to talk to all those that make up the spectrum of the American society, he traveled to the scenes of some of the more recent American tragedies, made impromptu stops in corporations such as Kmart (where the boys from Columbine bought the ammunition used in the shooting), and traveled to Canada to get an outside or foreign opinion. The idea was to move away from the documentary style of `talking heads'; he wanted a film that would not only touch a chord with the American people but one that would also be readily watched. This idea also made the documentary, that there was too much influence placed on the `words of the professional' or the ` findings of the expert'; that these findings and misleadings flooded the news at night to increase the amount of fear that the average American has as it looked for a scape-goat to blame. The information that Moor presented in his documentary did not technically follow a pre-described narrative, but followed more of a form where the audience was left areas to think and to breakdown the information. Elements of the circular narrative were the foundation of the film, where similar elements in opinions and the common American we continually addressed. Yet, the only problem that could be addressed is one of the ways in which Moore collected some of his data. Some might see a use of trickery or manipulation was used on his part to get the responses and such passion-filled opinions stated. While others would see the same information in the light that no instigation was needed, that people have these strong beliefs, opinions and are willing to talk about them but they lack the examples or understanding of the topic to take a well informed stand on one side or the other. Such a problem is not new in the world of documentaries when controversial data is presented to the public. Moore did a great job of presenting a delicate subject to the American people and was deserving of the Academy Award for the project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technique = 8... Honesty in Presentation = 0</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say that, as a person (a Canadian for anybody who might question if all the negative reviews are from the USA) who doesn't care for guns and has no interest in them -- I've never even held one -- upon first viewing of "Bowling for Columbine" I was a fan. I loved this film. I even bought the DVD. I thought it was a brilliant documentary and that its presentation of the facts was spot on.However, the scene where Moore talks about a bomber on display in the desert and the army plaque beneath it always made me wonder exactly how honest he was being, since what he claimed the plaque said sounded too outrageous to me. It kept on grating me until about a year later I began to actually research his film and found that nearly every single thing Moore presents in BFC is either heavily manipulated facts or bald-faced deceptions.Take the scene of him getting a gun for opening an account at a bank. What he does not show is that there was a criminal background check including photo ID check and an FBI background check. Then, to get the gun, he had to open a 10 year Certificate of Deposit... basically he had to deposit nearly $1000 before he could get the gun, not the smartest idea compared to just buying a gun if that's the only intent. Even then, when Moore gets his gun and asks about the safety of handing out guns in the bank, the audience is duped into forgetting a large portion of Moore's handing-out-a-gun-at-a-bank safety joke: the bank doesn't supply the ammunition!You even have his little cartoon where he tries to link the NRA to the KKK... never mind that him saying the NRA was formed the same year that the KKK was declared an illegal organization is 100% wrong... never mind that the NRA was actually formed by Northern Yankee's who fought AGAINST slavery... never mind that the NRA was primarily created in reaction to Southern laws that would ban blacks from owning firearms (the exact opposite of the cartoon's suggestion the NRA wanted to suppress blacks and leave them defenseless)... never mind that the cartoon is a South Park rip-off, presented after an interview with South Park creator Matt Stone in order to make it seem like the cartoon was made by the creators of South Park. I mean, no wonder Matt Stone hates Moore and made him a target of insults in his "Team America: World Police" movie. Talk about complete deception from every angle.What's worse is that he is even hypocritical in how he talks about America's culture of fear and how the media tries to instill fear in the population, and yet that is EXACTLY what BFC is: a film that presents manipulated facts in order to create fear. Probably the best refutation of BFC one can find is the in-depth article by Dave Kopel called "Bowling Truths" that literally shreds BFC from beginning to end, showing it to be -- as he puts it -- more of a 'mockumentary' in the vein of "This is Spinal Tap" than a serious documentary outlining anything close to reality.In terms of gun control issues, if you really want an intelligent look at the problems of gun control, check out the episode of Penn &amp; Teller's Bullsh*t on gun control. Now THAT is an intelligent and more importantly an HONEST delving into gun control. But if you are looking for facts and honesty in subject matter, you couldn't find a worse choice than BFC.BFC is insulting to anybody who would be willing to take the time and educate themselves on exactly how honest Moore is. If you think BFC is truthful and honest, go read Kopel's article (readily available on the net) and you'll see how much Moore stretches the truth. I mean, even the film's title is deceptive since -- as even the preliminary police report states -- the two shooters at Columbine never showed up for bowling that morning! I still own the DVD, if only to show people a perfect example of how sheep can be led around if they don't stop and ask whether what they are hearing is real. BFC offers little reality and a lot of political brouhaha that does little for intelligent discussion on gun control. In that, he has hurt the gun control movement more than he has helped it.(And by the way, people in Canada do lock their doors. I have to wonder how many doors he had to try in order to get his shots of every door being open.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>that michael moore is an obnoxious self-aggrandizing windbag... an incredibly overrated director who combines the crude rhetorical style of conservative media hacks like ann coulter with the nutty politics and unconvincing "millionaire spokesman for the common man" persona of ralph nader... basically just a left-wing version of rush limbaugh, only fatter.anyone who honestly thinks that "bowling for columbine" is an accurate and thoughtful investigation of violent crime in american society does not live in the united states (as the demographic data on this website clearly illustrates) or is ideologically predisposed to agree with any crackpot theory that moore spits out. *obligatory spoiler warning* the critically acclaimed documentary is a rambling, poorly-focused melange of isolated statistics, erroneous insinuations (including a crappy cartoon suggesting that the NRA was established in conjunction with the ku klux klan), lame anecdotal evidence, sappy appeals to the audiences' emotions, and incredibly dull diatribes about irrelevant topics like air pollution and health care reform.moore does, however, manage to pose an interesting question... why does canada, where gun ownership is common and violence-laced american forms of entertainment are popular, have lower violent crime rates than the united states? unfortunately, his laughably inept attempts to answer that question leave much to be desired. in "bowling for columbine" we are told that students sometimes shoot their classmates because k-mart sells cheap bullets, the CIA armed paramilitary groups in central america during the 1980s, and television news programs somehow turn ordinary people into racist lunatics. with stunningly tortured logic, moore also decides to blame former president clinton for declaring war on a murderous serbian dictator as well as dick clark for owning a restaurant that hired a single mother on welfare.in a disingenuous interview with NRA president charlton heston, moore crosses the line between mildly entertaining leftist buffoon and self-righteous jerk. with pointed questions and shameful editing, moore portrays the aging actor, who suffers from alzhiemer's disease, as a bigoted old fossil. take a minute to read heston's biography on this website... he was an active member of the civil rights movement when moore was probably sitting in his parents' garage eating paint chips and sniffing model glue.the target audience of smirking gullible foreigners, aging hippies, and naive latte-sipping college students will probably enjoy "bowling for columbine"... but anyone who does not already assume that america is overrun by heavily-armed, delusional sociopaths will find it tiresome and unconvincing...

		<shortDescription>Yes, Canadians lock their doors as much as anyone else, Mr. Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When film makers or critics of any kind stray too far from home and make generalizations, they need to be very careful. I don't find that Moore is too concerned about making careful observation in general, so I don't think he cares much about stereotyping others.His trip to Toronto in Bowling for Columbine was laughable, given the statements he makes about "Canadians". Moore suggests that Canada is a safer country because he pulls on a few doors in the city of Toronto and finds them to be unlocked. Moore has a penchant for stereotypes. If he were a bigot for the extreme right, I would be frightened of him. Canada is not just Toronto, no more than New York represents the US. And a few unlocked doors in a city does not make your point.I actually believe that a country with fewer guns will have less casual gun crime per capita, and I believe that the US has much to learn in that regard from us in Canada.Unfortunately, I came away from this film more with more distasteful feelings about the film maker than the subject material, which is too bad. To me, this was a film about Michael Moore, Bully. The bullying personality type is pervasive in his work and life story, and distracts me from the serious topics that he wants to side with.Moore, and us viewers, would do well to remember Woody Allen's cautionary, sarcastic line from Annie Hall (1977) when he said "I'm a bigot, but it's OK, because I'm a bigot for the left."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this supposed to be education from Michael Moore ? Okay people prepare to be educated Moore sets himself up as some working class intellectual but the gist of this documentary is based on stats , half truths and most importantly of all - Points that seem to have been missed out on purpose For example BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE centres around " America's astronomical murder rate " insinuating that the murder rate in that country is head and above any other country when it's not . Moore misses out the fact that per head of population the USA doesn't have the world's highest murder rate . That unwanted record is held by Mexico . Both Colombia and South Africa have higher murder rates per head of population than the US . He also fails to point out that many American states do have gun bans . New York for example has a total hand gun ban and the penalty for having an automatic weapon there is life imprisonment . He doesn't come out and say that anyone , everywhere in America can pop into any shop and buy as many guns and as much ammo as they want , but he heavily suggests it which misleads the uninformedMoore also misses out other points about the American death tolls from murder . If you study American murder rates you'll see a clear connection between the American government banning things . For example the prohibition of alcholic drink in the 1920s led to a massive crime wave of killing as gangsters fought to take over the black market due to the drinks ban . As drugs started to flood into the cities of America in the 1960s the murder rate rose as people tried to muscle in on the hard drugs trade to the point where now many US cities are battle zones . It's not the fault of guns that so many people are murdered - It's the fault of drugs and the massive profits they generate that are leading to violence in America . This information doesn't seem to creep into Moore's hidden agenda . Of course if the American government of the day decided to legalise all drugs the gangs and dealers would become instantly disenfranchised , but this suggestion would seem to be too liberterian for Moore . We're also treated to a wonderful piece of hypocrisy by Moore when he mentions that on the day of the Columbine school massacre the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia reached its peak . You may remember that because the Serbs were engaged in a violent conflict against Islamic insurgents ( America is doing something very similar today in Iraq ) NATO decided to bomb the Serbs until they pulled their troops out of Kosovo . Moore seems to be against the bombing of Yugoslavia in this documentary . What he doesn't tell you is that the NATO airstrikes were under the command of Wesley Clark , the same Wesley Clark who later ran for the Democratic Presidential nomination and the same Wesley Clark WHO MOORE LATER BACKED FOR DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION !And being a Michael Moore documentary we are treated once again to Louis Armstrong's What A Wonderful World contrasting to images of human suffering. Moore has made a career out of this technique and it's not even his idea because he's stolen it from Barry Levinson in GOOD MORNING VietnamMy own opinion of BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is that it's polemical rubbish , uninformative and just plain misleading . I also found it stomach churning that Moore is awarded every film gong going because he makes documentaries centered around human tragedy . His fans will point out that Moore's advertising the fact that guns are responsible for a terrible death toll in which case I'll point out Moore is benefitting from this terrible death toll via this documentary and the praise and awards it received . I wonder how his fans feel about that as they rush out to watch his latest documentary or buy his latest book ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was amazed that this movie was so full of lies and nobody seem to notice! Do yourself a favor; after you watch the movie go to www.bowlingfortruth.com and get the rest of the story. When I first watched the movie I didn't notice all the creative editing and obvious lies. After doing some research (which there is a lot of info on this guy) I found out that he doctored up the movie to make the NRA appear to be awful people. He says that this movie isn't trying to point the finger at guns. After analyzing this "documentary" there is nothing else he could be blaming. Furthermore, he always has some petition or another on his website trying to get people to ban something firearm related. In all reality the is a anti-gun and anti-NRA movie. Moore tries to hide his agenda behind some creative scenes and fails miserably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nothing new to be learned here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film and it really has me puzzled. I expected it be an anti-gun film, and parts of it are, but Moore tells us he is a lifetime member of the NRA, so his point of view is not clear. If he thinks guns are so bad, then why is he an NRA member? The film is muddled, with Moore trying to make connections that are simply not there. For instance, he goes after K mart for the fact that their bullets were used at Columbine. How is this their fault? Blaming K mart for selling bullets that were used in a crime is like blaming Budweiser because someone drank their beer, drove a car and hit a pedestrian. In addition, Moore doesn't at all address where the shooters purchased their guns. That to me seems more important, as a responsible gun dealer would certainly think twice before selling guns to teenagers. There is a lot of footage of citizens target shooting, but the vast majority of people who enjoy the sport are not going to turn into violent criminals, so the connection is very tenuous, to say the least. Moore does make a valid point that America has a much higher rate of gun deaths than other countries that also allow gun ownership, but is not able to answer why this is so. The film doesn't really go anywhere. It's a bunch of interviews and images with no coherent message. At the end of this type of film, the viewer should be able to figure out what the filmmaker had to say. But I have no idea what he was trying to say (other than the obvious--like showing a rally that included signs saying "Guns and children don't mix." Well, duh!) I didn't learn anything new from watching this movie or gain any insight at all into Columbine or the larger problem of violence. If you aren't going to learn anything new from a documentary, then it's pretty much a wasted two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore Bowls Gutter Balls in Columbine Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moore Bowls Gutter Balls in Columbine Filmby Ari ArmstrongWhat are we to make of a documentary that claims to discuss violence in America, but fails to even mention a policy responsible for raising U.S. homicide rates at least 25%?At the end of his film Bowling for Columbine, director Michael Moore bowls a strike. Unfortunately, his film is less successful. He heaves mightily and knocks down a few pins, but he also rolls some gutter balls.Economist Jeffrey Miron of Boston University found "drug and alcohol prohibition have substantially raised the homicide rate in the United States over much of the past 100 years" by an estimated 25-75%. Why? Prohibition creates violent black markets. It's a simple theory supported by the evidence.So, in his rambling exploration of many other facets of violence in America, why does Moore completely ignore the domestic consequences of prohibition? Such an omission is inexcusable, and it indicates Moore's social agenda trumps any serious effort to come to grips with the problem.That said, at times Moore's work is chillingly poignant. During one segment, he shows frame after frame of botched U.S. foreign policy moves. The U.S. helps kill or otherwise remove one leader of a struggling nation, only to see the rise of an even worse leader. The U.S. has supported both Saddam Hussein and the Taliban, though in retrospect that support seems to have been unwise. Moore's critique of American "foreign entanglements" mirrors libertarian concerns.On the morning of the Columbine murders, Moore points out, President Clinton was on television announcing the latest American bombing raid in Kosovo. Just an hour later, Clinton was back on TV discussing the suburban terror. Is senseless violence on the personal level linked to the mass violence of the state? It's possible, but Moore doesn't demonstrate a causal connection.Shock-rocker Marilyn Manson continues this theme by pointing out the president has more influence than Manson does. Manson blames the "campaign of fear and consumption" constantly bombarding Americans. However, Manson's suggestion that his music is a healthy "escape" is as ludicrous as his critics' assertions that Manson's music somehow drives people to mayhem.Moore notes the Columbine killers also attended a morning bowling class, so why not blame bowling? Moore's comparison is silly, but he does raise the excellent point that people shouldn't look for scapegoats following a tragedy.Which brings us to another of Moore's gutter balls. Scapegoating is precisely what Moore does, only his victim is the American gun owner rather than Marilyn Manson.At one point, Moore places a picture of the young victim of the Buell school shooting against a ledge of Charlton Heston's house. Moore seems to think Heston is somehow to blame for the death, and he asks Heston to apologize.Moore also took a couple of Columbine victims to K-Mart and used media pressure to convince the chain to stop selling ammunition. He describes this as an "overwhelming victory." Yet his self-serving media stunt accomplished the same thing keeping Manson out of Denver accomplished: exactly nothing.In his incoherent badmouthing of corporations, Moore neglects to remind us that his film was released by a large corporation, his equipment was manufactured by corporations, and his work was advertised by corporate web pages and media outlets. This doesn't prove Moore's case is wrong, but it does prove he's not self-reflective.Moore offers some needed criticism of American media, especially television news programs. One person Moore interviews notes that, even as the American murder rate plummeted, television coverage of murders dramatically expanded, thus giving viewers a false impression of reality.Moore rightly rails against racism. Many white Americans have an irrational fear of black males, and this encourages a violent mindset. That's a needed criticism. Unfortunately, Moore seeks to replace bigotry against blacks with bigotry against gun owners.Many of my gun-owning friends are doctors, lawyers, professors, and professionals. Does Moore interview anybody representative of the American gun owner? Of course not. Does he interview any scholar who is an expert on crime and firearms, such as David Kopel, John Lott, Gary Kleck, or Don Kates? Of course not. To do so would be to treat the matter seriously rather than fan the flames of prejudice.Moore cites the gun-homicide statistics for a variety of countries with lower numbers than in the U.S., but he conveniently omits countries with more stringent gun laws and higher gun-homicide rates.He also ignores the fact that England's gun bans have been followed by an increase in violent crime there, including gun-related crime. All the evidence that demonstrates lawfully carrying a handgun or keeping a defensive gun in the home deters criminals is totally suppressed.Moore does wonder why Canada has a relatively high gun-ownership rate yet fewer murders. He concludes there is something wrong with American culture.He's right about that: there is something wrong. He rightly points to poverty and America's racist past as part of the problem, even though he looks to failed welfare schemes to solve poverty -- whereas libertarians look to repeal the government interventions (such as prohibition) that have perpetuated it.But Moore overstates his case. He thinks America is a nation of fear and paranoia. But in some ways he feeds into the same media frenzy he criticizes in his film. Yes, some Americans have problems with violence, bigotry, and paranoia. However, the vast majority of Americans, including the vast majority of American gun owners, lead basically responsible and healthy lifestyles. This basic fact seems not to assist Moore in his quixotic crusades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore does this country a great justice with this film. He exposes the crazy, ultra-militant underbelly of American culture without spreading a bunch of liberal-slanted accusations that would taint the message. In fact, he has several conservative moments, including one where he doffs his lifetime NRA membership card before Charlton Heston.Moore is quick to point out the paranoid American blame cycle that is the stain on our collective carpet. When bad things happen (or might happen) Americans are quick to single out the immediately convenient scapegoat, but are hardpressed to focus the microscope on the bigger picture of our progressively crumbling society. Especially as compares to other European nations and the relatively placid Canada, who are made out to be a paragon of virtue by comparison.Between this even-handed film and the fact that I was forced to sign my life over to Selective Service to obtain college funding, I have the funny feeling I'll be seeing the better side of the Great Lakes soon. And to add to this joy, Bowling for Columbine gives any rational thinker the fuel to stand up to the most bigoted, indoctrinated, flag-waving apple pie die for your government pigeon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore, he is not helping solve the problem, just making money from it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had so much about "Bowling for Columbine," so I was looking forward to seeing the film, and now that I have, it is a bitter disappointment. I thought that Moore would have something to say, but he doesn't and the way he puts this film together it seems that he doesn't want to find the answer.Moore likes to interview and ask people why there is violence in America. Does he ask any experts on this issue? Not that I saw.He tells us that the guns bought for use in Columbine were legally purchased, but news reports now reveal that they weren't. He doesn't tell us about how the two boys were ridiculed and picked on at school. Or go into why they finally did what they did. He just shows us the carnage, hoping to play on our emotional reaction, not a deep thought out response to violence in school and its causes.He tells us about a 6 year old girl shot by a boy in her class. Moore explains that the boy's mother was evicted for not being able to pay the rent, so they moved into a family member's house. In this house the boy finds the gun and later takes it to school. This film leads us to believe that the employer of the mother is at fault, and/or that the state should provide welfare indefinitely so mothers could stay home and never have to work. Again he goes to the emotional response. Moore would have us believe it is societies fault for not giving the mother money so she can not work.It is saddening to see a filmmaker of Moore's potential create such a useless film. Where many filmmakers of Moore notoriety would seek to solve problems or investigate the truth, Moore seeks to lay blame on distant, uninvolved parties to the crime (Moore would have us believe that Kmart and Dick Clark are the real bad guys).In the end, "Bowling for Columbine" allows Moore to do what he ridicules others in the film for doing: Making money and fame from youth violence. He helps no one in this film but himself. I wander if Moore donated all his profits from this film to study ways to help end youth violence, or did he just help himself?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all the talk about violence in America, the only number cited by Moore is the number of gun deaths per year in America. That is misleading for numerous reasons. A better comparison is total number of murders and other violent crime, because that is taking into account cases where guns are used defensively, where criminals wouldn't attempt to commit a crime due to the knowledge that their would-be victims might be able to shoot them. America has historically had high crime rates, while UK has historically had low crime rates. UK has recently passed the US in every category of violent crime except murder, and the gap in murders is shrinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dishonest as a documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Please note: The following review was written in 2002.*** What's the biggest problem facing US society today? This is the core question that filmmaker Michael Moore addresses in his quasi-satirical documentary about the American gun culture, Bowling for Columbine. But as the film tries to figure out why so many Americans shoot each other to death every year, watching it, I noticed a larger problem in American culture: the tendency to go to extremes. This - more than guns, poverty, the media, rock music, or bowling - is the single biggest problem that our neighbours to the south will have to address. And the film Bowling for Columbine never even saw it coming.You see, this could have been a great film if it stuck to merely asking the questions. It does a fantastic job of exposing just how nuts the "gun nuts" really are. At times it is funny - for example, when members of the Michigan Militia state, completely straight-faced, that anyone who does not own a gun is irresponsible. At times it is horrifying - such as when the school shootings at Columbine High were shown from tape captured by a security camera. At all times it is provocative, and it raises most of the important questions relating to guns, the NRA, and the extreme right, to whom nothing is more sacred than the second-amendment "right to bear arms" - not even life itself.Instead, however, Michael Moore attempts to impose some of his own answers. And that's where this film loses its way. I hate guns, granted, and I have serious problems with the extreme right. But that doesn't make me any fan of the extreme left, either. The problem is that Moore injects his own social agenda and, frankly, quite radical politics into this film in a subtle, manipulative way that made me feel somewhat used.Moore issues blanket critiques of US foreign policy and of government, corporations, and the media in general. Using logic as ingenious as it is fallacious, Moore attempts to link gun violence to racism and oppression of blacks by the media, to all US war and aggression, and even to the state of Michigan's "Welfare to Work" program. The main problem is that the answers this film tries to provide fail to fit the questions it asks. Why is the American society so violent? We don't know, but clearly Moore doesn't either. And in a movie that is loved by worldwide audiences for its America-bashing more than anything else, it seems dishonest for Moore not to be up front about his underlying agenda. Leftist social criticism is presented as the logical alternative to gun ownership. Paradoxically, the movie does not seem to conclude - as is suggested by its anti-NRA stance and opening position - that guns are to blame for violence. At times, he even seems to imply the opposite. At one point, in an effort to support his claim that Americans have created an irrational, unjustified "culture of fear", Moore cites a statistic that in the past decade, crime has dropped while gun ownership has increased. But... look at that the other way: doesn't that mean that there are more guns and less crime? I thought the point was to show that the gun culture is to blame for the high homicide rates.Of course, that isn't the point at all. A favourite NRA slogan is that "guns don't kill people; people kill people". Moore's version of that one should be "guns don't kill people; Republicans, government, the media, evil corporations, globalization, and capitalism kills people". How is this anything other than another way to pass the buck? Marilyn Manson may not be at fault. Bowling is in the clear. But rich people are all evil, of course.The bottom line is, everyone comes away from this film realizing that the gun fanatics are nuts. I have no problem with being asked to accept that the extreme right has problems. I do have a problem being asked to accept that the only solution is to move to the extreme left. There's a happy medium out there, and Moore isn't it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muddled, and often obnoxious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm probably taking on an impossible task here. I am generally in support of an armed citizenry, and I have never liked Michael Moore, yet I aim to criticize "Bowling for Columbine" apart from these general views, in the sense that it fails as a documentary by not encouraging much real curiosity or real reflective sympathy.To begin with, his framing of the central questions is way off the mark, juxtaposing rare events involving children against an imposing number of American murders that reflects very different phenomena. Even at the number itself, bells should be ringing: he uses a raw count rather than a per capita figure, and all of the other countries he mentions have populations substantially lower than the U.S. Yes, the U.S. still has a substantially higher rate, but that doesn't justify using a totally irrational comparison in the service of rhetoric. But just as bad is the idea, implicit throughout the film, that gun deaths are spread more-or-less evenly throughout the U.S. population. The supposed contrasts with Canadians were a real jaw-dropper for me. Kids that play violent games and don't want to really hurt people? Folks leaving their doors unlocked *in the daytime*? Jeez, every place I have lived in the U.S. (except Washington, D.C.) I have known quite a few people to leave their doors unlocked *at night*! What kind of mental realm is Moore living in? The real fact is that, contrary to the stereotypes held by many Europeans, most people in the U.S., rich, middle class, and poor, are extremely safe. The problem we should really be addressing is not why "we" are so much more violent than "them", but why a few places in this country are nothing short of war zones. That goes to gangs, racial hatred, and inevitably to the disastrous War on Drugs. Moore barely touches on this. My point here is not to argue against him (which is precisely what I would want a documentary to inspire), but to illustrate the serious lack of thought that underlies this film.The one person who comes off worse than Moore is Charlton Heston, who quite simply seems like a ghoul. Either Moore has done an utterly unethical hatchet-job of their discussion, or Heston is completely incompetent. I don't care if you're ambushed coming out of the shower at 5 am: if you're a freaking spokesman for the NRA, you should be prepared to argue that firearms ownership by law-abiding citizens saves lives and reduces crime, not just spout some God-given rights crap that evokes zero sympathy from most viewers. When Moore shows a picture of the little girl shot by her classmate, you should be able to show him the kids that don't have mothers because they were beaten to death by crazy ex-boyfriends, with no realistic means to defend themselves. Whether Moore or Heston has more to blame, very little of the substantive pro-gun view is raised in the film.The people that come off extremely well are Trey Parker (or is is the other one?) and Marilyn Manson, both of whom show the kind of deep human sympathy that Moore fakes badly to cover his obnoxiously self-righteous viciousness. I personally wish, instead of using Columbine in rhetorical support of very muddled thinking on guns, that a film would have concentrated more on the mentality of the Columbine shooters and victims, reflecting the serious social problems in a typical high school experience, and the effects of alienation in general. But I know Michael Moore would have ruined that movie too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rings obviously false to a Canadian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scenes shot in Sarnia, Windsor and Toronto, Canada have provoked much conversation in Canada. These scenes epitomize both the problem and the strength of BFC, that is, the sense is correct but the details often exaggerated. While the received notion that Canada is less violent than the US is accurate, we are catching up in a hurry. And people do lock their doors, at night anyway. In Toronto's current (Nov. 2003) mayoralty election, increasing street violence and crime is a major issue. When Moore asks Heston, "Why do other countries have so much less gun violence than the US?" Did you catch his brief answer? He says, "They will". Whatever is causing the problem, the U.S. is on the leading edge of the curve, but other countries are catching up.That said, I give Moore credit for provoking conversation, for his humour (in spots). His lack of balance doesn't concern me. I can find my own balance, thank goodness for dissent and free speech. I also think that Moore is restrained in drawing conclusions in the film, which is a great strength of the film, in provoking discussion, and allowing people to express their own opinions.Finally, Moore is way off on Marilyn Manson. Moore is careful to say that there is no direct causal relationship between Lockheed and the Columbine assassins - it's a mentality thing. Isn't the connection between Manson and teenage suicide/ violence much more palpable than Moore's connection of Lockheed &amp; Columbine.** UPDATE in Nov. 2005 - regarding Toronto, the score is Heston 1 Moore 0.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine is a documentary that is both extremely funny and depressing. We live in a nation of millions of handguns, but that isn't actually what disturbs Moore. What does is that we so constantly fire them at each other. Canada has a comparable percentage of guns to citizens, but a 10th of the shooting deaths. What causes us to kill so many more of one another than they do other developed nations? Moore, the spirited everyman reactionary, makes clear that he's an ex-sharpshooting counselor and a long-standing affiliate of the NRA. However, Moore has grown out of his youthful penchant for guns. In Bowling for Columbine, moreover, he is not so certain of the bottom line as in the popular Roger &amp; Me, a film in which he saw who the bad guys were, and why. Here he asks questions he can't answer, such as why we as a nation feel so scared, such an urge for the consolation of guns. Observing that we relish urban legends meant to make us scared of strangers, Moore observes how TV news concentrates on local violence and says that while the murder rate is down 20 percent in America, TV coverage of violent crime is up 600 percent.This vital and stimulating documentary is rated R, so that the Columbine killers would have been guarded from the violent images, mainly of themselves. The MPAA maintains its custom of forbidding teenagers from seeing those films they're most justified in seeing. What imaginary realm do the clockwork uniforms of the ratings board believe they are preserving? I do sometimes wonder how we should expect the ratings system should be run, but it's publicly declared to just be an optional industry system that nobody's obligated to abide. Alas, the rating ranked to a film on the whole shapes who sees it in a theater, and what kind of marketing and publicity for the movie will be agreed to by TV and newspapers.Moore's consideration isn't limited to the dramatic ceremonies he captures to describe his misgivings. He goes various times to Columbine High School, at one point showcasing harrowing security-camera footage of the bloodbath. And Columbine motivates Moore to acquaint us with two surviving students shot at Columbine, both still with bullets lodged in them. He clarifies that all of the Columbine bullets were readily retailed to the teenage killers by Kmart, at 17 cents apiece. And then he takes the two targets to Kmart headquarters to return the bullets for a refund. This is ingenious showmanship and would appear to be convincing for the uncomfortable Kmart public relations spokespeople, who squirm and dodge in front of Moore's callous camera. But then, on Moore's third visit to headquarters, he is told that Kmart will consent to totally diminish the sale of ammunition. Incredibly for him, he's speechless.The movie is a collage of Moore encounters and accessory clips and shots. One bit that sears to the bone is from a classic stand-up routine by Chris Rock, who professes that our issue could be resolved by just raising the price of bullets, taxing them like cigarettes. Rather than 17 cents apiece, why not $5,000? "There would be no innocent bystanders!" Moore purchases a Star Map to locate Charlton Heston, rings the bell on his gate, and is welcomed back for an interview. But Heston is evidently unaware of Moore's M.O., and his responses to Moore's questions are pretty hopeless. Heston not long after disclosed that he had signs of Alzheimer's disease, but there is no evidence in this footage that he was enfeebled. It's just that he cannot give reason why he, as a man living behind a gate in a safeguarded community, with security patrols, who has never felt himself in danger, requires a loaded gun in the house. Heston is just as ineffective when asked if he believes it was admirable or decent for him to speak at an NRA rally in Denver 10 days after Columbine.Bowling for Columbine thinks we have way too many guns, don't require them, and are shooting each other at senseless proportions. Moore cannot select a culprit to answer for this reality, since it appears to arise from a country's urge to be armed. Early on, he tours a bank that's handing out guns to people who open new accounts. He questions a banker whether it isn't sort of risky to have all these guns in a bank. Not one bit. The bank, Moore finds, is a licensed gun dealership. I still can't figure that one out.</fullReview>

In my opinion you have to look at it in a much broader perspective. Why where the boys that did this horrible act like they where. Was it bad parenting? Was it the School system? Was it movies or videogames? Was it peer pressure? I can go on forever...

		<shortDescription>Very interesting for Americans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a special interest for Americans who are not used to see such direct documentary-making on social issues. The question why Americans are using more guns than Canadians is simple to answer: the Canadians had no civil war. In the American Civil War between 1860 and 1865 the Americans lost more human lives than the total of all their wars in which they participated, the W.W. II and the Vietnam war included. After 1865 the conquest of the West started and all those soldiers of the Confederation (a lot of Texans) or the Union who could not find work charged the West with their guns, their rifles and their violence. To this you can add the thousands of immigrates who started to come up during the second half of the 19th century. The West was conquered at a moment when the jurisdiction had to be build up after the civil war. You needed a weapon to protect yourself against snakes, Indians and a lot of thieves that vagabonded in the mid-west. Those circumstances did not exist in Canada where there was no civil war. Michael Moore is good in asking questions to the people and in making laughable old stars like Charlton Heston but when it comes up to give the right answers, he seems to be less illuminated. His editing is negligent as he mixes sentimentality and serious documentary-making. Perhaps he just wanted to shock the Americans, but than he should not have the pretension of insinuating that he has all the answers when he has not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is certainly worth seeing, yet I feel it should have been re-edited to leave out some parts that were quite misleading. There is dramatic tension between the good parts and the major falsehoods in this film. The good parts reveal a surprising amount to a thinking viewer, such as when the spokespersons for "the other side" are allowed to speak freely. The major falsehoods occur when the filmmaker jumps to conclusions or mixes exaggeration and satire with very sober (and sobering) facts. These 'falsehood scenes' (which I am talking' about) are sometimes humorous sketches and sometimes editorial comments by Moore. Unfortunately, Moore is truly, truly not an expert and that is probably why, several times, he offers botched conclusions and hack history. An example of the falsehoods: a short cartoon film about American history where paranoid early Pilgrims in America proceed to shoot all the nice Indians and then the Pilgrims go on to burn each other as witches. My understanding is that burning witches ended in Europe and did not cross the ocean. Also, that cartoon film fairly strongly implied that paranoia is something the "white" people have and the other colors did not. Sorry, but I am not going to name all the errors. I simply claim that historical rigor would oppose several of Moore's main points.The film is worth watching but with a disclaimer:"This film is not a reliable source of detailed background information or analysis but conveys almost an hour of good, worthwhile data about its chosen subject."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Michael Moore were any more to the left he would live in Havana or Communist China. He is most amusing and very entertaining. He is so biased and so off the wall that one rally needs to see his work to understand how the `far left' thinks and operates in America. Everyone will agree that Children killing children is wrong, but what Comrade Moore never asks and will not admit is that the founding fathers were concerned that a strong Federal Government should not have absolute power over its people. The second amendment is there to project the citizens from the Federal Government. Guns are not the problem, people are the problem. He shows this with his trip to Canada. They have nearly as many guns per capita as the US but they have a different mindset and therefore have virtually no killings with guns. Instead of banning guns and (His preference) ammunition he could look for ways to change the mindset of the population here in the States.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Propaganda that Fails to Make a Coherent Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some plot spoilers ahead.This movie is very overrated, with a great deal of critics and viewers heaping praise on this film, calling it profound and a wake up call to the United States' culture of violence and fear. This movie is much less a documentary than a propaganda piece. Moore is simply an angry firebrand trying to rally the troops to his cause. Nowhere does Moore make a coherent point about why the United States is a particularly violent country in comparison to the rest of the world. Whenever he raises a point that the US has a high murder rate, he counters this with an argument that the media exaggerate violence; for example, he argues that the Los Angeles news media focus on prominent stories of violence in South Central Los Angeles, when in reality that place might not be so violent. He contradicts himself here, unless he is arguing that media descriptions of violence perpetuate fear which in turn begets violence. If so, he never clarifies this theory.Viewers should be very careful about the statistics that Moore posts in his film, and must be view them with a skeptical mind, as movies, unlike books, cannot footnote their references. Examples of Moore's description of facts include his timeline of the US government's patronage of violent regimes in Latin America and the Middle East, as well as his short cartoon about the history of the NRA and the KKK. Clearly, Moore has no pretense to objective criticism, and this is especially obvious when you see crazy gun nuts helping to light a cross with a Klansman.Another problem with Moore's analysis is that he focuses on examples of extraordinary violence, such as the Columbine school massacre and the Oklahoma City bombing. Moore is, in essence, following the same form of analysis that he criticizes the media for doing. He would have been better served by speaking with college sociology and political science professors, policemen, and gun owners, who might have provided intelligent discourse on the nature of American violence, rather than celebrities, such as Marylin Manson and Charlton Heston, or the brother of Oklahoma City bomber Terry Nichols.This movie is not all bad. Moore does have an intelligent conversation with a USC sociology professor, which is the movie's high point. Viewers of the much superior "Roger and Me" may be left pondering why Moore has decided to return to Flint and focus on an incident where one preschooler killed another. He may or may not see Flint as a microcosm of the United States as a whole. His style of editing is quite entertaining, as is the clip of Chris Rock commenting on gun violence.If you understand that Moore has an extremely blatant political agenda, by all means watch this movie. Those who want an objective analysis of violence in America may find Moore's polemics very difficult to swallow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bowling for Columbine takes you on a journey!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore doesn't simply astound us with his quick humor and his dark conclusions, he offers us a passage through the messy business of fascination of arms and goes to the core of human need for violence.Many Charleston Heston fans were appalled with Moore's direct attack on the Hollywood good guy, but I wouldn't let fan love compromise the films message and its power. Recently this year more rampant psychotic attacks made innocent victims out of bystanders in a cinema, and the first thing that came to my mind was Bowling for Columbine.He corroborates his tale with many evidence, a bunch of testimonials and the best use of advertising I've seen in years, yet of course his views are one sided, facts are there for media workers to toy with them as they want, his attacks on a specific American party and its policy are ruthless, his despise for the Bush administration even worse, his belief about sending a message and shocking his viewers in the trademark scene where he protests, always in the final scenes of the movie, is idealistic to boot... yet its impossible not to feel plagued by it. Marilyn Manson's appearance was one of the films highlights for me, along with the South Park creator's talk with Moore and the South Parks American History animation. Hilarious and genius! His ways of criticizing our moralistic and cynic approach to the 'causes' of rampant shootings takes you to a deep analysis of our habit to point fingers at music, parenting, social background, everything except the examples we are fed everyday that is set by our countries and our leaders Because lets face it: violence has no party, it takes no sides, and that not only according to the film's writer, director, producer, but according to my personal point of view and James Holmes just keeps reminding people of how America makes money while facilitating the work of criminals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kids Aren't All Right..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess. I saw this film again for the third time -most of the blame is on the Batman's f**king issue- but I never reviewed "Bowling..." I though there was enough saying about that on 2003 or so.But then, I sincerely had to make a statement of my own. Here it goes....This is not a movie, neither a documentary...It's a humanistic way of thinking. Any film made almost ten years ago couldn't be such a thought- provoking smash as Bowling For Columbine is. It isn't about the comparison of criminal rates in several countries (we know.. statistics are some kind of mathematical lie). It's not about how fears constructs societies (even nowadays with the power in which mass media stands). It's about non-sense/no humanistic way of living in the name of profit. It's about how we, the real expendables, deal in this kind of revolting subculture of violence and poverty and deceit. Our madness as "Homo" subspecies... "Bowling" stills being a shock ten years later. It still stands tall as a documentary, and should be shown on every corner of the street.As a documentary it may have some flaws, but at the end of the movie I thought I wish I had the fuc**ng balls Michael Moore showed when Bowling For Columbine was rolled. His achievement should be celebrated, in spite of all the technical criticism we the home-cinema geeks could wield, or do. I strongly recommend it for those who haven't seen this gem yet. You see, it's not like we are talking about "Green Lantern" here.. BFC's kind of film plots are the spinal cord of what we are as a society. And I mean worldwide. I really do believe so, and that is why, no matter how many flaws BFC has (and there are little ones, anyway), I give it a 10. And if this film does not give you even a spark of thinking about it... well...shame on you, my human brother.Who dares to face this kind of statements anyways? We should viralize these thoughts; maybe the change are WE. Despite politics, I mean individually. I hope we have the urge to worry about how we manage our anger issues, our criminals, our very lives. Bowling for Columbines is a must. Wherever you live, whatever you think, whoever you are.I said it, a 10. Thank you, Michael Moore.Cheers from Argentina (and sorry for my crappy English).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>difference feeling about guns in the US and China</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Michael Moore's documentaries. Bowling for Columbine seems a little successful than Fahrenheit 9/11 for me. The background is the shooting violence affair in Columbia High School. Michael figured it out through different attitude of US citizens about this violence affair. He made issues of guns as the original problem in US violence. In my personal opinion, this movie revealed that people transit a mood of insecurity. And all these bad things came from guns. Due to the idea throughout seemed to be the inherent evil with guns it was obvious from the questions asked that this isn't really true. Maybe there is a possibility, which shows American gun culture that people have their right and freedom to protect themselves, even they have power to fight against government in order to press somebody powerful. As a Chinese, I think if this gun-allowed policy was used in China, it will be a worse trouble, since Chinese government was controlled by only one party, their policy serviced for themselves, there are a lot of unstable things in society. If people have right to use guns, killing will happen everywhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The documentary argues about the most problematic existent issue of the American Society-Gun Control. Guns are not a problem, supported by the fact that Canada have 8 Million guns, and yet a low death rate by guns. the problem is in the violent people. After the Columbine incident, the violent behavior was blamed upon Violent video games, Goth culture, Violent history, Parents, and such. but in my view i don't think it really matters. sure i play a lot of violent video games but it dosen't mean ill go out n shoot some people. the root cause of such behavior is the society i guess. coz the society classifies children as children with a bright future and those who'll be labors. it compels you in thinking that ull not have a future if you're not bright or good at school, which instills a sense of worthlessness into them, making them feel unimportant,filling rage, violence, and hatred towards people. also parents play a big role in child development. and government should look ways to improve the society. proper rules should be there. finally this documentary does makes a case for itself in spite of its criticism, this should oblige government into taking some responsibility and actions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharp question, unclear answer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The question of this film is just fascinating. After leaving the cinema, my girlfriend and I were sitting for about two hours discussing the issues. This means, the subject is great. However, I have troubles in telling what answer is given in the film to the question. Maybe this(?): there is an upper class, i. e. the whites, the politics and the weapon producers who oppress the lower class. But I did not see any clear connection leading from the class/racial struggle to the murders.The problem may be that no more statistics was shown than just the mere number of murders. Who is the typical murderer? Who the typical victim? This was not explored in the movie in more depth. Just one case of mass killing was chosen. Is it typical or rather an exception? No information on this. I tend to assume that that was not the typical U.S. murder.The good thing is that the movie is entertaining and intelligent, despite the serious subject. The best part of the movie for me was the director's trip to Canada.Overall: fascinating question, clearly put. But no real answers.Let me argue a bit with the film, because some details were really ridiculous to me, when the maker tried to put his leftish ideas at any cost, whether they are relevant for the weapon issue or not. Coming from a country with a mostly state run health care, I could not help smiling bitterly over the scene, where a man coming from a doctor proudly declares that he has not paid anything for the medical treatment. Neither do I often. The other side of the "free" health care is that (1) you are no customer for the doctor, just a beggar and (2) for such "free" state "services" I pay about 45% tax on income, 22% VAT on everything and many other excize taxes...And the oh so moving scenes, how people have to go by bus to work and earn just 8,50 USD per hour? In most regions of my country people are happy to get some job for 1,50 USD per hour and they have to pay for land, houses, cars and consumer goods basically the same price as everywhere else. And they do not kill anybody because of it, they are happy to earn the money. So, this was not impressive at all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of Michael Moore or his documentaries before I saw this movie. Needless to say, I really had no idea what to expect, except that it may have something to do with Columbine. What I was treated to was an involving documentary about gun violence in America which struck nearly every emotion in my body.Unlike other documentaries I've seen, like Hoop Dreams, this one tended to change the atmosphere and mood, instead of merely staying serious the entire time. At times, Moore was hillarious. At other times, I was on the verge of tears. There were also some notable moments where I was about to jump out of my seat in disbelief. Even though his interviews are innocent in nature, he is usually always successful in exposing supposed experts as not really being experts at all. Nobody can seem to explain what causes Americans to be so violent.I won't go into the ligistics of this movie because I feel it better explains itself. My recommendation for anyone is to see it the first chance you get. I feel Moore did an excellent job in addressing the problem and in searching for a solution. Unless you have a grudge with the director as some people do, I really feel you will enjoy this film.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's wrong with America?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine is perhaps the most honest and truthful documentary I have seen in a longe time. Michael Moore manages to debunk the myth that Americans are a righteous people. He does this by pointing to numerous references in American history where the government has overthrown regimes in favor of dictators and other militant groups. At the heart of his argument, however, is gun control. Moore poses the question: Why does Canada have a much lower death rate due to gun violence than the United States when Canadians seem to have the same obsession with guns? Moore points out that roughly 12000 deaths occur in America as opposed to the few hundred in Canada.To answer this question, Moore goes to Canada, where he talks to ordinary citizens. As one student remarks, Americans seem to want to fight over everything instead of talk things out. Perhaps, as Moore suggests, there is something wrong with the very framework our country is built upon.An interview with Charleton Heston, the President of the NRA, is shocking. What he answers to Moore's proposed question will astonish many.Overall, it is satisfying that rational and clear-headed individuals such as Moore still exist.</fullReview>

There is only one negative thing I can think of about this documentary, and even this could be considered a plus. While Moore criticises the media in the US for creating a perception of constant danger among the public, he himself creates a similar emotion. While I was watching this movie, I found myself seriously considering leaving the theater and moving to Canada. But like I said, you can consider this a plus of the film as well, since it practically illustrates one of its major points. As a final remark, seeing the footage of GWB, I could not help being reminded once again of a quote from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy that "anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I arrived at Waterloo's Princess Cinema (the only theatre currently showing the film in the area) this evening anticipating an insightful documentary similar to Moore's other work, but targeting the weapons industry. What I found was so much more. This film, more than any other of Moore's past projects, delves deep into questioning American values, and isn't afraid to tell the honest, down-to-earth truth about what's wrong with the system. Instead of simply focusing on guns, Moore paints a broader picture of the problems that plague the USA today. We see a culture of fear, violence, intolerance and greed. We see how the media is a tool used by anyone, be it the government or big business, who has the power to do so. We also see that more often than not, things are not how they appear. I was very moved by the time it was over. Three cheers and 10/10 for Michael Moore and his outstanding willingness to tell it like it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A number of reviewers here have commented upon Bowling for Columbine's lack of concrete solutions. I honestly don't think that was the point of the film. If you recall Moore's Roger And Me, there didn't seem to be any grand set of solutions that would cure Flint's malaise; the point was simply to highlight the issue and get people talking about it.As someone who has eaten at that Taco Bell in Sarnia a few times, I grew up very close to the U.S. border and watched "Channel 7 Action News" as a kid -- stabbing on the east side of Detroit, triple-homicide on the west side, and so on. Moore's Canadian subjects have fairly typically Canadian attitudes; as the blue-haired and pierced teenager suggested, Canadians are big on negotiation and not so big on war-making. This couldn't be, of course, much farther from American foreign policy (which I think Moore nails right between the eyes, if you'll pardon the pun).I found the NRA lifetime member from Flint's review of this film particularly interesting to read -- it starts out very positive, but falls into the clich&amp;eacute; of calling Moore a "leftist" and "socialist." Is Sarnia mayor Mike Bradley a left-wing commie nut by suggesting taking care of the elderly and the young is one of the cornerstones of building a solid community? I think not. This same reviewer also felt that Moore had somehow implied "the CIA gave millions to the billionaire bin-Laden and taught al-Qaeda how to fly planes into buildings" -- I never made that leap of logic, and I'm sure very few of my fellow audience members attempted to. All of the quickie facts juxtaposed over Louis Armstrong's "What A Wonderful World" are true; it's up to the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions, and that's what that particular reviewer thought s/he picked out... but those thousands of dead Nicaraguans ain't coming back, that's for sure (in the only World Court-proven case of state-sponsored terrorism in history; the American government merely pooh-poohed the verdict and continued its Thousand Points of Light and whatnot).I also think reviewers that saw this film as somewhat unfavourable are quibbling over minute details. Yes, the photo of Kayla Rowland was a bit emotionally manipulative; and yes, the quickie of Dick Clark in an SUV was a tad underhanded, but I believe these to be very minor flaws in an otherwise excellent piece of work. Overall, however, Moore's film made great connections between pop culture, violence, guns, history, suburbia, and racism, to name a few. Bravo, yet again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine is all at once funny, intelligent, thought provoking, sad, heartbreaking, incendiary, scathing, touching, and scary. This is a documentary with a lot to say about a lot of things (most notably guns and violence in the media and the US's culture of fear and paranoia) and should be required viewing for every single citizen in this country who claims to give a damn. Be warned, some of the images from the Columbine massacre and other horrific events are very very disturbing, but Moore, the master film maker juxtaposes them with hilarious political cartoons (I especially loved the piece about the History of America) and images from campy militia recruitment videos, toy gun commercials, bowling footage, and everything from South Park to Marilyn Manson videos. Hands down the most sobering piece was the montage of American foreign policy decisions that make us look like the worst terrorists (or depending how you view it, police) in the world. The most hopeful segment was the successful campaign to stop KMart from selling firearm ammunition. While this movie is doing bang up business for a documentary and has the sweet aroma of Oscar buzz, I fear that most of middle America (the ones who should really see it) will not, and only radical right wingers looking for more ammunition, or liberal leftists looking for more support of their ideas will go see this film, which leaves poor Michael Moore preaching to both his enemies and the already converted. 10/10.An aside: Was anyone like me more disturbed by Dick Clark dodging the cameras than the Charlton Heston interview at the end?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Riveting filmmaking once again by Mr. Moore...granted it's unabashedly liberal in it's bias, 30 minutes too long and a bit all-over-the-map thematically, but it works. I expected a anti-gun control movie in the manner of "Roger and Me" and while it does touch on that quite a bit and although either side of the gun control issue can be debated, "Columbine" does a better job on focusing on our rapidly declining culture of fear and violence, especially that espoused by the media (liberal as it may be). While Moore may argue for better gun control, he's not for abolishment, rather he asks us to look at ourselves and our country from a different perspective to see what's gone wrong...and while sometimes that perspective can be laugh-out-loud funny, more often than not it's both frightening and disturbing. Kudos for making a film that exposes our weaknesses as a nation and as people...and makes you think about yourself and your place in our society...even if the answers aren't what we always want to hear. As for me I'm still trying to figure out how Moore got Charlton Heston to agree to let him interview him...it's quite possibly the most embarrassing performance ever put to film (although Dick Clark doesn't fare much better in a brief cameo).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore outdid his initial triumph (Roger &amp; Me) with this exciting film that takes viewers for quite a ride. Guest appearances by "Southpark" co-creator and Marilyn Manson give articulate, insightful commentaries on modern American society and contrast the not-so-articulate appearances of Charleton Heston and reluctant Dick Clark.A brilliant montage of footage includes scenes that made me laugh so hard. Others in the audience clapped and filled the theater with laughter. In the moments when real people showed grief for the tragedies in this country, the collective emotion in the theater was palpable.Always an appropriate song in the background, whether alternative or blues, the soundtrack is full of amazing tunes that enhance the overall experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been less than a week, now, since another lamebrained mother****er walked into a school and started shooting (this time, in Newtown, Conneticut). We're told that there have been more than 60 "mass shootings" like this since Columbine. This one was particularly heinous because the goofball murdered 20 children along with 6 adults. Maybe it's because I grew up idolizing men like Bruce Lee and Muhammad Ali (and, yes, Charlton Heston) that I've always thought of guns as a coward's weapon. As we've seen over the years, even a five-year-old can pull a trigger; does that make that five-year-old a Man in any sense of the word? Not in my book. I tried for nearly 3 decades to interest newspaper syndicates (as well as a local magazine) in a comic strip I'd conceived which featured an arms manufacturer whose goal was to wipe out super heroes (because super heroes made guns passe). I've been told that "it's been done already." Whatever. What I can't figure out, though, is this: what are we as a nation so afraid of...?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore Strikes Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The two high school students made infamous for their rampage at Columbine were rumored to have been at a bowling class at the school the morning of the shooting. It turned out to be urban legend, but Moore kept the catchy title, anyway. There seems to be no in between in regards to the filmmaker. I flat out love his work, all the way back to Roger and Me, and his TV shows, TV Nation and The Awful Truth. Here he takes on the NRA and Charleton Heston, or Moses, as he is best remembered, as he was the chief spokesman for the gun rights organization. As a gun owner, living in a secluded area, even I recognize the need for proper screenings and some restrictions on firearms. As usual, Moore uses sardonic humor to make his point. At a bank in Colorado, he is given a hunting rifle for purchasing a CD. As he leaves the bank with the weapon, he asks, don't you think it's a little dangerous handing out guns at a bank? The high point is when Moore interviews Heston, asking him about the high level of gun violence, and Chuck answers that the reason is "race mixing" in America. This was seen by some as an ambush; I see it as Moore capturing the actors true feelings, and they are frightening. RIP Charlie boy. Bowling for Columbine is both informative and entertaining, and Moore is our best documentary filmmaker. Look out, Dittoheads, the truth hurts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is no doubt that Moore is a skilled documentarian who uses his talent for the greater good of (American) society.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine is every bit about gun culture in America as it is about the big man himself. The film, a Palme d'Or nominee and Oscar-winning documentary, takes a scathing view of examples of violence, racism, and poverty as embedded in the fabric of American society. Some are hidden, away from media glare, so as to preserve the very nature that America is a nation of political freedom, social equality, and economical prowess. The rest are manipulated by the government, authorities, leading organizations, and media to create fear that is non-existent.Bowling for Columbine takes two seemingly unrelated elements ? bowling and Columbine High School ? and establishes not so much of a link but rather tries to find a convincing answer to the madness of school shootings. Was the Columbine shooting an unfortunate and isolated incident, or was it a tragic symptom of a growing trend of improbable violence among (but not limited to) youths? In that light, Moore asks a more important question: Why does it happen so often in the US? The statistic shown in the film is chilling. More than ten thousand people are murdered each year in the US as compared to about sixty in Britain.In his film, Moore interviews people from gun addicts to the survivors of the Columbine shooting. He goes to Canada and finds to his (and our) astonishment that most Canadians do not lock their doors. Aren't they scared that someone might drop in and shoot them? That is a quite likely scenario considering that Canadian youths have a daily staple of violence in popular culture i.e. movies and video games, and that anyone with a license is able to purchase a weapon from the local store. Yet, the most puzzling thing is: Why do Americans kill so much more frequently than their immediate neighbors? Bowling for Columbine is powerful and biting, yet it is also very entertaining. Midway in the film, Moore includes a short animated sequence that tells of America's violent history. It is funny but so very true. Moore brings his documentary down to the level of the masses, but retains his ability to provoke raw emotions in viewers. Whether this is audience manipulation should be left to another day of debate; there is no doubt that Moore is a skilled documentarian who uses his talent for the greater good of (American) society.Perhaps the most uplifting sequence in Bowling for Columbine is the one involving K-mart and two Columbine survivors (both of whom have "K-mart" bullets stuck in their bodies). Moore, now a social activist, instigates a movement to stop the selling of ammunitions at all K-mart outlets in the US, and succeeds. By the end of the film, Moore controversially turns into an ultra-moralist. He asks tough questions of Charlton Heston, famous film actor and President of the National Rifle Association, who is clearly very uncomfortable for most of the interview.Bowling for Columbine is one of Moore's best works. Even though some of his tactics are questionable, we should admire him for his relentless probing of important issues in American society. His quest to use film as a medium to launch stinging enquiries has led him to excellent films like Sicko (2007), and Capitalism: A Love Story (2009). He represents the voice of a voiceless nation, and he does his job with enthusiasm and minimum fuss. Whether you like him or not, he is definitely here to stay.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Documentary by Michael Moore about the NRA and America's fascination with guns. Much of the footage deals with Columbine and the case in which a 6 year old boy shot to death a 6 year old girl. It all culminates in an interview with the head of the NRA Charlton Heston.Riveting, chilling, hilarious and absolutely incredible movie despite what your views are on the gun issue. Moore's views are definitely anti-gun but he does try to show the opposite side also. Moore questions why there are so many killings in America by guns and almost none in other countries. He gives no real answers to this question but he raises a lot of interesting points and theories. I walked out of the theatre very shaken but, in a way, exhilirated. This is truly a great documentary.I'm not going to review this fully--it's a movie you should see for yourself. A definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bigoted and populist but not all of it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a thought-provoking documentary that fell into the trap that bedevils many "controversial" documentaries. It is not presented as an unravelling of the truth but as a series of arguments to back a foregone conclusion. We all know Moore's religious, social, anti-corporate bent but by his own admission he lives in a million dollar home in NYC. He argues what we expect him to argue and no-one can accuse him of not presenting it humorously (very, in the first 30 min) and with much rhetorical force. Indeed the climb-down that he forces Wal-Mart into is extraordinary and worth the whole film. However, he mixes cause and effect in the most duplicitous way. He implies that the welfare for work programme is to blame for the death of a six-year old child at the hands of another. My parents have left for work every day for as long as I can remember for work at between 6 and 7 in the morning and I have never felt the slightest inclination to take a gun to school. Europe is living proof of that fact that large-scale state funding of just about anything, including welfare doesn't work. Look at Europe's pensions and National Health fiascos; financial time-bombs that will blow society apart. He implies that the presence of a Lockheed-Martin base in Columbine is indirectly to blame for the aggressive gun culture that resulted in the Columbine massacre. He neglects to say that it is the largest employer in the town and in some measure responsible for it's survival. He also implies that the bellicose nature of United State's politicians is to blame for this US gun culture and he trots out the usual litany of US blunders. To be sure the US has been less than perfect in its international interventions but lately its record is much, much better. Moore mentions Kosovo and the civilians that were killed. What he does not mention, again selecting the facts he reveals with care in order to support his thesis, is that, first, this intervention was done against the wishes of the UN and secondly, that it resulted in the saving of millions of Muslims, mark that Muslims, lives. Another moment in US history that no one mentions is the Cuban missile crisis. Had not the US spent considerable amounts on defence and the weapons that Moore so decries and had the strength and the bravery to out-stare the Russians the outcome would have been very different and Moore's life and that of the rest of us would be much altered. The point of the documentary should have been to show up just how racist and disingenuous Charlton Heston is and in that it succeeded breathlessly well.The US, a beacon of the free world, is undoubtedly riddled with defects. They happen to be the same defects that all other democracies have. However, the US, as the leader of the free world is held up to scrutiny far more. Its enormous strength is its freedom. What other country would allow the dissemination, nay laud (he has just won an oscar) a documentary that so comprehensively attacks US culture. However, the US attracts large-scale and virulent envy and needs to defend itself and the way of life it represents. Time and again against world opinion they have reached for their guns and their young men's life to defend us despite our protestations. I for one, hope that they don't tire of our pacifist bleating. In the end pacifism will end up killing far more people than war. I don't think Mr. Moore understands that or if he does, unfortunately, it doesn't fit in with his conclusions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was fully prepared to like this film, having heard good things about it from various sources. However, I found it somewhat tedious. I certainly agree with much of what Michael Moore was trying to get across. For example, I'm definitely opposed to the easy way guns are obtained in this country. Also, I think some of the NRA people, particularly ones like Charlton Heston, are dangerous. That said, I thought it was unfair of Moore to take advantage of Heston who, I seem to recall, has Alzheimer's disease. Also, I wasn't impressed by his actions at K-Mart headquarters. I did think the comparison of the US with Canada was interesting, and I was amazed at all the guns and hunters in the country. If it weren't so cold, I might consider moving there. Bottom line: lots of good points but lots of tedium for me. Wish I could be more sanguine about the movie, because Moore's heart is definitely in the right place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely misleading...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains semi-spoilers. After initially viewing this film, I along with many others believed the Charlton Heston was a bumbling fool who made sure the NRA held two big events after tragedies (one being Columbine) to alleviate gun control issues that might erupt - and in the process mock the victims of those tragedies. I also believed Moore was right in that America has been lead by a frenzy of shock news programs (that use crime as a tool for ratings) as a tool for our culture becoming more violent.Boy was I and many other people wrong. Documentary or mockumentary, Bowling for Columbine is dangerously misleading and paves over many ethical boundaries so that Micheal Moore's points of view are virtually spoon fed to all who view. But first, a description of the movie, it is a twist on the common documentary we all have seen on PBS and heavily rotates on humor and shock to wrap viewers. The comedy comes from Moore and his interviewees, as he tries to settle the issue of Columbine and further, try to determine why so many gun tragedies happen in America in the first place. Towards the end, Moore delves in the media and common misconceptions (in his opinion) as to why these acts of violence occur.Now to the fun part, Moore, in trying to prove his point often twists information and/or delivers imagery and scenes that are heavily cut on the editing floor to try to prove his point. Agree with him or not, a great deal of Moore's information is delivered in half truths and semi-subliminal messages, which is flat out wrong, even if you think he's telling the truth.Where to begin? Moore's arch-nemesis in the film, Charlton Heston, is the brunt of Moore's under-minded tactics. Within the early stages of the film, Moore deliberately edits Heston's speeches to give the picture that Heston is an insensitive moron who will defend gun ownership even if he got shot himself. Heston's speech actually consists of multiple speeches, some parts were given a year AFTER the Columbine incident. Additionally, many parts of Heston's speech are edited between sentences, outrageously, one part is edited mid-sentence! The result leaves the viewer with a shockingly different speech from the one Heston actually delivered. Heston's delivery of abuse doesn't end there, at a later point in the film Moore actually interviews Heston in a 5 minute segment (but if you look up at the clock in the corner, you can see the span of 23 minutes actually passing). Although there's no way of proving it, Moore has probably edited this segment, again heavily, so that Heston looks not only like a desensitized idiot, but also as a racist. This is definitely not true however, as Heston was fighting for civil rights alongside Martin Luther King in the 60's - one of the many facts Moore intentionally leaves out of the movie so you get as one-sided of an opinion as possible.Other heavily edited or misleading scenes are when Moore suggests the KKK and the birth of the NRA are linked, a scene in which Moore buys a gun from a bank, and when he suggests that Heston, with the NRA band-wagon, visited Flint, Michigan shortly after a 6-year old was murdered by another first grader (actually, he visited as part of a Presidential campaign, nearly a year after the tragedy).On another interesting note, Moore visits a Wal-mart and protests their sales of bullets and claims there should be a limit to the amount customers buy. He implies we should boycott big franchise stores where such unethical actions take place. However, Moore's movies can be purchased at many of these stores, which makes you wonder why Moore would allow this to happen. The reason - money. Once the smoke is cleared it becomes very apparent Moore takes moderately controversial topics that a great deal of folks agree with (but not the whole consensus) and profits off of them with sensationalized movies.The bottom line, Moore's movie is heavily one-sided and omits facts that clear up many of Moore's strongest points. The man has the right to make a movie anyway he wants, but the result is you are served a viciously misleading and often false movie. If you do watch the movie, read many reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half hour of Bowling for Columbine is great, combining brilliant humour with tragedy. The policeman's comments on the hunting dog are hilarious. But after that, Moore gets a bit lost, going off on multiple tangents, resulting in a confused and overlong documentary.He spends a considerable time in Canada, with his conclusion that it is not the level of gun ownership, but American society that is the problem. OK, but then he finishes the movie attacking Charlton Heston, who holds the identical view - that it isn't guns that are the problem. Confused?My main problem though is the lack of objectivity in the documentary. I hate right-wing bias, but left-wing bias is no better. The idea that you can mount an argument using the comments or actions of just a few people in an entire country (e.g the kids in Canada, or the unlocked doors segment) is ludicrous.The 'black armband' view of history, as seen in the cartoon of America's history, is also far overdone. The USA has done a lot of terrible things, but it's achievements in terms of general world peace and liberty deserve at least a couple of seconds of screen time.Despite all this, the movie is very thought provoking, and the achievement of getting Kmart to stop selling ammunition is worth the price of admission alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, provocative, but also unfocused and really not that much of a documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Michael Moore's TV show 'The Awful Truth'. Moore takes a subject, puts his teeth in it, and makes things happen. Moments in 'Columbine' resemble that: there's an excellent piece when Columbine victims confront K-mart for making their bullets too accessible. And it works: K-mart withdraws all it's bullets within the next 90 days. Moore and the victims are in shock, the viewing public (that's us) happy and satisfied, it's one of the glorious moments of 'Columbine'. Then there are interviews with a principal from a school where a 6-year old shot a classmate and with the father of one of the Littleton victims. Moore is showing their agony, and it's tough to watch (in a good way). It brought tears to my eyes on numerous occasions.Then there are some funny elements (some hilarious interviewing, you can't really make stuff like that up), but Moore fails to make his documentary really work, because there is no telling which way he really wants to go. At first, it looks like gun-control or even gun-banning is high on Moore's agenda, but it's something more than that to really understand what is happening in the USA. The 'solution' is presented by no other shock-rocker Marilyn Manson (at the time a pretty huge artist): America is living in fear, needs guns to cope with that but at the same time can't handle it. Fear is the next key-word.But how, when, what? Moore may have a serious and ground-breaking issue here, but nothing is happening. He's showing us a 'brief history of the USA', which should've been an interesting interlude, now it's just a silly, stupifying animation, with generalizations the KKK itself would be proud of. Moore states that TV shows like 'Cops' are showing white cops handing in black criminals. But where are the numbers? How many crimes are being committed by blacks, and how many are 'Cops' showing? It's the main problem with this documentary: Moore says something, finds someone who will agree on it (and if not, that's OK too), and call it a night. No numbers, no statistics, no proof what-so-ever. It's all a bit thin.The worst part of the 'documentary' - by far - are it's last 10 minutes. Moore is looking up NRA spokesman (and movie legend) Charlton Heston to ask him how he feels about recent events. Heston tries to be friendly, admits he doesn't have all the answers, but still gets battered by Moore. The definite low Moore is striking when he's leaving the picture of the shot 6-year-old at the Heston estate. The scene had me left with a baste taste in my mouth, in particular since you can see (by camera movement) this scene is staged... it makes you kinda wonder about the rest of the documentary.What Moore should've done is stayed focused on certain issues, tell what happened and let other people give their opinion. In fact, the most horrifying but powerful scene of 'Columbine' is actual footage of the murders at Columbine High School. There, deal with that. Think about what happened here. Where will it lead us? It's at these points you feel Moore has got something to say you actually want to listen to. But when you're ready for it, Moore is already literally quoting from the Yugoslavian State News about how the Americans purposely dropped bombs on a hospital and a residential area. It's at those times one knows again 'Bowling For Columbine' might be funny, provocative, ground-breaking, unique and even important at the same time, but a good documentary it surely is not.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some FACTS about this so-called documentary check out the nonpartisan watch dog website SpinSanity: http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20021119.html " By Ben Fritz (ben@spinsanity.org) November 19, 2002Michael Moore insists he wants to be taken seriously. The author and filmmaker, an unabashed champion for liberal causes, is challenging America's gun culture with his latest endeavor, the documentary "Bowling for Columbine." Like his first film, "Roger and Me," it consists of a mix of satirical interviews with average people, confrontational interviews with celebrities and Moore's thoughts on what is going wrong with America. The argument often takes a back seat to the humor, but that's just Moore's style, as he explained to the Contra Costa Times in March: "I always assume that only 10 to 20 percent of people who read my books or see my films will take the facts and hard-core analysis and do something with it. If I can bring the other 80 percent to it through entertainment and comedy, then some of it will trickle through."The problem is, once you delve beneath the humor, it turns out his "facts and hard-core analysis" are frequently inaccurate, contradictory and confused. At one point in the film, Moore apparently even alters a Bush-Quayle campaign ad, changing history to make a point. Like many of the political celebrities increasingly filling our TV screens and bookstores, he is entertaining, explicitly partisan, and all too willing to twist facts to promote himself and his vision of the truth.

I didn't hate this movie because I disagreed with Moore, I didn't expect to agree with him. I hated this movie because it was dull and produced on an un-intellectual level.

Alas, it lived up to my biased and unfair expectations, but not so much my expectations for interest and quality. I found the delivery of his spiel to be less compelling this time, and the movie as a whole to be rather unfocused and random, as Moore sort of bounces from vaguely gun-related topic to topic. There are numerous websites online that discuss how Moore manipulates numbers and interviews to suit his tastes, so I won't repeat them here. Even if you believe the "documentary" aspects of the picture, however, the film still doesn't seem particularly impressive to me.

Moore has chosen side long before he confronts the interviewee who doesn't get a chance to answer Moores' comments which are presented not verbally by Moore but through emotionally loaded archive-material. In doing so Moore retains the role to the viewer as the objective documentarist. He continuously uses cinematic manipulating sheltering himself from direct confrontation. There are countless examples of this procedure. One being the interview of McCollum in the weapons factory who doesn't see Moores' connection between the parents work and the two boys shooting. Instead of answering the question Moore shows an emotionally collage of some of the wars the US has been involved in while Louis Amstrongs "What a Wonderful World" is playing. See the movie and judge yourself but observe closely how such effects are being used. All in all a terrible manipulating movie by a documentarist whose only desire seems to be to entertain and not inform the public or seek out a solution to this important problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ill-focused rant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary is obviously the work of a man who feels passionately about his subject. I just wish that he had the discipline to go along with the passion. For instance, Moore compares the number of gun deaths per year in the USA and Canada. The US figure is far higher. However, Moore fails to consider that the USA also has a far higher population than Canada, or to look at the total deaths irrespective of weapon. So his figures don't even prove that the USA is a more dangerous place to live than Canada.I am a neutral on the subject of gun ownership and was looking forward to some interesting arguments. While there were some interesting moments -- for example, an interview where Charlton Heston seems to blame violence on racial diversity -- I wish that they had been connected together to make a more coherent whole. As it is, I left the theater wondering why Moore doesn't just move to Canada, since he seems to prefer it so much to the USA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dishonest garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I saw Roger and Me when it first came out. I thought it was pretty good, even though it patronized the people it was supposedly fighting for. My wife, however, was from Flint and pointed out how dishonest the movie was. Moore changed times, dates, and sequences of events in order to make a point. Now it's 2003 and Moore is up to his old tricks, except this time his movies is dishonest to the point of slander. I ask that anyone who reads this that has seen or will see this dishonest garbage to check out the facts. Particularly, check the available transcripts of Charlton Heston's speeches to see how Moore cut parts out of different speeches and passed them off as being said contemporaneously. Check out the events that appear to be together. Read and see what a contemptible piece of human garbage this man is. By the way, the murderers at Columbine did not go bowling the morning before their terrorist attack. Obviously, this doesn't keep Michael Moore from adding to his millions by capitalizing on the dead bodies of the Columbine victims. The fact that this crap got an Academy award for best documentary tells you more about Hollywood and their uninformed support of anyone that scores points off the NRA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore poses a desperately important question: why is America exponentially more gun-murderous than so many other countries? - then proceeds to make no significant explorations towards an answer, choosing rather to find inarticulate, unattractive proponents of gun ownership and have them make sad fools of themselves spouting off. How does showing the slow-brained Charlton Heston fumble with Moore's disingenuous questions give viewers any cogent answer to the problem of gun violence? There were so many tacky maneuveurs on Moore's part... not the least of which was his exploitation of the Columbine victims - schlepping them to KMart HQ in a sleazy PR stunt to embarrass the administrative dolts there into yielding to media pressure? [though it was quite cool that KMART won't be selling bullets any longer] I could rant on...but will, instead, end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing Effort from Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I describe myself as a semi-fan of Michael Moore. I loved Roger and Me and TV Nation, and was enjoying The Big One, until I realized that it was just the same repetitive cycle of confronting a CEO at headquarters, getting the runaround and then unnecessarily humiliating some hapless PR rep. So, I entered this film with some trepidation. Overall, I'd have to give it 2 stars. Much of it felt like a lazy effort--often there was no actual documentary, but rather clips from tv shows, training videos, old commercials, Chris Rock stand up, news items and stock footage. Would've rather seen a limit on the number of clips and more interviews and commentary.What was good about it: the interview with John Nichols was terrifying and revelatory. The film also provoked a lot of thought about why Canada is so less violent, given that they have a similar love of guns, and the same entertainment. And for those who questioned his statistics, I believe they were based on per capita murders. I winced a bit when I saw him taking the 2 Columbine survivors to KMart headquarters to return the bullets, thinking it was another Big One style ambush. But when the PR rep was revealed to be a robotic idiot, it didn't bother me as much. For once, it actually worked and KMart won't sell handgun bullets anymore. Though I'd already seen the Columbine security camera footage on 60 Minutes, it was presented sensitively and was still emotionally draining. And, he did convince me that Welfare to Work is the new slavery.The bad: Here and there the film lacked focus--was this an attack on the US goverment? Corporate America? Rednecks? It just kept jumping around. That whole cartoon about the history of white people being the cause of all the problems in America, wiping out the Indians and enslaving and killing blacks. I'm white, but none of my ancestors had anything to do with this and I feel irked when getting lumped in with the bad guys. Moore's attack on white males seems to come from a sense of self-loathing. This came up again in his attack on the show Cops as creating racial hatred and fear. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the stereotypical criminal on cops the shirtless white trash drunk beating on his wife? Kind of destroys the argument. The Heston interview could have been revelatory, but in light of his recently diagnosed Alzheimer's, it was clear that the man was losing his ability to formulate thoughts and proved kind of pointless. Next, I think blaming our love of guns on media-created fears of non-existent boogeymen is only part of the problem. A general lack of mental health care or the willingness to go for help seems to be behind most massacres and attacks. And finally, I don't like how he left the answer to our questions about violence to an "I Don't Know." Geez, you spent a year making this film--have some sort of conclusion! Given this open ending, I don't see the film convincing one side or the other that they are wrong about guns.Perhaps most disappointing, the film had none of the Moore sense of humor that resonated through parts of Roger and Me and all of The Big One. A little comic relief among the bleak statistics would've helped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Evolution of Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There once was a time when an issue would arise, a film-crew would seek the answer and thus a documentary be born. Things have changed.Micheal Moore's highly animated, informative and quirky film on the effects of guns and media is less of a documentary and more like Socio-Propaganda. Moore portrays himself as the suffering yet witty philosopher and Moore uses viewer empathy to be the vehicle on his completely, one-sided journey. This is evident from the start when he decides to begin with a montage of daily life to show that he too is the Everyman.The real problem is the issue (guns/media), is too big to summarise without taking a viewpoint. Bowling for Columbine has made it mind up where its going before it gets there.matt</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Rush Limbaugh and Al Franken, Michael Moore is an entertaining propagandist, but that's about it -- an ideologue flailing away at one of the most important issues of our time. He has no problem with getting extremely loose with the facts to further his cause -- see bowlingfortruth.com for a full accounting.He also thoroughly fails at his mission of finding out why Americans kill each other with guns and instead descends into the leftist mantras of America's the world's great Satan (sometimes deserved), NRA bashing (also sometimes deserved) and "inanimate objects made us do it" (let's get K-Mart). He even totally loses it and tries to blame one killing on Dick Clark.Moore uses his standard tactic of bushwhacking people with a camera and creative editing (fun but ultimately pathetic). That Chuck Heston was dumb enough to let Moore anywhere near him with a camera, blows my mind. I guess he really does have dementia.Ironically, Heston's ill-advised musings really do touch on a HUGE factor in America's gun violence rate as compared to other countries -- one that Moore is completely unable to recognize or explore because of his own bias. I'm talking about black-on-black inner-city violence. Few people, especially an agenda-driven leftist like Moore, are willing to point out that if you remove unfortunate inner-city blacks from the murder statistics, America's gun murder rates are about the same as Europe's. It's sad, true, and thoroughly un-PC to mention it. In total denial, Moore even suggests that Canada with its much lower gun-violence rate is as ethnically diverse as we are, which is absurd (Canada is 13% non-white, 2% black).Obviously, this does not mean that we do not have a problem, and there are a large number of social/historical factors that figure into why the urban black portion of our society is suffering as it is. However, it does make one wonder about the quality and objectivity of Moore's "investigation."Moore hardly even mentions the inner-city crime issue, but surprisingly Heston does (indirectly). Moses obviously has thought and read quite a bit about our gun-related social woes (God, I would hope so). Unfortunately he did not have the forethought or finesse to explain it to Michael. I suspect that even if he had (maybe he did), the tape would have wound up on the cutting room floor -- smug, pseudo-Nazi, gun-lobby leaders are far more entertaining and in keeping with Moore's agenda. In short, this film is more about justifying Moore's poorly thought-out opinion than about exploring the issue.It's also important to understand that the film's centerpiece, the horrible, graphic school shootings, have little effect on our murder rate. They create media frenzies (especially when they involve whites shooting whites) but they are a very small part of the picture. FAR more kids drown in pools (around 300) in the USA every year than are shot by their classmates at school. To his credit, Moore did quite nicely touch on the media distortion factor.In summary, this movie is worth watching, and it's quite scary or funny on occasion. It makes some good points. Just make sure to take it with a grain of salt the size of Montana (you know, that state full of white gun nuts).</fullReview>

Case in point: He asserts that the Columbine shooters were influenced by the USA's foreign policy (they had relatives who worked for the military). Last time i checked, a bunch of pseudo-satanists shot up their school--there were no F-14 Tomcats involved.And the little elementary boy who shoots his classmates?

		<fullReview>I've seen Roger and Me and that was a stroke of brilliance. Honest filmmaking made by an impassioned individual who had a specific message he wanted to deliver about corporate America. But I had no clue what the point Moore was attempting to make in this film. Was it that for some reason Americans are seemingly more violent than other peoples?I found the film extremely dishonest even though I do believe Moore's perspective that it is too simple to obtain a gun and one can only wonder why one really needs to own dangerous weapons. But then he rambles on with little clips about everything under the sun, absurd conclusions about stereotyping that are not quite valid today as they were 20 years ago, etc. and never really investigates any of them. Take Marilyn Manson for instance -- the only thing he presents is that MM is just a musician and you can't blame a man for just being himself and saying what he wants. Yet he targets the Hollywood machine for using words and imagery as well. I'm not really sure MM thought out this movie well or perhaps he thought he could just present his own perspective and ignore everything else. He rips Americans for slavery yet most of us are recent immigrants ourselves and he also fails to look at terrorism in the middle east -- which one do you perceive as a bigger problem? So what is the point? Are we trying to determine why Americans are more "violent" than other cultures? Do we have a health care problem here and lack of social/corporate responsibility? Please... this is preaching to the choir.This movie quickly lost its appeal to me very quickly. In seeing the Charlton Heston interview (supposedly at 8:30am) the clock in the background reads 6. This whole film is of questionable honesty and besides the first few minutes, this film is totally overrated and should have been a 10 minute documentary on 60 minutes. Don't listen to the critics or the ridiculous marketing quotes... Rent Roger and Me and don't waste your time and money. Try it again Roger...</fullReview>

What's the point of making a film so liberal that only people who already agree with you will sit through it?It's genuinely funny to watch some of the gun advocates stumble when Michael Moore interviews them. But then there are attempts to connect things (defense contracting and screwed-up teenagers) that are really a stretch. Moore knows how to use video to put the best slant on connections like that, and I started to feel manipulated. Then there are graphic scenes of violence and long ranting sections about how the US is evil. What's the connection between US foreign policy and teenage violence? Most teens don't give a whit about world events.I don't know, I guess he is entitled to his viewpoint, but the level of propaganda is so high I think he loses credibility and even the points that seem reasonable I start to wonder how much is real and how much is hocus-pocus. That plus the graphic scenes, I just couldn't get through the film.Who should see this film:-- Radical liberals at the far end-- Nobody elseI'll give Bowling for Columbine a 2 out of 10.

The eye opening part, that Canada was pointed as a great alt-lifestyle to America, big shock! Now kids, put 2 and 2 together, you then get Moore reasons for that! Now that's funny. This film is not so much about gun control but to cash in on a(some but not all Euro) Euro fan base with little national pride(opened euro first for a reason), that hate anything American to feel pride. They have my pity, Moore has their money. That's comedy. You could see some euro's could see past what Moore was pandering to, and talked about pro/con on the subject, not just yelling wake up like a 70's hippie. To those I say cheers. The trick from "Broadcast News" with Heston walking away at the end was great. Two shots, 1 camera and a wall blocking a place for 2nd, but I never see the cross shot of camera on camera? William Hurt would be proud Mikey. Docufiction section only. It never goes into how gun crime/murder rates rise when guns are banned, ask the UK but the rabbits are now safe. At the same time, the subject is worth talking about and Moore does the subject only harm by trying to make freshmen jokes about death. The only fan base he reached has no say in the matter. On that he did bring humor to a sad subject after all.</fullReview>

The most galling part of Moore's technique is his schizophrenic style of being the wacky provocateur one minute and the solemn serious documentarian thenext. He ambushes Charlton Heston at his home one minute and then placesthe picture of a dead child at Heston's front entrance before he strolls away as if he's really accomplished anything.

His lazy refusal to do research , become aware of his subject and offer criticalinformation requires that he fills the screen with exploitive moments that conceal how completely empty his film really is. His complete lack of an intelligent and well considered argument does nothing to serve a purpose for a serious debate.

I laughed hysterically when michael moore staged the scene where Charlton Heston walks away after being presented with this picture. If you notice, Michael Moore and Charlton Heston are never in the same shot in this scene, as well while Michael Moore is presenting the picture of a girl who died in an issue he's supposed to be passionate about, he's saying it in a calm and aloof manner. Michael Moore has no sense of basic human standards of morality and civility. I personally would never want to see anything from a man who is willing to exploit the death of a young girl in order to make money and increase his own pathetic political standing.It took me a long time to stop laughing when it seemed Charlton Heston should apologise for showing up at an NRA convention that was scheduled for that date in that town a year before then. As if guns were the problem in this situation. It was stupidity that caused this incident, if this had happened with a knife or a metallic blunt object then the NRA certainly wouldn't have been asked to apologise. That's like asking Patrick Stewart to apologise for showing up at a prescheduled star trek convention in that town because a trekkie died when he fell on a sharp star trek prop a few days before.Charlton Heston is a good man who not only lead a great organisation but as well marched in the civil rights act next to MLK.

		<fullReview>Michael Moore seems to be passionately trying to make a point in this film, but what it is I don't know. He spends the entire movie going off on tangents and never stays on one topic long enough to make any kind of coherent argument about it.For example, he speaks about America's "gun culture" and how we have so much "gun violence" in America. But wait, he says, Canada has a lot of guns too, and they don't have so much violence. Maybe it's that America has a violent history... No, Germany has that too, but is not a violent society. Wait! Maybe the idea that America is so violent is just a myth, as Mr. Moore shows by walking down the mean streets of Los Angeles unmolested. So now what was his point again? As to Michael Moore's integrity, if you care to research his "facts" you will find that a lot of the movie is deliberately false and/or misleading. The NRA did not hold a "pro-gun rally" after the Columbine massacre, they merely held their mandatory annual meeting and in fact canceled the "rally" and other festivities because of the Columbine murders. Nor did they hold a rally "48 hours after Kayla Rolland is pronounced dead", as Moore implies with his sneaky camera tricks.Something else I find offensive is Moore's comment that you can always count on "white America's fear of the black man." He argues that this "fear" is due to the media and TV shows like COPS exaggerating the number of crimes committed by blacks. Moore points the finger of racism while totally ignoring the evidence against him. The black crime rate in America truly is out of all proportion to the black population (and I'm not a racist for saying so). FBI statistics show that of all "known" murderers in America, more than half are black (www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_03/xl/03tbl2-5.xls).I love my country, and if Mr. Moore doesn't, then he has my blessing to move to Canada, which he seems to suggest is a Utopian society (no offense to Canadian folks, but I'm sure your country has its share of problems too). Ultimately, Bowling for Columbine fills the viewer with misleading information, opinions presented as fact, and fails to offer any solid reasons for America's problems nor suggests any solutions. Meanwhile, the scruffy-looking, purported "hero of the common man" Michael Moore is laughing all the way to the bank.</fullReview>

The information is one sided and incomplete, for example the numbers about gun deaths in the US are higher than other countries..why? Because our population is more 5 times that of many of the countries he mentions, he uses exact numbers not percents in proportion to the population.I also found it vulgar that he exploits the Columbine tragedy to make his "point", I hate to break it you but guns were a factor not the cause. Yay he got Kmart to stop selling bullets now I can go buy them somewhere else. Maybe violence is everywhere because people like him sensationalize it (whether it be in a positive or negative form)making it "cool" for those who don't think they can be heard any other way. I also was rather appalled about the way he went about "interviewing" Dick Clark and Heston, basically saying "hey you caused Columbine, what do you think about that" if I were Dick Clark I would have drove away too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manipulative and Full of Holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore contradicts himself during several arguments throughout this film. Saying it is ridiculous to blame Marilyn Manson for what happened at Colombine and then turning around and blaming the media for it's coverage of violence and Lockheed/Martin for making weapons. Portraying Canada as a wonderland of government programs for everyone without mentioning it's unemployment rate or insane taxes that pay for these programs. (And did anyone else notice the guy he used as an example of a minority in Canada was later revealed to be from Detroit?) The self depricating animated history was entertaining, but untrue and one sided. It basically said America's gun problem was the result of white people's fear of minorities. The use of the girl who was killed in Michigan and blaming it on the welfare system that "forced her killer's mother to get a job in another city" was pure manipulation. Why not blame the uncle for not locking up his gun so his nephew couldn't have access to it? Out of the 11,000 gun deaths each year in the US how many are Columbines or fourth graders killing each other? These kinds of things are rare. Yes, everyone agrees that gun violence is a huge problem in this country and it is tragic when anyone is killed. This documentary failed to deal with the real issues. What about the majority of gun deaths? What is at the root of those? Lockheed/Martin? The media? Poverty? I don't know and neither does Michael Moore. He spent the whole movie asking questions to people (Heston for one) and pointing to their failure to answer as proof that they were wrong without ever answering the questions himself. Finding the most sympathy inducing stories and presenting them as examples of the gun violence in America while using statistics that have very little to do with those examples is manipulation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>you've got to be kidding yourself if you can take this movie seriously. every scene, every "fact," and every argument in this movie either begs false conclusions, or are straight up lies. there is not one shred of truth in this movie. none. nada. all lies for you pseudo-intellectuals to swallow so heartedly and without question.the missile factory near columbine? it actually converts titan missiles to communication satellites, and ships them at night only to avoid traffic. the charlton heston interview? notice how the clock in the background doesn't quite follow time as we know it. as for his speech, it's actually several speeches, spliced together. that's right, mr. heston didn't make that speech - Micheal moore took a few of heston's speeches, cut them up, and put them back in an order that furthered his own agenda. the NRA meeting in denver? ny state corporate law states that you must hold shareholder meetings, planned ahead of time. it would have been illegal for the NRA to cancel their denver meeting - it was planned years in advance, anyway. it just keeps on going... any of us who have been to the smithsonian know that the plaque on the enola gay does not say what mr. moore said it did. the gun rally in michigan that heston did, was actually a "get out the vote" rally. implications that heston is racist are lies as well - he was one of the first screen actors to try to break the Hollywood color barrier, and one of the first celebrities to march publicly with MLK, Jr. And the little cartoon that attempts to draw connections between the KKK and the NRA is a falsehood too. actually, ex-slaves in the south joined NRA chapters, so they could get guns to protect themselves from klansmen. NRA president andUS president grant signed the first laws banning the KKK. i could go on and on about how this entire movie is one big lie, but you guys get the point.the worst part of it all, is that the premise and the conclusion of this movie don't even go together. it's not even a movie. the beginning of the movie talks about how we're all gun-crazy. the end of the movie talks about how we're a nation of fear. the two themes don't go together - we're a nation of fear because we're gun-crazy, or we're gun-crazy because we're a nation of fear? but at the beginning of the movie, moore talks about how Japanese culture is more violent and is not gun crazy. or some BS about canadians. please note:Micheal moore: college dropout</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing, but ultimately too propagandistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie wanting to like it: it's billed as a movie questioning America's culture of fear, militaristic foreign policy, violent crime, and so on. These are all, of course, important issues that should be addressed more than they usually are. And Moore does bring up some interesting points, particularly relating to the culture of fear. But ultimately, he takes too many cheap shots and his arguments turn too overtly propagandistic: nobody who doesn't already agree with him is going to be convinced by this film. There's also the usual Moore tendancy to towards demagoguery, in which he looks for good sound-bytes (video-bytes?) that don't really make much of a legitimate point.It's unfortunate, because this could have been a good movie if Moore had been a little more restrained. There are some good points buried in it, but be aware that it's largely a propaganda film: the left-leaning equivalent of those "public service" films the Christian Coalition puts out. If you're willing to ignore the over-the-top bits, and his style doesn't irk you too much, it's worth a watch. But as a legitimate documentary, it leaves something to be desired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Volumes could be written about what is wrong with this movie. It's high reviews comfound me. I can only believe that he has successfully pandered to people of simple minds led by astray by simple platitudes.In one scene he tries to build a case for the United States being war-monger by listing historical date after historical date where the US led some invasion, over threw some dictator or set up some ruler, but completely omits the historical landscape of the time so that the viewer may have some historical perspective as to why the US did what it did in the first place. These details would NEVER make Mr. Moore's movie because he has blinders on. Now am I saying that the US has always made the right decisions? Of course, not. But, I believe that a "documentary" should provide at least a full counterpoint. Mr. Moore uses a tactic very often in his interviews that is not allowed in a jury trial. He likes to blind-side the people he interviews with questions he has been thinking about for a long time ... questions with complex answers that anyone would be hard pressed to answer on its first hearing. In a jury trial, lawyers must provide each other evidence up front so they are not blind-sided. I would like to see just once Mr. Moore providing a list of the questions he was going to ask his interviewees a few days prior the interview. It is only fair.In addition, this movie was simply all over the place. I wondered through the movie what he was trying to say. He bounced from Columbine, to war, to racism, to fear, to guns and it just doesn't add up. Maybe it does in his, but not in mine.After the movie there is a interview with Michael Moore and he starts talking about his visit at the end of the movie with Charleton Heston. Mr. Moore brings up that he found most offensive Mr. Heston's comments that ethnicity may be involved with a larger number of shootings in the US. Well, I heard the interview and it is a prime example how Mr. Moore likes to take advantage of his interviewees by blind-siding them with complex questions that he has already been thinking about for a long time. Mr. Heston made NO SIGNIFICANT comment about how ethnicity could be related to a larger number of shootings in the US. His verbatim words were, "we have probably a more mixed ethnicity than other countries, than some other countries". Then Moore began pressing him on the point. Heston, realizing he hasn't thought through this well, backed off and didn't elaborate. Now, Moore is trying to make Heston look like a bad guy for making the comment as though it were a racist remark. It was an unfair interview to Mr. Heston, as with pretty much with everyone else Moore interviews.Moore's Columbine is poor and pointed documentary that does nothing in a fair way. It only serves as a means to express his views.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Directionless, emotionally fogged documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine is a disappointingly confused rant at American social injustice. Moore's increasingly personal emotional investment in the film means that he cannot use the time honoured satirist's weapon of engaging and directing our own in the issues he exposes. The irony that he does use is ill-defined as such, and so fails to raise a laugh (much of the time, I suspect, he assumes that people will find the content of his report inherently incongruous, but that not being the case cannot be explained away simply by reference to the cultural boundary of the Atlantic Ocean).Worse than this, he gets lost. Having linked the statistical disproportion of homicide in America with the gun culture, he then goes to Canada where there are comparable numbers of firearms available - only to use his format of the rhetorical question to tangentially shift the focus onto social differences, and, following this, cultural (consumer, specifically TV) differences via more rhetoric, and so on. For all his worthy observation and investigation, we are left without conclusion.Inconclusiveness - or inconsistency - is what marks the film (at a basic level, why so many typefaces for title cards?) and its content. I wondered at the end whether (a) I felt more sympathy for the NRA, despite their unarguable tactlessness and so (b) the 'interview' with Charlton Heston wasn't actually staged. Moore's achievement in this film is to illustrate the elusive roots of the 'problem', most memorably in the sequence where he gets caught in a rhetorical loop with a parent of a Columbine victim, each asking the other 'Why?'.This film is not Oscar material; curiously, the award was probably made because the Academy could see how LITTLE social hiatus it was going to create, and that by giving the award they were smothering the issues by incorporating the satirist rather than providing the publicity oxygen of marginalisation. 4/10 and I'm looking forward to Gus van Sant's 2003 Palme d'Or Winner ELEPHANT to re-address these important questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Any Solutions?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this film has quickly become one of the most popular documentaries of recent times and much of what could possibly be said about it have long ago been discussed by others so I will keep this as brief as possible. I felt compelled to write a comment on this movie because of the fact that I have lived in and around the town of Flint, Michigan (the location and focus of Moore's 1989 "Roger and Me") for my entire life. Michael Moore is and always has been talented in his own way. I've come to believe since I've seen this film, however, that his talent comes primarily from showcasing everything that happens to be wrong with society. Not even a single probable solution is brought up in this movie and it is easy to see why. Moore is content as a filmaker in exposing only the negative side of things. It is his specialty and it is what his movies are based on. This film is no exception and for the average person I'm sure this is a very convincing piece of work but Moore's blatant manipulation has reached an all time high. The finger is pointed in no less than three completely different directions. We seem to be first re-introduced to the old debate concerning high school bullying, followed by racism, and then followed, of course, by the belief that the rich are only out to screw the poor and nothing more. At times it seems as though Moore is just going off on tangents and he has a serious problem trying to tie all these things together to make better sense.Lastly, this is obviously a very personal movie that Moore has made and those that see it are bound to have their own personal feelings regarding the main subject of violence. I would like to say that I failed to see how it was Dick Clark's fault that some woman's child shot another little child at school, a school that I actually don't live that far away from. More importantly I was left wondering why this woman is viewed as being a victim when quite frankly she should probably be in prison for raising her son in a crack house and an otherwise horrible environment. Why should Charleton Heston have to apologize for something that he had nothing to do with? I suppose that the film's conclusion paints the best picture for me. Moore is out to do two things as far as I'm concerned. He's out to expose only what is wrong with the world and then mix these things with realistic drama in order to be has convincing as possible. You can't knock the guy for having a lack of talent at being manipulative though. He seems to be very good at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Americans are irrationally fearful since, "even though crime rates have gone down gun ownership has gone up".Maybe the reason that crime rates have gone down is that gun ownership has gone up.We learn that Dick Clark is responsible for children that misuse guns?? We learn that K-mart is responsible for the Columbine massacre??Obviously Moore does not like Lockheed, does not like guns, and does not care for the Bill of Rights. We see no acknowledgment that firearms are more often used to defend law-abiding citizens than they are used in crimes.Michael Moore claims to be an NRA member and not a gun hater. I guess that if you join the B'nai B'rith and talk about how many of your friends are Jews, but then go on to make anti-Semitic remarks, you're still an anti-Semite. In this respect I see no difference between Michael Moore and Leni Riefenstahl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak like Fahrenheit 9/11</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am very unfortunate as I am also named Michael Moore, and have lived with the stigma of sharing the name of a guy who makes very biased and poorly supported documentaries for several years now. I don't hate all of his movies, 'Canadian Bacon' was hilarious; but much like 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' 'Bowling for Columbine' shares the same media paranoia that Moore blames on all of the problems with America. It is not that I totally disagree with his points...the media is focused on sensationalism and I for one can no longer stand to watch either the local news or even Fox or CNN. But Moore's arguments have no sustaining points to them. An interview with Marilyn Manson showing what a loving and caring person he is doesn't offset Manson's lyrics or stage antics...he is a promoter of glorified death because it sells to all the Emos who feel they are "misunderstood." What a new phenomenon that is, anyone remember when rock &amp; roll first emerged in the 50's and how it was seen as the catalyst to the end of civilization? Nope, not me as I wasn't born yet; but I have heard the stories.Moore's antics at K-Mart are a joke as well, blaming the company for the mis-use of ammunition bought from one of its stores. What if the two killers at Columbine had used Wsthof kitchen knives? Should Nike or whoever's shoes they wore be also to blame? The Columbine High School massacre was a senseless tragedy, but one carried out by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold (and which wasn't the most deadliest school attack ever, the Bath School bombing gets that distinction). Harris and Klebold already have a track record and were well on their way to becoming professional criminals. Both were considered to have a lack of moral judgment and needed psychiatric help. However, Moore conveniently skips over these important facts and goes right to the tools they used to implement their hatred upon others. Also, what about Mark Manes and Robyn Anderson, who illegally sold and gave the firearms to Harris and Klebold? Why isn't their involvement documented by Moore? Bottom line, this is another sensationalized documentary from a guy who likes to see himself on the big screen. It is inaccurate and misleading in its presentations and Moore likes to misshape interpretations of events to support his beliefs. This only got worse in 'Fahrenheit 9/11.' Don't watch either on a full stomach.I only wish someone would limit Moore's right to free speech as much as he would like to limit everyone else's right to bear arms!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore shoots himself in the foot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to viewing "Bowling for Columbine," I knew of Michael Moore's work only by reputation, not having seen any of his previous films, nor read any of his books, nor even catching his work of performance art during the Academy Awards ceremony. What is immediately clear is that he is not a documentarian but rather a propagandist. This is not necessarily a bad thing insofar as he does not claim to be otherwise, as far as I know, but "Bowling for Columbine" is no more a true documentary than are the works Leni Riefenstahl made for the German Nazi Party during the 1930s.Moore is clearly passionate about his subject, or more accurately what he pretends the subject to be -- what he and others perceive to be the subculture of fear, violence, and firearms in American society. The actual subject of the film is, however, Moore himself -- his opining, editorializing, grandstanding, and manipulations. What other 'documentarian' makes himself the center of his own work to such an extent? Michael Apted? Errol Morris? Chris Marker? Michael Moore is to documentary film-making what Geraldo Rivera is to electronic journalism.Irrespective of either Moore's or the viewer's political inclinations, he does himself, his audience, and his purported subject matter a disservice by portraying the issues in such a polemical, one-sided manner. As he travels around the USA and Canada asking why there are so many more deaths by gunshot in America than elsewhere, it apparently never occurs to him to ask qualified sociologists and psychologists who have studied that matter (with the lone exception of Barry Glassner -- a sample size of one). There is certainly no lack of research done on the subject. But no, much easier (and funnier!) to trip up unsuspecting individuals, particularly ill-educated ones, with rhetorical trickery and ambush interviews and then splice bits of film together for maximum effect. There is no doubt where Moore's sentiments lie even though the film looks as if it were made by someone afflicted with adult attention deficit disorder, highly scattered and disconnected as it unfolds. Those sentiments are made clear in the first two minutes. There are a number of very effective moments however, both tragically and comedically, but not always in the manner Moore may have intentioned. In two instances, some Canadian residents state that they still don't lock the doors to their respective homes even though they have been broken into, vandalized, and burgled. Moore apparently found this attitude admirable. I found it hilarious, like watching someone continuing to park his automobile on railroad tracks even after a train has demolished his previous one.I expect this film received the awards it did more for its "political correctness" than for any artistic or even social merit. Certainly the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is not known to have a preponderance of deep thinkers after all, and as for a 13-minute standing ovation at Cannes, that's to be expected. This film is perfect fodder for those who love to hate America (see, for example, the comments below by "mrealfse" (Norway), "Gregory Goldlust" (Brazil), and "Josefin" (Sweden)). But hey, that's free speech, protected by the first amendment of the US Constitution, something to consider by those who would rescind the second amendment ("... the right of the people to keep and bear arms ..."). The Bill or Rights is not something to be tampered with.So, see this film for whatever reasons suit you, but for bona fide, unbiased documentary film-making, one is much better off catching any of the segments from the PBS news show "Frontline." Rating: 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This really isn't an anti-gun movie unless you're somebody who's absolutely opposed to anybody but the police and the bad guys owning firearms. I don't own a gun and have never fired one but the Michigan Militia men interviewed at the beginning of the film all made perfect sense to me. People should have the right to protect themselves from the bad guys without having to always rely on the cops. This is also a film that never should have won the Oscar. It's no different than any of his other ambush interview documentaries and there were far better choices the Academy could have made. The reason I say Mike is a sell-out is because after watching this film the only conclusion one can draw is the reason we're such a violent prone country is because of the violent movies and violent video games we're bombarded with but instead of going after Hollywood Moore goes after the Government because after all, if he had gone after Hollywood he would have had a really tough time finding a distributor. The DVD has a number of goodies on it- the book signing and the speech he gives are like watching a left-wing version of Jerry Falwell . His empathy is completely fake and just an act. There's also his bit where he explains his Oscar speech which is quite hilarious in its blatant re-writing of history. No, Mike, nobody was cheering you and the booers weren't booing the cheerers. They were booing you as you rightly should have been booed. In fact they booed you right off the stage and they were so loud in their booing that the walls in my apartment 5 blocks from the Kodak Theater were shaking. And no, Mike, it wasn't just a spur of the moment thing. You gave an interview right after the ceremonies where you said the whole stunt had been pre-planned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good entertainment, lousy documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I mostly agree with the opinions that Michael Moore puts forward in this movie: it's ridiculously easy to get guns in America, and guns probably cause a lot more harm than they prevent: people accidentally shooting each other, fights getting out of hand, people snapping and going on killing sprees etc. I also believe that some media and governments, either consciously or unconsciously contribute to the feeling of fear and insecurity in society.Also, I have to say that judged purely as entertainment, "Bowling for Columbine" is a winner. Michael Moore has a great sense of humor, and his audacity and cheekiness lead to a lot of hilarious situations. And let's be fair, a fair share of the people interviewed/ridiculed by Moore in this movie are fairly arrogant hypocrites who deserve to be put into place.That being said, as a documentary "Bowling for Columbine" really isn't up to much. I honestly believe that Micheal Moore has a fairly strong case, which would easily hold up in a fair two-sided discussion of the topic. Unfortunately, that's not what you're getting here. Instead, Moore tries way too hard to force his opinion onto the audience. I'm not saying he is lying. I believe that very little of what is presented in this documentary is factually incorrect. What Moore does do is pull things out of context, blow things out of proportion, and come up with all kinds of bold statements and correlations which are highly speculative to say the least.In the end, I think Moore ends up....ahem... shooting himself in the foot. I honestly think that he has a lot of strong points, but instead of just presenting them (and the counterpoints), he forces his opinion onto you. All in all, this probably only works counterproductive as his opponents can (and should) dismiss this movie as fairly cheap propaganda.As entertainment, this is one of the best comedies of recent yeas. As a documentary, "Bowling" fails miserably. As a political statement, it probably works counterproductive.**1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest I left this movie feeling shamelessly manipulated. I clapped at the end with the rest of the audience, caught up in the moment, but it took about 5 minutes of thought after the lights went up to discover that the emperor had no clothes. What exactly was the point of this movie? On the one hand it seemed like an indictment against the NRA and the US love affair with the gun--Mike sure had fun cornering Chuck at the end--yet by his own admission (7 out of 10 Canadian families own guns) this isn't the case. OK then it must be the climate of violence in the US and our nasty foreign policy right? Wrong again. Using examples like Nazi Germany and Britain's brutal colonialism we learn that the acts of the state have nothing to do with the acts of individuals (although he still provides a pointless 3 minute montage of 50 years of US policy misdeeds and brutality). OK then it has to be all the violence we're exposed to through TV, movies, and video games. Well no. Again he points out that the rest of the world loves this crap as much as we do. Disaffected youth? Nope. Poverty? Possibly but that segment seemed to have less to do with gun violence then how little America cares about our working poor. So what is it Mike? What's the point? From what I could tell he seemed to want to indict the media for producing a climate of fear in America but he never followed up on it. Where were the hard hitting interviews with Ted Turner or the LA TV executives that always go with a man with a gun instead of a near drowning? Maybe he's afraid of biting the hand that feeds him? If anything he's guilty of exactly the same thing they are, generating a climate of fear by cashing in on a hot topic but ultimately offering us nothing of substance. I think this movie is more of a disservice to the efforts of gun control then a damning expose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nonsensical ramblings of a left wing nut: Overall a terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A documentary is a presentation of facts in a broadly objective manner as defined by Websters Dictionary. While forcing myself to watch this junk, I asked myself, `How does this constitute as a documentary?' Moore obviously fails to portray himself as `objective' in any sense of the word. This heap of trash is clearly one-sided and anti-NRA, and Moore is far leftwing that he is risking falling over the edge. Fine, so Moore is not objective, at least he's got the facts straight, right? Not even close. He crops Heston's speech given after a child killed his classmate with a stolen gun so that it seems insensitive to the occurrence. It also shows the speech to be immediately after the shooting. In reality, if Moore wasn't so dishonest and deceptive and the whole picture was shown, the audience would have seen that Heston was actually sympathetic and that the speech was given 8 MONTHS after the incident happened. Moore illustrates Heston rushing to the scene of the crime and giving an insensitive speech a matter of days after the killing took place. Lies like this are commonplace throughout this so-called `documentary.' The real challenge would be finding some truth in it. Okay, at least he stays on topic and doesn't begin to ramble on to things not dealing with his initial argument, right? Wrong again. It's Moore, so he has to put bring his nonsensical left wing view in to everything that is wrong with America. For instance, somehow he moves for the topic of guns to the way Blacks are portrayed in the media. He shows a montage of news reports where Blacks are the criminals. I did not understand this, and I'm sure most people did not. Is Moore saying that Blacks don't commit crimes or that we should stop looking for Black criminals and throwing them in jail? After giving this some thought, I said that maybe Moore is trying to proclaim there is racial discrimination (without facts or statistics) in the media. Had Moore been less partial and shown news reports where non-Blacks are the criminals, then a viewer of this movie would be able to understand the truth: That the media does not discriminate between criminals by skin color. He then strays more off-topic and proclaims that Canada is a paradise compared to the crime-ridden USA. In addition, because he interviewed five people that don't lock their doors in Canada, Moore concludes that nobody in Canada locks their doors, and all Canadians are peace-loving people without a fear in the world. Moore is a great researcher: By interviewing a handful of people, he makes conclusions on entire regions (USA and Canada) and on races (Whites and Blacks). Fine, so Moore is not objective, deceives his audience, doesn't stay on topic, and makes stereotypes just to fit his argument, but at least he answers the questions that he poses at the beginning of the movie and provides a conclusion at the end, right? I know this is getting repetitive, but the answer once again is a resounding `NO!!' After watching this 2+ hour long non-documentary, Moore makes no conclusions and does not provide any answers that would help America fix some of its problems. Here's my conclusion: Moore is a left-wing nut and Bowling is not only a movie devoid of facts, but it is a movie that deceives the viewer with cropped interviews, made up numbers, and one-sided arguments. I am thankful that I did not pay to see this movie, because it would hurt me to think that I supported Moore in any way. I advise anyone who did not see this movie to refrain from watching it; you are not missing anything. If you must see it, please watch with caution, and do not be drawn into Moore's deceptions and arguments, because once you check the facts, you will see that Moore has no argument.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Documentary Ever????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The difference between a documentary and your run of the mill studio film is the presentation of facts. This film intentionally blurs that line by giving the audience so many errors as facts one has to wonder what Moore's endgame was. Here is just a partial list:Moore reports the parents of Harris and Klebold worked for Lockheed Martin, which built weapons at the nearby plant. Both are false.Moore ambushes Charlton Heston and tries to do the same to Dick Clark in this mission to blame them for the death of Kayla Rolland at the hands of a gun wielding classmate. What he does not tell you is the boy who committed this crime had been left by a welfare mom in the care of a felonious uncle, who took up residence in a crack house. Moore also says that at a Michigan bank, opening up an account will get you a free gun. What he fails to mention is all applicants, like any other gun buyer, has to undergo a criminal background check and a mental history before they can obtain the weapon. Make no mistake: Michael Moore is anti-gun and anti-American. You can read his book "Stupid White Men" or visit his website if this film does not provide enough proof.And those who gave this film high marks in taking this garbage at face value should hang their heads in shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, it is not a documentary.As others have said, the injustice here is not so much to the viewer, but as to the independent producers of real documentaries. They struggle in a field which receives little recognition and financing. They are protected by Academy rules limiting the documentary competition to nonfiction.Yet Bowling is fiction. It makes its points by deceiving and by misleading the viewer. Statements are made which are false. Moore leads the watcher to draw inferences which he must have known were wrong. Indeed, even speeches shown on screen are heavily edited, so that sentences are assembled in the speaker's voice, but which were not sentences he uttered. Bowling uses deception as its primary tool of persuasion and effect.A film which does this may be a commercial success. It may be entertaining. But it is not a documentary. One need only consult Rule 12 of the rules for the Academy Award: a documentary is a non-fictional movie.The point is not that Bowling is biased. No, the point is that Bowling is deliberately, seriously, and consistently deceptive.In the DVD version, Moore has even altered a caption that he fictitiously inserted into a 1988 Bush-Quayle campaign commercial -- one of a number of misstatements and deceptive arguments criticized when the film was released. Ironically, on the same day the DVD was released, Moore issued a libel threat against his critics on MSNBC's "Buchanan &amp; Press," saying, "Every fact in the film is true. Absolutely every fact in the film is true. And anybody who says otherwise is committing an act of libel."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>in the midst of all the libel, here's some food for thought...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moore would have us believe he is a populist.Moore would have us believe "Bowling For Columbine" is a documentary.Moore would have us believe a lot of things.Well, let me tell you what I believe. I believe this pseudo-documentary was nothing more than satirical hyperbole (I will explain hereinafter). His message is a very important one: no guns; I agree with it wholeheartedly. But did he need to indoctrinate millions of people with this factually selective putative "documentary"?He's not committing treason here. He's overtly trying to change his country for what he perceives to be the better.Before I even get into the film, I want to get into my bete noire when it comes to this film and Moore (bete noire in that this is something I hate it, not fear). And that bete noire would be the flak and indignation this film receives from all the right wing extremists (I'm not on the left neither; I think people who only see two choices when it comes to politics are veritably myopic). Their censorious remarks aside, Moore has clout with the common everyday pauper. The people who are not abreast to politics or foreign policy, who are not very topical, who are apathetic towards history, are, quite possibly, the ones who swallow Moore and his ideologies wholly (perhaps, because they don't know the putative "facts" that Moore points out to be otherwise). They may very well be his target audience. It's won an Oscar, copious amounts have been sold, the whole nine. Funny how Moore has a large fan base and did so with the usage of factually selective, hyperbolical, indoctrinating propaganda. The very same tools politicians use. Moore is a smarter populist than he appears to be. See how hypocritical those politicians screaming with indignation about "Bowling For Columbine" seem now?Right, now back to the movie. Anyone who watches this movie must realize how sententious it is. And Charlton Heston is not the racist Moore made him out to be (he was marching with Martin Luther King in days of yore, before it became de rigueur). Moore chopped up his speeches (you can see him wearing two different suits, hint hint, wake up people).He made all kinds of intimations, some of which were bordering on ridiculous (NRA and KKK in cahoots has been proven as fraudulent). All sorts of fabrications in this movie have you wondering if this is a documentary or some pinko's parody on the United States.However, that's not to say this film wasn't well done. The production was sublime. The messages were conveyed in a manner that was very lucid. But this, obviously, is not a documentary.The question is, though: is this what you're against? Anti-gun laws? Are guns necessary? If the constitution said it was every American's right to own a slave, would that make it ok to own a slave? Just because the constitution (written in days of yore, in times none of us could possibly ever identify with) says it is a right does not mean hurry to go buy that new desert eagle. Switzerland may have a law saying everyone must own a gun and they may have very low gun crime rates. But they don't have the image problem that most Americans have, they don't have the sort of animus among their own people that even guns can't mollify, so on and so forth.I aver that what Moore did was a bit much. Heston is an honest man but now looks like a liar (he couldn't have cancelled the speeches, they were planned years in advance; besides, the festivities were cancelled). he turned a civil rights activist into a racist, a man that lobbied for and enforced strict gun laws into an irresponsible gun nut.He called the bank weeks in advance to do the gun account clip; that's why he received the gun with no ample delays. The studio that produced it is from and in Halifax, so that "if it wasn't real, Americans wouldn't have made it" argument gets defenestrated (tossed out the window).But, perhaps, this was needed; too many people embracing Bush with zealotry nowadays. Don't take your ire out on the message because you didn't like the not-so practical application Moore chose (and the message I mean: outlaw guns). I still, however, aver that these sort of films are necessary for they are iconoclastic and heretic. Not to mention that they help the balance (the propaganda from both the left and right is now a little more balanced).Short and to the point: Moore only used the very same trickery all other putative populists use in the U.S. political scene. The medium Moore chose was apt. The only thing he did that may prove to be imprudent was title it as a documentary. Though many things may have been spurious, many politicians go on television with their own glib, using the same techniques Moore did (trickery). So how come they can get away with it but Moore can't? Neither one should get away with it, if you wish to be an objective judge about it. How can they call someone out for something they do as well? He may do so per pro the film medium, but conversely, there's propaganda politicians spew out everyday, only to pass it off as being objective and factual. I would suggest that those politicians, with whom Moore is now in a war of slander, debunk THEIR OWN trickery as well. It's only fair.I doubt any of you "Bowling For Columbine" zealots have or will do any research to verify the many specious "facts" it depicts. It's an amazing movie, otherwise; very well done (notice I said 'movie', not documentary; this is hyperbole, folks). Watch it anyway.- the G.O.D. (Chalaco)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even close to great, but a great place to start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's documentary showcases negative effects of guns without ever offering a real cause. Almost every time he DOES present a possible cause, he manages to undermine it. For example, gun ownership does not lead to gun violence. He demonstrates this by going to Canada, a country with a very sizeable gun-owning population and virtually no gun-related violence. After proving this point, Moore takes two survivors from Columbine with shrapnel from K-Mart bullets still lodged in their bodies to K-Mart world headquarters in order to ask for a refund and that K-Mart stop selling bullets. Tasteless, yes? And wait Michael, you just showed us that guns don't cause violence, didn't you? Gaps in logic exist throughout the film. Moore isn't really interested in exposing any real truth. He's anti-gun, and this movie is a masterful collection of anti-gun images. Watching this film is akin to the scene in Clockwork Orange where Alex is brainwashed into hating all violence. The vast majority of the movie involves over-the-top anti-gun emotional appeals. He visits Columbine, he tells the depressing story of an elementary school student who shot another one in Flint, Michigan, and he badgers Charlton Heston.There is also an insultingly bad animated sequence where American history is shown. Basically, it paints a picture of all white Americans as violent racists who use guns to oppress minorities.Despite all its flaws, I still recommend Bowling for Columbine. It makes some compelling points, even if it is pure propaganda. And it IS pure propaganda. But so is the mainstream media. There are powerful lobbies everywhere. Moore is just another one. Moore half succeeds in his mission. He encouraged me to think for myself, to read more, and to do my own research rather relying on second-hand sources. But he didn't convert me to his way of thinking. Much like Ann Coulter, he is too far absorbed in ideology and ego to ever provide a completely satisfying viewpoint.See this movie. There are far too many people out there who hate Moore just because they've heard about him or read about him somewhere. In order to truly form an opinion on him, see one of his movies or read one of his books. That being said, Canadian Bacon is the best film he ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>According to Websters: presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film. Perhaps Mr. Moore or the Academy should have read that definition FIRST before calling this bit of fluff a documentary. The movie is full of distortions and flat out misrepresentations of facts (please see bowlingfortruth.com for complete details -- I am indebted to poster tony-clifton for that). This movie works as a comedy (the scenes at the bank and the cartoon are good examples) but flops as a documentary (almost everything Moore says is at least distorted if not completely untrue). Bottom line--to quote an overused but appropriate line from Macbeth: It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury; Signifying nothing.

		<shortDescription>An NRA member review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I met Michael Moore in 2000 while working at the gun department of a local outdoors store. Moore told us he was filming a movie about guns in America. I was skeptical and told him as much, he said he was not making an anti-gun movie, but an anti-violence movie. He filmed a little, singed my NRA card and left. After many months of re-editing and after cutting me out of the movie, he has finally released it. Bowling for Columbine is at times disjointed and contradictory, that is not to say it's not shocking and thought provoking, and as an NRA Life Time member, I can honestly say I enjoyed it. Bowling for Columbine is the story of Moore seeking the reason to why America has such a high firearm homicide rate. His adventures take him from Littleton, CO, the site of the 1999 Columbine shooting, to Canada, to Flint, and finally to NRA President Charlton Heston's home for a climatic interview.Moore seemed able to control his leftist view on life at various points during the movie but his overwhelming pathos in life permeates the entire film. Moore, like many Liberals who live in the big cities have three truths in life (1) the rich screw everyone, (2) the government only cares for the rich and the military, and last but not least (3) America would be a better place if white Americans were not so racist. There may be certain amount of truth in all three of these, but none are an absolute fact. With (1), Moore talks about the mother of the six year old boy who shot Kayla Roland at Buell Elementary in Mt. Morris Township, MI. Moore sensibly raises the question as to why is a single mother being bussed 40 miles, from Flint to Great Lakes Crossing Mall, to work for near minimum wage. Moore could have tackled the issue by talking to the administrators of the program, but he makes a connection that only he could and that Dick Clark is responsible. See, Clark, the cultural music icon, owned the restaurant in the mall were Ms. Owens worked, so, using Moore's logic, Clark in California should know why this poor woman was being bussed 80 miles a day and forced to put her son in a crack house owned by her brother, where he found the gun. Moore never mentions that the house where the young boy was living was described as a `flop house' by Genesee County Prosecutor Art Busch, who is interviewed in the movie. Drug transactions were conducted at all hours of the night, and the hand gun was stolen. But Dick Clark is the one to blame, and when confronted by Moore, Clark has a `What the Hell are you talking about' look on his face before he sensibly orders his aid to slam the van door in Moore's face and drive off. Moore then insinuates that K-Mart, The Persian Gulf War, and the largest employer in Littleton, the defense contractor Lockheed Martin, are responsible for the shooting at Columbine. Moore makes no reference to the Trench Coat Mafia the two shooters ran around with, and most importantly he never mentions the fascination with Adolph Hitler the two shared, April 20, 1999 would have been Hitler's 110th birthday. Throughout the movie, there is a flow of racism that Moore believes accounts for America's high murder rate, which makes the omission of Klebold's and Harris' Nazi fascination truly puzzling.There is a somewhat amusing animation piece in the movie that tracks America's fear of non-whites up to the present. The cartoon goes astray by linking the NRA to the KKK, and giving the best rebuttal to gun control in saying some of the first gun control laws in America prohibited blacks from owning arms. The movie ends when Moore walks up to Charlton Heston's home and just rings the buzzer. Heston answers and invites Moore back for an interview the next day. At the interview, the then 77 year old Heston holds his own, but Moore's relentless attack makes the legendary screen actor and civil rights activist seem befuddled and confused. Moore continues to pester Heston as to why Canada has a lower crime rate in proportion to their large gun ownership rate; Heston then comments on our mixed ethnicity. Moore asks him if he thought race was the cause of crime in America, and Heston flatly says no. However, many reviewers have picked that one sentence out to accuse Heston of being a racist. Heston may be many things but a racist is not one of them. Heston was one of the first of the few in Hollywood to march with Martin Luther King, Jr., and Heston, as president of the Screen Actor's Guild, fought for the inclusion of black directors and actors in Hollywood. Heston throughout 40 years has traveled the world on behalf of civil rights. Once again, Moore omits this and leaves it to the audience to make up their own minds. Moore then demands to know why the NRA is so insensitive as to hold a pro-gun rally in Denver only ten days after Columbine and one in Flint eight months after the Buell shooting. The Denver rally was not a PR plus for the NRA, but the Flint rally was months after and during a campaign season; for these reasons Heston looks confused as Moore accuses the NRA for kicking the locals when they are down. At that point Heston stands up, graciously thanks Moore for the interview, and leaves. Moore races after Heston with a picture of Kayla, but Heston continues down the path into his house. This scene I have a problem with, as it flashes from Heston walking away and Moore holding the picture. Two cameras were involved, but for one angle the cameraman would have had to race ahead of Heston to film Moore holding the picture.Is Bowling for Columbine manipulative and biased in the director's point of view? Yes. Is it contradictory? Yes. Besides the Nazi omission, Moore never covers gang violence and the violent gun culture within the gang and drug filled places of our country. More truly, Moore never actually answers any of his questions, and that maybe is the reason why this movie works. One distracting point is where Moore idiotically implies that the CIA gave millions to the billionaire bin-Laden and taught al-Qaeda how to fly planes into buildings, but if you can get past his leftist social agenda, Moore has created a very thoughtful film that is not as anti-gun as it is anti-violence but with a little anti-military and pro-socialist health care thrown in as well.</fullReview>

It would have saved me the time of watching the movie if at the start he would have just come right out and said that the reason behind this so called documentary was that he himself is the one with the irrational fear of guns and that he hopes to spread that fear with all who watch. He points out that corporations are the ones to fear because they are polluting the environment which is killing more people than guns yet I am sure that he traveled from place to place in a motorized vehicle spewing massive exhaust fumes in his wake. And after pointing out that business is bad for America he complains about large companies leaving neighborhoods which in turn leaves people left in these areas doomed to a life of poverty and despair.And of course to top it all off we the viewers finally learn who is indeed responsible for children killing children.....Its Charlton Heston,Dick Clark and Kmart...</fullReview>

All Michael Moore did was basically use news footage from a local CBS affiliate and added his own commentary. I saw the original feature story on Carey McWilliams of Fargo, and he was not going out for a morning walk, but rather, going with the news crew to shoot at six in the evening. Carey is a well educated man who received his training in the ARMY ROTC, where he received an A in pistol marksmanship. So, if anyone has issues with him shooting, they can argue with the army. He's been shooting since he was a teenager. I am not worried about him owning a gun. I know certain sighted people that I would worry more about if they had guns. You want to know a side of Carey that few people even look at? He's more then just some supposed gun-toting redneck. He's a writer, a husband and a dog lover who plays scrabble with his mom, according to his "wife's perspective" on his web page.

Of course, both of these statements are a lie. The irony here is that I got to hear both the anti-gun and pro-gun lobbies lie through their teeth in a single 24 hour period.This movie is so loaded with falsehoods that it can never be taken seriously.

		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine raises some good questions but fails to provide any answers. Unfortunately along the way it also dips into Coulter-esquire screeching that imperils the message it hopes to convey.Moore claims that the mass media's projections are what fuel American violence. Interesting, then, that his version of America reflects the pat generalizations of Hollywood genre films. America is shown as a dangerous, rotten place brimming with corruption and gun fire. His vision is so relentlessly dark that it could be the set of an action adventure screenplay--one where "the system" doesn't work, the "bad guys" are the source of everyone's problems, and showing bravado will win the day.This is what makes the high marks coming from European reviewers somewhat intriguing, particularly when it is claimed that this film shows America "as it really is." It may be that parts of this film reflect questions that Europeans wish America would ask of itself, but I suspect at least some of the support comes from confirmations of expectations formed by watching American television and movies. How ironic that many people praising this film might be doing so based on prejudices built by the very media that Moore condemns! Moore's attacks on Charlton Heston, mentioned in some detail in many other reviews, were sickening. Here he is at his worst, deliberately destroying another person's reputation to advance his own agenda. This segment amounts to libel and should have been removed from the film.Moore also implies that the U.S. has a particular history of strong arm tactics and tries to tie U.S. violence to our foreign policy. True enough that U.S. frequently uses such strategies, but when Moore tries to suggest that this quality is *unique* to the United States, even the smallest bit of objectivity betrays his point. Imagine for a moment the history of Germany, Japan, Italy, or Russia and you will see how flat this argument falls. Even France and Britian do not get off scot free, with major incidents in India and French-Indo China during the 20th century.Identifying your political affiliation has played a major roll in the reviews on this board, and no doubt some will dismiss me as an American right-wing nut. As it happens, I'm a left-leaning independent who ostensibly should be on Moore's side. But I disagree with his tactics. He strikes me as an egotist whose main objective is advancing his notoriety at the expense of others, and pandering to the lowest common denominator to achieve these goals. I think that while Bowling for Columbine raises many good questions, it ultimately hurt liberals more than it helped because it makes all of their arguments--many of which I agree with--look like arrogant whining. Ultimately, I can't recommend this film.My rating: 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was a disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review includes details of the film's content. Not so much spoilers, since the movie never gets any farther than "Dude, don't Republicans like totally suck?"This movie is not a documentary - it's propaganda. The only thing that fools people into thinking there's anything documentary about it is that it's not even very *good* propaganda. I'm not a particularly conservative person - I generally think some gun control is a good thing, rock music shouldn't be censored, our current welfare and health care systems are woefully inadequate, and more money should be spent on public schools than on missile development. And while we're at it, yes, Michael, slavery is bad and so is the death of children. Duh. But I left the theater disagreeing with Moore to a greater degree than when I entered. He presented incomplete, unsubstantiated, and scatterbrained arguments for all of the (way too many) political positions he attempted to preach. I spent the entire movie silently providing the counterarguments he willfully ignored, without the benefit of hearing how he might rebut them. And since I think I'm pretty smart, I did a good job of convincing myself with my counterarguments.In addition to the bias problems in structure and content, mentioned in detail by many, here are other random things that really irked me:--Music, video games, etc, have NO influence on children's level of violence, but watching news about Kosovo magically does? If the nightly news can make kids violent, why can't Marilyn Manson? His one-liner about how the Pres is more influential than himself is so conclusory it's dumb. Most kids don't even watch the news.--The question Moore posed to Charlton Heston, and then mockingly watched him flounder in answering, is a question that Moore himself never answers throughout the whole movie: the sheer popularity of guns can't be the cause of violence, because Canada has just as many guns as we do. So what causes it? As Heston struggles, on the fly, to come up with perhaps wrong but at least plausible suggestions for a puzzle that Moore himself can't answer, Moore's mockery seems uncalled for and in fact cruel. Heston doesn't end the interview because he doesn't care about 6-year-olds - he ends it because he's being verbally ambushed in his own home by a camera crew and a debate partner who won't fight fair. --Furthermore, insofar as Heston was slow on the rebuttal...Heston was diagnosed with **Alzheimer's Disease** about the same time as that interview was conducted - a fact Moore doesn't even bother to mention!--Moore barges into K-mart, pushing the crippled children in front of him as tools in his shock-value-rather-than-policy-debate argument strategy, and proceeds to accost the poor minimum-wage employees who work there. --The 16-year-old Canadians brag about how their neighbors' tax dollars pay all of their medical bills while *puffing on cigarettes*.--Moore leapfrogs among issues because he can't argue any one of them successfully enough to make his point. Then, when he's run out of pieces of argument, he switches to the final resource of the desperate demagogue: The psychological tool of rapidly juxtaposing jarring tragic images with images of his political foes, then heightening the emotional impact by adding familiar and beloved music that stands out starkly in message and tone from the images we're viewing. A sort of fireworks-display-finale masterpiece of film editing, effectively programming us to agree with what he could not persuade us to believe. So even if we don't remember any good arguments, we'll remember that we cried, and that somehow it was caused by Republicans.--Even if we ignore the fact this movie is horribly biased, it _still_ doesn't make any sense. There's no coherent conclusion to be drawn. Moore begins his documentary with an interesting question: What is the source of the staggering levels of gun violence in the United States, particularly among our youth? He then leaves this question completely unanswered. Even if I overlook all of Moore's intellectually dishonest techniques and leave the theater preaching Moore's road to salvation, my message would sound something like this: To decrease gun violence, I should start watching South Park instead of the evening news (because the news is depressing and violent, and that clever South Park creator has pluck!), stop locking my apartment door at night (because trust is good and fear is bad, and faith alone will save me from rape and murder), and stop eating at restaurants that employ poor people commuting by bus from far away (because their unattended children will get shot while they're at work, all because I wanted a burger). This doesn't make any sense at all.Moore doesn't have any more magical solutions than conservatives about how to stop Columbine from happening again. Not surprising, since the tragedy of youth violence is a complex social phenomenon that can hardly be addressed competently in a 2-hour montage of pop iconography and interviews with unprepared people.The only reason people think this movie has an important message is because they're not *listening* to the (lack of) message at all. They leave happy because the movie made them feel good; it made them feel good because it appeared to justify their prejudices against conservative politics. The irony is that the movie "justified" their political positions by playing off of those prejudices - by incoherently babbling in familiar-sounding vocabulary, pointing to trendy celebs who share their political leanings, and making people who disagree all look like buffoons. In short, when the audience clapped in the SOHO theater where I watched this, it was less a reflection on the quality of the movie than it was the audience congratulating itself on being liberal. It's that same self-congratulation that motivated the Democrat-dominated Academy to give this movie Best Documentary, not to mention classify it as a documentary in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers coming your way * I am practically speechless.... this movie was one of the most dishonest, manipulative pieces of tripe I have ever encountered. It was a despicable compilation of lies, twisted facts, misconstrued data, spliced footage and disingenuous narration. I can't even begin to list this movies specific faults. Michael Moore, a bloated crackpot, sways the audience with a totally biased film. This won an Oscar? For documentary? But it's fiction, not documentary, and moreover an ego trip. His whole bleeding heart agenda was nauseating, especially the leaving pictures of people on steps. His quiet, humble demeanor is a veneer over an arrogant, loudmouth bigot. Half of the interviews in here are with people that don't speak for half a percent of the American population. As if everyone who owns a gun is a wacko that kills for pleasure, or out of sheer rage. Please. What about the interviews with farmers who shoot wolves that kill their livestock, or rape victims who carry small arms, or hunters, or sportsmen? My grandmother owns a gun because she lives in a seedy area, rife with crime. She is also handicapped and cannot move fast. Well, what if someone tried to attack her or rob her? She'd be in an awful mess if the phone were not readily available. And does everybody with a gun have to shoot somebody? No, of course not. A lot of people are content with shooting cans, going to the shooting range, or hunting. Not everybody is a "gun nut". The statistics used are inaccurate at best. Hand gun killing also includes police putting down criminals and innocent civilians acting in self defense. What about all the knife murders or beatings? I'd like to see those stats. It's good that K-mart no longer sells bullets, now people can't get them anymore, especially extremely rare 9 mm rounds. Next lets hope they stop selling knives, so all murders using knives will be stopped. Way to blame K-mart and not the two ding dongs who shot up their school. This movie makes me want to be a lifetime member of the NRA just to spite Moore (Yeah, I know he is a member too, don't bother mentioning it, he's just a clown). The whole Heston segment was totally fabricated as well. After the Columbine bit, the "From my cold dead hands" quote was used over and over, as if he said it right then. That speech was from over a year after the massacre, in South Carolina, in response to being given a hand-crafted musket (Just look, the damn thing is in his hand). The NRA rally had also been planned months ahead of the massacre and to just not show up would have isolated the thousands of NRA members in Colorado and cost tens of thousands of dollars. He acts like Heston took a jet to Colorado in order to anger the victims as speedily as possible. Which leads us to Mr. Heston's unfair bashing. It's also easy to overlook Heston's history of marching and being active in the civil rights movement. He even marched with MLK Jr. So essentially, unless the whole segregation issue was solved seamlessly, with no violence, Heston's comments about violence being rooted in ethic mixing are just about right, but the way it was edited makes him look like some sort of monster. Bravo, you seething blob. Isn't he trying to shove the whole KKK thing down our throats anyway? Isn't that violence stemming from racial/ethnic mixing? As I seem to recall the KKK was trying to end ethnic mixing by murdering black people. Hmm...strange. And if you think their isn't violence still because of racial tension, you need to pull your head out of your ass. That whole interview is also extremely choppy, and highly edited, leading us to believe Heston is an inane racist. Most of his interviews are like that. He will ask some wise-ass question, then cut before it can be answered, leaving us to believe the person about to respond was some buffoon. Also, Moore pretends like America's history of violence is nonexistent, and compares it to Germany and the Holocaust, trying to lessen our sordid past. Guess what assclown, Hitler once said he admired the Indian Wars because of how efficiently we massacred Native Americans. Moore is a jackass, do not allow yourself to be addled by his ultraliberal BS. By the way, sweet rip-off of "Good Morning Vietnam" with the montage of violent images and "facts" over "What a wonderful world" by Louis Armstrong. I love the "Osama Bin Laden used his CIA knowledge to murder 3,000 people on September 11th" quote. I guess Osama asked the CIA how to hijack planes and crash them into buildings, as part of the usual CIA curriculum. A sizable chunk of people who like this movie just hate the Bush administration/conservatives anyway. Another large chunk of people who love this are just fruitloops who hate the United States to begin with. I am not going to go into detail, as I am running out of room, but plenty of lobotomy patients hailing from merry old England and Canada wrote some pretty scathing things about the United States. Well, here is one for you. For the most part "Bowling" is all a bunch of lies, and people just don't realize because Michael Moore pretends to be such a crusader. For someone who claims to champion the rights of the people by "exposing" corruption and lying, he is a filthy hypocrite. This movie sucked, and people shouldn't be molded into his little disciples just by watching this inflammatory crap. 1/10: Gutter ball. If you disagree, it might be time for you to join us in reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore is an embarrassment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The blatant attempt to turn the unfortunate death of a 6 year old girl in Flint Michigan into a call to arms against gun ownership in the United States is ludicrous and extremely callous. Does Michael Moore visit with the family of this little girl on a weekly, monthly, or even a yearly basis after the filming has stopped? If not, then why is it ok to place blame for this event on Charlton Heston, at the time the President of the NRA. Of course there can be no blame for the Uncle of the little boy who took this firearm into a school full of unarmed students and teachers. And this little boy has absolutely no responsibility for pointing and discharging a loaded firearm at one of his fellow students. Does anyone really believe he thought he was taking a cap gun or toy to school? Cornering Dick Clark in California because the little girl's mother had once been an employee at the Dick Clark Restaurant in Great Lakes Crossing at Auburn Hills was irresponsible. You can't play seven degrees of separation of Kevin Bacon when placing blame for a tragedy like this, it is disrespectful of the little girl's family and of society as a whole. When I was six years old and older we were taught to respect all firearms, and the most important lesson was a firearm was never to be pointed, loaded or unloaded, at another human being. That training was sponsored and administered by the NRA in my small Michigan hometown, 150 miles north of Flint. I never brought a gun to school, I've never pointed one at another human being, because I was taught to respect the sanctity of life and the tremendous responsibility that goes with utilizing a firearm. Any elementary school student can devise the point and tack that Mr. Moore is utilizing in trying to string the events referenced in his "film" together to point to the immorality inherent in the United States primarily due to the existence of the 2nd ammendment and the right to bear arms. It doesn't say: "The right to kill another human being". Mentioning the terrorists attacks of 09/11/01 and how they've turned the mass population of the U.S. into gun-toting lunatics is absurd. I would agree with his statistics that a large number of people in the U.S. bought guns and purchased home security systems. Why didn't we see corresponding data as to the increase in hand gun use, shootings, killings? Because those statistics would not have supported his arguments, therefore in his script they are irrelevant. Just like Natalie Maines has the right to her opinion about our President, so do I feel I've earned the right to state my opinion of Mr. Moore and his propaganda machine. As a veteran and native born son of the great state of Michigan, I am thoroughly and utterly ashamed that Michael Moore is from there. I have also been a resident of Flint Michigan more than one period in my lifetime. He attempted to make a comment on the social reforms for welfare recipients, in that laborers are forced to ride free transportation 40 miles from Flint to Auburn Hills, as the little girl's mother had, in order to earn a living. And also take that forced busing to serve "rich" people in Auburn Hills. As one of the "rich" people who have lived and shopped in Auburn Hills, I'd like Mr. Moore to locate my winter home in Boca Raton FLA, my 7 series BMW or Mercedes, my 10,000 square foot mansion in Oakland County. Because I must have misplaced them. I do remember losing my job once due to automotive layoffs in Oakland County and applying for work at Great Lakes Crossing, but that was because I was one of the filthy rich he refers to and I just wanted something to occupy my time! Michael Moore does not speak for the vast majority in Michigan, the United States, or the world community. Michael Moore has always only spoken for Michael Moore, it's his ultimate ego trip to attempt to contact the CEO of a major corporation and sling one-sided barbs in carefully edited dialogue at that person to serve his own warped sense of reality. I like most Americans feel sorrow and pain for the families of Columbine and Flint and everywhere criminals use weapons to kill other human beings. But the people responsible for those deaths are the callous, heartless, and coldblooded killers who consciously pickup a weapon and use it with the intent of inflicting great bodily harm on their fellow man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like being preached to, but given no choice, I'd prefer to see a film which doesn't blame one group of people for today's problems but rather looks for real solutions. But "Bowling" is not about solutions.Obviously only slightly less backwards than his home-town buddies, on whom he takes no mercy, Moore show's himself in "Bowling" to be an innocent mid-westerner who rarely sees much of the world and Her people outside of Flint Michigan. "Bowling" is proudly hailed by some as "incendiary". And of course it is. But in the current world climate, being so is really no trick. Hitler was "Incendiary" too back in the 40s! Should we be proud of him as well? Hitler blamed the poor "state of the union" on the Jews and Moore blames the poor "state of the union" on the "white man". A race which according to Moore has the unique distinction of being both incredibly cowardly AND viciously greedy. How convenient! Umm...can we say "racism"?Moore accosts the media for weaving tragedies and inciting fear, while at the same time manufacturing a few tragedies of his own and basking in the attention. He exposes the tactlessness of Charlton Heston's NRA speech and its chronological proximity of to the events at Columbine, while ignoring the disgracefulness of releasing an anti-American film so close to September 11th. Even more demoralizing than this movie was the crowd of lemmings surrounding me in the theatre; all cheering and laughing in perfect unison. None of whom seemed to recognize the inaccuracies of "Bowling's" historical implications. Lies that would repulse even Howard Zinn.You won't see dissident propaganda like this in countries like China, Russia, and Japan because people get killed for it. In Japan, the invasion of the Chinese mainland was REMOVED from the history books! "Bowling" confirms once again that in America we have the uncommon and fortunate privilege to say anything we like, anyway we please, and get away with it. It's IRONIC that Moore back-stabs the same system which provides him these rights. Don't you think?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine (2002): Dir: Michael Moore / Featuring: Michael Moore, Charlton Heston, Marilyn Manson, Matt Stone, George W. Bush: Brilliant documentary about gun possession in America. Title represents the fact that two teenagers who open fired in a Columbine school were earlier bowling. Michael Moore takes viewers on a dark and sometimes comical journey to discover compelling and disturbing facts. We learn that America is driven by fear sparked by media. Moore interviews rocker Marilyn Manson whose music was blamed for the Columbine incident. He also embarks upon the influence of entertainment and violence and interviews Matt Stone, one of the creators of the popular Canadian cartoon South Park. George W. Bush is also featured for mockery and regardless of one's view, Moore still makes his vision funny. Charlton Heston also appears in his pro gun rallies and Moore addresses the fact that his rally took place a week after the shooting of a six year old girl. Moore also makes discoveries in Canada and other countries about guns. He even joins two Columbine survivors in their approach to K-Mart, which sold the bullets embedded in their bodies. The film contains Moore cynical approach that is branded with his humorous insight and opinions. The film requires us to reflect upon life and how it can end with the senseless pulling of a trigger. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore: "If you were to talk directly to the kids at Columbine or the people in that community, what would you say to them if they were here right now?"Marilyn Manson: "I wouldn't say a single word to them I would listen to what they have to say, and that's what no one did".Bowling for Columbine is a documentary about the gun Violence in America is shown as Michael Moore looks for causes and answers from some of America's top opponents of gun control.Bowling For Columbine is one of best documentary's I've seen in a while. It's both unique and interesting with it's powerful look on gun violence in America and the Columbine shooting back in 1999. All this is shown in different type of tones, you got a brilliant sense of humor, a strong statement and the truth. Michael Moore to me is 50/50, I know a lot of people don't like him and not a lot of people do like him. Yeah sometimes he can come off as jerk when it comes to interviews and some of the topics that he focus on, but I got to admit he sometimes comes up with some clever ideas to support he's statement and proving he's point to everyone, even when some may not agree. I don't hate the guy as these much more people out there that are even worse (like Katie Hopkins. If you don't know who she is look her up, she's a horrible human being). Moore is trying to get he's worries out about the fact that you can walk up to a counter of a gun shop and say "Can I have a gun please", and they give it to you and that person may shoot others if it falls into the wrong hands, and I can understand him right there even when Moore can take it to another level of forcing it in people faces which makes him look like a jerk to some.The documentary jumps around to different places and people by hearing their thoughts on the gun problem and the Columbine Massacre. All opinions are mixed and this documentary is like a time capsule of what the people and the whole controversy bullsh*t that was happening back then was like. I always love those kind of documentary's that show you a bit of the past and everybody's thoughts back then, it's just so interesting. The ending scene with Michael Moore interviewing Charlton Heston was both brilliant and it was hard to look away it was that strong. People may not like that scene has Moore is forcing the message down his throat, but I sawed something else then that, I sawed Moore trying to something right even when it might not be the thing but at least he's trying to prove he's own point. Now for the problems: My only little problem with the documentary and it's only a ant size problem and that's when they talk about the Columbine High School Massacre and they talk about what may cause Eric and Dylan (The shooters of the massacre) to start shooting by on that day. They brought up that it might be violence on TV, violence in movies and games and they even brought up bowling as one, but they didn't bring up bullying and to those who didn't know, Eric and Dylan was bullied really bad and they were out cast of the school as nobody really cared for them, maybe that's why they did it, for revenge. The documentary didn't bring that up and I was wondering why they didn't put that in.Overall Bowling for Columbine is a Documentary that's worth recommending and worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bowling for Columbine was almost a perfect strike for gun-control, but some of its facts is a bit loose, like a turkey neck.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is probably, filmmaker Michael Moore's most famous film. The documentary explores the reasons of gun violence, by looking into the gun culture of the U.S. In doing so, he learns that the conventional answers of easy availability of guns, violent entertainment, violent national history, &amp; even poverty are inadequate to explain this violence when other cultures share those same factors without the equivalent carnage. In order to arrive at a possible explanation, Moore takes on a deeper examination of America's culture of fear, bigotry and violence. Furthermore, he seeks his own investigation and confront the powerful elite political and corporate interests in fanning this gun culture for their own greedy gain. With his signature sense of awkward humor, the activist filmmaker pretty much change, how documentaries are shown. Love him or hate him, he has been the most influential documentary filmmaker of the past 30 years. Gone are the days of monotone narrating lectures. In are the more playful, and colorful documentaries full of funny cartoons, cool graphics to transfer information and perspective, catchy music tunes, pop culture references, and celebrity talking heads interviews. Very entertaining. The documentary also has a lot of heart &amp; sad moments, includes a number of disturbing scenes to illustrate its points, such as footage of real-life people being shot, gun suicides, assassinations, battle footage, and so on. Perhaps most terrifying, the movie includes security camera footage from the Columbine High School massacre. These scenes are brief, but effectively horrifying. It can be hard to watch, at times. Moore's techniques and message are so powerful and persuasive and his scruffy, paunchy everyman image so likable that it won the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2003. Still, the movie is without its faults. I'm not a ring-wing propagandist, but I found a lot of doubt in Moore's credibility information. Moore was often called out for his somewhat deceiving practices. He does like to edit some of the interviewee's responses to make it seem like they agree with his statements. A good example of this is the sequence with South Park co-creator Matt Stone. Stone was just there to talk about high school life at Columbine, but the movie made it seem like he was for 'Gun Control' by twisting his words, and making it seem like Stone help created the animation sequence in the film about the history of guns. Clearly, South Park Studios have no hand whatsoever in making the segment and Stone thought the cartoon that Moore presented was complete BS. This disagreement, cause Matt Stone and Trey Parker to put a negative caricature of Moore in 2004's Team America: World Police as retaliation. Moore's investigation was supposed to carry out ostensibly to uncover subversive activities, but actually felt more like harassment and undermined those that of different views than Moore. Most of them, don't really have much of a connection to the problems of gun violence. A good example of this is when Moore tries to link television producer Dick Clark with really irrelevant evidence to the murder of a six-year-old by a six-year-old, because the boy's mother worked at one of Clark's restaurants in a welfare-to-work program. Yes, Clark did kinda dodges Moore's questionings, but I really doubt Dick Clark is to blame for this tragedy. He didn't really hand the gun to the kid and force him to kill the other child. After all, it's more like the gun owner's fault. Sad, to see the movie makes Clark look like the devil. Another bad judgment call by Moore, was his relentless questioning during an interview with a clearly memory-impaired Charlton Heston whom by this time, was suffering from both cancer &amp; Alzheimer. Moore clearly took great advantage of Heston's weakness to make Heston look like a fool. When Moore asks Heston why he continues to taunt communities that just underwent gun-related tragedies by holding his ridiculous rallies, Heston couldn't provide any answers. The reasons for this is that Moore implied that the National Rifle Association deliberately scheduled its annual conferences to exploit the Columbine shootings, when the truth of the matter is the conference had been scheduled months or years in advance. Moore also accused Heston of holding an NRA rally right after a shooting in Flint; however, the footage he used was of Heston visiting the city almost a year later for a campaign event. Throughout the movie, Moore strung together snippets from several of Charlton Heston's speeches to make them sound like one arrogant speech. Moore has really gone to great lengths to misleading the audience. Another good example is where Moore goes to a bank which was giving away a free rifle to anyone who opened an account with them. What Moore didn't show, was the bank actually handed out, was an certificate for a free rifle at a gun store down the street, where the store performed the same background checks and waiting-period requirements as if a customer had walked in to buy a rifle with cash. There are way too much countless amounts of distorted information, throughout the documentary to noted, here. It's really up to the audience to decide what is truth and what's false, but I do advice people to do their research when going to see this movie, because this film clearly need further investigating. While, his research is up to debate and there are some good points that Moore brings up. My favorite is Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World" playing over footage of the atrocities by various US-backed regimes. To his credit, he's not exactly anti-gun ? or doesn't seem to be; rather, just like me, just curious about gun-culture and believe a little gun-control is needed. Overall: I give Moore credit for this film as gun control not an easy topic to talk about. I just wish, his facts were a little more solid. Sadly, it was not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On April 20, 1999 two students opened fire on their classmates at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. It left 13 people dead and many more injured, gravely affecting the lives of those involved and stirring up a very loud gun control debate. In 2001, Michael Moore released Bowling for Columbine, a documentary that takes a look at gun violence in America and the things that make us the nation with, by far, the most gun related deaths per year. Moore examines the culture of America and just how we got this way through fear, paranoia, and vast over compensation to protect ourselves from something that isn't even there.Michael Moore is obviously very liberal, and this comes through in almost everything he says or does. There is a lot of politics that go into his filmmaking, especially in this film that was released amidst the Bush administration. A lot of personal opinion goes into his filmmaking and he presents a very left wing point of view. Moore also employs plenty of theatrics and some overly dramatic moments in his film to get a point across. However, said point is incredibly important and it is laid out very clearly and very concisely throughout Bowling for Columbine.Politics play a part in Moore's arguments, but they don't overshadow the basis of what he is trying to prove. In this film, he clearly outlines America's gun crazy culture fueled by paranoia, and if you just take a look around you will know that he has a point. Sure he finds the most ridiculous stories and the greatest examples to push his point, but in the broad generalization of what he is examining you can't say that he's wrong.Interestingly enough, things haven't changed much in our culture in the eleven years this film has been out. America still thrives on fear, and we still fear the same things we did when this movie was made. It was incredibly interesting watching this film after the recent events in Aurora, Colorado because anything Moore says about Columbine can easily be related to our most recent tragedy. It proves that Moore has, rather unfortunately, made a timeless film that looks at an issue that seems to never go away, instead only getting worse. Moore tackles some disturbingly true topics about gun violence and fear, and he puts it all into his perspective very well in a very high quality documentary. Bowling for Columbine is an excellent film that people in America truly have to watch. Moore points out some sad but very prevalent truths in this film, and there is a lot to be learned from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine is a film directed by the controversial director Michael Moore, who has been subject to different opinions regarding social issues and very timely. Normally this famous film director addresses issues that people dare not mention for its harshness and radical. This film is crumbling and study a certain American social sector characterized by its close relationship with firearms and their lack of fear or respect with regard to violence such as fights, shootings and all sorts of problems ...To show the problem of violence and the close relationship with the existing firearms in different places in the U.S. The use different examples such as the tragedy in a school called Columbine which is located in a village called Little town with weapons as protagonists. One of the main themes of the film is the strong influence of media on society in general and the great fear and ignorance with which one lives daily in addition to efforts to find different routes and ways to find events or persons guilty of all social problems in general. It would be very interesting to see this movie because it is a good way to try to understand how it really is and what values make up the U.S. society. It is obvious that there is a corrupting factor explained and argued with the data provided on the development of the film such as the murder rate produced per year, the volume of arms sales... It is curious to see how when they ask the ordinary people the reasons for the killings in his country, and they blame the divorce, violent films or hatred between citizens without make any reference to the rulers or their own fears. This film is excellent to see how it can be the human being manipulated without realizing it. It is one of the movies which have impacted me in a long time. Whit it, you have the reality as it is and you realize that there really are people and acts as savage as those we see in these images.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not being a fan of Michael Moore politically or in general, I felt I needed to watch this film for two reasons. One, I currently am a High School student and have been interested in the subject of Columbine for a few years, and two because the second amendment is something I believe in. I wondered how a documentary like this could be made, and what kind of source information would be used to back it up. In other words, I had a million questions, and two hours worth of answers.This is the first Moore film I watched from start to finish. I turned off Capitalism: A Love Story because I didn't believe in it, and I couldn't comprehend everything being thrown on the screen. I've been saving Fahrenheit 9/11 and Sicko for when I'm older so I could give a mature review of those films, respectively. I shy away from a lot of political documentaries because I fear one slip of the tongue or keyboard will result in a gigantic uproar. I hate politics, I know very little about them, and I don't believe I should lose fans or a friendship for which side of the ballot I support.Bowling for Columbine explores America's unhealthy obsession with firearms. He questions why America had over 11,000 gun murders in the year 2002, and Canada had such a mere comparison to that. Canada gets all the same television, video games, and weaponry we do. Why is their gun death toll so low compared to ours? It's not only shocking, but scary as well. That was 2002. I couldn't imagine what shocking number it's at now.I'm a heavy American supporter, but this is the kind of thing that taints our reputation and is another red flag other countries use to bash us. This needs to stop. What are we doing wrong? Is it because the USA's first instinct when something is wrong is to fight back, and not simply talk it over? The documentary is humorous in places, but you question if what you're laughing at is right. BOC has quite a few bad laughs, but a number of serious points to put the movie back on track. My favorite scene is the animated American history lesson shown about half way through the film. That was well done. Funny, yes. True, shockingly.My favorite scene in the film was when Moore takes Columbine shooting victims Mark Taylor and Richard Castaldo to the K-Mart headquarters in Troy, Michigan to demand a refund for the seventeen cent bullets still lodged in both the boy's bodies. I won't ruin anything about the scene, but it's definitely what sealed the deal to me saying "this is a good Michael Moore film." Bowling for Columbine is factual, and interesting as far as documentaries go. It's difficult to review them because you can't really critique the acting or production values, and it seems like you're just rehashing events in the film and stating which ones you liked. No documentary I've reviewed like Going to Pieces and Google Me I've felt I've done proper justice to. But I can't recall the last time I extremely hated a documentary.Starring: Michael Moore. Directed by: Michael Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this documentary in class today, the day I am typing this review. It was pretty interesting, but it is obviously biased towards Michael Moore's point of view. Thankfully, I agree with him on this film.This documentary provides you with a load of interesting facts, such as murder numbers, and also an amusing cartoon animation. Unfortunately, this is also a bit dated of a documentary, so that could be a reason why the fact that the Columbine shooters bowled everyday before school was not a fact, which may have ruined the title "Bowling for Columbine". Maybe Michael Moore didn't know.This film should not be taken too lightly, because there is a very serious point to this. I think you would love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>is gun control possible Mr.Moore?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i saw BFC and it raises some interesting questions,discusses more than the question of guns but gun possession is the main subject. What this documentary doesn't go into is whether gun control is possible in the US in the first place? He does convince Wal-mart to not sell guns and ammunition but is that the answer to gun possession?obviously not. Moore tells us that many people are afraid in the US and feel they need guns to protect themselves.Thats true enough.But what he doesn't say is that these people do not believe that any law or restriction will disarm those individuals who might be criminals. If people really thought no dangerous individual would be able to get his hands on a gun,or at least it would be extremely hard for would-be criminals to get a gun,,they probably wouldn't feel they need guns themselves.But how realistic is this? Most people believe that a gun restriction will disarm most law-abiding folks but criminals will always get guns. Its kind of immaterial whether you agree or disagree with gun possession in theory when deep down you believe it cannot be properly enforced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to applaud Moore for putting together a technically proficient documentary that will make you think about the roots of America's gun violence issues. That being said, you'd be a fool to blindly accept what he says/shows as truth.Like the media that he lampoons he has no answers and is just trying to assign the blame to a scapegoat that fits his ideals. He makes some compelling arguments but he also alters or omits facts that would be hurtful to his cause. I also don't believe for a second that he truly cares about the people who are actually affected by the issue. To him they are just pawns to be used in putting gun advocates in an awkward position.I am from Canada and I didn't see the Canadian segment as being that far from the truth but when Moore shifts his lens to his home country I have to wonder how much manipulation of the facts is going on. I believe in gun control but I also appreciate the position of gun enthusiasts protecting their rights. Sure, it's bad form for the NRA to hold rallies in close proximity to tragedy but they're only taking steps against those that are trying to rob them of their civil liberties. I would be very surprised if the number of gun murders committed by NRA members was anything other than miniscule. They're just a convenient scapegoat.And yet, Moore attacks these and other groups as if they are personally responsible for the problem. Nobody in the film has concrete answers, let alone Moore himself. Therefore, it's best to use this documentary as a springboard for thought. Consider it as a means of provoking questions, not providing answers. In that respect, the film performs admirably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought provoking, very biased documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has along history of billing himself as "the voice of the People" in his films. He is good at making documentaries that are thought provoking and entertaining. Bowling for Columbine is a mix of what is good and bad about his efforts. This film deals with guns, and how the US is the country that has more violence than any other because of lack of gun control. He makes his point by using the tragedy at columbine the center of the film. He talks to survivors of the ordeal, and one can't help from feeling terrible for them. He goes to Canada where he finds that there are many people own guns there but the crime rate is much lower. He is very good at putting forth what he believes is the truth, he blames corporate america for virtually everything, he does not believe that people are responsible for there actions. Here is where I think that the film loses its way, he shows the people that are owners of weapons as all nuts, he corners them into looking like bafoons, they very well may be but Moore is not at all objective, he should present both sides and let the audience decide. I for one, am for more gun control, but a documentary should be more honest about showing the subject more honestly. At one one point Moore blames the murder of a first grader by another first grader on Michigan's welfare to work program, the mother was not around when her kid found the gun. No personal responsabilty is placed on the mother for this, its the state's fault. Moore also appears in the film going to Kmart with 2 Columbine victims to try to get them to stop selling bullets. Even if he is sincere in this, he makes it seem that he is almost omnipotent, having ALL the answers. The film is a documentary but there are scenes that are obviously staged and seem to be set up only to make Moore look like he is some kind of saint.It is not to say that the film shouldn't be seen, it is very gripping and very funny at times, and I agree with SOME of Moore's ideas, but he should try to present the subject more even handedly, it would cause a more healthy and intelligent debate!Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..and there are several, its hard to argue with the main thrust of the argument put forward in this film, that there is something wrong with the sheer numbers of people that die as a result of America's obsession with guns. Whilst it might step on the toes of Bush-fans and the right, it nonetheless, is a worthy way to spend a couple of hours watching...Yes, it does have its cheesy moments and some of the events seem somewhat planned, but some of the more powerful moments of the film is when Moore does not even need to talk, the camera footage of the Columbine shootings, the phone calls of terrified students, the call of the teacher with a dying 6-year old in front of her...This documentary also at least makes the effort to place it within the context of how politicians contribute to, not alleviate poverty, how can a parent be there for a child when they work multiple jobs at restaurants for pay that barely meets poverty levels...The point about sensationalized news coverage is a good one that can be corroborated in many academic media studies, in that the media don't tell people what to think, but rather what to think about, in this case the bogey man that waits around every corner that is out to get all (white) Americans... ..and whilst I can appreciate and love freedom, the freedom to arm yourself can so ever easily become the freedom to kill, and what does that do to other people's freedom?</fullReview>

Michael Moore is right that in that he is just a working class guy with no proper education, it shows.

		<shortDescription>Shocking, thought-provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite frankly, I was only semi-curious about seeing this documentary, mainly because of my utter disgust for Michael Moore, who protested the very war I was supporting (I'm supporting my President, I don't know what he was thinking). But, after finding out that it was a good idea to see it because of my disliking of the 2nd Ammendment and the National Rifle Association, I gave it a shot. I'm glad I did.Documentarian Michael Moore poses the question: "Are we a nation of gun nuts, or are we just plain nuts?" as he explores the issues behind the NRA and the 2nd Ammendment, and the connection between gun-craziness and the Columbine High School massacre in April 1999. He interviews several people from Littleton, Colorado, meets with Charlton Heston, and presents shocking statistics about gun deaths and the history of dictators, and much more.Much of this documentary was startling--especially the statistics. Over 11 thousand gun deaths in the United States last year, compared to 39 deaths in China, and significantly lower deaths in other countries? Scary!!!! The footage of dictators to the song "What a Wonderful World" with the final image of the segment being the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks was startling at best. However, the lighter fare that "A Brief History of the United States" (I swear, I was hysterical laughing during this segment) is great. It's a short, badly drawn cartoon that depicts the history of our nation in a short, cut-and-dry manner, complete with the patriot with a southern accent stating "I loves my gun! LOVES MY GUN!" was priceless.I'm a conservative Republican, and there is a major misconception among people who don't have much knoweledge of the political system that Republicans swear by the NRA. Wrong. I don't like the NRA, and many of the Republicans I know don't like the NRA either.The images I won't soon forget were of the poor Flint, Michigan neighborhoods, the footage of the massacre at Columbine, the picture of 6-year old school shooting victim Kayla Rowland, and the footage of the the evil Charlton Heston shouting "From my cold dead hand!"I work in a video store, and was able to obtain a demo copy of "Bowling for Columbine," which won't be on video or DVD until August 19, 2003. My boss saw the movie and told me that because of my political beliefs, I would need to see this movie. I'm REALLY glad I did, as I now appreciate the genius that is Michael Moore, even if I don't completely agree with him protesting the war. I highly recommend renting or buying this when it is released on video and DVD, so everyone can see that we are truly a nation that loves our guns--LOVES OUR GUNS! Sorry, I had to throw that in.</fullReview>

After seeing this, I was speechless.Michael Moore showed me the world I was never aware of. Hollywood normally shows us the bright side of being American citizen, with nice houses in suburbs, great looking skyscrapers, state of the art technology, rich people,...while Moore on the other hand, bravely presented the darker side. The side that is , for us, who live in the wealthier side of Europe, unknown. I was shocked to see this kind of poorness, neglect neighbourhoods, uneducated people, etc.Well since this is a comment of the movie, not the system, I should write a review of a documentary.

		<fullReview>Overall, I think the film is a success. It does not go on a gun-bashing campain, but focuses on the perpetual fear that Americans have.I think even pro-gun people will take to this movie. Why do they need guns? Because they are afraid? Let's not forget that the movie points out that there are 7 million guns in Canada, and very few gun related deaths. The film shouldn't, given this, conclude that guns are the cause for murder, and it doesn't.Some gripes about the film:I live in Vancouver, Canada, and I lock my doors. I've been broken into twice, I just like to lock the doors so I don't forget to lock them when I go out. Not everyone in Canada is living with a turnstile on their front lawn.The Heston interview was good, I feel sorry for the guy, Moore was relentless, but leaving the picture behind was VERY cheesy, un-called for, and contrived. The point was a dead horse by then, no need to push it further.I wish the film had more interviews with people who are blamed for the way America is (Matt Stone, Marilyn Manson). I thought those two interviews were the best in the movie, while the obvious flogging of Heston and Clark were too FOX-25.I would recommend this movie to everyone, and then ask them why they are afraid? My personal answer is that Fear = Ratings = Money. Racism and gunlaws aside, it's the media that perpetuates the fear. BFC definitely brings this out in parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but ends on a low note. Moore gives incredible evidence, but comes up with an irrelevant conclusion -- that Charlton Heston and Kmart are kinda slimy."Bowling" begins by focusing on what we would call gun "wackos." Then the movie focuses on teenagers. Then the focus is on fear. Finally, it focuses on the NRA.The best part of "Bowling" is definitely the exploration of fear -- "why are americans so paranoid, and so murderous?" But unfortunately, Moore gives up on this question, and instead devotes the last part of the movie (basically the conclusion) on a crusade against Kmart and the NRA.Moore could have edited the movie differently, making the emphasis (the conclusion) about fear. I think the Marilyn Manson interview would have been a powerful ending. But for some reason, Moore decided that exposing Charlton Heston is more important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary was great. It made me reflect on a lot of things that have happened in the history of the United States. There are a lot of things wrong with this country, and people really are sometimes too lazy to see it or just to do something about it. You will see why, if you just watch this documentary. I mean, why have a gun? People say it's for protection, and I say, from what? We pay a lot of taxes just for security, shouldn't we be secure enough? Other people say that we have the right because the law gives us the right to do so, and that accidents are not accidents until a certain point. If a boy hit his sister with a belt, you wouldn't punish your kid while he is holding the belt would you? The first reaction of a parent would be to take the belt away from the kid, and then the rest would vary from parent to parent. But its always the same reaction: the weapon shouldn't be in the hands of the aggressor while he is being punished. Now, everyone says that Americans have a very violent past, shouldn't we take the weapons from the violent children of this country (and I don't mean ?children' literally)? If a law says that I have the right to do something, that doesn't mean that I have to do it. The film has a way of showing this without apologizing, things are messed up and something has to be done about it.I definitely like this documentary for a lot of reasons, but the main one was because when the news came out of the little girl that was shot and killed by another kid of the same age, I felt unease and I didn't know how the kid should be punished for this. But in reality, I didn't look into the bigger picture, that is, how did he ever get a gun? Why wasn't there an adult to supervise the kid? Where were the parents? Oh, he only has a mother? The mother has to travel to another town to work all day in two jobs and when she comes home it's already too late at night, and she barely sees her kid. Why was she working so far in the first place? It just keeps going and going. It just doesn't end with the kid; it's a higher and more complicated problem that has to do with the disintegration of the family and the limited opportunities that a person with economic problems has to go through. I didn't know this, and I, at the time, was just blaming the kid because that's what the media is primarily interesting in. I didn't get the whole picture because that was not important in this society; the hottest news sells faster, without going into depth about it. I can't deny that this movie made me reflect on a lot of things and made my opinions about certain things stronger. One of then being that it's actually hard to find a celebrity to take responsibilities for his or her actions. People usually blame, accuse or make fun of some celebrities that are guilty of some crime or some incident, but I found that there is no lower being than the one that doesn't take the responsibilities for his or her own actions.So please see this film if you have the chance. I don't think anybody would regret it, and besides the worst thing that this film would make you do is ?to think.' I understand that the shots of this film would not appeal to a lot of people, but ?think' about the meaning of the film as opposed to its artistic value. I have to say this because that was the first thing that popped-out as I watched this movie was, `I'm going to move to Canada.' What I mean is, if a movie shows you and makes you feel that Canada is a better place to live and to raise your kids in, then there is something really wrong here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the movie. It provided and interesting look at one of America's ongoing problems.I read a comment that blamed the American Civil war for the gun's and violence problem in the US, but I think this is not entirely correct. Europe has seen many more wars on its soil than America ever has, and even in peaceful sleepy Canada, the French and English battled each other on numerous occasions.I think the real problem stems from an imbalance of power. The rich keep getting richer at the expense of the poor. Which is great if you are rich, but causes a lot of trouble if you are the poor.I think that Canada and some other countries are not as violent because of socialism. It's sort of a Robin-Hood-type of equalizer. The rich are not so rich (mainly because of all the taxes) and the poor not so poor (social programs). This eliminates some(but by no means all) of the reasons why people turn to crime and violence. Drugs are another good reason for violence, but I think drugs are also related to poverty (with some good old self-destructive human nature added in for good measure). You need only look to some more politically unstable countries to see much of the trouble being caused by a few powerful wealthy groups totally dominating the poorer masses.Another thing that Moore attempts to show is the level of influence the press has on shaping opinion. In the US, the media is much more interested in showing what will sell than showing a balanced view of society. This ends up skewing our perceptions of American society and propagating stereotypes. I noticed during the Olympics that American stations were only showing events that involved American athletes (which would likely garner better ratings), when here in Canada they showed more comprehensive coverage of events even if no Canadian athletes were winning medals. Who would have thought a government sponsored press would show a more balanced view of things that a free market one.Anyway, this movie in my opinion does do a good job of bringing to light some interesting issues that most of the rest of the media wouldn't touch.</fullReview>

Additionally it seemed to me, that in the second half Michael Moore tried too much to get serious in order to drive the message home and to justify why he made this movie.

In my opinion there is little to no validity to the statement that this documentary is missing something.

Denying all of the truthful information that this documentary gives the audience, is just pure foolishness and stubborness. The film isn't necessarily telling people what should be outlawed, or what shouldn't be allowed, but rather that our country in general has severe psychological issues that we dismiss and deny. I would also have to say that someone I never liked, made the most perfect points of the movie. If you watch this movie pay very close ear to Marilyn Manson when he is interviewed. This movie is drawing so much buzz because it is a massive thought provoking masterpiece! This documentary is the best living proof that ignorance, and fear are easily the most deadly forces known to mankind! 9 out of 10!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always enjoyed Michael's Moore's work. His goal is to make people think but to do in a way that is entertaining enough to make you pay attention.In this movie Moore (Roger and Me) takes on the issue of why America has such violent crime and why Americans are so violent. Moore does this by looking at all aspects of the subject in a humorous way (Could it be this? No that doesn't seem right). Therefore, when it seems like he is being contradictory he is actually looking at the subject in an exhaustive way. He looks at every possible answer. Conclusion: There probably isn't an answer. In my view, the only time he comes close is when a Canadian tells him that Americans are too impulsive and react more than think and he connects it with fear and having too easy of ability to get guns.Before going into the theatre I expected a biased view (I'm a moderate Democrat.). However, I was struck by how balanced the film was. Moore criticized liberal thinking as well as conservative thinking. I was with two other people one who is an independent with libertarian tendences, and another Democrat who is basically apolitical. All three of us agreed this movie was very fair. By the way, Moore also mentions that he grew up using guns, another example of balance.It strikes me that the people who are criticizing this film are using an incredible amount of name calling instead of saying what they specifically do not like about it. If you choose to give an opinion on this forum please make it substantive. Calling Moore a fat liberal does not count.In conclusion, it struck me that the people in America who really need to see this movie would not go near it. That is unfortunate.A great, enjoyable, funny, sobering film. I give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

I personally would like to thank Mr Moore for this more than enlightening film. And I hereby request making it mandatory for every student in the US and elsewhere around the globe. It's revealing, emotional, intense, witty, funny, appalling, interesting and just so true, that it's hard to believe that no other film maker either had the vision or the guts (or both) to do it. Moore combines cynical comedy, reality TV, archive footage, "disarming" interviews and cartoon sequences and manages to make his point without being pretentious. I (being a German who lived and worked for some time in the US and who still loves this amazing country) get sad and angry with those people who don't see (or don't want to see) the necessary changes which have to be made in order to REALLY transform the US into a country with admirable ideals such as Life, Liberty, the Pursuit of Happiness and PEACE, I might add. Great Film! Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking out of the cinema after watching this film, I gained a new appreciation of living in a country like Australia. The American obsession with the gun is nothing short of frightening. The argument that Americans are more violent due to their history is cleverly debunked allowing the interviewees to shoot themselves in the foot (pun intended!). Moore shows the power that the media can wield for the good of the community in harassing K-mart into withdrawing ammunition from their stores. Could have been a little shorter but a solid insight into the American mindset. Hopefully Americans who watch this will think long &amp; hard at where their society is heading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing "Bowling for Columbine", I do not believe that I will be able to look at my world through the same naive eyes ever again. While I was already for gun control and realized the horrors which guns could bring to people and their families, the images which this documentary brought to my attention will be forever burned into my memory. It's amazing how now, in 2003, years after the events transpired in Columbine, the footage and 911 calls can still horribly upset me. This film was tear-jerking, yes. But it certainly was not just "for effect". I found the montage of the US's history of violence to be exceptionally touching, if that's the right word. Culminating with a shot of the second Twin Tower being hit by the airplane, it's clear to see that what the US got, as terrible as it may have been, was no worse than the acts which we have done to so many other countries. Our history of supporting violence is appalling. This film has changed me forever. It has made me realize the true level of hypocrisy and idiocy which our country exhibits. I hope that everyone will make every attempt to see this film and will then take a stand against guns and the violence which they cause.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Bowling for Columbine last weekend at an independent theater and I was very impressed by the film. At times I and the rest of the people there to see the film were laughing and the next moment we'd all be horrified by what we saw. I liked how Michael Moore was able to seriously question America's obsession with guns, but also make the film humorous at the same time. The film raises some very thoughtful questions as to why our country does have so many deaths by gun shootings and I especially enjoyed how Michael Moore asked several different people why they thought America has so many deaths from gun shootings including Marilyn Manson and Charlton Heston. A week after seeing the film I am still asking myself the many questions brought up in the film. I would recommend that everyone go to see this film. There were some graphic scenes but it's only what would be expected from a movie titled Bowling for Columbine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only just saw this movie yesterday, after months of public discussion/publicity about it. It lives up to the talk; powerful, thoughtful and disturbing. Inspired by the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado a few years back. (How sad that to many "Columbine" now recalls those horrible events, rather than the lovely mountain wildflower the school was named after...) It has many memorable moments, including interviews with Canadian teenagers about the differences between our two nations; and when K-Mart responds to a visit from kids wounded at the high school my discontinuing carrying bullets for handguns and assault rifles. Usually, I object to tear-jerking, but this isn't so bad. The image of then-National Rifle Association President Charlton Heston's profound cowardice which closes the film will stay with me for a long time.Everyone should see this film. And bring your friends and family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though the movie has an extremely subjective point of view and sometimes provides us with rather simple explanations for not so simple coherences, it still makes a very good case for the matter of gun control. But I have also realized that this movie provokes an emotion it was actually making responsible for all the misery: fear!I might be much of the same opinion about easily accessible guns inducing deadly confrontations, but despite strong gun control, public health care, little hysteria and elaborate social services there has still been a school massacre in my country recently. So, what was the reason for that? I do not know the answer, either. But I am very happy that the US brought up an entertaining movie which initiated a discussion about the problem. At last, something healthy is coming from over there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bowling for Colombine" is an interesting documentary in that it doesn't really give the audience an answer to it's primary question: why are Americans so violent? Although a number of factors are raised, none of them really provide a full answer. Perhaps it is a combination of a violent history, lots of guns and fear, but that's not ever explicitly stated.Micheal Moore does ramble a bit across Bowling... which may annoy those in the audience wanting an easy A to B to C style documentary, but the loose collection of topics covered by Mr Moore very rarely drifts off target. If anything the lack of focus on any one topic / event provides the viewer with a greater look at the eccentricities of the US cultural psyche. Bowling... becomes greater than the sum of its parts by showing a wide range of topics where the answer hasn't been expressly decided before the footage has been shot.There are some flaws - the Heston interview is arguably sensationalist and misfires; Bowling... possibly goes on too long which weakens its impact. That said, the US is a better place for having people like Micheal Moore who are willing to ask the difficult questions. With luck, Bowling for Colombine will spark a discussion in the US about a topic that sorely needs examination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So let me start by saying that this is one of the best documentary/movies ever made. There is no doubt. I for one MASSIVELY appreciate Michael Moore's movie and I believe everyone should watch it. Not just Americans. There's more to gun crime than just America, don't forget. This film will make you laugh. Don't let that make you think it's a comedy. That couldn't be further from the truth. You'll laugh because of how ridiculous the gun situation truly is. You'll laugh when you see how pathetic people like Dick Clark and Charlton Heston are. I find it astonishing that just because Heston's an actor and a member of the NRA, he has the right to hold NRA meetings and be a spokesperson for them. Admittedly, Dick Clark is an arse for reasons other than guns, but an arse nonetheless. And the media...? Don't get me started... A fine point there by Moore in that respect.Anyway, 'enjoy' the movie. There's much to gain from watching it. Kudos to Michael Moore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERSI walked out of this film more inspired, more outraged, and more gosh darn entertained then I had in ages. This film is compulsory viewing. I think that every high school in Canada and the United States should get a copy of this film and screen it for their students, which is something I have never said about a film before. This film's message is powerful, especially towards teenagers: Do not buy into the fear. Think for yourself. You can make a difference.Sure, Michael Moore's film-making style can sometimes be infuriating, especially when his ambush-style interviews miss the target - such as the tacky and out of place Dick Clark mini-van scene in Columbine. But for each scene that falls flat, there are countless scenes that will have you laughing through your tears or giggling in fear. From the opening scene where Moore receives a gun for opening an bank account to the ambush of Moses himself, Charlton Heston, Bowling for Columbine steam rolls over it's subject matter with righteous anger and acidic wit, while somehow managing to honor the events at Columbine with compassion and grace.What makes Columbine work so well is that Moore never loses sight of one very important fact: owning a gun is seductive. Owning a gun is empowering. Owning a gun, for lack of a better word, is fun. As a card-carrying member of the NRA and former champion marksman, Moore has a tremendous intimacy and understanding of why human beings love guns. He understands the joy of loading the carbine. Of aiming, and pulling the trigger and hitting a bulls-eye. The most sensible people in BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE are the Michigan Militia, who are normal every day folks who know and respect the power of guns.Moore understands that having your finger on the trigger of a gun gives you enormous power, highlighting this power most chillingly with the security camera footage of the Columbine killers stalking their prey through the library of their high school. This scene follows a very astute statement from SOUTH PARK creator Trey Parker who wishes he could tell teenagers that "Yes, it is horrible being a teenager. It's was worst time of my life. It will pass. It doesn't last forever." From this scene, Moore cuts to the Columbine footage, and it is here that he makes his most powerful statement as a filmmaker. The killers open fire in the crowded library. The masses flee in terror, crouching behind tables and chairs, until only scattered bodies remain. Gradually, the killers emerge from the smoke, armed with guns and pipe bombs, looking as cool as Keanu Reeves in THE MATRIX. Moore slows down the footage - like a John Woo or Bruckheimer action sequence - and it sends a chill through you. Not just because what you are seeing is horrible, but because you begin to understand the pure seductive power of the gun. In this video footage, the Columbine Killers are no longer mere teenagers with a screw loose: They are warriors in complete command of the situation. The guns have given them the ultimate power - to stamp out evil as they see it and win the battle. What troubled teenage boy wouldn't want to have this ultimate power? What bullied and ostracized child wouldn't want to have their entire high school cowering in fear before them? It's not the bikini clad chicks shooting the guns that are seductive, it's the guns themselves.BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE isn't just a chilling and angry rage against the proliferation of gun violence in the United States, it's also an powerful indictment of the media's role in our society. Why do you need a gun? Because the media tells you every day how much crime there is all around us. Why do we need to build a safe room in our homes? Because the media tells us that big black men might come in and kill us. The media sells paranoia because paranoia sells. We don't get excited when we hear that violent crime has decreased 30% since 1970, but we will tune in to see the latest police shoot-out on the freeways of Los Angeles. Moore then takes us on a tour of suburban Toronto to test out the theory that Canadians don't lock their doors. At one house after another, Moore finds bemused residents peering out at him. "We don't want to prisoners in our own homes" one women says. It is a telling statement as to what each nation believes the definition of "freedom" really is. Americans think that freedom is the right to bear arms and freedom of the press, and yet it is the right to carry automatic weapons and the negligence of the media that proliferates the carnage on American streets. Canadians, British, Germans, Australians, and Japanese all have a high population of guns and a some, such as the Germans and Japanese, have a history as violent as America's. Yet they do not shoot each other so frequently on the streets. They do not put iron bars up on the windows of their living rooms. They do not live in a nebulous fear manufactured by ratings crazy television networks.In the aftermath of paranoia that has swept the United States after September 11, 2001, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE has become one of the most important and timely documentaries to ever be released into mainstream cinema.And "Thank you for not shooting me" remains one of the funniest and heartfelt lines of 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In docu-drama format, Michael Moore intermixes hyperbole with shocking statistics and news footage on the issue of gun violence in America. He accomplishes this so successfully that you are not sure whether it's ever appropriate to laugh, even at some of the `wackos' presented.There are many interviews in the course of the move, and all were extremely well done. Many interviews provided as much insight into the interviewees as they did the subject being discussed. The interviews with Charlton Heston and Marilyn Manson were especially interesting in this regard.To his credit, he has toned down the sneering and `I-am-for-the-little-guy' attitude of Roger and Me, and instead presents a fairly balanced picture of the problem of shootings in America. The K-Mart episode suggests that he is sincere in his quest: I didn't get the feeling (like I did with Roger and Me) that the whole thing was an act.This is not an anti-gun movie. See it and ask yourself why gun violence is so rampant in this country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll never think about America quite the same again. What is wrong over there? Too much consumer competition, poverty, discrimination, religion, conservatism? Too much advertising and TV? It seems America has a long way to go before they reach the famous "land of the free." These days it's more like the land of the gun, home of the mad. There's a lot I love about America, but there's plenty that scares me. That Bush character shouldn't be in power. Get someone not so...clouded. Americans really could benefit from having someone like Ralph Nader in power, not a war games boy like Bush, and a great deal more intelligent. But there's a huge conservative elite messing things up from the top as they enjoy their spoils without puting enough back into the community. This issue is raised in the film. Such a passionate country perhaps, so many great artists, scientists, academics. But often passionate in a misguided, stubborn aggressive way. Reason? Well, that's what this documentary looks at, and Michael Moore does an excellent job searching for the answer. While concentrating on the gun issue, the movie does raise interesting questions about what makes a society tick. One thing the film hits home about - too many guns. Unload, put away, and stop glorifying them in popular culture. Chill you Americans! or you'll blow us all up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful work that Americans just don't seem to "get"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film a couple of times and have talked to a few American friends about it. Here's the problem as I see it: Many American citizens seem to blame anything but themselves for the state they find themselves in. Be it Sept 11th, being overweight, the way they are perceived overseas, it's always the fault of someone else.So it seems to be with guns and gun control. A classic example is demonstrated in the film. Canada has the same number of guns per capita as the US, yet the US has a 6000% higher gun death rate. However, Canada also has free healthcare, unemployment and sickness benefit, free education and access to childcare for working parents. As one of the Canadian politicians puts it, "You don't get a functional society by kicking people when they are down."Moore goes on to demonstrate the media obsession with shock tactics and the overstating of the dangers in society. America has had a falling crime rate for several years now, but to watch the nightly news you would think that the country was being overrun with black men with guns. Never mind the fact that white men in shirts have defrauded the country of billions over the last few years, let's show another car chase.This should be required viewing for any American that wants to try and understand how the rest of the world sees their society. Unfortunately I don't think that many will want to.</fullReview>

Every american gunowner should, provided they can think that far, reconsider their views on firearms. I mean, the guy who meant that weapons-grade plutonium should just be "restricted"..? If the likes of him had it their way, America would soon become a pretty scary place to be. Sorry, even scarier than now, of course.For those of us living outside the US, this movie is great as it tells us stories, facts and information we never knew - and rumors we always hoped were untrue (which, later, it turned out wasn't).I'll recommend this movie to everyone and everybody.

I walked out of a screening on New Years day feeling a new understanding in my heart. Michael Moore has with one film answered the question of WHY Americans feels the compulsion to lash out at their own society, their friends and neighbours.I don't pretend to understand the communities in which these tragedies happen, for many years I have been appalled by a society in which weapons have been so easily available. Michael Moore himself, even though he was raised in these places and is a member of NRA, does not understand them but he is doing something which is desperately needed. He is doing something which the police, the government, the schools and the people aren't doing. He is asking why?He finds the answer.This film is one of the most important films I have seen in at least a decade. It does not just tell us what is happening it finds out why. Watch this movie; think about what is being said. Think about what has happened. 'Bowling for Columbine' will get into your mind and change what you understand.

Though we get some moments of black comedy worthy of DR STRANGELOVE (including Moore opening an account at a bank where new subscribers are given free rifles), Moore keeps reminding us that the real issue here is deadly serious - thousands of deaths every year.Though Moore teams up with Columbine survivors to ask K-mart to stop selling handgun ammunition, this is about more than gun control: it's about the culture of paranoia that the US media fosters and that the NRA and many US politicians are so willing to exploit.When I first saw this, the only thing louder than the laughter was the audience applause at the end. It's that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-of-a-kind movie by one-of-a-kind director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore is an extraordinary director and-- obviously--an extraordinary human being."Bowling for Columbine" is a unique film-- part documentary, part polemic, part comedy.Moore's targets include gun nuts, the NRA, Lockheed-Martin and other major corporations, Charlton Heston, welfare "reform," and American foreign policy. (There are probably other people and entities he skewers in the movie--it was hard to keep score.)Moore's supporters include teachers, police officers, district attorneys, a father of one of the children slain at Columbine, two shooting victims, and some sane "people in the street."As Moore has become more famous, he has become more "Michael Moore-like." This Michael Moore is heavier, unshaven, unkempt, and looks more like a homeless person than a movie director. I think it's just this "regular guy" appearance that gets Moore into places where others could not go, and--to a certain extent--allows him to achieve the victories that he achieves.My guess is that viewers will self-select, and that not many NRA folks will see this film. It may be that Moore ends up preaching to the already convinced. Even so, his message is worth hearing, and the film is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective despite the humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing this film brought some important issues to my attention, and being only 17, I'm glad Moore presented the information the way he did. I'm glad he didn't assume every viewer would be desensitized to the violence (which, I think, is one way he shows his audience precisely HOW desensitized we really are). He used images that triggered a deeper shock than the media does, while still catering to the conditioning we face every day.Despite the satire, and the strings of the most digusting images I've ever been subjected to (I did cover my eyes, I admit it) the film was effective. I saw this movie was effective because everyone I saw the movie with took the same ideas home, if not something extra. I was impressed by the overall quality of this movie to make me and my peers think seriously about everyone's actions, and I suggest this to anyone. I have serious doubts about anyone who does not find something out about themselves by watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore's new film "Bowling for Colombine" is one of the greatest documentaries I have seen in recent years. It really lays out an interesting argument as to why we are such a violent scoiety. The interviews with celeb's Stone and Manson are extremely insightful and the three minute tour of American history is extremely eye opening. Loved the film and think it is a must that every American should watch- specifically the youth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tendentious, but important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are interesting things in this tendentious and meanspirited movie. Moore's own history as a gun-owner and teenage rifle champion enables him to earn the trust of the gun-owners he interviews. And he has a certain affection for small-town American life that shines through his reflexive political correctness. He is a good magpie of amusing snippets of old TV and movie footage. And he scores one major coup -- it is astonishing that Charlton Heston in the closing interview should be so inarticulate, offering no support for gun rights -- a side of Moses we don't usually see.But Moore's grasp of foreign policy is nonexistent and he assumes that everyone shares his politics. Despite his smarty-pants downplaying of crime and terrorism, there are bad people in this world, who would show men like Moore no mercy. Moore misunderstands Canada in the manner typical of first-time visitors to that country. He confuses exceptions to rules with rules. And the idea of Moore's being some kind of moralist who can shame the USA into admitting its wrongs is a giant laugh.But precisely because of the documentary footage he has put together, this is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Picture of 2002, aka "Big Fat American Manifesto."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I look at the incredible word-of-mouth that "My Big Fat GreekWedding" has achieved. That movie has been like a feel-good pillpassed from person to person during this trying year of 2002.If only we could achieve the same phenomenon with "Bowling forColumbine." Because while there is a time for feel-good movies,there is also a time for movies that change the way you think andforce you to make a difference.99% of the time, the movie-going experience is about escape. Escape from our problems, escape from responsibilities andworries of daily life. And that's fine. It's a necessary part of ourculture.But once in a while a movie comes along that does the opposite: it holds life right up to your face and forces you to take action. Tomake your voice heard. "Bowling for Columbine" is one of those films. It is undoubtedlymy pick for Best Picture of the Year.Yes, it has a liberal bent. Yes, it make make you angry. But it WILLmake you think. And we need that so desperately right now,because there are so many challenges for our country to face.See this movie and tell your friends about it. Thanks.</fullReview>

This is a very insightful look at what makes America the society that it is. This movie asks more questions that it answers but these are the questions we as a society need to ask.

In all of Moore's provocative interviews, docu-drama comic relief, innovative investigating, creative editing, his undeniable biases (but doesn't everything have biases??) and omissions - this documentary is truly amazing.At the heart of Bowling for Columbine is its emotional impact on the audience, whether you love it or hate it. Through these emotional tactics, albeit manipulative in a way, few watching can deny their minds were not intimately engaged with this piece of work.Also being Canadian I thought the part where Moore shows Canada as a peaceful and friendly paradise quite amusing. Actually very funny at points, especially the part where everyone's doors are unlocked. Well maybe I'm different because I lock my door out of habit.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all his grandstanding and antics which come close to being insufferable, there can be no better critique than this clever and brave documentary! Moore is himself a lifetime NRA member and unapologetic owner of guns but shows how it has gone overboard. He shows that while violence is not unique to America, our historical quirks have left us vulnerable to a culture of fear and paranoia that dates backs to the colonization by the English. He contrasts our country with Canada, which as more gun ownership but has less than 10% of our firearm related crime and fatalities. Only in America has the gun gone from being a tool to a surrogate penis.</fullReview>

Obviously there is a segment of the population that will dislike this movie because of Moore's penchant for embracing the political left; but those who can be bold enough to view this movie in spite of their position on the political spectrum will be richly rewarded. The emotional level Moore hits with this film should render it very possibly as a Best Picture contender in next year's Oscar race.

He does not claim to have all of the answers, but he takes pains to dissect the one issue that is so polar - guns - but also tackles an issue that isn't so sexy or easily identifiable, fear. And for a liberal, he does a pretty good job nailing the "liberal" media to the wall.

		<fullReview>This was one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Moore's ability to tap into the real issues, to explore the underbelly, the fear, the system, and question everything - was shown in a humourous yet brilliantly creative way. The K-Mart scene, the entire George Bush speech - where the double speak was so thick; the outright lies, the racism and the entire fear of a counrty for one another, was so apparent throughout the entire film. The sadness of seeing all those dead as Moore showed the atrocities that can be committed in the name of 'freedom', the outright racist remarks of the NRA's president Charlton Heston, the work for welfare program that tears the one remaining parent away from the child, all of it hit me with great force. It's a movie that allows you to think, to form your own connections.This is a movie every American should watch.</fullReview>

His answer (and he make a very good case for it) is fear. Where as gun murders have gone down 20%, reporting of such has gone up 600%. I know people that love their guns more than they love their children (sad, but really true).Don't miss this film.

		<fullReview>Before reviewing this film, let me first preface that I grew up in a small town, made up of almost entirely republican, gun toting conservatives. I was given my first gun at age 11. I had fired guns more times than I could think. And all the while, listening to Rush Limbaugh and Pat Robertson.When I first heard of Michael Moore in the 80s, I was told that he was a leftist extremist communist nut. When I saw the trailer for this film, I thought to watch it.After seeing this film, I can say this: If this film could be considered the opinions and viewpoint of the democratic, liberal left wing, COUNT ME IN!!!I have been changed since watching this film. Never before has a film so touched and changed the way I see the world. It made me think. Yes he was saying this sucks and that sucks, and this is wrong and that is wrong, but he was backing it up with FACTS, and that's all I care about. You can spout off about whatever you want, but if you can't back it up, it's B.S.I went out and purchased Moore's book, "Stupid White Men." I can't wait to dig into it.So, I guess you can consider my butt converted. I'm changing my voting registration.This film totally deserves at least Best Documentary Feature at the Academy Awards this year. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (for anyone with an open mind)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Provocative and Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**If there is one thing about the documentary Bowling for Columbine does is it makes you think. Why is our society sometimes so violent? Who is to blame? Is it TV, Movies, Video Games etc. Michael Moore's movie doesnt answer those questions, but you are left to make up your mind. The graphic real life violence is the most disturbing part of the film, when you know the footage of the shootings you see are real! No matter how many times you see fictional violence in movies and tv, when its real you get a chill down your spine. Another disturbing element is when the film shows how the U.S. government secretly or out in the open supply weapons of mass destruction to nations considered to be enemies. Such examples are Panama, Iran/Iraq war, Vietnam, but the most chilling is giving weapons and CIA training to help Afghanistan fight the Soviets in their war with communism. Osama Bin Laden would use that training and weopons on New York City on September 11, 2001. The scene ends with footage of the second airplane hitting the World Trade Center with audio of screaming people. This is all shown while Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World" is playing in the background. Moore's film then takes us to Columbine High school where we meet two students who survived the shooting rampage. Moore also talk to others who survived that day and their testimonials will break your heart. Moore then takes us to his hometown of Flint, Michigan where a six year old girl is murdered by another six year old with a gun that he found in his uncles house. The documentary then shows his mother working long hours with minimum pay as a result she is evicted from her house leaving him to be cared for by his uncle because she is never home. The film questions if poverty or parents are responsible for gun violence. Once again, you are left to think about it. Moore's documentary ends with an interview with actor and NRA president Charlton Heston, Moore shows Heston a photo of the murdered six year old girl. Heston walks away and Moore places the photo next to a tree near his house. Bowling for Columbine is an excellent documentary about real life problems with gun control in America. It doesn't matter weather your anti-gun or if your an NRA member, This film shows it from both sides of the political spectrum and you are left to think about it. Michael Moore's film is oscar worthy and in some scenes funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore has received a lot of criticism in his career for wearing his agenda on his sleeve. However, this film is a search for the truth behind violence in this country. If anyone bothers to watch it, he deconstructs some liberal theories (including my own) about how guns themselves are the problem. His conclusion appears to be that it is only the combination of the politics of fear and the guns that creates the violence. As far as all of the nonsense about his weight, when you run out of intellectual discourse you can always go low. I think his next documentary should be on the discrimination that overweight people receive. Go and see the film and learn something. You don't have to agree with his politics to see where the man's heart is. He cares, and in our dog eat dog, absolute truth, self-centered society that is refreshing to see. As he matures as a film-maker I expect him to continue asking the questions that need to be ask and being the lone voice of the majority of Americans who are tired of being dismissed, categorized, and pushed around by corporate america and the government. I applaud him for his tenacity and hope that he continues to be a real American and not leave this nuthouse for Canada.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people have been commenting and critiquing this film as a "left-wing propaganda and for gun control", but that is as far from the truth as it can get. Michael Moore himself has said that initially the film original intentions were about America's obsession with guns, and segments of the film do show that original idea, but when he discovers that Canada has about the same ratio of gun ownership per citizen, then he then does the right thing and starts asking more questions and moves beyond the notion that number of guns in this country isn't the one single answer to this complex issue, in fact he never comes to an answer, but simply more questions. He does bring to the mainstream the notion that America is driven by a culture of fear and how many have exploited that for monetary gains. He is successful in illustrating that other nations such as Canada have long seen the connection between poverty and crime. I recommend that everyone should see this film, regardless of what political stance they may take. It will be a long time before another will provoke as much thought and debate as this film has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes things need to be ridiculed - Moore is just the man for the job!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To the user who put this film "in the bowl," I would say this. What part really ruffled your feathers?Mr. Moore has taken a simple premise -- why does the culturally imperialistic United States have hundreds of times more gun murders than Canada, the U.K., Japan, Australia, France, etc.?Then he proceeds to give his answers. Maybe the film gets a little self indulgent once in a while -- the part where he's going on about smog, while that's an important problem really wasn't germane to the topic of the film -- but you have to admit that there were some good points in the film too.If you are a "gun nut" Mr. Moore is NOT trying to say that guns are the problem. He really is trying to say that "guns don't kill people, people do." What I got from the film is that a culture of hate, fear and inequity drives the murder rate higher, and the fact that guns are so easy to obtain makes it the obvious vehicle for murder.And finally, if you are one of these people who views the United States through rose coloured glasses, I would say to you to take them off. I love this country as much as the next guy, but when it comes to how we treat our neighbours and how we treat our own, we are far from squeaky clean. I certainly don't condone terrorism as a means to effect political change, but some of the people we have labeled as "evil-doers" might not have started doing evil if the U.S. held itself more accountable for its actions.But I digress, this movie is excellent. See it twice.</fullReview>

It's about the different points of view about guns and gun control in the US and Canada, and about the Columbine shootings of 13 people. Poignant, informative, funny, sad, intelligent and all presented with some humour (whenever possible). It is even better than his other film Roger and Me. He makes the making of a film look like this is soooo easy and fun to make since the material from the "other" media that he uses is so good that it speaks for itself. The real stories and real characters that he uses are just mind bogglingly true in being smart, stupid, ignorant, funny, etc ... His straight forward and not-so straight forward controversies are brought out through the characters in the film without too much need for narration. My only quip is that he should of also spoke about Soviet involvement in the overthrow of world governments. I could not see the last 5 minutes of the movie because of a power failure (possibly caused by Bush attacking our power plants. :-). A classic which I will see again !!</fullReview>

The truth is Bowling for Columbine is a look into why Americans are more apt to use their guns than, say, our Canadian neighbors (who own 7 million guns between them and have only a couple hundred fatal shootings a year while we have around 11,000).Michael Moore (a lifetime NRA member, by the way) does not make a case against taking away our Constitutional right to own guns, and he doesn't even try to do so. It is ridiculous to make that assertion. He simply tries to open a dialogue about why we use our guns against each other so readily.If you are open to suggestions about the answer to this question, go see this film. If you are too afraid of what MIGHT be said to actually listen to what IS being said, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even with all of the publicity, I was not prepared for the full experience Michael Moore has created. While it still has the earmarks of his quirky documentary style, it shows a great deal of maturation, as he does not feel the need to insert in a laugh with any degree of frequency. At times things are heavy handed, but he has points he has to make. What really impressed me is how he took a central theme and weaved in many other American problems. Rather than shy away from complexity, his documentary shows how there are no easy answers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, a movie worth watching and talking about! Things are terribly wrong in America, and Michael Moore has the guts to point it out and take a shot at figuring it all out. Very sad to say, there are no 'answers' yet, but it should make everyone really think about it hard. This is a hilarious, heart wretching, painful, real, frustrating, and depressing look at a very violent America. Is there hope? I don't know, I'm moving to Canada.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am hardly what one might call a leftist or even a liberal. But this movie really got me to thinking. Are we as a country so full of the "war on terror" stuff we hear every day, that we have become, like good little Germans high on the Fuhrer's propaganda, ready to attack and invade the next country our fearless leader says is "evil". Pull that trigger, Mr. President! It just so happens that the one which really has nuclear weapons capability at the present time (North Korea) can be negotiated with, while that other one with oil....who might or might be a number of years away from being a nuclear threat...must be attacked. Moore has hit a nerve in me with this movie...like waking up and wondering......"Maybe Daddy is really hitting the booze and just looking to grab somebody else's dough (oil) after all....and maybe he is the biggest serial killer on our little global block?". Sheesh....I might just get up the guts to take a friend of mine to see this flick.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always been a fan of Michael Moore's work, but this takes my following to a whole new level.Bowling for Columbine is thoughtful, heartfelt, and thought provoking. And it's one of the most difficult movies I've ever watched.Unlike Moore's other movies, BFC certainly more serious, taking on the issue of guns in our culture. He dives into the issue head on, questioning violence in children, white culture's perception of blacks, the history of guns, and why it might be a good idea to move to Canada.With so many topics, it's tough to maintain its focus, but it does so very well, presented in what could be considered a series of mini vignettes, if you will.The most powerful, of course, focus on the tragedy at Columbine, High School. I remember when it happened, I was in New Hampshire at school, my girlfriend told me, and I simply started crying. No one should have to ever experience that day. And seeing actual footage from that day, was one of the most painful things I've ever witnessed.Unlike some of Moore's other stuff, this isn't merely shock, it's trauma. It hurts. But in true Moore fashion, he makes the hurt help, and his mission to K-Mart truly makes the film.I think everyone needs to see this film. You may not agree with it, which is fine. But at the least, it should certainly make you question the things you believe.-RJC</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those who say that "Bowling for Columbine" advocates gun control did not see the movie, or weren't paying attention. Rather, this film is an exploration of America's "gun culture," and our country's obsession with violence and resultant paranoia. In fact, Moore's primary thesis is that gun control is *not* necessarily the answer, pointing to Canada as an example of a country with lots of guns but few gun deaths. Moore also uses the Canada example to debunk the contention that violent music or movies cause tragedies like Columbine (his interview with Marilyn Manson is an unexpected highlight).Moore asks more questions than he answers, but one of his main points is that our culture of violence might spring from an irresponsible news media and a hypocritical policy of aggression abroad. He also questions the values of a society where bullets are sold in a K-Mart, a store that also sells such things as children's toys and candy. Never, however, does he question the validity of the second amendment. In fact, he vocally affirms it in his interview with Charlton Heston.The NRA has taken issue with this film, but Moore doesn't indict the NRA for believing in the second amendment. He takes issue with the tastefullness of conducting gun rallies in Colorado and Michigan just days after Columbine and the shooting death of a six-year-old girl, respectively. He also accuses them of moving away from their intended purpose (an organization designed to promote gun safety and responsibility) towards being a blindly allegiant partisan tool of the Republican party.Moore has a reputation as a left-wing rabble-rouser, but this movie was responsibly made, and offers a legitimate viewpoint of a very complicated issue. To simply dismiss it without watching it would be a mistake. Part of loving America, and being a responsible American, is educating yourself to all sides of an issue that affects us. Watch this movie and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

No aspect of "Bowling for Columbine" is in the slightest bit flawed-- it flows, it shocks, and it all makes sense. People like myself who have been on the fence about gun control will have no choice but to rally behind Moore in his desperate call for common sense. That a movie can, in 120 minutes, pinpoint exactly what is wrong with America and just how ridiculous our nation has become is a stroke of genius. As I said before, this film is flawless, and Moore deserves top honors for his brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An issue that will not go away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like him or not I believe that what Michael Moore is exploring here is an important issue that seems to continue to raise its ugly head, and has done so once again with the Sandy Hook massacre, and that is the question of why there are so many gun deaths in America. Some have suggested that it is not a question of gun control, but I would have to say that it is. It is not the issue that is explored in this film that Americans live in fear of their neighbour, because to be honest, this is something that occurs here in Australia as well. When home invasions became popular people began to secure their houses more and more, despite the fact that the only home invasions that we would ever hear about were on the news. However, we here in Australia have nowhere near as many violent gun deaths that they do in the United States. The reason for that I would have to say is gun control.I am a little dubious about some of Moore reasonings here, particularly with the question of Canada. Moore always seems to paint Canada as this wonderful paradise that exists to the North of the United States were all of the problems that the Americans face are non-existent. I would be doubtful that there are cities in Canada that go for three years without a gun murder, however it is quite clear that it is much higher in the United States. However, the issue of gun control though does not address the fact that some people get their guns through simply taking somebody elses. While the Columbine killers may have bought their own guns, the massacres at Sandy Hook and other places involved somebody taking somebody else's gun, and in many cases these people would have passed gun ownership tests with no problem whatsoever.I don't think it is a question of being a teenager either. Seriously, being a teenager sucks, and many of us go through the same problems that the Columbine killers faced, that is teasing, alienation, and such. Many of us as teenagers also have that desire to lash out at our persecutors violently, but in many cases we do not. Some of us put up with it, and some of us simply drop out (as I did). However if I look at some of these events (and this is no detailed research) we almost see the profile of a person who is pretty much at the end of their rope. There was one particular event where a teenager shot up a supermarket on Christmas Eve, and then turned the gun on himself. However, what we notice about this particular person was that he had just lost his job at McDonalds, and no doubt he was not really a model employee either. However in the United States there is no social safety net, so we could almost imagine that this particular person, angry at society, desired to lash out at it in the only way possible, and that is to shoot it up. Of course, one you have begun pulling the trigger, there is no turning back, which is why they turn the gun on themselves.Another point that Moore makes in this film is the connection between gun violence in the United States and the government launching wars against foreign powers. As one person suggests, it seems that if somebody upsets the American government, then the only response that the Americans can make is to bomb them to kingdom come. I think Moore is right when he indicates that Marilyn Manson is little more than a scapegoat, particularly since it is the President that is the ultimate role model, and if the people, especially the young people, see the President declaring wars on foreign powers that upset them, then the lesson that teaches them is that if anybody upsets you, then shoot them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Gun Control</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine is a documentary written, directed, produced, and narrated by Michael Moore. The film explores what Moore suggests are the causes for the Columbine High School massacre and other acts of violence with guns. He focuses on the background and environment in which the massacre took place and some common public opinions and assumptions about related issues.Aside from that,it also looks into the nature of violence in the United States.On April 20, 1999, shortly before they began their infamous killing spree at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold attended their favorite class, a no-credit bowling course held at a bowling alley near the school, the same bowling alley which would become the scene of a robbery and triple homicide two years later. While pondering these events, Moore humorously considers the link between random violence and the game of ten pins; along the way, he calls on the Michigan Militia; spends some time with James Nichols, brother of Oklahoma City bombing accomplice Terry Nichols; visits K-Mart's corporate offices with two teenagers injured in the Columbine massacre as they ask the retail chain to stop selling bullets for handguns; investigates the media's role in the American climate of fear and anger; compares crime statistics in the United States with those of Canada, and questions actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston regarding his appearance at a pro-gun rally held in Littleton a few days after the Columbine massacre, and a similar rally in Flint, MI, after a six-year-old boy killed a classmate with a gun he took from his uncle's house. In this documentary,Moore skillfully lays out arguments surrounding the issue and short-circuits them all, leaving one impossible question: why do Americans kill each other more often than people in any other democratic nation? He focuses his quest around the shootings at Columbine High School and the shooting of one 6-year-old by another near his own hometown of Flint, Michigan. By approaching the headquarters of K-Mart and going to Charlton Heston's own home, he demands accountability from the forces that support unrestricted gun sales in the U.S. His arguments are conducted with the humor and empathy that have made him more than just a gadfly for he's become a genuine voice of reason in a world driven by fear and greed.Though it may not always convince everyone,it asks important questions and provokes thought about gun control.</fullReview>

His thesis, that America promotes a culture of fear and violence, is hard to refute, even if you disagree with his methods. Like all of Moore's films, "Bowling for Columbine" is fantastically entertaining, and also enraging. His version of America is one that I'm ashamed to live in.Moore won the 2002 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature, and then eliminated the chance that he'll ever win again by ranting against then President Bush in his acceptance speech in one of the Academy's most infamous moments.Grade: A</fullReview>

A final, botched confrontation with National Rifle Association chairman Charlton Heston aside, the director's targets are the right ones.

		<fullReview>This is the famous funny political documentary, made and hosted by Michael Moore."Bowling for Columbine" explores U.S. gun culture and related issues, such as the history of how the U.S.A. was founded, the history of U.S. imperialist wars, the high rate of violence in the U.S.A., and the many school shootings in the U.S.A. - in particular, the Colombine Highschool shooting. It won the 2003 Academy Award or Oscar for best documentary, and broke the record for bestselling documentary ever - until he eclipsed that record with his next documentary Farenheit 911.I'm guessing that the film's title, "Bowling for Columbine", is a reference to "Gunning for Saddam".By the way, the audience at the 2003 Academy Awards gave Michael Moore a standing ovation, but some event organisers near the microphones at the Academy Awards booed him, and that is what was broadcast during the Academy Awards and in capitalist news reports about the Academy Awards.</fullReview>

The film is also quite critical of American politicians and the American people in general for being so violent and gun obsessed.

I remember seeing the new report of the little girl but never new about the NRA being in Flint. Seeing it now I can't believe it. What bugged me about the film and it's nothing against Michael Moore because he had nothing to do with it, it was that Heston wouldn't even look at the photo of the little girl. What I thought was great was Moore left the photo behind, leaving it open that you hope he looks at the photo or he just threw it away, but you don't know, you hoped he looked at it. But all in all, I expected it to be mainly about columbine but it wasn't and that was good, this was a documentary to make and I am glad that someone made it.

		<shortDescription>Gripping documentary about a tough subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>--Spoilers--Michael Moore's documentary is a very good look at a subject which is one of those permanent factors of the U.S. society, guns. The document deals with the subject with great interviews, the interviews of the person who was connected to the Oklahoma bombing and the father of the child killed in Columbine come to mind. The final interview with Heston is perhaps not that great and Moore perhaps doesn't handle it well, then again, what would be the best way to handle it? Heston is an old actor who has been chosen to be the 'face' of NRA, in that position you have to be prepared to take some flak, like all americans have to be ready to take some flak in the form of bullits. Ultimately, Heston is unable to defend the NRA-point of view, understands it and walks away. The whole documentary has been received as a kind of attack against the gun culture, I don't see it as such, it is just a pretty light hearted documentary about a really important subject. The thing about documentaries in my mind is that they don't have to be block-busters like this one to appeal to me or to be important. I would rather look at a documentary which is hard on the subject but not as glamorous and polished as this one. On the whole a very good documentary. 10/10</fullReview>

I can only offer suggestions. First of all, I fear the aggressiveness of the average American vs. an average Canadian or European. Secondly, every time I turn on the TV I see the media reporting LOCAL murders, and LOCAL crimes at a horrific rate. But thirdly and most importantly, I think, I have personally met Americans that openly and proudly own handguns and military style weapons for "protection" or "sporting use."The only Canadians or Europeans that I have personally met that openly and proudly own any type of guns are my grandparents who live on a rural farm and trained me to shoot a small .22 calibre rifle to hunt rodents (gophers, beaver, coyotes) that affect ranching.Keep in mind I've lived in Europe for 5 years, Canada for 13, and the United States for not even 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with living in the sticks is that movies like this turn up at the nearest multiplex (if they ever do) long after the rest of the country has seen them. Even so, this movie is so different and exceptional that I just have to comment on it. A documentary about high school massacres doesn't sound too appealing but this is much more than that. Incredibly poignant at times and hilariously funny at others this is a masterful example of movie-making. For me, the critique of US Foreign Policy shown as an MTV-style music video to the sound of "What a Wonderful World" is worth the admission price in itself. This segment should be compulsory viewing for anyone who accepts the Bush/Blair take on war with Iraq. Moore disguises his final conclusion well. For a good half of the film it looks as if he is piling up evidence for one particular theory before he completely blows that away (pardon the irony) with a convincing counter argument. Just when you think he has nowhere left to go except "We just don't know" he unfolds his own theory about why America is so violent. Whether you agree with him or not this is a definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Wonderful World...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The truth sometimes hurts ... Michael Moore's documentary ?Bowling For Columbine' is a moving look at the culture of the United States, and what it is exactly that makes them unique in the global community when it comes to guns and murder! As a non-American who has never been exposed to such a culture I find a great deal of the film hard to swallow, not from disbelief but simply from pure shock. I have never met, nor could I have imagined meeting some of the people in the film. I stayed in a state of shock for the majority of the picture and thankful that I live in the great country that I do. This film will not fail to spark discussion, and it will certainly not fail to move any viewer with a conscience!More importantly however, especially in the modern global climate, Michael Moore puts forward the strongest argument against big business, corporations, media, the American government and anyone else who would follow in the steps of any of these bodies. He achieves this with a masterful blend of fact and though provoking rhetorical questions. He succeeds because he does not ram his opinion down your throat; rather he simply presents his case for your consideration. I would go as far as to say that the film should be compulsory viewing in all places of learning. If you don't have an opinion on the current state of the world, or you think you know all the facts ? this is the film that will put you back in your place.On top of the amazing message buried in this film is a well-made film all the same. The film is a mix of vox-pop and file footage blended together with an often sarcastic or mocking soundtrack that generates a great deal of black humour. It still however manages to retain a serious dignity especially considering some of the subject matter and the images that are on screen. There is one particular sequence similar to one out of ?Good Morning Vietnam', set to the song `What a Wonderful World' that closes with the second plane flying into the world trade centre. It is an incredible montage of tear jerking imagery and facts that will not fail to reduce almost anyone to at least releasing a tear or two. Your world will never be the same again? a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie SHOULD get people to think - I don't dare to say it does</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has produced a great documentary here, i think. There seem to be some things that are going really wrong in America these days, and the thing with the guns and the crime seems to be one of the worst. Moore really shows things and statements of people that should get every normal guy to just think about his opinion to that. If you want to learn something about your own society go and watch this movie. Of course it might seem to be anti-American, but i would say that in this particular point anti-Americanism is even more than justified (People who have got merchandise of the National Rifle Organisation everywhere in their homes should not watch it though).Great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the production of "Bowling for Columbine," on September 22, 2001 -- which you'll notice is 11 days after 9/11 -- Michael Moore wrote on his website:"This started out as a documentary on gun violence in America, but the largest mass murder in our history was just committed -- without the use of a single gun! Not a single bullet fired! No bomb was set off, no missile was fired, no weapon (i.e., a device that was solely and specifically manufactured to kill humans) was used. A boxcutter! -- I can't stop thinking about this. A thousand gun control laws would not have prevented this massacre. What am I doing?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>documentary is interesting but doesn't tell whole story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an entertaining documentary film. You won't be sorry you watched it. You won't feel like you wasted your time. I would like to have seen the whole interview with Nichols. Like in the documentary, WACO:THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, the way the film is edited leaves one wondering if perhaps what is left out was meaningful as well. Guns can be a deadly nuisance in the hands of the wrong people and the lack of gun safety can always lead to deadly tragedies however, the right to keep and bear arms helps to secure freedom in this country, and, as a matter of fact, there is no right to self-defense without the right to keep and bear arms. Millions were killed in the twentieth century in countries where the people could not own weapons or defend themselves. Does it make sense to sacrifice freedom or millions to save thousands? Now, much of the film is poiniant and much of it needs to be heard and pondered. I enjoyed it and found it educational. I agree with much of it. I don't think Kmart or anyone else should stop selling guns or ammo, but I certainly wouldn't sell them to anyone under 21 like the Kmart does in the film. I recommend this film but it saddens me that many will not see that it tells an incomplete story that might lead many to false conclusions. 4/10 (good for a documentary)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an interesting movie which brings up two important issues: 1) What about the people of the U.S. makes them so prone to violence? 2) Why do we have a media "culture of fear?"The movie is well made and definitely tackles tough issues, however, Moore's personal biases are annoying, and the movie is neither a functional editorial nor a eye-opening objective documentary. Just as he gets to the really interesting questions (see above), he stops. He makes certain public figures simplistic scapegoats for the (very real) problems and falls short of making a truly intellectual picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little confusing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film puzzled me. At first I thought it was going to be a film about gun control, and then it turned out to be more like Michael Moore's personal journey in trying to figure out why the murder rate in America is so much higher than in other countries. Moore explores gun culture, music, video games, the media's portrayal of violence, and a wide range of other things, and in my opinion he doesn't come up with any terribly profound discoveries. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though, and there are some very emotional montages of real-life events in here that really got me teary-eyed.However, it's in what seems to be Mr. Moore's vanity and irrationality that things go astray. Throughout the movie, Moore himself seems to admit that he can't quite pinpoint exactly what the sources of America's violent society stems from (although he does indicate that the American media plays a pretty big role, which is understandable).Nonetheless, for some reason Moore still tries to villainize organizations and individuals who really have no clear role to play in the whole issue. For instance, Moore thinks it's "right" for K-mart to take bullets off their shelves nationwide because the Columbine killers bought their merchandise there. This move presupposes the belief that "selling bullets implies a higher murder rate", as that would be the only rational reason K-mart should take the profitable merchandise off their shelves. The confusing part is that earlier in the film, Moore went to a Wal-mart in Canada and marveled at the fact that the store sold bullets freely and yet Canada's murder rate was still incredibly low--thereby suggesting that stores selling bullets did *not* imply a higher murder rate. The worst part is that Moore is glaringly inconsistent in his logic: when he examines music artists like Marilyn Manson, he determines that they can't be a cause of why the American murder rate is so high because kids in other countries with less crime also listen to Marilyn Manson; why, then, does Moore not think that this same kind of argument is valid when applied to stores selling ammunition?Similarly, the role that the National Rifle Association and Charlton Heston play in this film is extremely vague. Nowhere in this film do I see a concrete reason for why the NRA should be blamed for the unjust murders of innocents in this country. There's a pretty big distinction between using a gun for self-defense and using it to hurt innocent people, but Mr. Moore doesn't seem to attend to this.Part of the problem with this movie, I think, is the fact that Michael Moore is tackling an extremely complex subject. The reasons behind America's high murder rate is vastly more complex than the reasons behind General Motors' abandonment of their plant in Flint, Michigan (the topic covered in Moore's superb first effort, "Roger &amp; Me"). In "Roger &amp; Me", it was easy to identify the GM CEO as the villain, which accordingly made it easy to identify with Michael Moore as the hero. In the issues covered in this film, however, there are (understandably) no clear villains, and the ones Michael Moore classifies as villains seem more like innocent bystanders to me (or at the very least, potential villains whose guilt is assuredly not verified), which makes Moore himself seem all the more villainous for relentlessly chasing them down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An informative, but flawed documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who is very libertarian about gun control, I thought I would hate this film. I'm not sure entirely what I think of it. At times I enjoyed it and at other times, I thought Moore was dead wrong. At times, Moore goes a bit off the point. For example, he starts talking about Africanized Bees. Why? From the looks of it, to make the movie longer, I guess. Sorry, but Africanzied Bees have nothing to do with gun control.I think the most important message is that the news media is probably one of the organizations that deserves the most blame. We're told that there's all kinds of dangerous people in our own neighborhoods ready to kill other people. Kids aren't safe in schools. Airplanes are full of terrorist. Sex offenders are probably living next door and ready to kidnap your children. People who listen to what the media and government tells them are probably scared out of their minds. The fact is that despite the high murder rate in the US, we are a very safe group of people. We can never be 100% safe, but most of us will never be the victims of violent crimes. I only know one murder victim in my entire life and she wasn't killed by a gun (she was run over with a car).I found the interview with the Lockheed Martin guy interesting and the subsequent footage of US foreign policy at work very informative. The US has been a violent aggressor for over 100 years, dating back to such idiocy as the World War I and the Spanish-American War. I think there's a point to be made that such a cavalier attitude towards other people around the world and their governments may lead to children and American citizens picking up that attitude here at home.Also there was this huge segment towards the end where he got on his soap box about the welfare to work program. He went around blaming Dick Clark for this girls' death because his restaurant employed the woman whose Son shot the girl at school. But there was no blame on the uncle who left the gun laying around for a six year old to pick up. I believe that Moore should have gone after this guy and asked him why he let his gun fall in to the hands of a six year old. But I suppose blaming the evil capitalist makes for better movie making than blaming an extremely irresponsible uncle...There are two things I found completely inexcusable for any "documentary" filmmaker. One is that stupid cartoon during the movie which tried to link up the KKK and the NRA. The NRA was started in upstate New York by former Union soldiers after the Civil War, two of the first NRA presidents were Union General Burnside and General Grant. During Grant's presidential administration, he worked vigorously to destroy the KKK under the Civil Rights Act of 1871. This idea that the KKK and the NRA are one in the same is an insult to anyone with a hint of historical knowledge. But don't let history get in the way of a funny cartoon, right?Next up is the way Moore cut footage of Charlton Heston during the Denver NRA speech. I saw the entire speech, unedited and it was no way near as vitriolic and hateful as Moore presented in his movie. I can understand not having enough time to put the entire speech in to the movie, but at least try to be honest. Don't edit the footage of a dying man to make him sound like a nut...Overall, this movie is right about half the time, which isn't half bad. Moore clearly tried to make an objective film about the nature of the gun control debate and succeeded for the most part. I say, 5 out of 10 because it's not without it's flaws...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore certainly has revolutionized the art of the documentary. But he is very selective in his choice of facts. One suspects he does 100 interviews to get the one clip that supports his argument. Case in point. I lived in Toronto for 30 years. I NEVER knew anyone who did not lock their door. Indeed, we equipped our home with a high tech burglar alarm after several break-ins in the neighbourhood. Even though I sympathize with Moore's disdain for guns and for Geo W, his approach is a scattershot one. I'm still trying to bridge the stretch between the tragic kindergarten shooting in Flint Mich. and Dick Clark's restaurant business. Also, Moore's calculated "slob" persona is getting a little tedious. Moore is a genuine revolutionary and mirrors my own politics and philosophy. But he takes too many facts (and quotes) out of context and, as amusing as his ambush interviews may be, I question the journalistic ethics of his technique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a hard time deciding if i liked this movie or not. I did enjoy it, but I also disliked most of it. Yes, this documentary makes interesting light of the problems facing the US today. Yes, Moore's narrow and manipulative style prods the audience into asking questions that deserve to be examined. And yes, he does have a right to spew his diatribes (it's in the Bill of Rights). However, the incoherence of his logic (not surprisingly) eclipsed the film for me. The cover of his book "Stupid White Men" says it all, with the demagogue Moore smiling smugly, not realizing how ironic the cover's statement is.Keeping in mind his simplistic world view, I'll adress the "for" and "opposed" camps in terms he'd understand. The bleeding heart liberals who eat out of his palms and the cigar-chewing opressive capitalists who despise him are equally guilty of falling for his trap: they're paying ($$$) attention to him. Altruism accounts for perhaps 10% of his motives; after all, filmmaking is the most expensive artform in the world, though the word art should not be attached to this heavy-handed mess. The goal of this movie was to make a return on investment, and it did that handily. In that sense at least, the movie was a success.Can someone please tell me the causal link between the CIA-sponsored assasination of the president of Chile and the destruction of the Twin Towers by well-fed middle class immigrants living comfortably in the Western world? Oh, and showing my country as this clean, non-violent contrast to our neighbour Republic gives new definition to the term "manipulative bullplop." And using Beethoven's Ninth... I know one is not allowed to make threats to another's person, so I'll stop it there.Moore's "my-target's-walking-away-while-I-wistfully-call-out-questions- to-him" schtick got old after "Roger and Me." But many people swallow it whole. For them, I say buy the DVD; he probably gets 10% of the gross, which comes in handy for anyone who lives in a mansion. For those down the middle and have brains, watch it and make your own opinion, if you can stomach tedium and the constant mangling of facts. And for those right of centre that think he's a commie, keep in mind that no pinko eats better food or dresses down more convincingly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but so are most of Moore's pieces. This does a good job of raising the issues associated with gun violence in America, and speculates on what really makes us so crazy to be able to shoot our neighbors. The usual suspects (culture, media, history, etc.) are trotted out and for the most part exonerated. The very human side of the "I own a gun to protect what's mine" decision is presented, along with the fear (or lack thereof) that goes along with that decision. Spoiler alert (is this even possible with a documentary?):That the question is left unanswered may bother some viewers, but this is a documentary. Moore continues to follow the investigative/sensationalist path to "get" the viewer. Humor is frequently used by juxtaposition and irony (e.g. getting a free gun for opening a bank account). Raw manipulation is used even more frequently, such as bringing Columbine victims to corporate headquarters to "return" the K-mart-purchased bullets still inside their bodies. Distrust of Big Brother is (rightfully) evident. The most thoughtful statements presented are by Marilyn Manson. It's an interesting mix, and may provide an emotional ride for many.One last thing that continues to bother me: Flint is presented as a terrible victim of corporate America's abandonment policies. What has Michael Moore done to help Flint? He lives in NYC. He's even (reportedly) fought efforts by his own staff to unionize. Is he any better than the newsman who, on cue, "chokes up" while reporting about a 6-year-old's murder.Another unanswered question.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Two High Schools</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine is certainly one of Moore's milestones on the way to the magnificence of Fahrenheit 9 - 11 in which Moore with great gentility and circumspection explores the era of The Bush. Contrary to rumors spread by Bushists, Moore never once accused The Bush of wetting himself and running away when the disastrous news came in.A skillfully told yarn of the path two suburban teenagers took to gunning down a local high school, Michael Moore weaves the yarn together with an attack earlier that morning by US planes on a High School in Yugoslavia. Moments before the disastrous news came in from Columbine, President Bubba publicly congratulated US pilots on their devastating raid on a civilian target. I understand the US pilots were decorated for their dubious choice of targets.Barely seconds later President Bubba had to face the cameras again: This time to console an American community for their losses in a devastating raid carried out by two teenagers who caused far more destruction at far less expense than the earlier US aerial bombardment of a Yugo HS.Was this not US ingenuity at its best? The documentary is long on Moore preaching and so short on details that Moore missed two of his favourite bugaboos: US police and excessive reliance on technology. It seems the local swat team decked out in their little armoured costumes and armed to the teeth sat on the sidelines in the parking lot for over three hours while two youths went on their rampage inside the school.Much as we could critique the police for incredible indecision and utter lack of courage, on the other hand, it might have been unpatriotic for mere police to show more courage than their President.Beyond missing such an important detail, Moore was unforgivably rude to Charlton Heston. An interview, Mr Moore, is to develop the interviewee's views not to preach to the person interviewed.I gave this a *** 4 ***. The two major faults significantly detract from an otherwise eloquent polemic.</fullReview>

Yeah, right.This "documentary"--documentary in the sense that 'JFK' and 'Natural Born Killers' are also documentaries--relies on Moore and less on the topic. The man is an ego-maniac, but there are two positive elements.--The demonizing news media. As a journalist I can say that the institution is more concerned with flash and style than answering questions. Moore is a failed journalist too in that regard.--Moore refers to Flint, Michigan once again. Obviously 'Roger &amp; Me' didn't let him vent entirely, so he goes at it again, but as a clueless individual.Overall, when I say "Dud" I mean this had real potential but got mucked up along the way. It is all about Moore patronizing the audience, assuming they're liberals. I'm apathetic. Stick with 'Roger &amp; Me' because Moore's feeling was rawer.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Say what you want about Michael Moore, yes he is lying hypocrite phony scumbag who has has made entertaining movies. It is just stunning that he has been awarded an oscar for what is essentially a propaganda film about guns. Joseph Goebbels and Lani Reifenstahl would be proud of Moore's effort. The only true thing about Bowling For Columbine is the fact that it was made by Michael Moore. The most promoted part of the film, where he walks into a bank and gets a gun after he opens an account is totally false. He had to wait 7 to 10 days just like the rest and was only able to pick up the rifle from a liscensed dealer. How this movie is a documentary is beyond me. It sounds like it belongs in the fiction or fantasy genre of films. Moore blames all of the wrong things for society ills and hopes to blames them on an inanimate object and conservatives. I would not be surprised if he one day makes a movie about conservatives or any other group he disagrees with in his own Triumph of Will type film. The current propaganda Moore is putting out would make any extreme liberals/ socialists and Nazi propaganda people of the past proud. Moore has managed to tell the lie long enough and with enough passion to have many perceive it as the truth. No wonder he won the Oscar for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>distorions, mis-representaion, half-truths and all out lies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who said this film is an "eye-opener" please read this.Documentaries are supposed to tell facts and choronicle things as they happened. this "film" does neither, it is merely a long commercial for Michael Moore's political views and agenda.The distortions begin with the film's title. Lyons reports that, contrary to the title of the film, the two boys who committed the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., did not bowl the morning before the shooting. Although early news reports did state that they had attended a bowling class in the morning, police told Lyons it's simply not true.Another distortion is Moore's continued repetition of the lie that the U.S. gave millions of dollars in aid ($43 million last year and $245 million in total) to the Taliban government of Afghanistan when, in fact, that aid consisted of food aid and food security programs administered by the U.N. and non-governmental agencies to relieve a famine.FYI, the Lockheed Martin plant in Littleton doesn't make weapons. It makes space launch vehicles for TV satellitesIn another segment of his film, Moore focuses on a 6-year-old boy in Michigan who shot and killed a 6-year-old girl and blames welfare reform. Moore shows that the boy's mother was away from home at two work-for-welfare jobs for some 70 hours a week, thereby allowing the 6-year-old to find a loaded gun at a relative's house while his mother was being forced to "ride a bus for an hour and a half each day to serve drinks and make fudge for rich people." What Moore also leaves out of his film is the fact that the relative's house, as described by the Weekly Standard's Matt Labash, was "a crack house, where guns were often traded for drugs."What Moore doesn't report is that not only is welfare dependency dramatically down since welfare reform but also the poverty rate is down, and that families previously on welfare are faring significantly better financially since reforms were enacted in 1996.And in a distortion of reality the scene in a bank in Michigan that that opens the film was staged by Moore(by his own admission and that of the bank manager). Customers who open long-term CDs at the bank actually have to go to a gun store to pick up the weapon after a background check. Yet the film clearly indicates that the bank itself stores and hands out guns to customers and Moore even jokes as he walks out, "Here's my first question: do you think it's a little dangerous handing out guns at a bank?"Much more mendaciously, Moore has apparently altered footage of an ad run by the Bush/Quayle campaign in 1988 to implicate Bush in the Willie Horton scandal. Making a point about the use of racial symbols to scare the American public, he shows the Bush/Quayle ad called "Revolving Doors," which attacked Michael Dukakis for a Massachusetts prison furlough program by showing prisoners entering and exiting a prison Superimposed over the footage of the prisoners is the text "Willie Horton released. Then kills again." This caption is displayed as if it is part of the original ad. However, existing footage, media reports and the recollections of several high-level people involved in the campaign indicate that the "Revolving Doors" ad did not explicitly mention Horton.In addition, the caption is incorrect -- Horton did not kill anyone while on prison furlough (he raped a woman).Contradicting himself doesn't seem to be a problem for Moore, though. In the movie and subsequent media appearances, he has derided America's lack of a social safety net, comparing us unfavorably to Canada, even though he states explicitly in the film that the two countries don't differ significantly in terms of poverty.Moore also claims several times that our higher gun homicide rate must be the result of American culture rather than the greater number of guns in our country, citing the fact that Canada has a much lower gun homicide rate despite having seven million guns in its ten million homes (Moore ignores the fact that Canada has significantly fewer handguns and a much stricter gun licensing system). Yet that doesn't stop him from repeatedly bashing the anti-gun control NRA and even making a visit to the home of its president, Charlton Heston, the climax of the movie. In an e-mail to supporters , Moore even referred to Heston as a "gun supremacist." And in an interview on Phil Donahue's MSNBC show recently, Moore said he supports banning all handguns just minutes before stating, "I don't think, ultimately, getting rid of the guns will be the answer." (ironically Moore belongs to the NRA)Repeatedly, though, he returns to the issue of fear in the movie, claiming that excessive coverage of gun violence by the media makes Americans scared of each other and therefore more violent. This circular argument doesn't make any sense either. On the one hand, Moore has made an entire film purporting to investigate why the U.S. has the highest rate of gun violence in the developed world. He then attempts to answer the question by theorizing that the media provides too much coverage of gun violence, causing citizens to fear each other. If gun violence is really so bad, though, shouldn't the media be covering it and don't citizens have something to be afraid of? And if the media is indeed over-covering the issue and America is safer than we think, why did Moore make this film?Ironically, Moore interviews and cites the work of USC Professor Barry Glassner, whose book The Culture of Fear attacks the media for sensationalizing incidents of bad news while ignoring the bigger picture. One of the book's primary examples is extensive media coverage of school shootings that ignores the overall downward trend in youth violence in recent years. Indeed, Glassner points out that people are three times more likely to be struck dead by lightning than die in a school shooting. Moore, however, focuses extensively in the film on the Columbine massacre and a school shooting in his hometown of Flint, Michigan, and doesn't seem all that concerned with the country's epidemic of lightning strikes.Here, as ever, Michael Moore just doesn't seem to know what he thinks. When pressed, in fact, he isn't even sure he actually has a point. Appearing on CNN's Moneyline last spring, host Lou Dobbs asked him about the inaccuracies in Stupid White Men. "How can there be inaccuracy in comedy?" Moore responded.Satire is not an excuse for dissembling. Great satirists like Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain used hyperbole as a form of social criticism. Michael Moore, however, uses lies, distortions, and nonsensical arguments to mask cheap attacks and promote his own political agenda. Take him seriously at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is based on a wonderful curiosity and takes some interesting turns and interviews, but at times, it is ridiculous to the point of laughable. The stats are straight figures rather than "rates" of killings (which he later calls them) or percentages, making them flamboyant and misleading. The U.S. has multiple times the population of the other countries mentioned. No scientifically-minded person could take this presentation seriously. Also, the pilgrims were not the ones who killed the Indians - they were the ones who had Thanksgiving dinner with them and forged alliances, learning and exchanging with them, for the most part... it was the mercenaries and traders from England on different boats who killed the native Americans. He should have undertaken more historical research. It would have been nice if he had mentioned that England has a "Zero tolerance policy" on guns - which is why their police carry sticks and why they have a very low murder rate. Oversights like this and the gushing or manipulative nature of some of his interactions, at times make it easy to dismiss and discredit. Why pick on Charleton Heston so much? Is he typical of Americans - a scapegoat? I'm totally against guns, but why make a fool out of this actor who is simply standing up for a freedom? Such elements are unfortunate, because I think Moore has some important points to make about why America is such a violent country ... who is to blame? The news (and COPS!) really do need a complete overhaul - they do foster fear and racism. I admire Moore's efforts to actually make strategic CHANGES (and his dry sense of humor) - he's not just whining, he's doing something about it! Bravo. If his journalistic quest were a bit more professional and credible, he would make an excellent case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm no Michael Moore fan. I know he's more than a little selective with his facts and non-facts, to say the least (rent MICHAEL MOORE HATES America sometime... really, it's not vicious like it sounds!). But when I watch a movie, what I'm looking for is to be entertained. And on that note, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is by no means a write-off.This time around, the lefty filmmaker goes waaaaaay over the top to take on the evil gun industry. His motivation? Other than his hatred of guns, he wants to find out what was behind the infamous 1999 shootings at Colorado's Columbine High School. So Moore heads out on a cross-country journey to combat the old adage that guns don't kill people, people kill people. He interviews creepy gun nuts, pulls guilt trips on department stores carrying ammo, seeks the infinite wisdom of a creepy punk rocker, and hypothesizes that weapons plants lead to gun violence. He also makes his usual wild assumptions without evidence (of course that young Michigan boy brought a gun to school because of welfare reform... what other reason could there possibly be!?). The pot shots at the Bush administration, which would become a hallmark of Moore's work, seem like an afterthought (the line that begins "In George Bush's America..." came literally out of nowhere with no buildup or rationale).But as I said earlier, is it entertaining? Well, yes and no, but generally yes. As long as we accept Moore for what he is and what he's trying to do. It also really helps if you agree with him. So don't dismiss BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE as a piece of crap because you don't like the message. Moore wasn't trying to be unbiased or even preach to the unconverted. It's just Moore being Moore, love him or hate him.</fullReview>

As entertainment it's a conglomerated mess of stuff, none of which is particularly interesting or new or creative...just opinions, interviews, speculation, unanswered questions, news clips, etc. As a documentary it's an obvious agenda-driven mix of half truths, skewed stats, erroneous inferences, etc. which plays out like so much propaganda. An unfortunate hit, this flick will do more to mislead, muddle, and confuse than to illuminate the truth. There are lies, damned lies, and statistics. Then there's "Bowling for Columbine". (C)Note - if you can't see the Hollywood sign, it because of water vapor. Pollution is a few parts per million and does little to reduce visibility. There's an ocean near by. Duh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, Michael Moore has been known for eschewing the facts and timelines (see Roger and Me), but the one thing he can do is make a sometimes listless genre interesting to watch. While he never actually raises any answers, he does raise one incredible insight: Americans are nothing more than high-strung, trigger-happy, potential wack-jobs. How true. Americans are nothing more than fear laced individuals hoping violence will settle all. Moore seems to be the only one that can illustrate this in a way that is objectively one-side. Sure, he proclaims Canada is safer and cleaner and better in many ways, but he also introduces the differences perfectly and presents his side of the argument with a structured argument that makes perfect sense. While I deplore the whole part with Charleton Heston, the film as a whole was a 10/10.</fullReview>

There were many interesting and witty elements, but on the whole it didn't really say an awful lot. Yes, some people are hypocrits, others evil, but why? Where was it going?

		<fullReview>I was not impressed in the least with Mr. Moore's film. It was unfocused and convinced me of the opposite point of view of what was trying to be expressed. As the film progressed, ?. well, progressed isn't the word so much as jumped from random point to random point, I found my self wondering asking what is this film trying to say. At one point I thought I had figured out that he was trying to say fear was causing violence which in turn caused more fear, only to cause more violence. Just as I thought "Ahh, they have finally gotten to the point of the film." It jumped to another completely separate point to the fear. In all there were probably about 7 or 8 minor points, some of which conflicted each other, expressed over the 120 minutes. None of these arguments persuaded me to think more conservatively on the main issue of gun control; some even convinced me the opposite way of what I think the film was trying to express.As stated before the film was unfocused. Here is a similar story line to the film: A little girl in Michigan was shot by a little boy in school. Speaking of shooting people, The USA killed lots of people in Vietnam and that means that the kids of the people who made the bombs that killed those people think its OK to go to school and shoot it up like what happened at columbine. That reminds me the people who made South Park are from around Columbine and they think that kids have too much pressure so I think that kids shouldn't be able to get guns as easily as they can now. A couple kids who got shot a columbine think the same thing as me so we went to the k-mart headquarters and complained. They seemed like they ignored us so we went to the local K-mart and bought all the bullets they had so K-Mart doesn't sell bullets anymore. HOORAY! People still get killed in the united states though, but not in Canada. You ask, Why? I don't know but I do know that they have lots of guns there and they don't lock their doors.Do you feel like you just read a lot of nonsense? That is exactly what I felt like after I watched Bowling for Columbine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** This fictitious, fallacious drivel disguised as a commentary on the gun problem and violence in America should merely be received with denunciation and absolute shame. I was appalled by practically every detail of this "documentary", from its denunciation of America (particularly its chronicle of "American atrocity", adversely ignoring the illimitable countenances and heroic services of America throughout the history of its power), to Moore's insidious blame upon individuals like the legendary comedian Dick Clark, for the tragic killing of an innocent little girl (somehow instituting a program of Welfare to Work is more to blame for a terrible shooting than the culprit who committed the crime himself, because the mother was not around to witness her son engage in nefarious violence. Moore, you are disgustingly confused with every "fact" you present, particularly in your representation of Americans, such as myself, who understand the actual root of violence: the individuals who commit violence. Rather than foolishly endeavoring to "resolve" the problem of gun violence" through removing ammunition from the shelves of K-Mart, suggesting that us Americans behave more like Canada (a country of scarce population and arms) for their handling of violence, etc. etc. etc., you should try and observe the facts: people kill people, and that is the bottom line. This fallacious, offensive excuse for a documentary should have been removed from the shelves as Moore's ammunition scheme in the film. I couldn't detest this "Columbine" "Moore". Shame on you, Michael Moore. Someday I would love to make a documentary depreciating the likes of you, for what you are; rather than blaming our "evil" president, the "evil" conservative faction, which currently constitutes a majority in congress, and the "evil" corporate special interests, for the problems which exist in this country, take a good look in the mirror, and then wonder, "Why do people kill people?" Why do people behave not as who they are, Mr. Moore, ashamed of being what he is, as an American ashamed of being an American? There is essentially more fact than fiction in this "documentary", and I call for an immediate revokation of the 2002 Documentary Oscar! Hollywood, what were you thinking?

		<fullReview>Moore is not logical or accurate. He claimed that Columbine shooters Harris and Klebold got the guns through a legal purchase. Not exactly --that is awfully misleading. Somebody purchased the guns legally and then illegally gave them to Harris and Klebold. The boys were too young to have purchased the guns legally. Anyone that would randomly shoot high school students doesn't care about the law, thus, gun control laws were irrelevant in their case. Just as they shot innocent bystanders illegally they would have (and did) get the guns illegally. Drugs are illegal but people still use them -- do we need more drug laws? More homicide laws wouldn't have prevented Columbine either? So why are we debating what the law should be? The laws on the books are adequate, but people still break them.Weren't Harris and Klebold brought down by men with guns -- weren't the remaining Columbine students saved by men with guns in the end?According to FBI data, states with the most gun laws have the most gun crime and vice versa. Why? Because gun ownership is bad for criminals and good for law abiding citizens defending themselves. When laws take away guns from law-abiding people only criminals like Harris and Klebold will have them. The former will be at the mercy of the latter. The numbers don't lie. See John R. Lott, Jr.'s book More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun-Control Laws (Studies in Law and Economics) http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226493636/youdebatecom/002-8388372-9459211</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie held some interest for me, but he seemed to be asking the wrong questions except, for the end of the movie. Considering the idea throughout seemed to be the inherent evil with guns it was obvious from the questions asked that this isn't really true. I think he should have focused more on why the U.S. seems to be the one country that has problems with an inordinate amount of violence. The facts about Canada show that guns obviously aren't the problem. It would have been more helpful to delve deeper into the history and societal ills of the U.S. for the answers to these questions. I found Moore's biases too strong to take this movie too seriously, especially in light of some of the questionable facts(?) he uses. You have to dig a lot deeper to find more answers. He only used material that fit his viewpoint. I also found the movie somewhat disjointed and didn't really have a good flow. Glad I waited for it to come out on video.</fullReview>

But it does achieve the desired effect, which is to say "see, I grew up this way, I am one of them, you know, gun-toting rednecks, but now i have seen the light and the err of my ways". What a bunch of nonsense. Moore is a mouthpiece for the left, and uses the guise of a documentary, which this film does not qualify as in my book, to put forth a purely biased agenda. The real tragedy at Columbine remains a mystery to all of those who have viewed this film; however, many sheep have been corralled into believing something that they know even less about after having viewed this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what point he's trying to make. At face value you think he's trying to imply that guns are the root cause of why America is so much more violent as a society. Then he implies it's because the media causes us to be afraid to walk out the door. Then he implies it's because single-mothers have to work for evil corporate empires like Dick Clark's restaurant. Then he's back to K-Mart and harassing them because they sell bullets. However he doesn't once interview anyone who actually knew Eric and Dylan. He doesn't try to explain what was happening in their lives that lead to the Columbine incident. The closest he comes is two girls who were in their bowling class who said "they were kinda weird". Heaven forbid anyone proposes that the reason Eric and Dylan did what they did is that they had been ostracized and harassed for years. That when you stop treating somebody humanely you shouldn't expect them to act human. Of course the root of all problems in American society is the evil corporations.Then he does his stunts with Dick Clark, K-Mart, and Heston. His modus-operandi is the same as his previous movies. He will prepare and research his position then show up and demand impromptu interviews in order to sucker punch by presenting information to the person who is unprepared to respond so he can make the other person look foolish and unable to defend themselves. This movie is an insult to the legacy of what happened in Littleton. The word "Columbine" is only used as a cheap means to draw attention to himself and sell more tickets. You should be ashamed of yourself Mr. Moore.</fullReview>

Although I could never say The Media or George Bush were entirely innocent, arguments regarding why they are "evil" are also falsified. By liberally cutting parts of interviews and speeches to prove points that weren't true, he mislead all of us.

If anyone is to blame for the tragedies it is people like Moore who are against social values and anti-American-Culture. When will the public wake up and see that Moore loves to attack and criticize but can't handle the hot seat himself? If there is any justice this film will flop and end up on the $0.99 movie rack.

It was 2 hours of Michael Moore cramming his opinion down your throat as hard as he possibly could. As Michael Moore said in his infamous Oscar speech, "Shame on you". He seemed like a reasonably intelligent man that could have came up with a way of showing the facts without attaching his bias. Michael should have takin notes from the recent documentary, "Capturing the Freidmans". A piece which was exponentially more powerful because of the fact they left the topic open-ended. They let the viewer draw his own conclusions. I get the feeling a lot of these people who claimed to really like the movie agreed with Michael's stance on gun control.

		<shortDescription>Just about the best example of the "Big Lie" technique. Joseph Goebbels would be very proud of Mr. Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just rented "Bowling For Columbine", a masterful piece of deception and propaganda that proves how unethical and intellectually dishonest Michael Moore is. The film should win the Joseph Goebbels Award as the most effective execution of the "Big Lie" technique since Herr Joe coined the phrase (but not the concept). Regardless of one's opinion on the gun issue itself, this film is a perfect example of slick, below the radar dishonesty. As Goebbels said, never tell "little lies". People will catch you in those and may not believe the big ones. Tell real whoppers, mix in some half-truths and a few out of context truisms and make the package seem like common knowledge presented smugly: (everyone knows this---don't you?) or as a shared "in" concept that "you and I" are hip enough to understand and everyone treats it as gospel.The whole tone of the movie made the above clear to me. But the obvious and not so obvious misrepresentations of fact make Moore even more dishonest than I realized. Regardless of one's opinion of Moore, this Academy Award winning "documentary" is anything but.The fact that even Moore admits that it isn't really a documentary (he, quite accurately, calls it a "polemic") demonstrates the ethical and intellectual bankruptcy of the entire Hollywood establishment.Unfortunately, Charlton Heston was never the most effective advocate for the Right to Bear Arms, perhaps the most important and elemental civil liberty. And there is no doubt that he was in the early stages of Alzheimer's Disease when ambushed by Moore. Yet Moore only used a tiny fragment of a 23 minute interview and not only misrepresented other speeches by Heston but actually manufactured them by splicing in quotes from highly disparate speeches and public appearances. He gives the impression that all the bloodthirsty NRA gun psychos gleefully held their annual convention in Denver shortly after the Columbine incident as a form of defiant gloating. He even spliced in the famous Heston speech where, while brandishing an 1860 Henry rifle with which he had been presented, he pumps the air and says "from my cold dead hands". It would have been a real propaganda coup for antigunners if he had done so at that time. But, inconveniently, that speech was several months later, so Moore inserted it in to Heston's Denver speech. And, of course, no mention of the fact that the Convention had been planned years in advance AND that the NRA canceled it's dinner dance and all other events other than the actual meeting required by its bylaws out of deference to local feelings. In another example of this sleazy modus operandus Moore tells the audience that Heston and those evil gun nuts held a "huge pro-gun rally" in Flint Michigan within 48 hours (he makes a point of this) of the classroom shooting of a six year old girl by a six year old boy. The fact is that the "rally" that Moore flashes on the screen took place eight months later while Heston, along with many other politicos was in town stumping for conservative candidates. This was in October of 2000 and Michigan was a hotly contested state in the national elections.Goodness gracious, those pesky facts do get in the way, don't they?!Interestingly, the NRA and the gun establishment aren't the real villains. Big bad Amerikkka is. The film contains a little "historical" cartoon by the makers of "South Park" who are, by the way, from Littleton Colorado. According to these eminent scholars, revolvers were invented to suppress slave rebellions in the South, and both the KKK and NRA were formed the same year, conveniently allowing Klansmen to simply become NRA members once the government began to suppress the Klan. Since this is a family website, I'll have to limit myself to BALDERDASH!!! The Klan was founded in 1867. The NRA was founded in 1871 by former Union generals concerned with the poor marksmanship of Union conscripts, and was originally chartered in the state of New York. It has always been open to all men (and by the turn of the century, women too) without regard to race or creed. Rather revolutionary for organizations of the time. Comparing the NRA to the Ku Klux Klan is perhaps the most vituperative libel of the film and the way it is presented as a hard historical fact is nothing short of despicable.I can point out many other deliberate lies and misrepresentations, but I don't have the time or the space in this medium. I'm tempted to say that Mr. Moore is unprincipled, but that wouldn't be entirely accurate. He's a man with a far left America-hating agenda willing to play dirty to bring about what he may honestly feel is a principled result. After all, as Lenin said: "to make an omelette you've got to break a few eggs"----the perennial mindset of tyrants throughout history.Although it pains me to put money in Moore's pocket, I recommend the movie (which can be entertaining and funny in spots) as a clear example of how clever charlatans manipulate the media and it's consumers.</fullReview>

By making a film for public exhibition, you have given yourself that status, and through its content you are intentionally alarming and misinforming the public.It would be nice if he could have actually presented the facts in an unbiased fashion, and let the rest of us use our heads to process those facts and come to our own conclusions. But Moore, as is the case with most film makers, looks through the camera with only his left eye and makes damn sure we all know he intends for us to see it his way.His little animated bullet cartoon is the worst of it. While mildly entertaining, it paints a portrait of white people as a weak and tremblingly fearful race, prone to kill everything they don't understand, while blacks are decent, kind and strong, only wanting to have a family picnic as the horrible whites hide behind trees with their guns. Next, he has to take issue with the makers of the show "Cops" for having the audacity to show black people being arrested on television for committing crimes, when, as we have already learned, black people don't ever do anything but go on innocent picnics.I got tired of watching Cops a long time ago, but I seem to remember them showing plenty of white and hispanic lawbreakers too. I think most of us have watched the program and laughed at the nasty-looking white drunks as they pitched their equally nasty-looking fat wives through the windows of their trailer houses. But people like Moore want to nurture the image of minorities being mistreated, stereotyped, and harrassed by whites, which is in fact a stereotype in itself. This way he can do his part to keep racism alive and flourishing in the "Land of the Free" forever.One part of this documentary I do agree with is our government's lack of good sense concerning its intrusion into the affairs of other countries. Sure, if somebody comes over here and blows up our real estate and personnel we should not hesitate to find them and send them back to kingdom come. But, on the other hand, if we weren't in their country to begin with, helping their enemies and supplying them all with weapons, they wouldn't have felt a need to attack us in the first place.So now I get to read these comments from people in various parts of the globe who, after having viewed this movie, have the United States all figured out. They sit back, feeling smug and superior, telling us what is wrong with our country and our lack of legislation (too much legislation in my opinion), shaking their heads sadly at our shameful stupidity, laughing at our supposed fear of each-other, not getting the idea that the "fear" is only a media myth to begin with.Well, I don't know why we have the most bloodthirsty citizens in the world. America was founded by men with guns, has been traditionally defended by men with guns, and is being constantly protected by men with guns. Freedom comes with a price. Lives are lost every day, for many reasons, some right, some wrong. As portrayed in the 100th episode of South Park, we need hawks to protect our way of life and keep us from being annihilated, just as we need doves to keep the tempo toned down to a level somewhere below insanity and to show we aren't just a nation of killer rednecks. I, for one, feel plenty safe here, but if I do happen to catch a stray bullet some day, you can bet your ass I won't blame it on K-Mart or Charlton Heston.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Columbine just hit Montreal ? and Michael Moore is still part of the problem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I write this, a disenfranchised Goth Megadeth fan has just opened fire in a Montreal college? and people are referring back to Columbine, occasionally praising Michael Moore's documentary.I couldn't disagree more. Michael Moore is a gun-toting yahoo who is a lifetime member of the NRA and would have you believe that he is an anti-gun activist, an ecologist who drives a SUV, a populist filmmaker who dresses like a pig farmer and lives in a million-dollar mansion, and an anti-Bush activist who helped elect and re-elect Bush by voting for Ralph Nader. His film "Bowling for Columbine" received an Oscar from Hollywood because Hollywood was so glad that at least one film about Columbine put it off the hook for producing entertainment glorifying crime and violence non-stop. His very next project, "Fahrenheit 9/11" received the Palme d'Or in Cannes from a jury headed by Quentin Tarantino, who is the foremost American provider of films glorifying violent crime.What is more to the point, Moore's film is misleading, superficial and doesn't address any of the real reasons of the Columbine massacre: disenfranchised youths who are marginalized by institutional school bullying from jocks, and absent parents, who turn to America's violent images-of-death subculture - which is rapidly becoming mainstream - for solace. He takes the blame off violent TV shows and films, violent video games and violent heavy metal music. He even has Marilyn Manson, the perpetrators' supposed favourite act, do a tie-in video for his DVD edition in a very lucrative deal for both parties and speak words of wisdom in an interview. He blames everything on the NRA and poor Charlton Heston. Well, guess what, we don't have the NRA in Canada and black-clad Goth victims of bullying and exclusion, who have just listened to Megadeth's maudlin ode to murder-suicide "A tout le monde" for inspiration, are still packing guns and shooting randomly in the streets.Maybe Moore's cute little film should be retired from the market as being produced under false pretenses, dangerous to your mental health and your power of reasoning. Michael Moore, I blame you for the continuing violence!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Joseph Goebbles award for creative propoganda goes to Michael Moore. In this film Moore distorts reality for entertainment purposes, muckraking his political bias into a moronic frenzy. That so many people are fooled by this garbage shows how painfully ignorant they are of the actual issues and current laws. If ever a film deserved an award for histrionics in the service of propoganda, Bowling for Columbine is it. The voters of the academy have deprecated the entire genre of documentary by bestowing an award on this pedantic and inaccurate tripe. It is a propoganda piece, and not even a very good one, not a documentary.Like Michael Bellesiles, whose book Arming America won the prestigious Bancroft Prize, Moore deserves to be fully discredited and the award revoked. That's precisely what happened to Bellesiles, whose Emory University professorship was stripped, Bancroft Prize revoked, and book publication halted when his massive fraud was revealed by a multitude of real historians, actual researchers and competent statisticians. They found that he falsified research and "violated basic norms of scholarship" when he tried to falsely show that guns were not prevalent in antebellum America, presumably to advance an anti-firearm political agenda.Anyone who thinks Moore's similar fraud deserves merit is either severely misinformed or foolish or probably both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore blames everything but the kitchen sink for gun violence, everything but the individual responsible for it, that is. Typically the liberal, Moore doesn't truly debate issues he simply tries to frame his interviews in such a way that it creates a certain impression. It is an extremely manipulative way to make a movie (especially a documentary). Moore's offers no viable solutions. It's rather naive of those who have reviewed the film to claim Moore isn't anti-gun because of his NRA history. He certainly has advanced beyond the stage where of childlike naivety where some liberals blame the weapon itself for the deaths. But Moore hasn't quite reached the level where he can comprehend the negative aspects of man's free will. If you ignore free will, you cannot deal with any human problem in an intellectually mature fashion.In a way, by making this film, he is feeding into the "culture of fear" he claims is promoted by the media. If you want to look at someone who profits from fear look no further than Moore. In this case he profits from the fear of "fear". You have to be obtuse not to see the irony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the wake of the most massive tragedy of all, the planes on 9/11 flying into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon and into a field in Pennsylvania, Bowling For Columbine found a ready and receptive audience and earned itself an Oscar for Best Documentary. It's not clear however whether this will stand the test of time like some of the work that Edward R. Murrow did with Joe McCarthy or with migrant workers. Murrow was simply telling a story and focusing like a laser on a specific problem with some suggested cures. Michael Moore was lumping everything into a general us versus them.No doubt about it gun violence is one god awful problem. I spent years at New York State Crime Victims Board paying claims for funeral expenses for survivors expenses to bury loved ones. The availability of firearms in the USA is some kind of surreal joke. The best part of Bowling For Columbine is right at the beginning with Moore getting a choice of firearm for opening an account at a Michigan bank. I opened an account at Citi-Bank when I moved to Buffalo and got a piggy bank.Long before the USA was industrialized we were a frontier nation and that's ingrained in our national culture. That second amendment was put into our constitution was something thought necessary as we also were adverse to a standing army. Well we've sure got one now, but no one bothered to modify that 2nd amendment or reinterpret it. I was also a member of the Army Reserve in my younger days, but no one took their M-16s home with them nor did we purchase them for our own use.The National Rifle Association is one powerful lobby because so many people feel the need to own a weapon. Until that's excised from our national consciousness, we won't see a realistic reduction of weapons any time soon.Michael Moore took all of his beliefs and crammed them into one film. These things have the flimsiest of connections if any. I remember in Oliver Stone's JFK we bring in Donald Sutherland's character to pull together all the conspiracy threads that led to the JFK assassination to make it all clear. With Moore doing his own narrating the film is like Sutherland's scene exponentially expanded with visuals.The NRA after the Columbine High School shooting massacre rather callously did not call off a convention scheduled for Denver. To keep the issue of the right to bear arms as they see it they elected a celebrity president, Hollywood screen legend Charlton Heston. Sad to say Heston was in his dotage when he took the position and left it when he acknowledged said dotage admitting Alzheimer's Disease.Personally I've always kept beliefs and entertainment in different worlds. If I didn't I wouldn't enjoy the work of a lot of people like Charlton Heston. In fact in his younger days Heston marched for civil rights in the 50s and 60s. He's not the first or the last person to change his mindset on issues. He grew more conservative as he aged, I in fact grew more liberal.So I'm not amused at Moore's mocking of Heston. No more than I was amused at Howard Stern mocking Kirk Douglas after his stroke. It just wasn't called for.A little less mockery and a lot more focus would have given Michael Moore a better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed documentary classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bowling For Columbine is Michael Moore's examination of gun culture in America following the Columbine High School massacre. Probably his most critically acclaimed movie, this has Moore's fingerprints all over it. With him being in front of the camera a lot as well as giving voiceovers, Moore unleashes the full force of his outspoken, controversial, unsubtle and biased documentary filmmaking technique and this won't win points for restraint. Moore distorts information, manipulates the viewer a lot and attacks his subject relentlessly, rather than weighing up both sides of the argument. Not everyone will agree with this method, and there are certainly scenes where you can almost hear him thinking about how to hammer his point home even with false information. But, Moore has done a lot of research and knows his stuff. He also makes a lot of excellent points, but more importantly does so in a hugely entertaining and at times funny manner. It certainly makes you think, even if you're not always convinced.Michael Moore shows himself to be one of the best editors of all time here. His construction of montages and interviews is genuinely extraordinary, and he discusses and presents his argument is a hugely engaging manner, meaning that the film although 2 hours long is rarely, if ever, boring. It's a well written documentary overall and although Moore's approach is flawed, it sets the film apart from other films of its kind. With a lot of personality and a lot of anger, this is a unique documentary, even if at times it feels like a personal reflection instead of a neutral, more widespread view of the subject. A thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking film overall, which also delivers on the emotional punch required for a documentary on this subject. It's certainly flawed and doesn't always fit the definition of a documentary, but it's a pleasure to see such an audacious vision in a documentary, and even if you don't agree with his methods, you can't deny Michael Moore is making a good point.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the Michael Moore documentaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, Michael Moore is an extraordinary documentarian, making an adventure out of every topic he tackles, rather than a series of talking heads. Bowling for Columbine tackles gun violence in the U.S. with simple, open-ended question: Why the U.S.? What is it about the culture and history as well as access to guns of the United States that makes this country such a dangerous place to live with so many gun deaths compared to all other industrialized countries? His answer is not a simplistic one - it is not simply that we have a 2nd amendment and people misinterpret it as so many anti-gun folks might say. Canadians own about as many firearms and yet they don't have nearly the rate of gun-related deaths. Although many will view this film as anti-gun, I think the film is much more sophisticated than those who feel threatened even by the question "why" understand the film? Moore, in fact, does not come to any hard and fast conclusions, perhaps other than that we in the U.S. live in a culture of fear and there are historical conditions, including racial segregation and economic conditions that we as Americans have not come close to fully addressing. This documentary is a must-see for anyone concerned about the number of gun related deaths and injuries and even for those who believe the 2nd amendment protects a person's right to bear arms, but feels that no "right" is without some reasonable restrictions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 years on and more relevant than ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the wake of the recent shootings in Virginia by a masked gunman live on air and the seemingly endless mass killings in America taking place in schools, movie theatres and churches, it seemed like the perfect time to re-visit Bowling for Columbine, Michael Moore's breakthrough documentary on gun violence in America. It has been 16 years since the massacre of 12 students and 1 teacher at Columbine High School in Columbine, Colorado, and 13 years since Michael Moore won the Best Documentary Oscar for his extremely provocative and shocking film. The main question is has anything changed? The answer is a resounding no. In fact, gun violence seems more out of control than ever.Starting out tongue-in-cheek, Bowling for Columbine begins by telling a few amusing, almost too-ridiculous-to-be-true anecdotes highlighting America's love of guns. Moore opens an account in a bank, only to be rewarded with a rifle for doing so. and begging the question of just how sensible it is to be handing out guns in a bank. We then learn of a couple of men who thought it would be funny to dress up their dog in hunting gear with a rifle strapped to it's back, only for the gun to fall off and shoot one of them in the leg. These early moments are hilarious as Moore interviews the type of crazy-haired lunatics who should have their own soundtrack of twanging banjos, but serve to set up the audience for something more serious and all the more troubling.Is America's violent history to blame for the amount of gun deaths that occur every year? Most large countries, such as Britain, Germany and Japan, were built on bloodshed and have committed recent atrocities. Is America's love of guns as a way of life the reason for so much violence? Canada is also a gun-loving nation of hunters, but Canadian's leave their doors unlocked when they leave their home. Is it the poverty and mass unemployment? Nope - check out almost any other country with the same social issues but without the same levels of crime. It's when Moore takes a trip across the water to Canada that he seems to have the revelation. He catches a clip of the news, where the breaking story is the introduction of speed bumps. These people weren't being drilled with fear 24/7. Switch on the news in America, and you see young black males being chased down, arrested, and thrown into the back of a police car, or as interviewee Marilyn Manson points out, there are adverts telling you that if you don't brush with Colgate, you'll have bad breath and no- one with come near you.For the majority of Bowling for Columbine, Michael Moore raises some terrifying questions and makes many very good points, all delivered with powerful, ironic montage's, insightful interviews, and a wry humour. But the last quarter descends into a Moore vanity piece, as he puts himself in front of the camera when he should remain behind it. Moore takes a couple of Columbine's survivors to Walmart to campaign against their sale of bullets and brings the press with him. Although it gets the job done, Moore's ever-presence as a kind of working man's hero makes it come across as a cheap publicity stunt. There's also the climactic interview with NRA president Charlton Heston, who Moore lures in under false pretences and then ambushes with questions of gun-control, a tactic that crosses any journalistic boundaries into sheer rudeness and left me uncomfortable. However, Bowling for Columbine is still an extremely powerful film, and is still shockingly relevant over a decade later. Every week, the news seems to deliver a story about yet another massacre and yet a lot of American's still argue that guns are important for self-defence, which is an extremely depressing thought indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best "Anti USA" movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American scheme (dream) is laid bare for anyone to see in this movie. First a few things I have to disclaim. Michael Moore can be crass at times. His method of getting interviews are bordering on trolling at times, but one has to remember that it is honestly a joke believing these people will stand up for the charges made against them. I think without these comedy bits his documentaries would be a bit dry, even if he is off the mark sometimes.As I watched this movie I really started to wonder why is it that Americans are so backwards and controlled by fear. He interviews people who have no idea that they are displaying their mental illnesses on camera and it punctuates his points incredibly. People spend so much time criticizing Moore that they prove his point, Americans are not willing to listen or rethink their values. Their immediate response is to attack someone with opposing views, not with debate but with verbal or emotional abuse. Unfortunately Moore (and me and other Americans) also are guilty of throwing dirt before talking it out. So there is also that irony to be pondered. All in all it is a fascinating movie that is a singular documentary on the gun problem in America. People like Moore give us a reason to be proud to be American. Even if we aren't a part of the "gravy train".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael More is a mastermind behind educating the American people in a fun and fascinating fashion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Violence is a devastating aspect of our planet. America is one of the countries containing the highest number of gun violence, poverty, and fear professor Michael Moore examines. Never has a documentary been more critical or more entertaining than "Bowling For Columbine. Tackling all the following aspect of the American society such as gun violence, gun usage, violent behavior, how gun violence interferes with poverty, the NRA, the easy access to gun violence, and more. You'll realize how gun-crazy our country is when Moore walks into a bank of all places, only to come out with a shotgun he purchased and not a deposit. I scratched my head too. What's even more alerting is the number of people so loyal to killing machines and see it as a right to own an assault riffle. Moore isn't opposing the second amendment, he's moderating it. And boy do we need moderation. The gun-nuts out there are scary. With a fascinating look as to the purpose behind the tragic Columbine massacre that left nearly twenty teenagers dead, we shrivel as to the unknown reason as to why violence even happens in our country. There are countries who have more guns than us, but hardly .01% of the crime. Moore doesn't feed you sociology textbooks like any liberal teacher, he urges you to think and begs to find a reason. That's the beauty behind this guy, he doesn't give you answers. he gives facts, interviews, and reality. Never has an interview been more tense than when Michael sits down with former NRA leader Charleton Heston and debates over the wackadoo gun popularity. Paced beautifully with some humor that destroys extreme American views, then transforming to a depressed victim of gun violence, "Bowling For Columbine" informs us on where our society is going due to the outrageously tragic amounts of violence that shape our fear and other social issues including poverty. Story after story, fight after fight (including banning bullets from K-Mart), Michael Moore is a genius of documentary filmmaking and teaching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of this movie did sound odd to me when I first heard it. I didn't connect it with the shooting at Columbine high school right away. Then I read what the movie was about and it clicked. I looked up the word "Columbine" and found that it means "aquilegia" (ger. "Akelei") which of course makes no sense in combination with "bowling". I saw the film and then understood why Moore picked that title. Yet, I probably would have chosen a different title, since this is no (exclusive) documentary about the Columbine shooting. So don't expect that.A friend recommended this movie to me and I would like to recommend it to just anyone to go see it. It's a controversial issue and it is a good thing to talk about it and this movie certainly makes people talk about it. This movie is not against guns it is against people killing others with guns and tries to find the reason, the motivation behind this. It fails to give an answer, so do not expect one, either.It succeeds in showing that something can be done if people decide to speak up (K-Mart). It also succeeds in showing that the number of guns per household is not necessarily linked to the number of gun deaths per year, mainly by comparison with other countries. It picks up the concept of "fear and consumption" as main motor behind this dilemma, yet again it doesn't insist on this being the absolute truth. Moore is unsure. He doesn't know. We don't either.He feels there's need to talk about the almost 12,000 gun deaths/per year. And he definitely is right about that. The more people talk about this, the better the chances are that this number can be decreased.It is not a movie that wants to make you jump to conclusions about Americans, it wants to make us communicate and try to help find answers to a problem that needs solving. It might even help a little if people stopped watching/being interested in Reality TV shows and rather watch more documentaries...8/10</fullReview>

MikeMoore does a good job of demonstrating that there is a problem inthe US, one that doesn't seem to exist elsewhere. He then tries toanalyse why, and it seems to me that the conclusion is the cultureof fear promoted by the American media.The movie becomes a little confused at points, because it tends togo in directions that do not seem to follow this conclusion. Forexample, Mike Moore attacks Charlton Heston on his gunownership stance, even though he himself has already agreedthat it is not the level of gun ownership that is the problem.The segments on welfare and the poor, and how the richestcountry in the world doesn't see the need to care for its owndisadvantaged is done very well, but I don't see that it isparticularly relevant to the gun issue. It just serves to take awayfrom the point Mike Moore is trying to make.I would probably have given the movie a 7, but the subject matterdeserves and extra point. I feel that it is critical that more UScitizens watch this movie and start to think about what sort of worldthey want to live in. Stand back for a little and look objectively at therest of the world and you'll see that there are a lot of things in theUS that can be improved (whether you won WW2 or not!).Michael.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America Under the Gun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowhere as good as his documentary "Sicko" about our failed and disgraceful health care system here in the US filmmaker Michael Moore takes on the gun lobby and especially the NRA, National Rifle Association, in the film and comes up a bit short in it about the availability of guns in America and how violent a society we've become because of them. Using the 1999 Columbine High school massacre as his argument he tried to condemn all gun owners as well as sellers as being directly responsible for it. As for the two very unstable teenagers Eric Harris &amp; Dylan Klebold who "executed" it his documentary seems to give them a free pass in what they did in it being more because of the country's gun culture then their fault. We see throughout the movie a number of horrific crimes committed by guns both legal &amp; illegal by mostly very unstable people who should never have been able to get their hands on them. Yet in most cases they did by legally being able to buy them and the ammunition that goes along with them at their local K-Mart.It's in this Moore makes his best points but when he goes after people like actor Charlton Heaston and Dick Clark for both owning and promoting guns he loses a good percentage of his audience who like Heston believe in the Second Amendment and are law abiding citizens and are as outraged at what happened at Colmbine as he himself is. Instead of concentrating in his film for stricter background checks and eliminating military style assault weapons which many if not most members of the NRA are for Moore seems to hold the NRA, which in fact Moore is a lifelong member of, more responsible for the gun crimes done mostly by very unstable and committable individuals then those committed by the criminals in the movie.We do get the message that America is steeped in a gun culture since even before its founding in 1776 but what Moore overlooks is the social problems that its now facing that leads to the gun as well as other violence that's now terrorizing this nation. It's the fear instilled on us by our elected and unelected leaders that drives people to buy guns legally or illegally more to protect themselves and their families then what people are supposed,like Michael Moore himself, to have in hunting target shooting and gun collecting.If Michael Moore was totally against guns in our society he should be against them for being sold to the public for any reason. Yet he claims that he's been a gun enthusiast since he was a pre-teenager and won a number of medals for sharpshooting. But in him staunchly defending the Second Amendment yet attacking those, like collectors and law abiding citizen like Charlton Heaston, who supports it makes Moore sound a bit hypocritical to say the least. I felt Moore holding Charlton Heaston responsible for the shooting to death of a six year old girl in Moore's home town of Flint Michigan by a six year old boy who's mom was away at work as low a blow as Mike Tyson biting off Evander Holyfield's ear in their Heavyweight Championship bout in June 1997! I was almost expecting Heston who so graciously invited Moore to his home for the interview to lose his cool in him being ambushed by Moore and belt him right in his mouth. Yet like the gentleman that he is Heston just excused himself and walked out on his interview with him. Moore to his credit does bring out that on the day of the Columbine massacre we the US launched the biggest air and missile strike on Seriba in the Kosovo War that killed at least a dozen times as many Innocent civilians,many as young or even younger, as those killed at Columbine with President Bill Clinton who ordered the strikes on TV seeming to actually boast about ordering it.Yet hours later we see Clinton almost in tears crying over the victims at Columbine as if those killed by his actions in Serbia weren't even worth mentioning! We do need tougher gun laws as well as penalties for those who commit gun crimes in this country but by not leading by example in the support of the many dubious and possibly criminal conflicts and wars as well as targeted assassinations, without a trial, overseas that those for total gun control who for the most part are fully in favor of it the entire anti gun issues falls flat on its face. Like the saying "Do as I say not as I do" we or those who are in charge can't expect normal citizens to give up their firearms when their own government is so eager to use them for any reason that pops into its head. Even to the point, which many gun owner and supporters of the Second Amendment fear, against its own people, like in Waco Texas and Ruby Ridge, whenever it feels it being necessary!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie many time as a french Canadian, I must say that it is eye opening, but should be taken with precaution. The montage of the film is good. A few nice shot along with dynamic change of beat. The sound is good too. The music is good and fit the visual. A little clin d'oeil to a clockwork orange, a nice sound editing and good volume balance between voices and music make it enjoyable to ear. You may have notice from other review around here with 0 knowledge of how to rate a movie, that the information are totally flawed and therefor it is worth a 1 star out of 10, but it is not 100% true. The information in this movie are good but aren't objectives. The KKK and NRA information were a bit changed, and the other Other country's (especially Canada) information butchered. It is not true that Canadian doesn'T lock their door. It is not true that Canadian hang out in front of Taco Bell or that a ghetto look like that in Canada. The movie was made by an American who had very low knowledge of other country culture. But only an idiot could put a score under 4 out of 10 while only judging the information for this movie. Especially considering the fact that it is a movie that display greatly the culture of fear of the united states (No need to be a genius to understand that the American people are afraid).On a final note, the movie wasn't made for the single purpose of destroying information. It was made to make American realize that there is really something wrong with them. all the other country in the world can tell you that). sure it's not all American that have problem. but there is a lot more then other country on the level of murder and crime against the world.tl;dr the movie is not perfect and have some flawed informations, but it still does a great job showing a huge problem to anyone who watches it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A political film in every sense of the word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's Bowling For Columbine is a political film in every sense, namely because it is a film directly involved with political situations in the United States. Since this is a documentary Michael Moore can simply state the message he is trying to get across without the use of artistic metaphors or allusions. Despite being a documentary however he does use some clever techniques to get his message across to the viewer. Moore has received some criticism for some of his techniques but his point gets communicated to the audience nonetheless.Bowling For Columbine came out in 2002 nearly a year after the attacks of 9/11. The United State's atmosphere was extremely tense and citizens were afraid. This is the basis of Michael Moore's theory of why the United States is "gun crazy". He believes the gun homicide rate is so high in the country because people are afraid and on edge constantly. He proves this point because the sale of firearms and ammunition went up drastically after the terrorist attacks. He points out the irony that a country that claims it's peaceful, mostly uses violence to solve its problems.The Columbine Massacre is the main argument for Moore because it asks the question of how a couple of teenage kids had such easy access to numerous deadly weapons. The massacre shows the tragic results of what can occur in conjunction with a country having such loose gun laws, as the United States does. Moore starts off his Columbine segment with the actual 911 calls made during the massacre. The plays the footage of the attack while the audio is playing, the result is a very disturbing and sobering sequence. It really hits home with the viewer and makes them sympathize and listen to the point that Moore is trying to convey. Another clever technique Moore uses to get his point across is made apparent in another scene. The scene where Moore rattles off stats of United States military involvement in other countries and the deaths resulted from the attacks is already a very sobering scene. He goes even further to show graphic footage of dead bodies and explosions. All the while he is juxtaposing all this disturbing information and video with Louis Armstrong's "What A Wonderful World". The juxtaposition of these two mediums creates a very impactful scene that strongly resonates with the audience. This same technique was also used in the film "Good Morning Vietnam" starring Robin Williams, and it has the same effect.Michael Moore raises some very interesting questions in Bowling For Columbine. The main one being, "Why is the United States so unique from other gun loving countries?" He shows how the United States has more gun related deaths than other countries such as Canada. One of the answers that he comes up with is that the media is creating fear in the country by only showing violent and disturbing news.Despite having some clever and impactful techniques, Michael Moore does have some controversial ones. There are times where he seems to go too far with some of the people is he interviewing. Moore becomes condescending at times and sometimes even blatantly insults whom he is interviewing. Sometimes it can be deserved when he is interviewing an expert or someone who should be held accountable for something like in the interview he had with Charlton Heston. However there are times where he becomes rude to people who aren't in fact experts and Moore makes them look foolish for no reason. This may take away some of Moore's credibility at times. Sometimes a point can be clearly made without taking the low road and making the "opponent" look dumb.Even with a few techniques that can be deemed controversial Moore does drive his message across quite clearly and he does seem to back up his argument with facts. Bowling For Columbine raises some important questions that people should take notice of, especially United Sates citizens.</fullReview>

When you check the REAL facts made fiction you may be ill!You can find this and other sites by going to the famous search engine, Google and entering:truth about columbine hardylawYou will see SEVERAL sites that debunk the very premise of this movie and there is plenty of material to use to make your own investigation ... if you are a fair-minded person, you will be sickened by the misrepresentation of fact by way of editing and outright lies.And there are too many to even recount here but the NRA facts are total fiction made from editing speeches given over a period of months to seem as reaction to Columbine. The "rocket thru the streets in middle of the night" is whole cloth as well.In short, if people in this movie, including Heston.. seem callous and unfeeling, it is ONLY because Moore made it that way.So if the movie is a fraud, how can one rate it as high as it seems to be. Yep, Moores films are fun to watch but his inappropriate display at the Oscars was truly in keeping with promoting his far-left agenda at any price. \ Again I DONT ask you to believe me.. do a little work and you will see for yourself.What a bunch of Lemmings we are!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excercise in Self-aggrandisement. He tells us what he thinks and thinking is not really his strong point, rather than showing us. Most of us would have made up our minds on gun laws on the presentation of the statistics and the harrowing cctv video showing the massacre at the high school. The interview with the parents was heart wrenching stuff.Part blaming the actions on Lockheed Martin and the media is pretty poor analysis of what happened at Columbine, suffice to say that all other major democracies have arm manufacturers that do not seem to inspire others to kill. Unfortunately there is not enough space here to talk about what makes so many Americans kill each other in such large numbers.Clinton's finest hour in my humble opinion was that he went into Kosovo and stopped genocide, Michael Moore doesn't seem to grasp the most fundamental concepts regarding foreign policy. I could go on.He had to hog the limelight when Kmart decided that they would stop selling munitions , a great director would have stayed behind the camera, the victims and their injuries were in the background, Michael Moore was in the foreground, only the most narcissistic individual would do what he did, almost shameful.But... Since there is very little political debate in the US on anything important, can you imagine congress under its on volition delivering sensible gun laws for its voters? Its like most contentious issues, it will be decided by the Supreme Court (Roe Vs Wade, the US has still to ratify a sensible abortion law). If this film can get this onto the floor of congress it might deserve its rating. Otherwise it is on a par with JFK, they both spoil the argument by overstating the case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was a little insulted....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie primarily for the reason that I knew a few people who went to Columbine during the time of the shooting. But I was a little insulted because I grew up in Littleton and it seemed to me that Michael Moore attacked Littleton in being the "poster city" of violence. Out of all the school shootings that has happened throughout the U.S. Columbine is by far the worst, so I'm not denying that. But other than Columbine, he didn't fail to mention the bowling alley shooting that also occurred in Littleton and he didn't fail to use a news clip showing a person buying guns after 9/11 that showed in the upper left hand corner that the city was...Littleton, CO.A lot of people in the documentary mentioned that where these crimes were committed in a "painfully normal" suburb. Not true. I went to high school with a girl whose brother was killed in Columbine, so she lives in the neighborhood where the majority of Columbine students live. She told me that where she lives suicide and homicide crimes are higher in that part of the city than anywhere else in Littleton. The majority of kids who live there are majorly troubled. So, yes, Littleton is not the utopia of Colorado, but not all of Littleton is like that, and it seemed that Moore was criticizing the entire city of Littleton.I know that the documentary was centered around Columbine considering the title, but I was just a little annoyed that he seemed to be attacking the city that I know as my home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dueling Narratives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visual media, especially TeeVee and adding radio exist in an economy of ideas that restrict them. The restrictions are severe because the human mind has a hardwired need for narrative, a story, a collection of reasons and events that make sense. The more clear the sense of the thing, the stronger it pulls on us.So each of us enter into that space needing something that simply seems clear. Some of that is in the simplicity of the thing, some in the simple art of storytelling and some having to do with how well it fits our "real" world. Conservative political philosophy didn't have to become the sole owner of these simplicities. At root, conservative views (way back) were as complex, subtle and yes, honorable as any other. But by an accident of history, for some short term gain they appropriated the simple tools of the closed limited story of film and such. This created the appearance of an "opposition" as what is now called "liberal" ran toward loud claims that the world is not as simple as the others presented.It is an accident of history that the conservatives own the cinematic platitudes. From this comes the obvious observation that it is impossible to have liberal talk radio, for instance.This is the situation Micheal Moore walks into. He sees a world that has adopted simple views that are divorced from reality. He senses that the best attack is to try to win back the platforms. He's been in the magazine, talk radio and TeeVee business, but it is movies where he found the right formula ? and that is to present as simple a story from the opposition as that now pushed by the red state/business consortium.Thus, we have a simple story in "9-11" that Bush took us to Iraq because of family connections to the oil business. Sounds incredibly stupid when written, but a powerful cinematic presentation ? skilled ? sorta had it make sense when you watched.Before that was this. The goal is to come up with a narrative as simple and powerful as that of the NRA crowd, and map it to a cinematic vocabulary. I'll let you decide whether this is a worthy enterprise, based on the costs and benefits.But the question here is not about whether the "argument" is right, the narrative true, but whether it is good film-making. I think not. That's because he tries two things here: he presents his own quest for "the answer" at the same time he presents us with the answer.So we ramble through all sorts of tentative narratives, discarding each along the way: Indians, slavery, imperialism. Then on to the nature of media: video games, edgy rock, the selling of fear via TeeVee. He should have stuck with that because it would have matched the folding of his quest with the goal.So on to the institutionalization of fear in the American character. Surprisingly little on the gun lobby and the link of American entrepreneurialism in the face of no social net to the "spirit of individualism" and the link to self defense. Too complex, those, I guess.If you think of yourself as "liberal," you may want to think twice about what it implies to stoop to simple narratives. If you are interested in effective film-making, look instead at Moore's 9-11 movie. Its more effective at the game.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hype got to me. I had been hearing about Michael Moore for too long, I had to see what all the fuss was about. I'm glad I did so because now I know what I was missing out on... Not much at all really. The problem with Bowling for Columbine is it's often hard to know what to believe as Moore is very sketchy with some of his information and he rarely gets in depth with the topics he touches on. He is a very clever and manipulative guy, you have to give him that much. In a roundabout way I agree with what he has to say; there is no doubting that there is a gun problem in the states, but it's hard to warm to the film as Moore comes across as really quite arrogant and annoying and he leaves so much to be desired from his interviews (I would love to see the entire Marilyn Manson interview, they seemed to be on two completely different pages). It might have turned out to be a better film if he had gotten Fahrenheit 9/11 out of his system before making this. Just take the film with a grain of salt, it's nothing special. Bowling for Columbine: 6.5/10 really not much of note (to me anyway).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The main message is the climate of fear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching Bowling for Columbine that Michael Moore won the Oscar for last year. Everybody refers to it as an anti-gun documentary, and they make much of the fact that even though Moore is a lifetime member of the NRA, he made an anti-gun documentary. I guess they really weren't paying attention when they watched it, if they did watch it before reviewing it.Moore talks a lot about the easy availability of firearms in the U.S. and contrasts it with countries with more restrictive gun laws, but he mentions it as only one possibility for the high incidence of violence. He also mentions poverty (which seems to be his personal favorite), violent movies and videogames, rock music, lack of religious upbringing, lack of parental control and the historical imperative (We've always been violent. It's part of our frontier heritage.)To me, the most important question that he asks is why Canada, which has almost as many guns per household as the US, which has as easy access to the purchase of firearms and ammunition, has a much lower homicide rate than the U.S. I think he hears the answer at one point but doesn't recognize it for what it is. He is interviewing Charlton Heston and asks him the question. Heston mentions some of the factors that Moore has already analyzed and discarded, and then he mentions "diversity of ethnicity". Moore jumps on this as evidence of Heston's racism and misses the point. The point Moore should have seen is the higher degree of homogeneity in Canadian culture outside of the French/Anglo split, and there is a high degree of homogeneity within the two cultures, while they themselves are geographically separate. It is this high degree of homogeneity in other cultures that I believe to be a primary determining factor in their lower violence rates.I believe that the main message of Bowling for Columbine is not "Guns are Bad" as the reviewers and the press would have us believe. Rather I think the message is that the U.S. historical sense of isolationist individualism and self-reliance has been perverted into a feeling of paranoia and fear thy neighbor by the government and the media. First of all by a media that believes that violence sells papers, and secondly by politicians who believe that a population in fear is more easily lead and controlled.Moore asks a lot of questions. Unfortunately, he doesn't always want the answers. He himself is a fear-mongering media flack. He would rather ambush someone and make them look stupid and guilty than provide a balanced, carefully thought out analysis of the issues. He is a skillful documentarian but he is one pole in a situation that he himself has polarized. He wants to present a media event that is controversial because controversy (a low level form of violence) sells. One media commentator whom he interviews says of the philosophy of the press in selecting which stories go on the front page, "If it bleeds, it leads." Moore is just as guilty of that point of view as any member of the jackal press.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shame on you, Mr. Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** This fictitious, fallacious drivel disguised as a commentary on the gun problem and violence in America should merely be received with denunciation and absolute shame. I was appalled by practically every element of this "documentary", from its outrageous denunciation of America (particularly its chronicle of "American atrocity", adversely ignoring the listless countenances and heroic services of America throughout the history of its power), to Moore's insidious blame upon individuals like the legendary entertainer Dick Clark, for the tragic killing of an innocent little girl. Somehow instituting a program of Welfare to Work is more to blame for a terrible shooting than the culprit who committed the crime himself, because the mother was not around to witness her son engage in nefarious violence. Everything presented as a "fact" is terribly distorted, fallacious, and false. Disgustingly confused with every "fact" he presents, particularly in his representation of Americans such as myself, who understand the actual root of violence: the individuals who commit violence, this documentary would be more suitable with the label "liberal fantasy". Rather than foolishly endeavoring to "resolve" the problem of gun violence through removing ammunition from the shelves of K-Mart, suggesting that us Americans should behave more like Canada (a country of significant less population and arms than America) for their handling of violence and gun control, etc. etc. etc., Mr. Moore should try and observe the facts: people kill people, and that is the bottom line. This fallacious, offensive excuse for a documentary should have been removed from the shelves as Moore's "ammunition scheme" in the film. I couldn't detest this "Columbine" "moore". Shame on you, Michael Moore. Someday, I would love to produce a veritable documentary deploring the likes of the idiocy which rummages throughout your ridiculous "mind". Rather than blaming our "evil" president, the "evil" conservative, right-wing faction, and the "evil" corporate special interests, for every problem which exists in this country, take a good look in the mirror and then wonder not, "Why do people kill people?" Rather, why do people behave not as who they are? Michael Moore, "Americans are possibly the dumbest people on the planet"; and this is no distortion nor fallacy like the "facts" presented in this film. There is essentially more fact in fiction than in this "documentary", and I call for an immediate revocation of the 2002 Documentary Oscar for this refuse. Anybody who believes what Michael Moore has to say here or in the upcoming travesty "Fahrenheit 9/11", is either deeply misguided, ashamed of being an American, or completely ignorant.

		<fullReview>BFC is quite simply the greatest collection of lies ever to be put together by a so-called "journalist". Whilst I initially enjoyed and even believed the propaganda spouted by Moore, I came to do more research into his claims and found almost all of them to be distortions of the truth.Some examples: 1) Charlton Heston did not go conduct a pro-gun rally in Flint - it was a political rally, and it was held 8 months after the killing - not 48 hours later as the movie portrays.2) Moore claims the Lockheed-Martin plant in Columbine makes bombs, when all it does is make weather satellite rockets. They are transported at night-time because the convoy is so long it would disrupt traffic.3) when Moore presents the photograph of the killed girl to Heston, it's clear that the scene was staged, since the camera was showing Moore's back - and then showing his face - and from the scene it is obvious that there was no second camera. Moore later says in an interview on TV that there were two cameras which is clearly a lie, judging by the footage on the film.4) the plaque at the bottom of the B-52 does not applaud the bombing of innocent civilians as the BFC proclaims. It is proclaiming the downing of a MiG fighter plane, which was considered VERY difficult to do for the cumbersome B-52.5) Moore portrays Marilyn Manson, named after a serial killer Charles Manson as a "good guy", with almost "intelligent" ideas. But in actuality Manson's ideas are equally as simplistic. To think that children are more influenced by geopolitics that they know nothing about, than by a pop icon is delusional. Clinton was fighting to prevent genocide in Kosovo, and Moore mentions that more bombs were dropped on that day than any other day of the war - as if the children somehow knew that at the time and were subconsciously motivated to kill children as a result! Records of the Columbine killer's diaries on the other hand show them admiring Hitler and Darwinism and that they formed their killer instincts from their belief in Evolution and Natural Selection - beliefs which the USA fought against in Kosovo.-- I could go on, but by now it should be clear just how much of a liar and a distorter of truth Moore is. For more information you can go to bowlingfortruth dot com, as I have found that site to be the most factual in debunking Moore's outrageous claims.</fullReview>

A documentary is supposed to be, well, based on the facts and since it is not I cannot praise this movie. I will say it was put together well, especially the staged scenes where he got a gun at a bank and bullets at a store without having his ID checked. Moore edited together Heston's speech very well, you'd have no idea that the dialogue actually comes from several speeches and that Heston's messages didn't come close to the fabricated one that Moore created. Honestly I don't know why he bothered, intelligent viewers can smell the propaganda on this film within the first minute and can easily find the facts on the event on the net. Narrow-minded individuals will buy the message of this film faster than you can say "John Q"!

		<fullReview>It's sad that some see Michael Moore as some kind of crusader when in reality his "working-class smart ass" routine is as tired as his flannel shirts. Moore typically frames any debate as a "smart vs. dumb contest" rather than an exchange of ideas and as a result immensely pleases his target audience: elitist urban liberals. This type of "debate" is not uncommon to liberals. The New York Times and the Washington Post do much the same although they do a much better job of insulating the rhetoric with polished invective. Moore's films are a guilty pleasure for the swine who enjoy them. Even a simpleton sees that Moore specializes in taking cheap shots but rarely creates anything of substance. Unlike the talented Errol Morris, Moore has his mind made up before he shoots a frame of film. "Now", he thinks, "If I can only make up other people's minds for them." "Bowling for Columbine" is no different. It's another worthless mockumentary in which Moore gets to make fun of guns, gun-owners, and the military while exploiting the deaths of so many young children at Columbine High School. Why is it exploitive? Because he is using a terrible tragedy perpetrated by sick, disturbed children to try and portray legal gun ownership as insane. Sorry, little buddy, but the Constitution of this great country is quite clear. Hey, China has gun-control! Why not move there Mike? While you are there try and make an unflattering documentary about their industry or human rights practices? Now THAT would be a short lived project. All the while, Mr. Moore sleep safely under the very veil of freedom you criticize. Because right now there is an armed force of patriotic men and women protecting your fat movie-making rear.</fullReview>

The picture that is shown of the dog that was supposed to have been carrying a gun on it's back and accidentally shot someone was set up by Moore, the story is in fact true but the photo given is a fake. When Moore is interviewing someone in a black van who is trying to get away from him because they have to go somewhere, Moore sets it up so it looks like the man has no time for him. Also when he randomly turns up to speak to Charlton Heston about Kayla Rowland, Moore tries to make it look like Heston doesn't care that the little girl was shot but if Moore turned up at your house without much warning and asked you loads of annoying questions you weren't prepared for I would have walked away, wouldn't you??I think it's pretty clear that I didn't think much of the documentary, I mean the guys from America and yet he spends all his time slagging off the country!!!I rest my case! Watch the film, you will see I am right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore bad documentaries coming soon!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an effort to see the other side of the gun control argument....I watched this last night. It is another shi**y movie done by Michael Moore. I feel dumber for watching it. Good thing it came for free with a new release rental or else I'd be extremely belligerent right now. How do people believe in his convoluted thinking? Roger and Me argument:GM owes Flint because that is where GM started, so GM shouldn't layoff people in Flint or shut down factories because they owe the city of Flint something. Who the hell believes that?Bowling has the same thinking:Missiles are built in Littleton, so that reinforces the use of guns for violence in children. The President bombed Sudan on the same day that Columbine happened further strengthening the commitment to teach our children of gun violence. There are lunatics out there with guns, so we are all going to die bloody deaths due to gun violence.In order to believe Moore's stance that A is correlated to B, you have to start at A then he takes you to Z, then back to F, up to R, over to U, and then (if you are still with him) you arrive at B and all the world's problems are solved and he's the genius we have to thank for it. Now I looked up some information and according to this CREDIBLE (read: non-Michael Moore style) source:Source: Mokdad, Ali H., PhD, James S. Marks, MD, MPH, Donna F. Stroup, PhD, MSc, Julie L. Gerberding, MD, MPH, "Actual Causes of Death in the United States, 2000," Journal of the American Medical Association, March 10, 2004, Vol. 291, No. 10, pp. 1238, 1241. 29,000 people die from gun-related (not all involving violence) deaths each year in the US. These are the causes of death in the U.S. in 2000 US population (282,000,000 population and 2,400,000 deaths) ranked of course in descending order:435,000 Tobacco related deaths (.00015% of population and 18.1% of all deaths) 400,000 Poor diet, physical activity (.00014% of population and 16.6% of all deaths) 85,000 Alcohol consumption (.00003% of population and 3.5% of all deaths) 75,000 Microbial agents (.000026% of population and 3% of all deaths) 55,000 Toxic agents (.00002% of population and 2% of all deaths) 43,000 Motor vehicle crashes (.000015 of population and 1.7% of all deaths)and drum roll......FINALLY.....coming in 7th place....the horse with the huge following for and against it... The bane of Micheal Moore and friends....accounting for an astounding .000004 percent of the US population per year....and an OUTRAGEOUS 1.2% of all deaths....here are all 29,000 gun related deaths!(crowd goes wild)Now the interesting thing that I noticed from Roger &amp; Me (1999) to Bowling for Columbine (2002) is that Michael Moore looks like he stopped (THICK LAYER OF SARCASM) working out. In Bowling, it looks like he ate his way to 3 bills, and if he isn't quite there, he is only a biscuit short of it. Now it is interesting to me he'll take on guns (#7) on the list, but his fat, lazy a** isn't screaming and running (don't know if he knows the meaning of the word) around the country trying to right the wrongs of Poor diet, physical activity (#2 on your list, but #1 in your heart - literally). According to Bowling, there are 11,000 deaths due to gun violence, so take out the accidents and the suicides, and look what we get, less than 40% of all gun related deaths are even due to gun violence. Is it possible that people buy into the anti-gun bulls**t just because it is playing off of people's (obviously statistically) irrational fear of being shot and killed? The funny thing is, I don't even own a gun. I don't really care, guns aren't a part of my everyday life. The issue that bothers me is the activism for something that is so irrelevant and the attention that guns get FOR LITTLE TO NO APPARENT REASON. Is a gun death more tragic than some kid whose parents don't teach him to eat right and exercise so his fat a** doesn't run a lap and kill over on the playground? I think the fat kid scenario is more tragic because it is to use a gun analogy...shooting a bullet at the kid, but the bullet has no velocity, but it enters the kid's body little by little, inflicting pain the whole time, it moves millimeters per year, finally hitting the vital organ at X number of years and ending the fat kid's life. At least a real gun puts him out of his misery right away (but then he misses dessert - damn there is no good answer here).Next review upcoming...I think I'm going to give Fahrenhype 9/11 a chance (see what those loony right wingers have to say).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I have never seen such an insipid display of self-promoting self-righteousness as this movie. Moore has arrogated himself into a position as commentator on society, yet he displays over and over that he knows next to nothing about the subjects he tackles. If I didn't find Moore so loathesome, I would have felt embarrassed for him as he desperately tried to connect the Columbine murderers to the Lockheed plant, asking a bemused plant employee if he thought the "weapons of death" manufactured there somehow contributed to the "atmosphere" that led Dylan and Kleibold to perpetrate their crime. Even worse was when he tried to blame an tragic shooting by a first grader in Flint, Michigan on Dick Clark! I forget, was this supposed to be a documentary or a comedy? Frankly, I find the man, his style of filmaking and his attitude boorish and tiresome. Don't waste your money on this fetid pile of steaming waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has no substance. Moore takes a tragic event and makes a bunch of indictments about the armed forces, capitalism, post-World War II U.S. foreign policy and welfare reform -- everything the Left loves to hate about America. His style is as bad as the media sensationalism he's attacking. The one interesting point in the movie is where he mentions that it's almost as easy to get a gun in Canada as it is in the US, yet the homicide rate in Canada is nothing compared to that in the US. He could have made that the main focus of his movie. (Independent verification of the Canadian gun laws and homicide rate would have been necessary though.)But I guess that would have meant no other swings at the rest of American society, and probably fewer ambush journalism moments. It would have been more like a PBS documentary, and less of a movie about Moore's own ideology.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fear more than guns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Left wing filmmaker Michael Moore examines the issue of guns in America. The title refers to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold responsible for the Columbine High School massacre were supposed to be bowling for their class earlier that morning. Moore sarcastically wonders if bowling caused the massacre. He takes a wide-ranging look at guns and the overall culture in America. He talks to various people. The most compelling is James Nichols, brother of Terry Nichols who was convicted of the Oklahoma City bombing. The man has crazy eyes. There is a glee in his demeanor about guns. Marilyn Manson has a couple of intriguing responses. Matt Stone comes from Littleton which is next to Columbine High School. There is a cartoon in a South Park style that gives some simplified views of fear in America. Moore concentrates more on this idea that Americans live in fear. He contrasts America with the world by going to Canada and their unlocked doors. This is not a traditional documentary. One can easily pull it apart by pointing out any number inaccuracies and loose facts. Moore is painting a picture and a feeling. The best idea is to pull everything back to fear in America and get out of the actual guns as the issue. Sometimes, he overreaches by going general politics. Also, not everybody in Canada keeps their door unlock. This is a little scattered but Moore eventually puts everything into focus.</fullReview>

Maybe, if you count Native population as well as Asian and Latin American population.The facts: Preston, in the Halifax area, is the community with the highest percentage of blacks, with 69.4%; it was a settlement where the Crown provided land to Black Loyalists after the American Revolution. And... Halifax had the highest rate of gun-related violent crime of all major Canadian cities in 2012, according to Statistics Canada. According to the 2011 Census, a total of 945,665 Black Canadians were counted, comprising only 2.9% of Canada's population, and this figure includes Black Canadians of mixed race.What do you say to that ?Michael Moore?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine, the comedic depiction of the gun issues that America must tackle, is a moving story about several topics that relate to gun rights, such as the Columbine Massacre in 1999. This film puts the bigger picture of gun rights and most of the political issues that our government must tackle such as weapons of mass destruction. The stats of gun incidents and gun related deaths in America help solidify the issue, as well as the act where Moore, the main actor, producer and director, take a few Columbine survivors, Mark Taylor and Richard Castaldo, to "refund" the bullets that were still in their bodies at the local K-Mart. These shocking parts really help the film display the fact that America has a domestic issue with guns and gun rights. I really enjoyed the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a very impressive movie. It is good point that this movie focused on American gun society. Gun in America become very important problem now, but considering in the fact that when this movie was made is 2002, Moor's point of view is very appreciated. In addition, this movie searches about the problem of gun deeper and explains the problem comprehensibly. (ex. The history of America) The latter is very important for foreigners to watch such documentaries as this. At the latter of this movie, they succeeded something big. It was very important change in America and this succession is the result of this movie. It was awesome. (Of course, those who support gun society didn't think so.) But one point that I was disappointed is this movie is too long. I think this movie can be made in less time. Longer the movie is, more boring we are because density of movie become less. This point is unique to documentary movie. Particularly for me, who watch many movies and American dramas, documentaries are boring as a whole. For the documentary, whose theme is belonging to the real world, it can't be helped. But this documentary is more interesting than other documentaries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Thorough And Sometimes Fascinating Documentary About Guns.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore leaves no stone unturned in "Bowling for Columbine". From that title alone you'd imagine that the entire 2 hours only focused upon the tragic events of the Columbine high school massacre, but Moore provides insight on just how easily it is to gain a weapon (Via. a free gift for opening a bank account), and purchase ammo from a barber shop. There is also a little evidence showing the staggering number of gun related tragedies in various countries, and the overall sad history of violence arms have left in its path.Being a British male, we barely see guns in my country. Sure I've seen a few gun shops around, but there are many certificates and licenses you need to go through in order to own one. Then again their presence in every form of media is undeniable, and "Bowling for Columbine" is a definite wake up call for people in and outside the U.S. Whereas I knew about the segment "A Brief History of the United States of America", I never really knew that much about the disastrous American foreign policy decisions and the following results (Sometimes ignorance is bliss I guess).The only things that always seemed out of place to me is the Matt Stone and Marilyn Manson interviews. They hold some relevance to the subject and the statements are sound, but I feel that they could have been left out and still the movie would succeed. Other than that, it's a very well made documentary that I recommend you see. Final Verdict: Extremely informative and sometimes unintentionally comedic. Michael Moore's directions and efforts are to be commended. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How much for just the bazooka?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We like nonfiction, but we live in fiction." - Moore Michael Moore's "Bowling for Columbine" attempts to delve into the United States of America's infatuation with guns, war and murder. At its best, this is a funny, irreverent documentary, which nicely details the relationships between big business, media, major weapons contractors and small, personal arms. At its worst, this is a reductive film which too forcefully tries to shepherd its audience toward a singular conclusion.Still, as mainstream American documentaries go, "Columbine" is strong. Moore cites Kubrick's "Strangelove" and "Clockwork" as an influence on his aesthetic, and his film carefully mixes humour, shocks and pathos. One scene finds him getting Lockheed Martin, the largest weapons contractor in the world, to admit that "what happened during the Columbine high school shootings is just a microcosm of what's happening in the world", whilst others see him fusing popular culture and agitprop. The film's superficiality has been condemned (pacifism didn't get the British Empire out of India, Moore!), but it's also this facet which allows Moore to smuggle his message into the skulls of the post-MTV generation. "Columbine's" climax, in which Moore manipulates NRA spokesman Charlton Heston, has also been criticised, but moments earlier similar stunt tactics led to Moore getting handgun ammunition pulled from Walmart shelves. Temporarily.8/10 ? See 2003's "The Yes Men."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable romp but when the end justifies the means, one shouldn't call it a documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had just written a review for a documentary by Werner Herzog, where I stated that, although Herzog will at times "spice" scenes up a little to fit his vision, he generally doesn't push points, opinions or believes on his viewers. After all, that's what documentaries should do: Show what is and not what you think or believe there is. Then I thought of the complete opposite to Herzogs style and the first thing that came to mind was Michael Moore and his "Bowling for Columbine".Don't get me wrong: I did enjoy the documentary, it was very entertaining and (for a non-American) at times even educational to watch. It gives the outsider a deeper look into the American psyche, but I think, if I was an American ? hence having to choose whether I'm "pro" or "contra", which the film virtually forces the viewer ? I would have enjoyed it much less. For one, I don't like to be manipulated. If a documentary like this one tries so very hard to get a point or opinion across, that it no longer shies away from bending facts or manipulating through style, it ceases to be a documentary and becomes propaganda (or, in the slightly milder form, a mondo-documentary like "Mondo Carne").I also get a little nervous when the rhetoric is so geared and pointed, despite often being very entertaining. That may well have to do with my background: I'm German and we had some bad experiences with rhetoric some 80 years ago. However, more than 10 years after it's release, "Bowling for Columbine" seems to have sparked a whole wave of this form of documentaries (for the lack of a better term), being used by both sides. To mind come films like "Supersize Me" (where a vegetarian tries to convince the viewer that eating at McDonalds every day is unhealthy) or "Expelled ? No Intelligence Allowed" (where a religious fanatic try to convince the viewers that school-kids should be taught science according to his holy book), etc. Not a good sign when how you say something becomes more convincing than what you say.An American friend of mine, who seems to be slightly more neutral on political subjects, once pointed out that the so-called "Left" a la Michael Moore and the "Right" like Rush Limbaugh are just two sides of the same coin. If that is true, I would suggest a new currency.So, how to grade such a film? As a "real" documentary I'd give it 2/10, as an entertaining piece of polemic 7/10 and to stay on the neutral side 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unconvincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this documentary, Michael Moore attempts to explain the reason that America has the gun violence it does. In the process he examines a number of claims but fails, unfortunately, to come up with any meaningful answers. For example, he visits Columbine High School outside of Denver which, as everyone probably knows, had the terrible school shooting back in 1999. He points to a nearby factory owned by Lockheed-Martin and speculates that there is a connection between the making of military ordinance and the school shootings. To me that argument just wasn't compelling because I don't believe that Dylan Klebold or Eric Harris killed 12 students in cold blood because of a nearby plant that produces missiles. He then gives statistics of other industrialized societies and compares their gun violence records against that of America. He goes on to suggest that since Canada has almost as many guns (per person) as America that the prevalence of guns is not the reason for our fatality rates. Again, I found the comparison unconvincing for several reasons, primarily because not only is Canada more rural than the U.S., but it also has social programs in place which take better care of its citizens. In other words, the comparison is one of apples to oranges. He then examines the factor of "white fear" and implies that some of this gun violence is due to racism against blacks. To a certain extent he may be correct. George Zimmerman probably fits this diagnoses quite well. However, it should be remembered that it isn't the whites who are committing a huge proportion of the violent crime. And saying this isn't racist?it's factual. The bottom line is that the U.S. is inundated with over 250 million guns and it is relatively easy to obtain one at any given day?with thousands upon thousands more being pumped out by the gun manufacturers every month. Throw in things like poverty, fear and illegal drugs into this volatile mix and the results are plain to see as they are splashed across our newspapers and television screens every day. In short, although Michael Moore asked a lot of questions in this film, I wasn't quite convinced that he had the right answers. I rate it as average.</fullReview>

With that said, he disgraced the film at the Academy Awards with his hateful speech aimed at President Bush over a completely different topic.I agree, gun violence is a problem in this country, but taking guns from those that uphold the law and own them, why punish them? However, when interviewing former NRA president Charlton Heston, Mr. Moore came off as oafish and unsentimental to gun owners and their rights, going as far to accuse the NRA of gun related atrocities.In the future, Michael Moore may want to look back at his work on documentaries and remember what worked, helping the little man, like he did in Flint, Michigan in "Roger and Me".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary is highly over rated. While it does raise interesting questions as to why Americans murder each other at such a high rate, it offers few if any answers. Anyone can take a camera around the country and stick it in people's faces and ask questions which are hard to answer and in the process make themselves appear smart. Instead of focusing two hours solely on the problem, why not spend some time with the audience suggesting and investigating ways they can help the problem. While the intentions of the film are of the highest standard, its only useful purpuse is to make the viewer feel helpless with regards to the situation it devels into.P.S. - It was miraculous and great that he was able to persuade K-Mart to stop selling handgun ammunition. That type of ammunition does not need to be sold at every major intersection of the country; gun and sporting goods stores should suffice.</fullReview>

Doors always locked, sensationalist media, fear of black people, etc. He[moore] seems really inclined toward class warfare. He suggests "white collar COPS", involving the strip search of embezzlers. He also tries to blame the military-industrial complex(Lockheed-Martin) and Dick Clark for urban poverty. What then follows is an examination of the Canadian welfare state. He contrives a connection between the KKK and the NRA as the NRA was founded in 1871, the same year he claims the KKK was outlawed. The KKK didn't have its heyday until the 1920s, and unless I am mistaken, exists today. This attempt to label gun owners as racist is thinly concealed.He also seems to ignore fairly obvious facts, Case in point: He marvels at how he can buy as much ammo as he(a non-canadian!) wants in Canada, yet there isn't the same level of gun violence as in the US. What he fails to recall, however, is that he had earlier bought all the ammo at Kmart. He seems to imply that there are(or should be) legal limits to ammunition sales in America. He also fails to mention the history of gun control in america. An examination of the 1968 Federal Firearms Act, enacted to disarm the increasingly agitated black community, would have fit handsomely with his premise that whites fear blacks. The interview with Charlton Heston, honestly... He said gun crime was caused by mixed ethnicity. Whether it means he's racist or just a senile old man, Moore took it as an opportunity to badger him. Chasing him as he tried to walk away, leaving the picture, what documentary purpose could that serve?</fullReview>

As a zillion people have stated before, Moore does an excellent job of combining startling facts with humor to present some rather grisly realities without alienating the audience. However, I really think the ending almost ruins the film. The meeting he has with Charleton Heston just succeeded in making Moore look like a jerk and Heston look like a pitiful old guy with Alzheimer's. It seemed as if the whole purpose of the end of the movie (especially leaving the picture of Kayla on Heston's property, which I'm sure he never even saw) was to further Moore's status as martyr rather than conclude the movie in any logical way. The shot of Moore walking away from the gate looking contemplative and angry was a little much. In spite of this, the movie is a good reminder that we mustn't let impending war blind us to our domestic problems and I do recommend it.</fullReview>

That is, use violence to "prevent" violence at every level: - personal with handguns in self defence - local with so many prison/death sentence punishments - global with war and bombardment of "ennemy" nations -. This is a method that probably has a lot of results is some cases but generates unhappiness (don't the privileged few wield the law?) and insecurity (when will YOU be the target of the system?).On the other hand, I feel that the film does go into sensationalism (gosh, why do people applaud at the end of such a sad and complex movie) and will provoke lots of violent reaction because I felt that it immediatly took side with pacifists (and the naives?). You also go out of the film with the lingering feeling that the editing was partial and did a lot to select the scenes shown.Overall I do want to side with Michel Moore's more pacifist perspective, but it would look like such trivial European anti-Americanism that I dare not!Please go see this movie and make your own opinion...</fullReview>

It was refreshing to see a film that didn't just throw out a bunch of tired platitudes but instead backed up its message with poignant interviews and absurd but factual situations (such as the free gun with new bank account at the beginning of the film). Some of the messages the film delivers are more astonishing due to their sources. Marilyn Manson and Matt Stone come off as probably the two most thoughtful and insightful interviewees, whereas spokespeople for Lockheed Martin and K-Mart look like fools. The film punctuates its message with moments of humor that elevate the mood after some of the darker moments. About the only problem I had with the film was the sensationalization of the number of gun deaths in the US vs other countries. They should have been adjusted to a per-capita number for a truer comparison and still would have demonstrated the stark difference. But this is a relatively minor flaw in an otherwise superb film. This is a film every American should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie Everyone In America Should Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Bowling for Columbine today and I was just - pardon the pun - blown away. This is a movie that everyone in America should see and must see. I will see this movie again and get the dvd when it comes out, just so I can loan it to others. (I went to a video store the other day, and they for whatever reason do not carry Roger and Me). This movie unlike a lot of movies today, really makes one think. This movie really hit home since I live in Michigan as well. Great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you really hold my attention for 2 hours on documentary material. I'd have thought not, but Michael Moore succeeds in doing just that. I found it both funny and scary, while my other half, Jane, just found it scary. Both of us were captivated by the film and had lots to discuss afterwards. For me, the most interesting new material was the comparison between Canadian and US culture - I had no idea that Canadians have so many guns nor did I realise how laid back they tend to be compared with US Americans. I shall do a little of my own research to verify this aspect. Michael Moore of course takes positions and milks them somewhat, yet he is modest and self-effacing enough to own up to what he is doing and argue his points with great poise.I don't think that spoilers can apply to documentaries, but the next paragraph does describe some of the outcomes that develop in the film.Lasting memories of this film: the fact that Marilyn Manson was so eloquent and sensible, whereas Charlton Heston simply couldn't handle even the simplest questions as soon as he was being interviewed by Moore and therefore "off script". Also, the scene where the K-MART press relations person goes before the cameras and publicly caves in to Moore and the Columbine kids' request was truly moving. I believe that Moore really was pleasantly surprised by that action and he looked so genuinely pleased that he and the kids had got an unexpectedly good result.Moore works for me even better on film than he does on the page. This is superbly done and well worth the two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore deftly exposes the reality of America(amidst all of our self- deception and supposed freedom-fighting). I just don't understand why so many people are criticizing Moore for leaving out some of the more mundane details.He's trying to make a point, people.The most elegant way to make a point is to derive a general, holistic meaning out of details to back up a thesis. Moore, with all his political acumen, does well to arrive at a thesis more telling about American society than any I havewitnessed. And Moore's conclusion here is spot-on correct: Americans havebuilt and continue to build a nation on fear.  Granted, he does fail to mention that Charlton Heston is suffering fromAlzheimer's Disease, and that the man once marched with Dr. Martin LutherKing Jr, and he does rather rashly leave a picture of a dead Columbine victim on a post at Heston's residence. He also fails to mention the drug war as amajor transducer of interpersonal aggression and hatred into murder. Butthrough all this he manages to make an extraordinary point about America'ssordid past and confused present.Sometimes (forgivably) unfair, frequently hilarious, and always deeply moving, this documentary is both a piece of art and an incisive social commentary. 10/ 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bowling for Columbine" is the best documentary of the year (I wouldn't say by far, I thought the Kid Stays in the Picture was great). It tells the story of how guns are used in America and how people have crisis with themselves/family.

		<shortDescription>Funny and incisive, but a bit muddled (***)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's latest documentary is a powerful, thought-provoking, and frequently very funny examination of gun violence in America. Among the questions raised: why, in countries like Canada, where there are just as many people with guns, are there only a few gun murders every year, and America has upwards of 11,000? Moore is quick to disprove foolish people who would say things like "violence in movies" or "Marilyn Manson", because people everywhere (including Canada) watch loads of violent movies and listen to lots of angry music. So what is it?Moore knows that a definitive answer can't be found to this question, but he takes a look at it from several different angles that are usually very involving.And even though it is very funny a lot of the time, there are scenes that will take your breath away. Columbine is, of course, a frequent point of conversation, and at one point we see actual surveillance camera footage of the massacre. Though nothing graphic is shown, the effect of the footage (mostly of students hiding under tables and running for cover while Harris and Klebold wander from room to room shooting) is so startling and immediate that I didn't even notice tears had welled up in my eyes until they were already there.There is another quick montage of suicides and murders caught on film that, again, even though the camera cuts away before any blood is actually seen, the effect on the audience is like a punch in the stomach. If anything really brings home the ugliness of gun violence, that is it.The movie is very powerful, but there are a few problems. Moore attempts to cover the story from too many angles and in the end, has talked about so many different societal ills that it's hard to see how they all tie together, even if they do. As a result it's too long (no matter how interesting the subject matter, 2 hours is usually pushing it for a documentary) and the point he's trying to make seems diluted by the end. I give the movie 3 stars because of these slight flaws and for its overall enjoyment level, but it's an extremely important movie that I urge you to go see. Though you may not always agree with what Moore is saying or doing, he deserves praise for at least caring enough to make people think about important topics, and doing it in an entertaining and enlightening way.It's the kind of movie you should go see with friends and go out to dinner for conversation afterwards. I should know, because I went alone, and I was dying to join in one of the many passionate conversations going on in the lobby when it was over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore shoots a Strike with "Bowling for Columbine"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I walked into Bowling for Columbine with my grade 12 English Writing class it was with mixed expectations. On one hand missing a day's worth of classes with a legitimate reason is always fun, but on the other hand I would be in store for nearly two hours of what could very possibly be an extremely boring film. Having heard almost nothing about it, I didn't know what to expect, but as the lights began to dim and the hushed whispers of the almost 60 teenagers cramped into the theater gradually died down, I sat back and let myself get swept away by what I think is arguably one of the truest, most thought provoking films ever.Bowling for Columbine is an eye opening experience, a film that shows you the true nature of the United States giving us a real look at American politics and not just the sugar coated CNN version of them. Michael Moore takes us on journey through the seedy underworld, the dark bowels of the country, where all its shameful acts remain hidden from international scrutiny. As a Canadian who's always harboured something of an Anti-American sentiment I found this film refreshingly rewarding. Moore not only sheds light on America's less than reputable dark secrets but also goes out in the open and talks with Americans about their personal philosophies, namely their ridiculous obsession with guns. Moore has impeccable screen presence, as he chats with the Americans in such a deliciously patronizing manner that the unsuspecting rednecks are made fools of without even knowing. The film drips with satire with brief interludes of Chris Rock's hilarious stand up comedy pertaining to gun control to a hilarious cartoon entitled "A Brief History of the United States of America" that runs through the series of events that made America such a great nation, from the massacre of the Native Indians, the random burnings of the Salem Witch trials, the exploitation of blacks for slavery, to the "coincidental" simultaneous formation of the KKK and NRA, followed by the Rosa Parks inspired black uprising, all the way to the gentrification of today's white suburbs.It's not all fun and games though, while most of it will have you chuckling to yourself Bowling for Columbine is a serious film that does in fact deal with the titular school. Using the tapes from Columbine High's security camera's Michael Moore shows us the horrible footage of the Columbine High massacre. The haunting ambient music playing in time with the slow motion footage of students being shot at and blown up leaves the audience in a state of open mouthed shock and left at least one member my class in tears. And that's really the goal of the film, Michael Moore assaults us with shocking images of violent acts not to terrify us, nor to entertain the sadistic, but rather to educate us all about the increasing danger of "firearm-mania".Bowling for Columbine made me laugh, it made me think, but above all things it made me incredibly proud to be Canadian. Seeing Moore dumbfounded and utterly amazed at the Canadian way of life: the healthcare, the violence free cities , the general friendliness and peaceability of the people, made me glad I live in "The True North Strong And Free" and feel sorry for those who didn't. I may have walked in unsure about the movie, but I left the theater knowing one thing for certain. Bowling for Columbine is brilliant. It's true, honest film making at it's best, and there's simply no way anyone in their right minds can disagree.5 1/2 stars out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I touch on some details from the film over which Michael Moore is getting flack, I'd like to happily declare that this is the best and most satisfying $8.50 CAN I spent on a movie in a long long time. "Bowling for Columbine" is so insightful, so honest, so spirited and above all - right on target that it hurts. There isn't a movie, TV broadcast (Nightline, Frontline, 60 Minutes...), or a newspaper investigative report out there that better summarizes the issues around the problem of gun violence in America today.Now, I noticed that some reviewers take Moore to task over his tactics in interviews with Dick Clark and Charlton Heston. I most definitely didn't have a problem with either one. In the first instance, Moore didn't accuse Clark of anything, as somebody wrongly pointed out here. Issue centered around a single black woman whose 9-year-old son found a gun in his uncle's house (kid was living there because his mother and him were evicted as she couldn't pay the rent), took it to school and killed a classmate. Before the killing, kid barely had a chance to spend time with his mom who was in a work-for-welfare program. Moore simply wanted to get Clark's opinion on this woman's situation and the fact that she as a single mother was assigned by the State of Michigan to work in one of Clark's theme restaurants 60 miles away from her home in order to earn her welfare money. Time spent in the restaurant with commuting back and fourth effectively took her away from her child as she literally worked from dawn 'till dusk while the money earned ended up not even being enough to pay the rent. That however, didn't stop Clark's restaurant from applying for a tax exemption on the grounds that it employs welfare cases. THESE ARE ALL FACTS AND MOORE MERELY STATED THEM. He then, successfully I might add, argued that this state program of busing poor people miles away from where they live and forcing them into odd jobs to get basic welfare is wrong, especially if they're single mothers with small children to raise at home. Moore talked to state officials and the mayor of Flint who agreed that this program is useless. Being a well known celebrity with indirect ties to the case, Clark's opinion on the whole issue was sought by the filmmaker. However, Mr. American Bandstand wouldn't give him the time of day. It is Clark's own fault for coming off as an arrogant ass because he most definitely acted like one. Nobody came at him with a spear! All he had to do is give a civilized comment and state his opinion, and he couldn't even manage that.With Heston Moore was a bit rough. But when you take into account the kinds of things that the NRA president is advocating and condoning, little squirming over his own record is the least he can take.Some have even gone as far as accusing Moore and his movie of being anti-American and point to a sequence which details various American military interventions around the world after WW2 until present day, showing the civilian death toll in millions and misery they've produced. AGAIN, THESE ARE ALL WELL KNOWN FACTS, and Moore played them to a great effect to contradict the PR person from Littleton's Lockheed (producers of nuclear arms, cruise missiles and other weapons of mass destruction, largest supplier of American gov't) who suggested that they (Lockheed and American government) "use their weapons responsibly" and that the Littleton kids who shot up the Columbine High School couldn't have possibly learned their violent ways from them. Lockheed, btw, has its headquarters and largest plant in Littleton and since it is the largest employer in the area has family members of many of the kids from Columbine HS working for them.Like "Roger &amp; Me" before it, "Bowling..." is another masterpiece and essential viewing for everyone living in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was it me or did Moore seemed disappointed by the K-Mart victory?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the fact that this reviewer is a typical Jewish, bleeding heart, liberal democrat in New York, who is avidly pro-gun control, I found myself irritated by Moore in what was perhaps the most meaningful scene of the film. Is not the entire point of a documentary to instill emotions that will in turn inititate political participation and in turn change? A teenager (whose name escapes me) sustained tragic injury at Columbine and accompanied Moore to Kmart headquarters in Troy Michigan only to secure exactly what they journeyed there for, the removal of all ammunition EXCEPT hunting bullets from there stores. I'm sorry, but it seemed like Moore was more comfortable being snubbed by Dick Clarke, or by the namesake of Roger and Me. Why does he not make more of this victory and the hope that this brings for our future. After all, as the film states, "being a teenager sucks." And yet this eighteen-year-old, picks up where Moore leaves off and inititates ACTION that ultimately leads to the mutual victory for Moore, Columbine survivors, K Mart and indeed all of us! Perhaps this should have been the final scene of the film. Instead Moore seems more at home down the road in Flint and on to the next gun tragedy. This was a great film. I give it a 9 1/2 out of 10. Instead of leading us by the nose, he leaves the conclusion to the viewer to conclude why we are "gun nuts," or "just nuts." Great Job, despite this one question that plagues me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shades of '1984': Using comedy, Michael Moore sticks it to the wooden near-dead white men and their 'Uncle Toms/Aunt Thomasinas' who rule us through fear. Using Charlton Heston as the epitome of stupidity and cupidity....the paradoxical figure in our minds of Moses, the NRA and now Alzheimer's Disease, he raises the question, "When did Reagan and Heston first show the ravages of this brain-destroying disease? How much power did they wield over the gullible sheeple of America during this time?" Then of course, we come to understand the link between Lockheed and the doings at Columbine. Eric Harris' daddy was flying fighter jets in the Gulf War. Notice how many of our terrorists...local and foreign ...got their start in the first Gulf War? Bin Ladem, Eric Harris, Timothy-the Oklahoma bomber? And then the Lockheed shill, with a straight face, too ignorant to understand the horrible connection, announces their $15,000 grant to Columbine to train the kids there to 'handle their anger'. This is the company who brings you impersonal death onto thousands of innocents, instead of 12. And they give to train the children....how? To 'handle their anger'!!! How about the senseless anger, calm duplicity of the Bush administration which cynically goes about maneuvering us into perpetual war for perpetual 'peace', instigating more 9/11s as they hypocritically diddle the heart-strings of patriotism. And the TV-mind-vacuumed populace of my country follows right along. See this movie if you're ready to get a chill along with your laughter. The conduct of Dick Clark (who owns the company where the welfare mother of the 6 year old gun-wielding killer works for nothing wages) is really hilarious, and will forever be etched in my brain as I watch his coffin-ready face on New Year's Eve. He tries to shut himself out from the reality of in-your-face Moore ("Stupid White Men" author) which just serves to display his inhumanity. Grasping at straws, I figure that the rude exits of both Clark and Heston are there to show they still have a conscience.... they know they do wrong. Heston takes his NRA show to both Columbine and the town where the 6 year old kills the little girl ---right after both sets of mindless carnage by children against children, facilitated by easy access to guns.The question is still unanswered, "Why did we have over 17,000 deaths by gun last year in this country, when other countries with equally easy access to guns have something like 1700?" Heston says it's our 'multi-ethnicity'...he's not racist atall. What do you think?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unique film about gun violence in America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`We need to do something about gun violence in America!'?A phrase that seems to be uttered by every politician, and many citizen groups more and more in recent years. Why is it that our citizens posses the same number of guns as citizens in other countries like Canada, but we have a much higher murder rate? How does over 11,000 gun related deaths a year in the United States sound compared to less that 100 a year in Canada? The film Bowling for Columbine is a documentary directed by and starring film maker Michael Moore. The film takes a humorous and very ironic look at gun violence in the United States. It centers on the Columbine high school shooting in Littleton, Colorado and on militia activity in the mid-west. Although the film focuses on these events, it also takes us through a history lesson of the Unites States. Why are we such a violent culture? Why do we worry so much about violence? What role does the media play? Moore has theories related to all of these questions. I enjoyed this film in part because of his theories, but also because I left the theater with more questions about why we Americans do what we do than I did answers.  I highly recommend this film, not just for the commentary on the gun violence in our country, but also for the glimpse into the reasons behind it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I can't remember seeing a film before this one and thinking I've got to have it as soon as it comes out. The film is desperately tragic in some places, hysterically funny in others and a must-see for everyone over the age of 13. Michael Moore is certainly opinionated, and Bowling for Columbine expresses those opinions strongly and clearly. Gun violence is reprehensible and the United States suffers grievously from it. The film explores the question of why it's so much worse here than other places. Moore raises the question: if easy access to guns was the only cause, wouldn't Canada have the same problem? No answer seems readily apparent. I have an opinion of my own, though. It has a lot to do with fear, as Moore stresses. Fear of competition, fear of other people taking away what is ours. Fear that we're not going to get enough, that other people will take what we need. The cause is a combination of overpopulation and the lack of a support structure for the economically disadvantaged.See this film and form your own opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Michael Moore's previous films, I was prepared for some liberal anti-gun dogma. But this picture exceeded my expectations in so many ways, and opened up into exploring the roots of America's culture of violence and rage - it is guns themselves? Racism? The fearmongering mass media? Libertarianism? "South Park"? Aside from cheap-shot ambush interviews with Dick Clark and Charton Heston (well, maybe Heston was asking for it as NRA President.) Moore does not get an answer but ties together these themes in unpredictable ways, with anger, humor, pathos, and irony. It's a film about much more than guns.I only have one question - Why did the MPAA give this film an R rating? I would not hesitate to show it to a high schoool class.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...the most stunning film of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By far one of the most thought provoking movies since, well, Michael Moore's last film The Big One, this powerful documentary is the most stunning film of the year. Moore returns in his imperfect and fiery guerilla form to tackle what exactly is wrong with this country when it comes to the American people and guns. While these questions have been raised before, no one does it with as much cojones as Moore does. While not all of the answers are given, that's part of the point. This is the type of film that could go on for hours, but leaves enough discussion points to let the viewers answer the questions. It's the asking that is Moore's specialty. Some of the answers do come courtesy of celebrity interviewees Charlton Heston, Marilyn Manson, and Matt Stone (South Park), but the most revealing come from the camera-shy corporate execs and fumbling PR reps that are often the director's favorite targets. His view may be one-sided at times, but he presents it in such a humorous and loveable way that it's hard not to side with him. And why wouldn't you? He's successfully made his targets look like complete idiots. Movies, music, racism, news media, parents, isolation, culture, and poverty are all probed but in the end there seems to not be one single guilty party. Over 11,000 people are killed in this country by guns per year and the only 165 in England. Canada has 10 million people and 7 million guns. So why do they have less violent deaths than we do? The fact that you may even be thinking about it while reading this makes the film successful. One of the funniest moments of the film comes in the form of an animated South Park-like condensed version of American history to date. While far from politically correct, its biting, yet fair criticism of our forefathers before us show us that it is indeed our violent history and legacy of fear that makes our problems unsurprising to our neighboring countries. Most of the film handles the tough subject with a humorous tone, but the most effective moments come courtesy of the interviews with previously unknown, everyday people. This includes former Columbine students that had been shot in the tragic school massacre, the father of one of the Columbine victims, a teenage boy attempting to create napalm, and a teacher who watched one of her grade-school students shoot another one with a handgun. All give this film the extra depth that is sure to detract any cries that it is all propaganda or faceless finger pointing. While funny, sad, scary, intriguing, and poignant all at the same time, Michael Moore proves while he's not the best "director" in the world, he's definitely the best documentary filmmaker out there. This is the first documentary accepted into Cannes Film Festival in 46 years and it's easy to see why this piece of work could not be denied its well-deserved accolades. This is an important film that needs to be seen. Given Moore's previous success, one can only help that between his good name and word of mouth something this powerful makes its way into the conscience of the American public and beyond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indicted: The American Constitution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>However compelling a document this is, Moore's film needs to be taken with a good chaser alongside. One minute it blows you away with seemingly irrefutable evidence of America in a hand-basket heading to hell, the next, you know there is more to the story than that. But what really sticks in this Canadian is that the second amendment (did I get that right, the one about the right to bear arms?) needs to be re-thought, to be cleared up, way before any meaningful gun laws can be enacted or enforced. Michael Moore has the kind of courage needed, I think, to begin the work. It's the Constitution that needs to be called to account. Tommo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I got off the plane from DC last week, a Channel 4 TV news reporter came up to me, asking if I was coming from DC. I said yes. He then asked me if I was from Washington, and I said no, I was from Detroit, there for work. He followed up asking if I was relieved about the sniper, and I said, "no, I was just going about my own business, I don't think anyone was that worried", and he walked away from me. I asked his cameraman if he would do a story about the news media causing violence, he said "not likely", and also walked away.I called my friend Sharon the other day because I needed directions to a party... she didn't know them, but invited us to join her and Darby for a movie at the Main Art, Bowling for Columbine. He piped up in the background with the time etc, and we agreed to meet. I really didn't have any idea what it was about, although I've read Rivethead, which talks about Roger &amp; Me, I'd never seen any of Michael Moore's movies. I thought it might be about nuns, but that'd be "Bowling for Benedictine", another thing entirely.Bowling for Columbine is about some of the 11,000 americans that are killed with guns every year. It starts with bowling footage, accompanied by the great Camper Van Beethoven song, "Take the Skinheads Bowling", which Rennie had just introduced me to a few weeks ago, so we were singing along. The reason for the title is that the last thing the crazy teenagers at Columbine High School did before starting to kill their classmates was to go to their 7am bowling PE class. Moore goes into excruciating detail about the huge numbers that are killed here as compared to Canada, England, France, or even Germany, which he reminds us is not a nice place, considering the violence and genocide they perpetrated on the world in the 1940's. He doesn't provide us numbers per capita, just raw numbers, so it sounds worse than it is, but he's like any other politician, out to make a point, so he doesn't mention that our population is way bigger than any of the countries he compares us to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing documentary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first time in the history of the Cannes Film Festival, a special Jury Prize award was given for the first time for a documentary. Never before has a documentary been awarded at Cannes, yet the judges felt that the documentary that they saw was extraordinary and deserved to be recognized. The documentary is the latest documentary directed by Crusader Michael Moore titled BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. Either you love Michael Moore or you hate him, just like Radio Shock Jock Howard Stern, you either love him or hate him. A lot of people that I know feel that Michael Moore is too liberal and ignore anything he says or prints. Yet, everyone does agree that Moore does make excellent points in supporting his viewpoints and ideas. Moore has directed documentaries in the past that would go after General Motors, and successful corporations like Nike. In BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE Moore explores the National Riffle Association (NRA), NRA president Charlton Heston and the second Amendment in the Constitiution "the right to bare arms." The opening scene, which is quite funny has Moore apply for a bank account. After opening up an account at the bank, he receives a free gun! Moore brings up a excellent question asking the bank manager, "aren't you a little afraid to be handing out guns at a bank?" Then Moore is shown at a barber shop getting a haircut while the barbershop also sells bullets. Moore explains in BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE how April 20, 1999 began as a ordinary day. It wasn't until after eleven o' clock in Littleton Colorado that the world for schools and teenagers changed forever with the Columbine High School masscare. Moore has the cameras go down the halls of Columbine High School, showing the viewer that it is no different than any of the other thousands of American High Schools. Yet on the soundtrack, is the 911 emergency call audio tapes being played having the sounds of people crying and in panic over the tragic incident. Then some of the most horrorific scenes ever seen on film is shown as the actual video tape cameras in Columbine show the April 20th incident. The picture shows the cafeteria of studnets sitting around only to be shown hiding underneath the tables, then franticly running out of the school. Later showing the two students responsible for the shooting carrying guns and throwing explosives. While the 911 recording of one the shooter's fathers worried that his son might be involved with the shooting. BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. Some might seen it as liberal propaganda, but people need to look closer to what this film is really about. Moore shows that other countries around the world have just as many, if not more guns than the people of the U.S. Yet the U.S. has 11,000 gun related homicides a year comparing to 38 in Japan and the 67 in England. Moore asks the question why are there so many gun related murders in America. Moore then asks those questions to several people as well as the questions about the Oklahoma City Bombings and militia life to James Nichols (brother of convicted terrorist Terry Nichols). I loved the answer James Nichols gives after Michael Moore states: "the Constitution states the right to 'bare arms' nuclear missiles are arms also, should citizens have those as well? "No, there are crazy people out there!" Nichols replies. Moore also talks about the Columbine Shooting incident to SOUTH PARK co-creator and former Columbine High student Matt Stone. The influence of Heavy Metal music related to the Columbine shooting to Marilyn Manson (who gives perhaps the best and most intelligent answers in the entire film). And asks Charlton Heston himself on why does he always appear in town for a NRA meeting after a tragic incident. Heston appeared in Columbine less than a week after the incident, in Flint Michigan (Moore's hometown) a few days after a six year old boy killed his classmate, and Heston was even in Tucson last week a few days after the tragedy at the University of Arizona. BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE has both very hysterical and very emotional scenes in the film with Moore making his point about the issues of gun control in the United States. I saw the movie twice already in the conservitive city of Phoenix (Scottsdale to be exact) and after both showings I was pleased to hear and see that the film got a round of applause and a standing ovation from the 500+ audience. I never seen that done for a movie, from the both times that I saw it. I will tell people that you can agree or disagree with Michael Moore and his viewpoints about the NRA and gun laws. But this movie must be seen for the issues that are discussed, to see how celebrities like Charlton Heston, Dick Clark, Marilyn Manson, and Matt Stone are really revealed, and what the news media likes to put on the news everynight. Thinking about it, the last four years, the biggest news stories two of the four years delt with guns: the Columbine incident and the Washington D.C. sniper shootings. What message does that send the rest of the world about America? I'm not going to get anymore into it or discuss politics. But I will tell you to see this movie, when you are a gun lover or hate the sight of guns. This is one of the most thought provoking movies that I have ever seen, and Michael Moore should get a Oscar for Best Documentary for this classic! Cannes is already intelligent enough to recognize it, the Academy should also. Don't miss it! ***** (out of five)</fullReview>

There was so much information, I did not have a clue concerning guns and how severely they affect crime and the health of our country. I found each person he interviewed and the way the story was woven together was genius. His interview with Mr. Heston was the icing on the cake. Michael Moore did an excellent job in presenting both sides....clearly showing how our pitiful control of guns is far worse than any terrorist. At the rate we're going we will destroy ourselves and not have one weapon of destruction from Iraq. Every politician, law maker, and law-enforcement personnel should be made to see this film...and it should be shown in every school room in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yoda on culture of fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What have started as gun-nuts comedy has evolved (via Socratic method, Marilyn Manson and South Park) into examination of culture of fear, but stopped short of asking why fear is cultivated in the USA.Here are some of the questions raised in the movie:Q. Why do people shoot to kill? A. They are afraid.Q. Why do people shoot to kill in America more than in other countries?A. Obviously fear is cultivated in this country more than in others.Q. Who profits from culture of fear? A. Quite a few individuals. Let's put gun manufacturers aside, they just using the built-up fear to make living. Q. Who profits from building-up the culture of fear? A. The movie hints at politicians. At all levels. Indeed fear is handy diversion/manipulation tool. Economy in bad shape? ? Make war on terrorism. Cannot afford child care, medical insurance? ? You'd better worry about killer bees or gangs from Bronx invading you neighborhood. Hence media coverage of violent crimes (declined by 20%) increased 600%.To illustrate the point a politician in Canada is interviewed as well as footage of Bush is presented.Canada. Problems with social security? ? Find solution.USA. Problems with social security? ? Bomb Iraq. 9/10 See also `Wag the dog' on the subject.Cheers, Yoda.PS An advice to militia men: Need protection from government? Try electing politicians whom you don't have to be afraid of. Try supporting that media, which exposes corruption in the government elected by you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a spoiler review...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was excellent.Moore's discourse is all about the high number of gun-related murders committed in the USA compared with other western countries. It may seem like he is bashing the 2nd Amendment but that soon gives way to the fear-mongering media services. He manages to get interviews with people who apparently feel justified in blaming gun-related crimes on ethnic background (I am specifically referring to Charlton Heston - and look at the part of his home he chose to be interviewed in: he is sitting in a director's chair with his name on it surrounded by movie posters of movies he was in). Marilyn Manson is interviewed, and he is one of the few coherent people, along with the South Park writer.There is footage of murders being committed by soldiers, with subtitles describing how the American government has funded various terrorists and mass murderers abroad. Moore takes 2 Columbine survivors to K-Mart headquarters to complain that the bullets used against them were bought at K-Mart, leading to K-Mart agreeing to stop selling bullets in 90 days. By the end of the film, there seems to be a definite comparison between the USA and Canada. Some of the people Moore interviews are truly frightening, like the NRA types and the Anarchist Cookbook guy.Prediction: Moore will not be winning any Academy Award for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another strong effort from Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a maverick filmmaker in every sense of the word. He's extreme, he's opinionated, he challenges the biggest institutions he can find, and he has a quirky sense of humor and timing that makes him one of the best documentary-makers out there. "Bowling for Columbine" is his latest film, a look at the gun culture of the United States. His major focus is on several elements: the Michigan Militia; the Columbine shootings; the track record of American history as it relates to guns and violence; a look at Canada and its startlingly lower homicide rate involving guns; and a school shooting of a six-year-old girl in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. For Moore, a lifelong member of the NRA, the basic question is this: Why are there so many gun deaths in the United States as compared to other countries such as Canada? With such a complex issue, Moore can't give any easy answers, but he does address most of the major components of the issue. Is it lax gun laws? Is it an inherent violent nature? Is it music, media, movies that influence our thought processes? Is it anger or resentment? He seems to settle on the idea of a culture of fear that inhabits suburban America, which leads them to want to protect themselves in any way possible from a perceived threat that may not actually exist. One pertinent sequence in the film illustrates this - Moore wanders into a subdivision in Canada, opening doors and walking into houses because nobody seems to lock their doors - and he's greeted with mostly friendly reactions, and certainly no threats. "Thanks for not shooting me," he tells one homeowner.Moore's modus operandi here is fairly similar to the structure he used in his debut, "Roger &amp; Me." He plays the part of American Everyman, a little befuddled at what he thinks are simple questions asked of people who have no ready answers. His 'man on the street' interviews with other common folk are used mostly for laughter - clueless kids and goofy militia members. James Nichols - brother of Terry and associate of Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bombers - comes across as completely insane. A lot of this is, of course, a result of creative editing. Moore has the power to portray everyone how he sees fit - those who he agrees with are given much more respect in the editing process than those he doesn't, such as Nichols. Since he's not claiming to be impartial, he can do this, but it hurts his overall cause somewhat if the opposing opinion isn't given any credence at all.Moore's claim to fame is going after the big boys, representing the common man. Here, he does so in an appeal to K-Mart headquarters on behalf of Columbine survivors, and an interview with NRA spokesman Charlton Heston.Moore has a good sense of timing regarding when to go for humor value and when to bring in the serious issues. He offers some disturbing statistics and shows some very provocative footage, such as the security tapes from the lunchroom at Columbine, which clearly show Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold - the shooters. Chilling stuff. Overall, it's a powerful piece of filmmaking that deserves to be seen, if only for the questions it raises. Whether you agree with him or demonize him, Michael Moore certainly makes people think and makes people talk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gun lovers should like this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, gun control opponents have been saying "guns don't kill people, people kill people". Well, in "Bowling for Columbine", Michael Moore, a lifetime member of the NRA, takes up this thesis in exploring why there are so many gun-related deaths in America today. Pointing out that there are plenty of guns in Canada (7 million in a country of 10 million families) but only 165 gun-related deaths (compared to over 11,000 in the US), Moore begins to explore why "people kill people" in America.Perhaps the reason that gun lovers are so opposed to this movie is that they don't like the answers that Mr. Moore presents. He looks at uncomfortable issues such as racism, a fear mongering media, and American foreign policy while examining their affects on the American psyche.This movie is extremely well put together. The disturbing footage and somber mood are perfectly off-set by well timed comic relief that in no way makes light of the subject matter but, rather, sheds light on the subject matter in a way that makes it possible to endure.That being said, it isn't perfect, while it paints an excellent picture of American gun culture, it glosses over many of the assessments of other countries in order to support its thesis. Also, the criticisms of Michael Moore's self-promotional tendancies aren't entirely off-base. This style, however, is somewhat neccessary in order to paint the picture he manages to. If it weren't for the predatory interviewing style that has become his trademark, many of the entertaining and absurd material he manages to amass would just not be possible to collect. The interview with Heston characterises this as Moore's near cruelty in badgering the senile old man only serves to outline how unfortunate it is that such a damaged mind has so prominent a voice in the American dialogue.Whether you like Moore's position or not, its extremely important to see this movie because, despite a few weaknesses, it still manages to make some very important points. "Bowling for Columbine" is moving, funny, and far more intelligent than most of the dialogue on gun violence that pervades the media.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is by far the best documentary I've seen in the last couple of years (maybe the best since "A Grin Without a Cat"). Some people might say it's provocative and manipulative, but that's exactly how documentaries should be like! Moore gives not one particular answer to the questions he asked in the beginning but he provides us with enough information to make our own judgment. In my opinion it is the combination of frontier-mentality (America has always been a violent country! In the Wild West people had to be armed in order to protect themselves, but today this mentality is still present. The cartoon in the middle of the film describes that in a funny but still effective way) and the easy access to guns, which is responsible for the high killing-rate. Unfortunately Moore had not enough time to finish his thoughts. He can't go into much debt, when talking about several issues. But still his attempt is worth more than every other one before...if there is any!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it amusing that the detractors of this film choose as the lynch pin for their arguement a fact that is not even part of the film. This film is not anti-gun. It is not even pro-gun control. Sure, it does raise the question of why a homeowner would need a weapon used to mow down tens and twenties of armed soldiers with the efficiency of a Craftsman tractor but this is not Moore's arguement. If one took the time to decide to watch this film objectively (in the same vein of Errol Morris' filmmaking style) as if it were just another piece of film to be absorbed and thought about instead of being predisposed to dislike it for its "liberal" agenda they would see the point (or arguement if they feel it must be argumentative). This film poses facts. It poses facts but no direct questions. Moore poses questions to many figures, both famous and infamous. But his questions are not pointed directly to the audience. Perhaps the debates seem like a "smart vs. dumb contest" because he is posing questions that have merit to people who have never allowed the thoughts outside their own agenda to permeate into their heads. They're not bad people. They aren't people who hate peace. They just haven't thought f both sides of the issues they stand for. I will not deny that there are moments in the film where certain figures seem a bit insensitive even buffoonish. Of course these are moments that occur within these figure's own arenas. No body forced Charlton Heston to fumble about, briefly blaming our violence problem on the United States' mixed ethnicity. A point that bites down hard after we are shown examples of the mixed ethnicity of Canada, where the number of gun owners is relatively similar to ours yet the deaths by firearm are nearly as dissimilar as they possibly can be. The question that this film poses is not why do we need so many guns. The question posed by this film is why do we need to kill each other. Why do we feel the necessity to keep our firearms at the ready at all times, perfect for my children or your children to get them and place silver dollar sized holes in their own faces? Why is it that out of the entire world we, the country with the most wealth and opportunity, have population numbers that fluctuate vastly every time some one feels they have been insulted? Why does a country like Canada, our neighbor, not go through the same strife as we do? The ultimate question presented in this film is not why can't we lock down all guns. The ultimate question in this film is why do we as a people allow this unnecessary violence and heartache perpetuate within our own backyards. Why do we just sit and accept it? This film is dangerous and in a way offensive to people not because it shows horrific scenes of the world. This film is dangerous and offensive to some people because it does what all good documentary film does. If you are open enough to do so, it makes you take a long hard look at all the worst impulses of yourself. This film is a cue for humanity. If you are disturbed by what you see and the facts that you are presented in this, why are you disturbed? If you are disturbed, what are you doing to make it all right again?It would be a shame for this film to be dismissed as propaganda. Regardless of which side of the fence you stand on concerning guns and violence you should see this film. See it with and objective eye. Absorb the statistics. If you don't believe the statistics, look them up for yourself. Do your own research on the issues. Form more than an arguement. Form a strategy. Take the time to realize that we are living in the midst of an epidemic that may never go away and think of how we can minimize it if not solve it. This film is a significant piece of cinema. It is exactly what it is suppossed to be, a starting point. A beginning for us to make this world better, starting at home. You owe it to yourselves to see this film. You owe it to your families. You owe it to America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BRAVO to Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems only fitting having been born in "gun country" that Michael Moore cinematically takes aim at his own home state of Michigan and hits them right between the eyes.He takes cinematic potshots at others too--the brother of one of the Oklahoma city bombers, the US government whose history of intervention and assistance to other countries usually comes in the form of guns to oust an unsavory leader or help maintain the existence of an U.S.-imposed leader, even Dick Clark whose Michigan-based business employed a single mother on "workfare" whose 6-year-old son shot and killed another six-year-old girl in his Michigan classroom--with a gun from his uncle's house where the boy stayed because he and his mother were being evicted for nonpayment of rent.I personally may never watch "The 10 Commandments" again after seeing Charlton Heston come across as a gun-toting ("From my cold dead hands!"), insensitive (hosting NRA rallies in Littleton and Flint days after shootings in both) quasi-bigot ("Well, [maybe the reason we're so gun-crazy is because] we're more mixed here ethnically.") Mr. Heston should sell his estate in Beverly Hills and move to Michigan to be with militia buddies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really a documentary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night and I must say that I'm not really a fan of Michael Moore, largely because I think that he uses good subject matter to promote himself over the "cause" sometimes. 'Bowling for Columbine' is an amazing film though, and everyone should see it. This is a more focused, older, and better funded Michael Moore, and he has created an incredible piece of propaganda for the left. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but you're kidding yourself if you think this movie isn't as self-serving and one-sided as many of the NRA videos and 50's television commercials that are presented throughout the film as comic fare. I thought that Marilyn Manson spoke the most insightful and intelligent words that anyone has uttered on screen in ages, and the scenes of the Columbine killings with overlapping 911 calls were chilling and heartbreaking. On the downside, Moore still insists on playing the Nazi card WAY too often, and occasionally in err of history. The montage of American military/Middle East and Central American terror/dismembered and dead children along with Armstrong's 'What a Wonderful World' is the stuff of B-grade student film, played more for weak irony and black humor rather than for effective power and poignancy. Regardless, this film is an amazing example of well thought out, well executed propaganda. If its message appeals to your politics, then good. If not, the film can still be enjoyed for it's persuasive powers. It does not present objective fact, but rather is a carefully carved out work that is designed to make you see one distinctive side of an issue. In that sense, 'Bowling for Columbine' has more in common with 'Judd Suss' than it does with, say, 'Woodstock-the Movie' or 'Hearts of Darkness.' Moore uses a superiorly deft hand at making the audience see things his way, largely through his gift for humor and wit. At one point Moore inserts a few minutes of Chris Rock's 'Bigger and Blacker' video, which are extremely funny. The audience will laugh at Chris, but after the movie is over, will only remember what a funny movie 'BFC' is. It is the same technique that has sold millions of records for Puff Daddy: give 'em a groove they already know, and they'll buy it because it's "new." That, my friends, is successful mind control, and Michael Moore is to be praised, for he possesses a gift for it. The important thing is to keep that in mind every time he gives us a new "documentary" to consider. 9/10</fullReview>

Instead, this film, which sometimes looks no better than "The Blair Witch Project" proves that all the production values in the world cannot compete with a raw talent for entertaining. There is fascinating, heartbreaking footage of the Columbine massacre - I don't know how he gets his hands on this stuff. This is a no-win movie. You can leave your smugness at the door. Liberals behind the media (COPS, CNN) certainly don't come out of this smelling like roses -and republicans? politicians? corporations? - don't even ask. I left the cinema feeling that the American gun problem was more phenomena than problem. Leaving the cinema was like leaving a rabbit hole where everything was curiouser and curiouser.

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I found it to be a compelling statement on the need for gun control in the US.I would have to partially disagree with earlier comments on the way the information is presented, especially as the info used to support the writer's claims is itself "simplistic and polarizing". Yes, Mr. Moore has a 'spin' that he puts on the documentary, but in all fairness I think Mr. Moore does nothing to hide his own feelings and opinions and offers them up as such. Yes, he does use material that selectively supports his point of view (as happens in all presentations of a point of view) but then he gives those who oppose his point of view fair opportunity to present their case and if they end up looking like idiots for it, that can hardly be Mr. Moore's fault.All in all in the time provided Bowling for Columbine shows some dramatic differences between the US and other nations on the issue of firearms. It makes what I feel is a fair attempt to show both sides of the issue and leaves the viewer to make up their own mind. It does this with out having any of the force feeding of opinion through one-sided reporting of facts that is so prevalent in most commercial media.More power to Mr. Moore for tackling such a divisive issue and being as even minded as he was, in other hands the facts could have been twisted much further.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Could contain spoilers even though film is a documentary****Michael Moore (`Roger &amp; Me') knows no shame. In this funny, flawed, and ultimately important documentary about guns in America, `Bowling for Columbine,' Moore's greatest moment is when he corrals poor Charlton Heston, president of the NRA, into an interview. Moore stalks the aging, pre-Alzheimer's actor, cornering him into frustration about why he headed a rally right after a 5 year-old boy shot a companion in the same town. Heston can't ably answer; he just shuffles away to the innards of his Hollywood compound, looking old and alone. What mostly gained Moore access to Heston and credibility all around is the fact that he is a life-long NRA member.The film is filled with regular people making Asses of themselves about guns. Very funny is the bank officer opening an account for Moore that includes a gun as a prize. Moore can barely contain his outrage that banks could be in the gun business.Cannes accepted this film into competition, the first documentary in 46 years, and for good reason. Moore explains maybe a bit too easily America's longstanding `culture of fear' from colonial days, partly answering why its gun-murder rate is so much higher than other country's. When he rakes over giant Lockheed Martin, whose arms manufacturing juxtaposed with welfare-for-work makes it a worthy target, he is at his ironic and supercilious best.Other interviews with Goth rocker Marilyn Manson and `South Park' creator Matt Stone help Moore's thesis that obvious icons of rebellion are much less responsible for violence in America than a K-Mart that sold ammunition used at Columbine.Although Moore's logic is a times specious, at other times sheer demagoguery, there are instances when he is himself startled by the truth of his discoveries. For instance, when a Michigan prosecutor states that the white suburbs have more problems with guns than black urban areas, Moore confesses, `I didn't think that's what you were going to say. I thought you were going to say it was black kids in the inner city.' At moments like these I forget Moore's being accused of manipulating or manufacturing interviews; I just marvel at a child-like filmmaker doing what few others can-making unmistakably provocative films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You come out with more questions than answers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching, I purposely let myself get absorbed into the content of the film. That's what you're supposed to do right? So when I left the film I was blown away by the message of what causes such mass violence in America. But on the way home, I began to think more critically of how it presented it. Aside from one major issue (gang violence), I don't think the film could have been improved much. I don't think the intention was so much to prove a reason. In fact, the film introduced some seemingly contradictory solutions. Violence is way too complex an issue to narrow down to one cause; and that's what the film revealed. However, it did show what the causes are not (Marylin Manson, video games,violent movies...). A journalist chooses what to cover in his or her story. This itself is not the problem. The problem is when the journalist chooses stories that fool and endanger the public. Michael Moore surely would like us to think for ourselves and be cautious of what we are told by the mainstream media.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very thought provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore again reaches out to give the public an intelligent, thought provoking slice of americana. His approach is pure grass root movement generated, and the irony of his associations is at times extremely funny. While the first half of the movie left me in tears from laughter, the second half of the film really peaked my need to seek out answers. Unfortunately Moore's approach does not dig deeply into the reasons behind our country's use of guns as a means to an end, but rather focuses on broad correlates (availability, ethnicity, etc). What was truly missing was the interviews with shooters stating why they felt they had to resort to using a gun in the first place! Moore's corporation orientation of afixing blaime, does little to get to the real reasons behind his quest, but does make for interesting entertainment. All in all, it was a film definitely worth seeing, and regurgitating with a few friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simplistic and Polarizing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Compassion is the only source of energy that is useful. Anger always accelerates the damage." -- Zen master Thich Nhat HanhI often gauge a film by my initial reaction when I leave the theater. Am I satisfied, uplifted, frustrated, angry, sad? Admittedly, this is not always the best way to judge a film, but more often than not, my initial reaction seems to stand up. After seeing Michael Moore's documentary on gun control, Bowling for Columbine, I left the theater feeling strangely empty. I wanted to like this film because I know it took some courage to make and films that contain biting social criticism are few and far between. I am grateful that these thought-provoking issues are being raised; however, I found the film so strident in its tone that I fear it may further polarize the debate and not bring people together.Moore begins by using one of his favorite techniques, that of showing his opponents in a ridiculous light. In this case, it is the Michigan Militia, using their own words to show the addled thinking of gun supporters. For example, one Militia member states: "It is an American's responsibility to be armed." Mr. Moore then goes to a local bank in Michigan that provides guns for people opening an account, making some pointed comments about how inappropriate it is for a bank to be giving away guns stashed in their vault. All of this is funny until you realize that it is all manipulated to support his point of view. Now of course I laughed because I agree with its message, but I stopped to think -- what if he was using this approach to attack a point of view I supported? I would be furious and rightly so.Having lived in Canada and the United States, I can attest to the fact that much of the material Mr. Moore uses to promote Canada and denigrate the U.S. is full of half truths and distortions. He implies that the source of U.S. violence cannot be the unemployment rate because Canada has an unemployment rate of 8% while the U.S. rate is only 4%. This completely overlooks the fact the rate of unemployment in Black and Latino areas, areas that produce a high crime statistic, is much, much higher. Mr. Moore also asserts that a hospital visit in Canada is free and quotes some local Canadian residents as saying it should be a basic right of people to have access to free medical care. What he doesn't say is that it is not free. Canadians, at least in British Columbia, pay a premium of $108.00 per month that may not be that much lower than what some Americans pay to Blue Cross. Besides, he doesn't mention the long waiting lists for surgery for life threatening illness, and the inadequate hospital facilities in many areas that require delays in transporting the needy by helicopter to other hospitals. He quotes the Mayor of Sarnia, Ontario promoting social welfare programs, and contrasts that with the cutbacks in the U.S.. Well, perhaps I should move to Sarnia because the government of British Columbia has slashed spending on health and education, cut welfare payments, and eliminated many programs that benefit the poor and the elderly. I did find much to like in Bowling for Columbine. I was elated that, as a result of visits from injured Columbine students, K-Mart announced that it would no longer sell ammunition after a 90-day phase-out period. In addition, in a segment dealing with the abuses of U.S. foreign policy, he shows how the school shootings arise do not occur in a vacuum but arise from prevailing political policies and community attitudes. I think he rightfully points out that the U.S. overbearing use of its power around the world sends a message to its citizens that it is all right to use force to settle an argument. He also makes a telling point that the U.S. media and corporate culture promotion of fear as a marketing tool creates a climate of paranoia. Bowling for Columbine is being touted as a must-see masterpiece. Allow me to offer a lonely voice of dissent. I agree that the film makes some very riveting and scary points, but it does nothing to promote resolution. I do think questions need to be raised and awareness brought to these issues, but Mr. Moore produces much heat but little light, and his self-righteousness drives people into opposite corners. I know there are no simple solutions, but the epidemic of violence, Mr. Moore to the contrary, exists not only in the U.S, but all over the world. This is not just an American issue. In poking at these issues, Moore jumps all over easy targets like Dick Clark, the NRA, and the Bush administration. The issue, however, is not the mindset of George Bush or Dick Clark or a sadly deteriorating Charlton Heston. Scapegoating is not the answer. It is this "us against them" attitude that doesn't work, whether the antagonists are George Bush and Saddam Hussein, or Michael Moore and the big corporations. The focus must be that, if we are to survive, we can no longer afford to live in an ego-driven "you OR me" world. It must quickly become a "you AND me" world united by our common humanity, or there will only be more Columbines.</fullReview>

I do think that everybody should see this, and think about it before waving a hand, arching an eyebrow and dismissing this as "left wing propaganda." If you think his arguments are propaganda, then coherently diffuse them. There are factual statistics that can't be simply dismissed. If you ask me what Michael Moore wanted when he wrote this movie, I say he wanted people to think. Do that. Don't just knee jerk an angry response because you categorically disagree with everything Michael Moore says because he's some bleeding heart. Personally, I love the guy and his work, but I don't expect everyone to. All I want is for people to see this and think about it. Some parts had me laughing harder than I had in a while, yet other parts had my stomach in my shoes. It's definitely worthwhile.

Regardless of statistics and facts (many of which are included in this spectacular documentary) this film addresses a highly emotional issue of guns in America.Whether you be a card-carrying member of the NRA (of which Moore is) or if you are a heavy supporter of gun control and/or elimination of guns in America this social commentary is worth the time.Take the time to see this documentary.

		<shortDescription>A great film -- but with at least one flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me point out where I think this film is flawed. BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE almost exclusively focuses on gun violence in America as it stems from or relates to "white" America -- with very few exceptions. That means there is nothing in this film about drug violence, gang violence and the gun culture within urban, "non-white" America. Much of the firearms murders during the mean drug wars of the 80s, 90s and today are/were "black on black" homicides and other homicides within the context of urban (and suburban) organized crime. BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE never once touches on this subject, which is unfortunate. And it leads me to believe that Michael Moore is rather uncomfortable relating examples and statistics of firearms murders committed by anyone other than Caucasian Americans (there is a funny scene early in the film where Moore has to write the word "Caucasian") -- as though it were somehow politically incorrect or mildly reactionary to touch on the subject of the very obvious gun culture within the cultures of American organized crime as well as in the culture of non-white ethnic groups (in other words, the gun culture that is far removed from the likes of Columbine and the Michigan Militia).I think Moore stayed away from the subject of non-white gun violence because it could perhaps undermine his quasi-thesis that all or most gun violence in American is somehow the result of a deep racially-motivated psychological fear that can be traced from the pilgrims, to the slave holders, to the westward pioneers, etc. He seemingly arrives at his semi-theory through process of elimination. But to imply that there is a separate problem (though perhaps related in certain ways) of firearms violence in America that does not involve white people scared to death of non-whites or other types of strangers would perhaps challenge Moore's semi-theory more than he would like. Michael Moore is well known for wearing his left of center views on his sleeve, which is of course why it's rather surprising to learn from the film that Moore is a member of the NRA. He does a remarkable job at building a case that it's a culture of fear of the non-white man that creates this obsession with guns and over-abundance of killing, yet clearly there are thousands of murders in the U.S. every year that are committed by non-middle America, non-rural, non-suburban, non-whites. So why do black criminals, Hispanic criminals, or criminals from other non-white populations kill with guns? What "fear" do they suffer from? Do they fear other non-white homicidal criminals? Moore, as fearless as he is, seems to fear touching on this issue. Could it be that there is a culture of greed that arises from the business of organized crime that also parallels this culture of fear that perhaps is not really part of organized crime? I think so. I think Moore had more than just an opportunity to explore the gun violence in urban, organized crime; I think he had somewhat of a responsibility to explore this too. But he doesn't. And I can only guess it's because this issue somewhat challenges his quasi-thesis of "white fear."But despite my criticism that I have offered so far, I have to say that this is a great film -- easily one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. It's debatable as to what kind of documentary this is. Is Moore some kind of "satirical documentarian?" His skill at interviews, his pithy observations, his wit and his desire to confront and shock are tremendously on the money. And Moore's skill at getting just about any human being to be candid and say what's really on their mind is amazing. This film is not only hilarious and disturbing, but it is also tremendously moving. I was practically in tears when the film showed the miserable poverty in Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan. He is tremendously skilled and passionate when it comes to shining the spotlight on the underclasses, the forgotten, the downtrodden and those people and problems in America most of us wish would just go away. Moore refuses to let us ignore these problems, and he relates them with such a genuine compassion that it is impossible not to be moved. And he exposes the selfishness and the disinterestedness of the privileged (and well armed) with such effortlessness that it is impossible not be amazed, shocked and outraged.The film works partly because it shows Moore exploring and struggling to come up with the reason or reasons why Americans are so homicidal with firearms (as opposed to our well armed, but less murderous, Canadian neighbors to the north). Moore tries to find an answer or answers -- and he does come up with a theory -- but he implies that his theory may not be the only theory or that it may not be absolutely correct. As Moore irreverently points out in the film, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold liked to bowl, and bowling was the last thing they did before they murdered a dozen or so students and teachers at Columbine High School. So could bowling have been the cause of the Columbine massacre -- any more than Marilyn Manson or easy access to guns? Hence the title BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE.But the film is also a kind of a broader expose on the culture of violence and misery that is unique to American culture. Interestingly, the film briefly essays the culture of violence in American foreign policy -- and how from time to time the U.S. government has, openly and secretly, had a policy of military aggression in many troubled spots around the world. Moore does not explore the history of these conflicts at all, but instead implies that culture of violence within everyday America and the culture of violence used by the American political establishment overseas is related. It isn't complete (nothing about this film is) but it is effective, informative and revealing.But, as I stated already, I think this film is somewhat flawed -- because it does not explore or reveal quite enough. Well, actually, I think it's incomplete. Now Moore needs to go out and make the sequel: BOWLING FOR THE MAC DADDY or BOWLING FOR GANG BANGIN'. He could start with my neighborhoods here in LA and Venice Beach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're a brilliant comedian, now keep your opinion to yourself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very funny movie. Moore has such a wonderfully twisted sense of humor. Sure he's using dead children as his canvas but then again most comedies are based on some sort of misfortune or bad character trait. Don't see this movie for a great debate on the gun issue. See it as a comedy. I am a second amendment advocate and I loved the movie.The movie is about Moore trying to figure out through a series of interviews why America loves guns. In most of his work he blames the corporations. In this one he correctly blames the American public rather than the NRA and the gun companies. Sure they get a little of the blame but most of it he drops on the electorate. After all who's fault is pollution? The oil companies, or the commuters who don't want to pay more money for clean burning fuel? Whose fault is violence? The gun makers or the criminals that actually pull the trigger. Moore puts more blame on the trigger pullers in this film.He also has some great interviews. Charlton Heston and Maryln Manson are two of the more memorable ones. Both are accused of causing Columbine but Manson does a much better job of defending himself. Actually when asked what he would tell the kids of Columbine, his response is genius. Charlton Heston on the other hand is made to look like a real monster in front of the camera. Of course, to his credit, it was early for the old man and Heston thought he was dealing with an NRA advocate. That's why he agreed to the interview. We all have seen Heston advocate the NRA and we know that he is smarter than what is seen here. The end of this movie was actually quite sick. Moore makes the argument in his film that violence is the fault of the American public's paranoia but in one of the closing shots he still insists on blaming it on Charlton Heston just like the popular media he criticizes does.There are some very funny scenes such as when Terry Nicol's brother utters the classic line: "There are a lot of nuts out there". There is another sequence when Moore is interviewing a police officer about an accidental shooting by a dog that gets a lot of laughs because the police officer refuses to be in on the joke. There are many other great laughs.I disagree with everything Moore has ever said but I am a big fan of Roger &amp; Me and TV Nation. He has a way of making brilliant black comedies. At times this movie may have been a little sick, but then again so was Pulp Fiction, another movie I loved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At times engaging, engrossing and brilliant, "Bowling for Columbine" suffers from Michael Moore's unquenchable desire to sketchily indict many putative disparate evils without deeply exploring their nature. A documentary of pieces, the sum is poorer than many of its parts.Moore, the enfant terrible of American documentarians to many, reprises the filmmaking techniques for which he is justly renowned. The sharp edit that leaves many viewers suspecting unfair manipulation of subjects, the ego centrality of Moore's presence and the rapid and almost seamless juxtaposition of antagonistic issues so as to suggest (but not develop) their mutual relevance to the film's theme are in abundance.Moore isn't anti-gun. He is anti-violence, a stand no sane person could dissent from. And he brings to the screen the hardly novel reality that gun violence is epidemic in the U.S. and not a problem in many other Western countries including our northern neighbor, Canada. In jaunts to Windsor and Toronto he allows young and old interviewees to wade in on the question of why their country is so much safer from gun violence, despite the great prevalence of weapons for hunting, than is the U.S. Their answers are neither enlightening nor profound but they do seem more laid back than my fellow Americans (this is news about Canadians?).Moore does demonstrate true physical courage in his exploration of Canadian neighborhoods where, he's heard, denizens don't lock doors. He opens a few doors to confront unsuspecting and remarkably undisturbed homeowners. If man of Moore's size with his unkempt appearance opened my door and walked in unannounced - well, I don't have a gun but I keep two killer cats for a reason.The big problem with this film is that it accuses so many while explaining so little The news media, popular law enforcement TV shows ("COPS"), American foreign policy, arguably corrupt support for dictators, racism, the insinuation that the public is so gullible that any news story from the spread of Africanized bees to the danger of bacteria sparks panic - all fall within Moore's purview. Moore can not let go of his interest in, indeed near obsession with, the fate of his native Flint, Michigan, subject of his brilliant "Roger &amp; Me." The minutes showing the continued decay of this once vital industrial city add nothing.There are sobering and moving moments. The principal of a Michigan elementary school having the sad distinction of being the scene of the murder of the nation's youngest school gun victim, a little single-digit aged child (killed by a peer), projects strength and love for and commitment to her children before faltering and succumbing wordlessly to tears. She knows she doesn't have the answers. With what she's experienced, we know she has fears for the future that can not be disspelled.The interview with an aging Charlton Heston adds little to the film. No one knew at the time of the actor's Alzheimer's Disease but it doesn't matter. Moore's lying (there's another word?) to Heston to get the interview is a common journalistic ploy but the encounter itself uncovers nothing of interest. Heston is old, his steps almost faltering. For those who do not remember that Heston publicly fought for racial justice forty years ago, inclusion of his hardly prepared or thought out comments that can be interpreted as racist was, simply, an unfair act by Moore. Leaving a photo of the little child killed in Michigan on Heston's grounds was tacky.Moore does score a victory in this film when he takes two Columbine victims, one now a paraplegic, to K-Mart's HQ to demand that the mega-chain cease selling ammo for handguns. To Moore's obvious sincere surprise the corporate spokeswoman pledges to exactly meet that demand. A symbolic victory but one that doesn't solve the real issue Moore never satisfactorily explores: why there are so many rage-filled teenagers in our culture?In her brilliant, penetrating and devastatingly brilliant sum-up of her life as a journalist in the nation's capital, "Washington," the late Meg Greenfield draws on her experience to argue that for most, high school is their defining emotional and maturational experience. Obviously, few high school students become killers and they enter school with many values and attitudes formed. But so many teens are emotionally supple and painfully vulnerable. Were the Columbine killers so different other than in the degree in which they acted out? I suspect they weren't. And that issue stands apart from any underlying American culture of gun violence. I would love to see a more thematically constrained Moore explore high schools, perhaps just one.And, unfortunately, I had no greater insight into teen homicidal violence after the film than when I entered the theater. Moore lost a tremendous opportunity here.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's best work, ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore had to win me over with this film, because I was not a fan of his before I saw it. With American gun culture being a far more intriguing issue than the nebulous attacks on "stupid white men" that Moore's previous work is known for, my interest was piqued enough to be very excited about Bowling For Columbine. The verdict is nothing short of fantastic. Despite what detractors of this film have said, Bowling For Columbine is not "anti-American", "socialist propaganda" or gun control propaganda. I defy anyone to name an instance in the film in which Michael Moore advocates stricter gun control, because the facts are that, although there is footage of gun control advocates, Moore clearly doesn't believe that banning guns is the answer to anything. I am forced to question if those accusing this film of being "propaganda" were in the bathroom while say, the entire segment on Canada, was on. To quote Moe Syzlak, "if you're so sure about what it ain't, how about telling us what it am," which is a fair enough question. What Bowling For Columbine is, is an intriguing look at the American psyche. There isn't really a whole lot to say about the film without ruining it for those who haven't seen it. But for those who bemoan the lack of a definitive "answer" for the problems posed in this film, how exactly is such a complex issue going to be resolved in a matter of hours? There are clearly ingrained mental problems that America as a social entity has to deal with. In regard to American violence, simply asking the right questions, which Bowling For Columbine did in spades, is a triumph, that will hopefully put us on the track to an answer. ***SPOILER*** I will say that perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this film was the interview with the not so subtle bigot Charlton Heston. Would I have called him that before he implied that the presence of minorities in America is responsible for the high amount of gun deaths (as opposed to the ever vigilant and responsible Caucasian gun owners)? No. As for those who accuse Moore of "ambushing" Heston, Moore asked a simple question, "why does the NRA continue to show up in locations which have just suffered through gun related tragedies?" Heston had no answer. If Heston did appear "ambushed" it's because he took Moore's NRA membership to mean that all NRA members follow the Charlton Heston party line, and that he would be getting slow pitch softball questions. I always thought that Heston might be a better person than the NRA sound bites made him look, but amazingly, he's a far worse person.See this film, if nothing else, it will make you think about something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Worth Seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's Bowling For Columbine is a film which I can highly recommend. It's a good, old-fashioned, something-for-everyone liberal documentary from the kitchen-sink school of documentary filmmaking. Moore tries hard to bring ideas to the general population which most American media would find to be sacrileges (but which I wholehearted agree are some of the keys to America's problems, chiefly our problem of violence.) Such as that our exploitive media terrorize us by constantly focusing on violence and instilling fear, causing a perception of our world which does not match the reality. For example, Moore brings up that while violent crime has decreased in a certain time period by (I think) 40%, media coverage of violent crime has increased 600%.Moore, who is excellent at finding subjects or situations which will yield succinct expressions of some nebulous concepts, runs into a news camera crew in South Central Los Angeles at one point, and interviews one of the producers. He asks in a case where there are two story possibilities - the "near-drowning" of a baby, and a man brandishing a gun - which the news crew would go with. The producer responds, "The gun. Always go with the gun." That says it all.During this same short sequence, Moore is shown the "Hollywood Sign", off in the distance - or rather, it is pointed out for him, but can't be seen, due to smog. Moore wonders aloud why the media aren't covering that story, and the contrast between the importance of the two stories - pollution on a vast and killing scale, and one man in South Central waving a gun - makes it exceedingly clear how the rigidly formatted, reductive television news programs fail to cover the real news of the world, in favor of the sensational. The only real crime here is that, instead of labeling themselves as entertainment, they call themselves "news", which it becomes obvious they are not, except maybe with an asterisk reading "of the exploitive, dramatic, and summarizable in ten words or less."Despite its overall success in being an engaging, thought-provoking, and often emotional film, Bowling For Columbine's failings are Moore's usual ones. Chiefly, an occasional lack of respect for certain things or people (e.g. Charlton Heston) which may cross a line for some viewers, making us wonder how fully we can support some of Michael Moore's tactics, which as a result can make his idealism seem a little expedient.Also a flaw, in my book - and probably less evident to the average filmgoer - would be Moore's over-eagerness to make some of his subjects look stupid (while Moore comes off looking clever) by his editing of their statements. This, again, undermines his idealistic stance, since it frequently seems (to me) he uses people as stand-ins for the two-dimensional attitudes of ignorance and stupidity he wants to express; that, even if the person being interviewed is not as stupid as Moore would like a subject to be in a given scene, he leaves their more balanced views on the cutting-room floor.Moore's strengths are again his usual ones, such as a willingness to do things that make us nervous, like bring two survivors of Columbine (both with bullets, purchased at K-Mart, still lodged in their bodies) to K-Mart headquarters with a request that K-Mart take the bullets back, and a request that K-Mart stop selling ammunition.In this particular scenario, if you're anything like me, you'll be surprised at what happens. It's clear Michael Moore was among the most surprised of all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore grabs our attention yet again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of reviews are missing the whole point of this documentary.It is NOT about guns, people, it is about FEAR. In the fear dominated culture that has been foisted by the self-serving media and the NRA on the U.S.A., this movie is a beacon of reality. Sometimes the fear is not even specified, there are these loose references to danger and unspecified enemies (by George Bush among others) which instils the triple door locks, gated communities and guns under every pillow mentality that is the U.S. today.Crime is down 20 % but the coverage of crime by the media is up 400%. No wonder CNN watchers are paranoid. The siege mentality takes over.But while all this is going on, nobody pays attention to the real problems, urban decay, no universal health care system, workfare which keeps mothers away from their children, corporations getting wealthier and the NRA everywhere, puppets for the arms manufacturers.There was long applause at the showing which has sold out for every performance in Toronto. Good going, Mike.And yes, my door goes unlocked along with many others in this great, safe city of over 2 million multi-ethnic souls.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheering for Moore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm glad to see that this film is being embraced by so many. Especially by people who are being open-minded with their pros and cons. I understand how some people have found Moore's tactics a little too harsh. But I'm proud of him because of the the Left has often been too timid and PC . When you're talking about human lives, you have to be confrontational. We have to address the people who are in some way responsible for the violence in this country head on, and through our confrontation, allow them to reveal and confront their own agendas. He got K-Mart to stop selling guns and bullets. What else has the Left done lately?I'd also like to defend this film in saying that it is not so much a film about guns, but a film about fear and paranoia. In looking at other countries, Moore acknowledges that they also have crime and gun-related deaths, as well as poverty, violence in cinema and video games, and a range of ethnic cultures (he might have mentioned that Holland has a higher percentage of immigrants than we do). I believe his intention in making this film was to examine WHY we have so many people who kill for the sake of killing (such as serial killers, snipers, the boys at Columbine, the rats who blew up the building in Oklahoma...). What is the fear that is driving people to arm to the teeth? What is the source for the kind of anger that drives people to kill total strangers at random? These are questions that have been needed to be raised for a long time. I don't think Michael Moore is there to give us answers, but to raise these questions for us to answer ourselves.I'd also like to defend Moore's interview with Charlton Heston. Mr Heston is the president of the NRA. How could Moore make a film about the issue of guns in America without interviewing the president of the National Rifle Association? I think the questions he asked were legitimate questions. If Mr. Heston seemed feeble-minded, perhaps the NRA should get a better spokesman. If he seemed racist well... they were his words. Michael Moore didn't put them in his mouth, in fact, Moore re-worded his question in order to give Heston a chance to re-word his answer. Since no one in the NRA seems upset that their president and spokesman has stated that perhaps our 'need' to be armed is because of our country's ethnic mix, I guess that means they're fine with Mr. Heston's point of view. Nuff said.It's impossible to cover all the angles that make up violence in our society. Michael Moore has done a great job so far. I hope he'll follow up with more films like this. If he can get K-Mart to re-think their policies, who knows what else he can do to make this country a little safer?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that makes one think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bowling For Columbine is Michael Moore's latest documentary. In it, he attempts to understand why America has such a violent culture, and why so many Americans seem to be afraid all the time. Although many seem to think that his main target is the NRA, in fact it is the American media and the way it emphasizes the violence in our country, and uses fear to hype their ratings on the news. (Killer escalators, killer bees, etc.)Having said that, the movie also struggles to understand why so many people live in such fear that they keep a loaded gun in the house at all times. It seems especially absurd when Charlton Hestons proudly boasts that he keeps a loaded gun in his Beverly Hills mansion, which is surrounded by a gate, and protected by a security service. When Moore questions why Heston has a loaded gun in his house, Heston replies that the Second Amendment gives him that right. He may or may not have that right under the Second Amendment, but the real question is why is this man who lives in a crime-free neighborhood with gates and security guards so afraid that he feels the NEED to keep a loaded gun in the house. After all, Heston admits that in his long life, he has never been the victim of a crime. It is this fear of that Moore tries to understand throughout this film and I give him credit for making me stop and think about why we Americans are so terrified all the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's strange to read so many diatribes against this film from gun advocates, because as a left-wing anti gun nut myself, I felt a little bit pushed toward the right by it (as far as the gun debate goes). Moore repeatedly cites the abundance of guns in Canada, which remains almost crime free (he wrongly dismisses a lack of poverty as a reason for this), which is a pretty persuasive pro-gun fact.I have many problems with Moore's arguments - he's obviously no scholar. He also includes too much borrowed material (Chris Rock's HBO Special???) and kisses up to like-minded interviewees (Matt Stone?), while being overly harsh to others (I never planned on feeling sorry for Charlton Heston). But Moore's talent is his aggressiveness, and the sequence in which he brings two Columbine victims to KMart headquarters is an extremely powerful bit of populist action (though I wouldn't expect those who disagree with the cause to find it so). All in all, it's no Roger and Me. But it is refreshing to see a movie come out that is unafraid to take a stance - with all the fear of offending anyone with centrist politics that dominates the film world. If just for that, I hope people see this and talk about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less about Gun Control, more about Fear Control.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really is not what gun nuts are making it out to be, e.g. some sort of gun-control propoganda. Its an introspective and insightful look at what makes America so darned violent. In fact, Moore, who is a lifetime member of the NRA, specifically uses Canada as a comparison to the U.S. and notes the fact that there are well over 7 million legally owned guns in Canada -- a large number. Yet Canada's gun-related murders number around 300 while America has over 11,000 a year. In the movie, Moore specifically discounts the idea that the proliferation of guns is what makes the U.S. so violent. So just what is it that makes the U.S. stand apart from every other industrialized country in the world when it comes to violence?Well, the search for the answer to that question is what this movie is really about. While the journey is meanders a bit, and there is definitely some bias when it comes to certain issues (like the animated retelling of America's history), the movie definitely raises many pertinent questions. It should also be noted that Moore does not play favorites when it comes to political leaders. He takes Clinton to task as well as Dubya. Finally, this movie couldn't have come out at a better time as we ponder the military invasion of Iraq. What kind of message does it send when we use force as a first resort rather than the last?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Motives got a little muddy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>so michael moore's movie is well made, entertaining as hell and for a documentary, i think that says a lot...i think he set out to try and answer why the US has so many gun slayings, with a presumption that it's due to our obsession with guns. he spends the first 30 minutes making dumb gun owners look really dumb, but that's no big feat. I think the main crux of the movie happens when he goes to Canada and discovers that they've got just as big a hard on for guns as america does, with a fraction of the crime. Canada had something like 500 gun slayings last year, whereas the ol' US had over 11,000. So he then had to reevaluate what was behind the bloodthirst here in the states. The answer he comes to, i feel was dead on. The media and an atmosphere of terror and fear perpetuated by the media, which seemed to be a problem only within the US.Once he carries the audience to that point, the target of the movie should have changed. Instead of continuing to make gun owners look bad, i feel he should have started poking at the media...and he starts to with an interview of the producer of the Cops TV show and an embarrassing scene with a reporter on the scene of the youngest school slaying. But the climax of the movie returns to the original focus and attacks guns. Two scenes, trying to get bullets removed from the shelves of Kmart and another embarrassing interview with an enthused gun advocate, this time the king of the mountain, the president of the NRA, Charlton Heston himself. Sure, the bullets used in Columbine were from Kmart and the NRA used atrocious judgment in showing up in Columbine within days of the shooting for a gun rally. But Michael Moore has already shown us that these things are not at the crux of our murder rate, at least, not directly responsible....So why still attack them?In the end, i felt like this was a propaganda movie. and regardless of the cause, propaganda with it slanting facts, playing the shell game, or distracting viewers is still wrong. the ends don't justify the means. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and would recommend it to everyone, but i felt in the end that Michael Moore's motives got a little muddy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and for that reason, I wanted to give it a high score. Until I sat down and tried to digest what Mike Moore had been telling me. And then I realised - I haven't got a clue.I have enjoyed Mike Moore films in the past, although I am fully aware that I am not being given the full picture in order to evaluate all of the points. They tend to be more "propoganda" than documentary. But hey, at least he does it in an entertaining way, and as long as you go out and research the other side, at least he has presented you with some interesting viewpoints.That was the kind of case for this film. Except, I really don't know exactly what his viewpoints were. He explores various reasons for the high gun crime rate in America and he talks about the general situations and the reasons for it (looking at arguing against standard explanations: family breakdowns, violent past, high gun ownership etc). But then we seem to have left that subject and gone to the specifics of one particular crime ... and then another ... and we are all of a sudden spending quite some time examining the low wages paid by Dick Clark (who owns the chain of restaurants where the mother of a 6 year old gun user worked). Oh, so the reason for that crime (all crime?) is because of poverty? But hang on, he's just dismissed that reason when he compared gun crime with certain other poorer countries. So why are we trying to interview (blame) Dick Clark? ... Oh, we've moved on, and now we're talking about the negative way in which news reports stir up fear amongst the public. But we don't give any real evidence of any direct link between this and gun crime. Just examples of negative press stories from the past. And now we're back to a specific incident (the Columbine one) and we're blaming KMart because they sell bullets (not that I am defending KMart) ... oh, and we have also heard drawn out implications that America's gun crime is due to the fact that gun owners are all white, and the NRA is racist, and Americans all own guns because they are afraid of the black man. Hence the high gun crime ... erm .... pardon? We are directed all over the place, but at no point does Moore give us anything tangible that we can use in a debate. If I present an argument during a debate, I will expect the first response to my point to be "Why do you think that?". At this point you need evidence and good, strong arguments if you are to succeed. Moore doesn't really have any of these. Not only that, but he can't resist numerous, irrelevant sideswipes at the Bush government, which (valid though they often are) often have nothing to do with the overall aim of the film.My review is not to argue with Moore or his points, but merely to say that if you are expecting an Oscar winning "documentary" to provide you with useful arguments and convincing theories, then you'll be a bit disappointed. But, if you are a fan of Moore's general style of presenting an argument, and do not mind if he is random and doesn't finish any avenue he explores, then you will enjoy this.A shame, because I tended to agree with many of the points (not all!), but just felt that Moore didn't do them justice if he was trying to talk to intelligent people who are capable of forming their own opinions, and need solid reasoning in order to do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important view if nothing else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this some 8 years ago, it really hit me. I thought it was funny, bold, logical, had a major point and was remarkably skillfully put together. And it seemed honest enough. In other words one of the most important eye-opening comments I had ever seen. Well, now I'm a bit older and, afraid so, more cynical and found out more about Moore the character over the years. So I find his methods what comes to getting his points across now more questionable, and his much debated picking on old fragile Charlton Heston has become almost too painful to watch. No matter that the actor has said and done some idiotic things like "from my cold dead hands" in some NRA rallies and defended the right to bear arms like it was some holy mission.But as the word "fear" is a main frame of reference throughout this film, so is relevant the fact that when every criminal in the country has gun, you better arm yourself too. America has gone too far already that way and all the Hestons have a point too. And only by decreasing poverty and the income gap the situation may get better. In a hundred years or so. So Moore gets it right on his major themes and that's of course the most important thing. Context over form.But as said nowadays I have much better understanding also for those who criticize Moore. Just remember that everyone who gets rich and famous, and is still in a hurry to make his beloved country a better place by his films and otherwise, can't please everybody. You couldn't either. Only those who call him names like "fat pig" and so on, I don't get. Do you mean that if he was a more handsome man he would be okay in his business? Or for having a sex with, or what?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Documentary Media Class Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For my film review I chose to watch a documentary by Michael Moore entitled "Bowling for Columbine." In this film Michael Moore discusses the Columbine High School shootings which occurred on April 20th, 1999 in Columbine, Colorado. Two students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, brought shotguns, pistols, and pipe bombs to their high school and then went on a shooting rampage against their fellow students. It was one of the most deadly school shootings in United States History and at the end of the day 12 Students and one teacher were killed while an additional 21 people were wounded. In his film, Moore discusses the possible causes for this shooting. He states the glorified use of guns throughout American History as a possible catalyst for the shooting rampage. Moore also explores the process of obtaining a fire arm in the United States and how it is a very simple process that is not very difficult at all. He also states several statistics about gun deaths worldwide and then compares them to the yearly amount of gun deaths in the United States and the numbers that has found are quite staggering. Throughout his film Moore talks about the way Americans feel about guns and gun control and he does, in my opinion, do a very good job of presenting opinions that represent both sides of the issue. He does this by interviewing people who represent both sides of the issue and give very interesting and thought provoking responses to Moore's questions. For example, Moore interviews Timothy McVeigh's brother and gets his opinions about gun control and why he thinks that citizens of the U.S. are allowed by law to carry guns and arm themselves. I think that with this film, Moore does a good job of not pushing his own views extremely hard on the viewers but does represent them in a way that would not influence the viewers greatly but allows them to form their own opinions about gun control. I think "Bowling for Columbine" is an example of the kind of film making that Michael Moore does best, he takes a very serious social issue in the U.S., in this case gun control, and explores it to great extent by gathering info and opinions of a wide range of people. Much like his other pieces of work, including "Fahrenheit 9/11" or "Sicko", Moore discusses both the background information of the issue he is documenting as well as what is currently going on with the issue, and even adds some speculation as to what effects the issue will have in the future. Moore also takes whatever issue he is talking about and compares what is happening with the issue in the U.S. to the rest of the world. For example in "Bowling for Columbine" he gives statistics for the amount of guns and the number of gun related deaths in the United States and compares them to Canada. By doing this he is able to show to what extent guns impact our society and to what extent they impact other societies. I think that by picking a country that is right next door to the U.S. he is able to show how drastically different the severity of the problem is in the two countries. The editing in this movie involved a lot of steady camera shots which did not provide a feeling that it was shot with a hand-held camera. The individual scenes vary greatly, there are some where there are longer interviews and others where the interviews are quite short. One thing that both of these aspects have in common is that neither one is performed in a standard sitting at a table asking questions, they are usually standing somewhere or walking around someone's house or place of work. By doing this I think that Moore is able to hold the audience's attention better and to get away from the sort of interview that one would find on the nightly news. The movie progresses not so much chronologically but from theme to theme. Moore discusses gun control while presenting people's opinions that he has gathered about it, he will then move to talking about gun accidents and give examples and statistics for this. I feel that the film does a very good job of staying organized and doesn't jump from idea to idea in a haphazard manner, but is very streamlined and smooth. Moore also narrates during his movie while he is transitioning between clips or to give a little background information about an interview before it is played in the film. The cinematography of this film used a lot of literal visuals to get across the issue of gun control. He shows visuals of guns, news paper articles, as well as old news broadcast clips. The documentary was shot in color film with only a few old clips in black and white. Moore uses a variety of shots in his documentary including various interviews and some shots of scenery. He does do a lot of close up interviews with people but he also shows visuals of schools and cities where he is. The film does not have a very shaky feeling to it which means that it was probably not shot in a hand-held fashion. But I think that for this kind of film that is the best way to do it because you don't need to convey a sense of action when you are exploring an issue and interviewing individuals. The film also gives a very strong sense that a lot of the interviews and visits that Moore makes are not scheduled in advance but more of an "on the spot" set up. I think this makes the film seem a bit more real just because it seems like the person being interviewed is giving an honest answer and has not had time to prepare exactly what they were going to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't judge me harshly, but I like my videotaped murders and suicides to be cartoonish and unreal. Dirty Harry villains getting what they deserve? YES! Real people shooting themselves in the head? NO!!! This film shows videos of actual killings and suicides that made me stop watching it after the first wave of "real" killings that is shown about fifteen minutes in - and shown without even the slightest warning. The killings were frightening, disturbing, and very, very sad. I wanted to like this film. My brother Jim thinks it is a great documentary, the critics seem to generally like it, and the DVD box says it is very funny. I wish I had researched a bit more, though, since on this very website the Parents Guide makes it clear that this is not a film for the squeamish among us. I am one of the squeamish sort. When the newscasters tell me in advance that the following video footage contains scenes that some viewers might find disturbing, I look away. So, I avoided this movie for many years just because it seemed like I would find it disturbing. I am guessing that Michael Moore had his reason for editing the film in a way that moved from scenes of "movie" violence to actual murders without any warning to the audience. I will start using the Parents Guide before watching similar movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine Michael Moore's documentary Bowling for Columbine is an examination of gun culture in America; it explores the issue of gun violence and gun culture. It focuses on the media's role in society and the way it effects and their perception of the perception of violence in America. While the film covers a very serious issue it is also very entertaining, the documentary captivatingly conveys the shocking problem of gun violence, the media's connection to it and the atmosphere of fear that Americans seem to feel. Moore follows the cycle of violence and fear ruining his society.There is no doubt that the media has a huge effect of society. It can not only spread positive messages but also negative ones. Moore focuses of the way media can affect the emotional climate of the country. He uses examples of stories like Y2K and the Africanized killer bee plague which threw America into a state of panic. It demonstrates how the media portrays black people in a negative way, creating fear. It uses sharp editing of crimes committed by black men accompanied by loud narration repeating 'black man wanted for crime' or 'wanted: black male'. This makes it seem as if white men do not commit crimes and that we should fear black people, which is not the case. Moore's point is clear: the media has to be more responsible and stop creating the terrible fear in the community. The media, the corporations, the politicians have all done such a good job of scaring the American public; it's come to the point where they don't need to give any reason at all.The documentary suggests to us that this fear leads to greater consumption of guns and associated products. Moore opens a bank account and is supplied with a complementary gun; he buys bullets from his hairdressers and can pick up a gun at k-mart, proving how accessible weapons are. The easy access to weapons and the fear that Americans have does nothing to create a safe environment in America, in fact it does the exact opposite, which is clearly demonstrated by the terrible number of gun deaths in America per year: 11127. This number is by far the largest in comparison with Australia (65), Japan (39), Canada (165), Germany (387), France (255) and the UK (68). These figures clearly show that the easy access to weapons and the fear created by the media do not create a save environment.The easy access to weapons is unsafe and unnecessary; it creates a casual attitude towards them, Kids find them at home and are not afraid as they should be because they haven't been bought up to fear them. One six year old child even felt comfortable picking it up and putting it into his school bag; he took it to school where he shot another six year old girl in his class. The girl died in the class room after the single bullet traveled through her body. The boy found the gun at his uncle's house where he was staying. His attitude towards the gun was not fear as it should have been, children shouldn't be comfortable around guns and families should not be leaving guns in places where children can find them. The girl's death was a tragedy, the youngest school shooting in history.Moore's Documentary is both entertaining and thought provoking. Bowling for Columbine powerfully presents Moore's point of view on the shocking problem of gun violence in America and the effect that the media has in intensifying the fear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sometimes criticize Michael Moore for his "pretend" documentaries that are usually so biased that they qualify not as documentaries but rather as propaganda. "Bowling For Columbine," however, was I thought pretty well done. Yes, Moore has a bias which comes across but his bias seems more muted than in his other movies, and he seems far more interested in asking the question "why?" than in simply attacking and ridiculing those he disagrees with. Why are there so many gun deaths in the United States compared to other western countries? Fair question. Moore doesn't really come up with an answer, but raising the question is nevertheless a worthwhile task.Politically, the movie paints with broad brush strokes. Both Bush and Clinton come in for criticism of how their actions have contributed to the gun culture. The real target of the movie, though, is the National Rifle Association - that bizarre (there's my solid Canadian bias showing) - lobby group that seems to think that the more guns there are in people's hands, the safer everybody will be. Moore makes great play of the fact that he's a life member of the NRA (which surprised me) and therefore can ask questions from the inside, so to speak, as he does at the end of the movie when he confronts Charlton Heston (at the time the president of the NRA) with some of these questions, with Heston in the end simply agreeing to disagree and walking away. His brief encounter with Dick Clark took me aback. The one scene that really stood out in my mind was the interview with the brother of one of the Oklahoma City bombers (who seemed a bit crazy himself and who was apparently also a suspect at one time) when the man looked at the camera with a bit of a wild look in his eyes and said, about why he needed weapons but thought that access to weapons-grade uranium should be restricted, "there's wackos out there." True - and a lot of them have guns! It's all set with the 1999 school shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado as the backdrop, and it does raise very legitimate issues and questions. In my view, it's Michael Moore's best "quasi-doc," although it portrays a bit too benign a view of Canada's gun problems. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love him or Hate him...Micheal Moore puts it out there to the people at large!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Paul Mooney says so Vehemently everyone will have their N***a wake up call; Micheal Moore just puts that saying into perspective for the Nation at large in most of his movies this movie is one of them. "Bowling for Columbine" is a hit hard, take charge movie that focuses on the events of Columbine high school tragedy but it also focus on how guns in America and the moro...I mean people that used them should take responsibility for the actions and the repercussions of there decisions; Micheal Moore whether you love him or hate him he doesn't put his point of view entirely into this movie he does his homework, puts in the research and does what he has to do to put the reality out there now whether or not people will accept it or not is there business but at the end of the day you have to respect him for putting the truth where it hurts.......The administration, and the gun lobbyist. Micheal, has his own set of dark humor which keeps anyone interested at the same time and relate to matters at hand. Whether your black, white, or anywhere in between you will relate to this at one point or another cause everyone as a story either tragic or just plain simple! The story is in the heartfelt tragedy and the moral of how human nature tends to make mistakes and keeps on mistaking them...and whether you want to believe the truth or not its still there and it will effect you at one point and that's what Micheal Moore pretty much states.This is a very good Documentary for anyone who loves Micheal Moore's work and never seen one or two of this films should see this. 9/10- Strong balance in the story that keeps a person well educated as well as insights that makes a person think no matter what race or sex. Micheal Moore puts no holds barred to getting the truth out even thru dark humor. A very good movie. and a reason why I LOVE documentaries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore investigates America's pathological love for guns in this strong, effective and often unsettling documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine (2002) "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." Second Amendment of the American Constitution Ask any American why they have a firearm and they will quickly reply: "It's my Second Amendment, it's my right", probably the only part of the constitution many of them know and they cherish it. Amendment II was established to respond to the ultra-violent period during America's birth. It was necessitated due to the situation in America. Its dubious interpretation has led to a massive number of weapons available in every city in the US.Personally I am against selling guns to every idiot because "It's their right" and more importantly why sell them a semi-automatic firing 30 round a second? How can that be a weapon for self-defence? Buying a gun in America is easier than buying a car; plus you can have many many guns if you want because it is your right as an American. Statistically, America has the highest rates of gun crime and sometimes I wonder why? Is it maybe that the market is flooded with weapons? Could that be the reason? Some may disagree but I see an obvious link between availability of guns and gun crime. Anyway that is just my opinion and I am sure others manically disagree.Michael Moore's Oscar winning documentary is a fascinating look at American suburbia, horrific gun incidents in schools and how the media instills fear in the American citizen. Many will argue that Moore's works are always one-sided; perhaps, but still he makes some excellent, excellent points.Entertaining, tragic, informative, funny, this is a great documentary that is recommended to anyone interested in social issues...8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that makes you think - a rare quality these days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a European, I have often looked with shock and bemusement at the USA and how fanatical Americans are about their guns. It's a big love affair between his man and his Glock over there and whenever you ask an American about this obsession, their stock answer is "it's my rights!". No matter that kids are shooting kids and Charlton Heston is in the running for "Crass Old Fool of the Year" Award - AGAIN. According to the average American, if it's in the constitution, it must be right and can't be changed to reflect the changing times.Michael Moore has produced a brilliant movie which from the get go provokes thought and discussion. He chooses the right scene to start the movie - he walks into a bank that offers a free gun to new customers and opens an account. I think that first initial scene says it all right there and sets the tone for the rest of the movie.Columbine is only part of the movie. He actually only barely scratches the surface of that incident and instead chooses to examine the gun issue from a much broader overview. He asks why Americans love their guns so much and then in a part that I found brilliant, he then examines Canada, the United Kingdom and even Germany and compared their ultra-low gun deaths to the explosive number of gun deaths in the USA.But you ultimately know where the movie is headed. You know that everything is ultimately pointing to a showdown between Moore and Charlton Heston, and finally they meet (although it doesn't last long). When Heston runs out of stock answers and glib excuses and realises Moore knows his stuff, the NRA lackey runs away.This is a movie that should be seen by EVERYONE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i found this provocative documentary very interesting and enlightening. it covers the Columbine tragedy in which on the 20th April 1999 two of its high school students came to school carrying some serious ammunition and started shooting everybody.it shows us how this tragic event affected the United States, what it changed or did not change.it also tries to answer the question of what makes America the free country with the most murders by guns per year in the whole world.i personally don't remember any documentary or any film in general that caused such hysteria as Bowling For Columbine did, i don't remember any Director being so straight forward in touching such delicate issues as Michael Moore does here and for that i solute him.but, this is a kind of story in which you are obligated when talking about to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.it seems as if Michael Moore picked one side of the story, the more juicy one, sticked with it and didn't let nothing in the film raise anything against his opinions.still, this is one documentary that is very entertaining and therefor i recommend this to everyone, you really don't have to be a documentary fan in order to enjoy Bowling For Columbine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore isn't a subtle film-maker,fair enough.But isn't that necessary sometimes,to scream out your point?Especially when society is so numbed by violence in media that it has become normal. In "Bowling for Columbine" Michael Moore explores the American fascination for weapons,violence and the "right to protect",yourself,your property,your opinion;with violence if necessary. Victims of random violence and their families are given a voice.For an European like myself,a fascination not so easy to understand at first,as we don't have a "weapon culture" here.But we also have a somewhat different society.But now that we have settled the fact that weapons and hand-guns in the hands of regular citizens are way more common in the US than in Europe(for instance),we need to try to figure out why. Michael Moore often blame the media for spreading the word of fear around like a gospel(fear of the unknown,fear of strangers,fear of the different)-and he may be right.Partially,at least.Michael Moore is a honest,good-hearted man who make people listen(even the reluctant),I admire that. His methods are sometimes very brutal,but few will be untouched by his message.If you can think for yourself,you won't be disturbed by the fact that he is somewhat biased.And what price are we willing to pay for security;conformity?Do we really have to assume that all goth-teens are presumably violent? Do we really have to be so afraid and defensive?Try to overlook his political opinions if you dislike them,he deserve to be listened to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A full review of this movie should discuss whether it is true to the facts, but many others have done so, on and off IMDb, much better than I can. In any case, one should never go to a political documentary hoping to learn The Truth. I am particularly skeptical about Michael Moore because I remember him stating, in "Roger and Me", that General Motors was making "huge profits" in the 1980s. (That does not mean that everything Moore says is wrong).Leaving facts aside, I shall focus on two other issues. The first is that it is wrong to say that this movie is anti-gun: it is anti-anything that Moore doesn't like. That includes, but is not limited to, big corporations, the media, and American intervention abroad. Moore even tries to blame violence on the media's obsession with violence; which, taken to its logical conclusion, implies that he should blame violence on his own documentary.Arguably, the broad range of targets makes it a better movie: if Moore had only one target, he would have presented only one side of the argument. The drawback is that the viewer can get any message he or she wants to get. At least, this is the impression that I get from the IMDb reviews.The other issue that I want to discuss is related to the opening sentence of the movie: "It was the morning of April 20th 1999 (...) The President bombed another country whose name we couldn't pronounce." A minimally-educated European will be reminded of Neville Chamberlain saying: "How horrible, fantastic, incredible, it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing."As I said, American intervention is, in fact, one of the targets of this movie; but Moore does not discuss in detail any specific war, possibly because he could not pronounce the name of any of the countries. The reason Moore is opposed to these wars is that he thinks they have created a culture of violence within the USA. The evidence that he offers for this claim is that Marilyn Manson also thinks so.So Michael Moore reveals himself: not a new Riefenstahl or a new Goebbels, as some people claim, but a new Chamberlain. Michael Moore wants peace for our time. We foreigners can kill each other without restraint: Michael Moore won't make documentaries about it, unless we live in countries with names easy to pronounce.Actually, the comparison to Chamberlain is not entirely appropriate: Neville Chamberlain was an elected leader, and his policy of appeasement had the full backing of the British people, who are collectively to blame for the failure of appeasement. Moore, needless to say, does not have the full backing of American people.Incidentally, Moore does not mention Chamberlain in the movie, but he does mention Gandhi, during the Charlton Heston interview. However, it would seem that Moore has no clear idea of what Gandhi actually accomplished.While my comments range from the sarcastic to the scathing, I did find the movie quite entertaining, and it introduced me to some interesting characters, James Nichols for example. People who have read this review up to here will probably look at the movie critically, and therefore I can recommend it to them (except if they don't want to finance Michael Moore, of course). Unfortunately, it is more likely to be seen by people who would stop reading at the first negative comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a misinformed movie this is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is all one sided propaganda. When he said that only rich people eat fudge at the fudge store that was a bunch of baloney. You think that only rich people eat fudge? It looks like Micheal Moore has not missed a meal in a long long time. He probably has eaten meals at places that hire employees the exact way that fudge factory does. We can't know every employers hiring process.This documentary is so one sided all it shows is a view from the extreme left. Why didn't he go to the streets of Los Angeles and ask gang members about this issue. He would have learned way more facts about guns and violence than he could ever learn by going to Charlton Hestons house. The fact that he put Heston in that position was completely uncalled for. He tried to make it Heston's responsibility to ban guns. He also made it seem that Heston is a bad person because he has certain views. All I have to say is that this movie distorts the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmm, I don't know...??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have just watched it through. Michael Moore appears honest and focused, but he kind of lacks the forthright, 'in yer face' approach, that could possibly have done this film/documentary "more" justice. (pardon the pun!)He is sympathetic, empathetic and generally genial to those who spin in his sphere, but I do feel his reservation at going for the jugular inhibits much of his intent. For example, the only sense that we receive that his teeth are unfurled, comes in the dying moments when his reverence for an American Icon dissipate, and he tackles Heston 'front on'. By this time, although I'm punching the air, I do feel that other, less 'important' individuals, have been given short shrift. Obviously I'm not privileged to the cutting room floor, but I do feel somewhat cheated at not having this probation earlier on. Wal-Mart appeared a triumph, but a phyrric one, almost designed to get maximum media coverage at the expense of the victims who stood in Moore's shadow. The documentary lacks symmetry and continuity in this respect. In the final analysis, we applaud the making, and that, in itself, is a success; we are left to question the antics of the NRA and the effects upon the American public, we constantly are reminded of the global possession of firearms...but do we come away any the wiser? America has a problem, granted, but to hear this in several forms, over 150 minutes, does not provide an answer. 'Street-wise' individuals may re-enforce our already held beliefs, but we require deeper insight if we are to look for a way forward and not sit back, tut-tutting at what we already know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bowling for columbineAs the early reviews of F.9/11 started to come in we heard many times that this was a more subdued Moore that he had toned down for the subject matter. After re-watching BFC I would have to say this was true of this film as well. While conservative pundits and the insane people who think Bush actually did a good job will try to discredit Moore at every turn- don't believe it.I don't always agree with Moore, his views on Fast food, mumia and faith in the American public seem misguided. As a Gun owner I don't feel threatened by this film. Moore asks important questions about American insanity.I feel he is not wanting to look at the real reason behind the insanity Free market capitalism and American imperialism. Sure he touches on it but perhaps that is another film.This last time I found the fact that Marilyn Mason had better come to grips with school shootings than just about anyone else was interesting. No one blamed /Clinton and his use of Violence. Violent video games, films and music are in all these countries with less gun violence.America is the one with the gun violence?it is also the one with the violent foreign policy track record going back?oh since the country existed. America is the one with the biggest gap between the rich and poor, with the least insured in the first world. Important questions.Al Franken said something important about the difference between liberals and conservatives it can be seen in the reaction to this film and Moore's other work. Conservatives love America like a 4 year loves it's mommy. Liberals love America like an adult. Willing to look at it's problems. Well I am no liberal, and I hate conservatives. That makes me radical that is glad at least Moore gets the issues on the table.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have heard of this film for quite a while and I have to admit I avoided watching it. I live within an hour of Columbine high school and that day is not a day I care to re-visit. But when I finally did see the movie, Bowling For Columbine I was astonished. I was astonishes at the abuse of power that goes on exclusively in our country. Bowling For Columbine was delicately made by Michael Moore. Although we all know his views are far from neutral, he charades as a middle-of-the-road kind of guy while conducting hilarious interviews with Terry Nichols and bomb exploiting teens. Moore almost puts his interviewees at ease with his sloppy appearance and casual attitude. It was almost unbearable to watch the actual footage of the library during the massacre, unbearable but important. I like many other Americans find it easy to turn my head on issues such as gun violence but Moore makes that impossible by shoving it in your face. The experience was painful and entertaining at the same time. Moore's cartoon skit that slammed Americas history of unreasonable fear was hilarious. Tactics such as that cartoon is what makes Moore a documentary genius, instead of coming out himself and slamming Americans, he uses cartoon bullets. Who can blame them, they are just cute little bullets telling the truth? To anyone out there that is afraid to watch this movie, I encourage you to go outside your comfort zone and watch this visual masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a US Citizen and, like the rest of the world, i sometimes struggle to understand elements of US society as, I suspect, many US citizens do as well. This film is not the final authority on this subject but it is an important series of clues that lead the viewer to finding a few more potential pieces of the complex jigsaw that is the USA. Noamh Chomsky cautions against the manufacturing of consent and like any film with bias this is possible, Michael Moore does not make unbiased documentaries, nor does he pretend to, however he does at least, use facts which are verifiable thus allowing the viewer to deduce there own conclusions as well as considering Moore's. I particularly liked the piece with Charlton Heston, the president and chief advocate general of the National Rifle Association. Heston never really stood a chance but then he seems to have a fondness for hopelessly heroic, morally ambiguous, positions so he put himself in the line of fire (Pun Intended) and no one should feel sorry for him at all.I have eventually become used to the US style of documentary which seems to take a quarter of the information delivered in a UK documentary and make it fit into four times the space. I am not sure why this is, maybe US documentary film makers believe that that's all their audience can or will stand or maybe they believe that the subject needs to be explained repeatedly throughout to ensure understanding. Regardless, I felt that the film was a little simplistic at times and too long but this was maybe due to being used to a higher pace of information delivery. In the films defence it was, obviously, aimed deliberately to appeal to the widest possible audience and as such my few negative comments may not be justified.On the whole I consider the film to well made, entertaining, thought provoking, well researched and presented. I recommend this film to anyone and everyone be they US citizens or not.The real strength of this film was not just the answers it suggested but questions it asked.</fullReview>

Watch this movie. It attempts, with twisted humor and sorrow, to answer why there are so many tragic deaths in America, whereas in other first-world countries, deaths by shooting are next to nil by comparison.The story of America's fascination with guns is told by Michael Moore.Get a free gun when you open a bank account? The National Rifle Association holds a seminar a week after the Columbine incident? 17 cents a bullet? Other topics are brought up to try and understand and isolate the problem as Moore talks with various celebrities and locals about what can be done to help the United States. Stock footage of 'Chris Rock: Bigger &amp; Blacker,' is shown with a good answer to the problem but this movie altogether has a good idea addressing what's wrong from gun accessibility to fear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think "Spinal Tap" was a more meaningful documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>{this entire review is a spoiler alert) Michael Moore is so hypocritical it is hilarious.He tries to shock you into thinking the facts he said are not biased- but any film (actually, this is much more of a movie than a film) that claims that violence in America spawns from White jealousy of the Black race is simply trying to get a rise out of the viewer. His point about the show "Cops" being racist is simply not true- if you watch the show for long enough you quickly find that there is no executive producer behind the scenes intentionally picking out black people- all races and genders are equally represented in the show. It is just Moore using opinion and not facts to support an opinion, which is circular reasoning by definition.His points regarding Charleston Heston's inappropriate timing in scheduling meetings are understood- to an extent. But any American knows that our country is situated in freedom, not sympathy. While Heston's timing of the NRA meetings was obviously distasteful, it nonetheless was him trying to preserve his second amendment right. When Ice- T sings a song called "Cop Killer" that is temporarily banned, a man like Micheal Moore will surely be the first there to cry and protest such censorship (even if several Police officers die as a direct result of the song). Saying that however, he seems to feel that the 1st Amendment is more important than 2nd amendment- a sentiment that is a matter of opinion, not fact (There is no where in the Constitution that lists the order of importance of rights). Ice- T's "Cop Killer" should be protected in my book, but so should Heston's ability to congregate and to articulate his desire for a 2nd amendment right. I realize Moore's right to protest Heston is HIS 1st amendment right- it is just that his argument quickly becomes hypocritical and thus hollow.Michael Moore is obviously a man of high intelligence and a strong sense of self and country. For this I respect him. But the only real conclusion I could achieve from his argument was that he wanted to live in Canada- a place where guns and a low death rate run free. But, after watching "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" recently, I quickly came to realize my issue with Moore's argument. Leone's classic disapproves of violence by exploiting it and the people it possesses- Moore simply passes his opinion as fact- something that is protected by our Constitution, but shunned by any rational intellectual.I think Moore's most blatant (and simple) example of manipulation was when he was standing out in Compton, arguing that there was nothing to fear. Mr. Moore, if you walked into downtown Compton at night, without a camera crew, I can almost guarantee you your tone would not be so annoyingly confident.At least "Lick My Love Pump" by Nigel in "Spinal Tap" was honest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Savae Cycle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jessica Kruse Emily M. Liebman English 102 03/03/04The Savage Cycle The movie Bowling for Columbine is an attempt by its filmmaker-activist Michael Moore to pry open the frightened eyes of Americans in order to reveal the source from which gun violence emanates. While in pursuit of an explanation, Michael compares U.S. factors such as history of violence, gun availability, violence in the media and ethnicity to those of several other countries, revealing many similarities. Yet, no other country reports a shockingly high crime rate comparable to the U.S. With unsatisfactory results from statistical comparison Michael is forced to further examine the American psyche, revealing fear as the motive of action, resulting in more fear. As the savage cycle continues and is spread through the media, corporate and political America enables more individuals access to guns, fueling the economy in the self-destructive process. Through the use of sarcasm, contrasting images, and striking social examples, Moore successfully rips the white wash from our country's history revealing the bloody truth - making me scared and ashamed to be an American.In the opening scene Moore receives a free gun for opening an account with a bank in his home state Michigan offering `more bang for your buck'. After humoring their vague questioning and background check he then asks, `don't you think it is a bit dangerous handing out guns at a bank?' This question directly addresses and recognizes our country's sad economical state, foolishly rewarding currency with tools of violence. Next, Moore visits the Michigan militia to interview James Nichols the brother of Terry Nichols who with the help of Timothy McVeigh bombed the Oklahoma government building killing one hundred sixty-eight innocent people. James Nichols casually shows Moore around his farm proudly explaining that his produce is one hundred percent natural and safe for consumers. Nichols then displays unstable mentality by cocking his pistol and raising it to his temple exclaiming no one can tell him he can't have his gun kept safely loaded beneath his pillow. When asked if all Americans should have atomic bombs at their disposal Nichols replies `no way, there's a bunch of nuts out there'. Our attention is then drawn to the massacre of twelve students and one teacher at Columbine High School in Little, Colorado where the schools mascot is the Rebel displaying a soldier carrying a gun. With Lockheed Martin the largest U.S. bomb manufacturer's headquarters employing most of Littleton's residence, the company's motto states `we are Columbine' and rightfully so, as the children of this town are brought up admiring the production of weapons and their use. As a result of these conditions a victim's father emotionally pleads, `something is wrong here, lets do something about it'. Moore now asks, `What is wrong with America?' Excessive media coverage of the Columbine Shooting shouts accusations in all directions blaming violent American history, entertainment, musicians and the `breakdown of the American family structure' for the contaminated minds of violent youth. Moore then shares a brief insight to our bloody American history mocking prejudicial fear traced from our founding four fathers trough slavery and repression to our current Iraq situation. Our casualty cluttered heritage is further exploited as dark bloody images of our history's victims are paraded in celebration of our all mighty power to the song of Ray Charles's What a Wonderful World, creating ironically morbid eye opener. Now having convinced his audience that our haunting past lives in the present, Moore decides to remind us of Germany's Nazi camps, Japan's invasion of China, and the British ruling do to use of guns. Still, The United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada, Australia and Japan's murder rates combined equaled 973 compared with 11,127 in the United States. The question then arose; maybe America just has more guns than those countries. Unfortunately, that was not the answer; as of Canada's ten million families there are seven million guns. After interviewing several teenage boys in Canada Moore found that people there tend to watch just as many violent movies as do Americans, yet still return home at night leaving their doors unlocked as they retire for the evening. While sitting at a Canadian bar contemplating the vast differences of Windsor's ethnically diverse community versus Detroit's just across the river, Moore focuses on Canadian evening news discussing new speed bumps added to the streets rather than several shootings as found on U.S. television. After reviewing many recent stories covered in U.S. media such as Y2k, razors in Halloween candy apples, animal attacks and the migration of deadly African Bees, the message is clear. As Marilyn Manson had claimed in his interview with Moore `if the media keeps everyone afraid, they'll consume'. A police officer interviewed, states that although crime rates had consistently dropped 30% within the last 5 years that media coverage had increased over 600% causing viewers to feel safer at home watching the news rather then venturing forth from their locked doors. When a news cameraman in Hollywood was asked if he would choose a story of a shooting over a near drowning he confirmed that shootings are sought as audience attention grabbers. When a couple of Canadian kids were asked why Canadians were not as violent as Americans they responded that `we are not pumped full of fear like they are in the U.S.'. And here it is, in Michael Moore's self glamorizing attempt to discover the cause of our self-destruction he himself contributes to the source filling fear in the open minds of content American viewers such as myself with brutal visions of hatred. Yes, I agree with Michael's closing thought, `It is a glorious time to be an American'.Works Cited Bowling for Columbine. Writ. Michael Moore.Prod. Michael Moore. 2002</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this documentary by Michael Moore. First off I'm not a big Michael Moore fan, but am interested in the Gun Control issue. Documentary wise the movie is ok, it does tend to present only one side, but that is what I expected it to do anyway. Actually before watching this movie I supported removing Guns from America, but after watching it I can't say that that is the answer. Fear seems to be our problem, not too many guns. Anyway you can get that from the movie. Bowling for Columbine is over all a decent film. It is perhaps a little long, but that is why they invented fast forward buttons. Bowling for Columbine is worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine is arguably one of the best stand-alone documentaries I've seen in some time. Extremely well done and thorough, makes you open your eyes a bit, let you know what's going on in our own lil world over here in America.....stuff everyone should know. Factoids, mainly, presented in an informative, paced, and surprisingly not boring way. You'll come out of the film knowin' a bit more than you did before, and that's a good thing, not to mention the intention of such documentaries.However.....Michael Moore as a person bugs me on occasion in this film. There's a fine line between being powerful and being downright sappy and cheesy. He goes back and forth on this one and ultimately....well, you can guess how it is overall. Some parts, to me, was just rude. I totally understand why he says/does the things he says/does, but just because it's understood doesn't make it justified. Moore is fairly quick to point fingers and throw around statistics, but as we all know, there's two sides to every coin and statistics are VERY, VERY, VERY open to interpretation.People seem to have this mindset that you can't appreciate a director's (or any artist's at that) work unless you TOTALLY dig them FULL ON. Well, no. Like I mentioned before, it is excellent as a documentary, but MM is not so jammin' as a person. Sort of like Puff Daddy: excellent businessman, but he's a goober.If you're still debating about watching it, you're probably asking "is it overhyped?" I'd say no, not at all. But, if you asked if Michael Moore is overhyped, I'd say there's plenty of room to consider that possibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8.7, 20,000 votes? Where is it on the list?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was astounded by the score that this movie has achieved, which rates the film in the top 20 at least, but makes no entry in the top 250 list.The contrast between humourous anecdotes/satire(The South Park-esque "A Brief History of America") and the harsh reality of murdered children and shattered lives is justified to bring the devastation of what happens in America in this day and age.I couldn't help thinking that this film came off the rails a bit when it started to seem like a commentary on the general culture of the US instead of the gun culture documentary that it is. We have seen most of this in Moore's previous documentaries and books ("The Big One" and "Stupid White Men" for instance).Despite this, Bowling for Columbine is a documentary of true quality, which is the kick up the ass that America needs. I may not agree with everything that Michael Moore stands for, but the basic message of the documentary got to me. Things need to change in the US to stop more of these tragedies occurring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern satirist ---POSSIBLE SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Michael Moore's "Bowling for Columbine" is hardly a balanced account, and I'd be worried about anyone who was swayed by its arguments, I found it to be a funny and profound condemnation of America's obsession with guns. Some of Moore's assertions are a little trite and easy, but he does provide a disturbing satire on American gun culture. This is one of those rare cases where a film deserving of an Oscar actually won the award. Moore himself, I might add, comes across as an intelligent, likeable, and articulate individual.Reasoned arguments do not make good movies, which rely on relatively simple arguments joined with evocations of strong emotions. Moore does make effective use of such techniques, but his arguments could actually have been a little stronger. The viewer is made cognizant of much of the folly, cruelty, insensitivity, and general stupidity behind America's love of guns. The director's sense of humor, inspired choices of interviewees, and general wittiness mark him as a talented satirist.Some of Moore's assertions do weaken the general impact of the film. He appears to blame gun violence in America largely on whites' fears of blacks and on media manipulation of those fears. As an American living in England, I can say that the local television news in American is more sensational and exploitative than television in the UK, but it is different in degree, not in kind. The media in the UK can be pretty bad, and newspapers here are often far worse than newspapers in the US. Consequently, Moore's argument does not work. His assertions that racist fears have fueled America's obsession with guns is no more convincing. While such fears have undoubtedly played a part in that obsession, the situation is surely more complex, and a cartoon version of American history, like that Moore gives in his film, does not prove his argument. It is funny though. His explorations of historical reasons are a distraction. Those reasons are simply too complex to present in a work like this, and Moore's simplifications distract him from his main target.I was also troubled by some factual manipulation. For example, Moore provides us with the number of murders committed by guns in the US and the much lower numbers committed in other wealthy democracies. While the disproportionate numbers are frightening, they give no indication that violence is more pervasive in the US than in the other countries. In order to say that violence is more pervasive in the US, the total number of murders (expressed as ratios to the populations of the countries) would have had to be presented, whether they are committed with guns or with other weapons. If the total murder rates were then similar in the US and the other democracies, many of Moore's conclusions just would not hold. I suspect that the US is a relatively more violent society, but that suspicion is hardly proof I could use in an argument. A more thorough examination of the facts would have helped to make the director's assertions more convincing.These faults do not, however, greatly detract from the impact of the movie.The viewer should be aware that "Bowling for Columbine" is not a "factual" documentary. It is a satire. This should not deter anyone from viewing it, however. It is well made, effective, funny, and profoundly disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a wonderful World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moore uses far too much satire in this film and a great example of this was his use of the song, "what a wonderful world." We all know what he was hinting at, but honestly, does he really need to be sarcastic throughout the whole movie? It does tend to become annoying. This movie was based on everything that he believes about America and his opinions. Some opinions should just be kept to yourself. I agree with much of what he says, but the way he portrayed everything made him look hypocritical. He's a member of the NRA, but yet he thinks it's not right to own a gun? He laughs at the people who have loaded guns in their home, but he knows darn well that he has a loaded gun in his home has well, so what makes him so different than the rest of us? He thinks he's the only one who doesn't fear in our country and he thinks Canada is so much different than America just because in the middle of the day when the people are home they don't have their doors locked. Wow, that's a lot to base things on. Plus, he was wrong about the killer bees, they did actually did enter Texas. Maybe he should do a little more research. All and all, I think it was poorly arranged and far too stereotypical. Though i did enjoy the cartoon, it was quite funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of 2002-2003!! Definetly the best documentary i've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentaries are perhaps the most overlooked movies out there. Most of them are considered just as interesting and exciting as spending an hour at school. Well this is neither boring or dull and it manages to be interesting, watchable by everyone while effectively dealing with a very serious subject: gun possession and murders in USA. The film itself, as suggested by the title, is mainly about the Columbine High School Massacre. It tries to explain who is responsible for that tragedy and why a large part of the American population owns guns. The film moves in an excellent and very original pace ,for a documentary, it goes from hilarious to shocking, then depressing, then hillarious again and so on and so forth. Michael Moore examines every aspect of the problem, from America's history and the Wars that America has been, directly or indirectly, involved in to the influence of rock music and Marylin Manson who ,very much to my surprise, speaks very logically like a very sensible man, ditching his monster of rock persona (but not the make-up). Also worth of note is a short film by Mat Stone and Trey Parker about America's history. The main question that Moore poses throughout the film is why the USA has such so many shooting victims when other countries that have an equally if more blood-filled history (Germany and Britain are stated as examples), similar social problems like unemployment and poverty have significantly smaller numbers of shooting victims. Although a direct answer is not given, several factors are hinted, like the fact the governement it self with the wars that it wages promotes gun violence and violence in general. The biggest problem is, according to Moore, fear. Fear which is caused by the media and their constant coverage of violence making the people afraid of their own neihbors. Towards the end of the film we get to see Moore as an activist as we see his and two Columbine survivors' (successful in the end) effort to make Wal Mart ban the sale of guns and ammo. The film ends with Moore ridiculing the president of the NRA, Charlton Heston. In conclusion, this is a very enlightening and moving documentary about a very serious problem. No matter what you thing about gun possession you have to have a look at it. Could be the best film of the year. 10/10</fullReview>

And even though Michael Moore probably edits to his benefit and displays thing from his preceptive and not much else, that doesn't make the movie bad. There are very few documentaries that are truly objective, if there are any at all. Documentaries will always be shaped by the people that make them. So don't use that as an excuse to put the film down or to justify yourselves. And about the dispute of the facts in the movie, check it out for yourselves. I did. It's accurate, even though it's presented in a pretty dramatic way.I live in Sweden, and we don't have the same problems as the US. But this still was a real eye-opener.</fullReview>

Unfortunately for those individuals, theres Michael Moore there to uncover the lies. This time around Moore tackles the NRA and gun ownership in America. Some of the things presented in this movie are horrifying. Anyone who cares about their country, and where its heading should see this film. A lot of the past reviews on here have accused Michael Moore of lying, and using sly editing to get his point across. Don't listen to it. It's just the "gun nuts" who are afraid of their dirty little secrets coming out. They did not review the film fairly, they simply don't feel the same way Moore does and they trash him for it, which is VERY immature. Educate yourselves and see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the point again?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moore does a masterful job of manipulation through out the film. Of course it's easy to see why the anti gun people would love this, but he also manages to get others thinking "hmmm, yeah.... I wonder why?" He uses a lot of misinformation and the occasional heart breaker to do it, but when you're watching something on film or on the news, be aware of your state of mind because they can mesmerize you. The reason why this film leaves many questioning their views is because there is a dichotomy in his own mind that he doesn't understand or know it exists. *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS**********Moores ultimate quest is to find out exactly why Americans kill each other with guns while other countries which he tries to compare to the U.S. don't. As the film unfolds, it becomes clear that he believes it's the Governments fault in one way or another which I don't necessarily disagree with. But he makes a point to make fun of some of the second Amendment advocates and through the whole film he shows his anti gun stance. What I don't get is, if the Government is so bad, then why on earth would you want to take guns away from the citizens? As many second amendment advocates claim, the right to bear arms is to protect yourself from an over bearing government.There were some great parts to this, and I did like it if only for the way Moore manipulated people who watched it. For example, he goes to Canada and mentions they have a 17% ethnic(?) population and while he's saying it, we see black people walking by the camera. The obvious point he's trying to make is that Canada is just like America in terms of ethnic diversity. Nothing could be further than the truth. 17%? If you're assuming Caucasian as the majority in the U.S., I think it's closer to 50% or higher.And aside from the manipulative efforts and un truths, I would have like it if he had mentioned things like even though 11,000 people have been killed by guns in the US, 175 million people world wide have been killed by Governments who's citizens were not allowed to bear arms and that Hitler was the first Government leader to require that fire arms be registered. We all know now that it was in order to seek out those with weapons, take them away and start the Nazi party. I'm no gun slinging Militia guy, but a good documentary presents both sides of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This left me puzzled... (spoilers, I guess)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's Academy Award winning documentary "Bowling For Columbine" was very entertaining, but also leaves lots of unanswered questions. We never really find out about why there are more homicides in the U.S., what causes them, or what can be done about them. Once again, Moore takes the government to task as the reason, yet omits other factors like Hollywood. Honestly, I've never thought that video games, Hollywood, music, or the Government were reasons for all these murders, but Moore continues to blame the usual suspect (George W. Bush).I think it's a difficult question to answer; I just think that the U.S. lives in a sea of sensationalism. They love to make a big deal out of one small incident. If one man gets bitten by a single solitary snake, that means everyone in the town had better be ready to fend of an "army" of snakes. The media is in love with its power to control the people and they can never lose the power to put fear into the people of America. They can exploit that control without any penalty. Therefore, every incident in America is played big, as if Columbine could happen anywhere in the U.S., when it reality it's an isolated incident. Most Americans I know who live here in Canada just shrug it off and say that that's the American way; that's how they blow up the stories. It's just difficult to explain; I've always felt the U.S. is more powerful and influential than all the other countries in the world combined and they have a different way of doing things. When you rule the world, there's no right or wrong.Still, the film is pretty honest and he does make some good facts but this is from a leftist's point of view. I'd like to see a right-winger's side of the story. It will hold your interest, as Moore's blind-side style of questioning is quite entertaining, but if you're expecting an answer for why America is obsessed with guns then keep looking.</fullReview>

This is why." And that's fine. I don't need to be spoon-fed anything. But his failure is in not convincing himself that he's learned anything. As a result, the whole experience fell flat.I wonder what kind of deadline he was working with, or what other pressure led him to ignore many more phenomena that might contribute to the rate of gun violence in the US. How about hypercompetitiveness, the urgency with which we are all living our lives, hypersensitivity and entitlement, etc..Ah well, maybe next time, Mr. Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't own a gun and hope I never feel the need to. This movie passed me by when it was in the theaters. I kept meaning to see it, but despite the hype I just never got around to it. I finally rented and watched it today. I read several of the user comments and tend to agree with a lot of what has been said. Although I felt Moore made a valiant effort in pointing out Americas obsession with guns, violence, and the fact that we have such an obscenely high murder rate in this country compared to other countries I don't understand the whole Kmart crusade or confrontation with Dick Clark. I would have really liked to have known more statistics and even though the film was very well done I felt it was missing a lot of factual information that might have shed some light. He speculated quite a bit but only pointed out what Is and not why this is.My own oppinion of this for what it's worth is that we as Americans have it all wrong. We seem to have everything we want, but no matter how much we have it is never enough. We focus on all the wrong things. We worship hollywood, celebrities, money, beauty, and image and feel that if we do not possess these things that our lives are empty and hollow. We seek out psychotherapy, drugs, alcohol, anything that will reduce the pain of our boring humdrum lives. We watch the news on tv and read the newspapers and every single story is sensationalizing murder, death, chaos and destruction and because we are in such a sorry mental state this stuff seeps into our hearts and minds and makes a real impression. Tell the CEO of coke a cola the what you see on tv or read in a newspaper doesn't have an influence on how you think or make decisions. Any marketing or advertising agency knows the truth. We are highly impressionable and what we see and read is filled with images of horror, image, destruction and that becomes part of our reality. That is what becomes accepted behavior, what is seen on tv.I have only been to Canada once and don't remember what was on television, although I would venture to guess that the news media there and any other country that has a low rate of murder and gun violence does not inundate their citizens with this kind of negative crap every day and night.This movie had an effect on me. There is so much violence and despair in the world sometimes I just feel like giving up on life myself. It's just too depressing, but I try to rise above it, ignore the terrible stories in the newspaper and not make talking about car accidents on the side of te road topic of interesting converstation and capitalizing on other peoples grief and horror.I think we as Americans, as humans need to try and focus on what is good, decent and positive and if we do so collectively the world will be a better place.</fullReview>

And my heart goes out to those kids who were at school during the shooting at Columbine. They are brave souls. Which is in sharp contrast to the celebrities interviewed who were real creeps.I really hope all Americans watch this and take it to heart.

		<fullReview>`If more guns made people safer, then America would be one of the safest countries in the world.'This statement, uttered midway through the film by a Canadian citizen, serves pretty much as the guiding thesis for `Bowling For Columbine,' the amazing, eye-opening `dissertation' by Michael Moore, which won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature of 2002. Moore, the well-known left-wing tub-thumper and self-appointed thorn-in-the-side of the American conservative establishment, is clearly a man on a mission. He wants to figure out why exactly it is that Americans seem to have a running love affair with violence and guns. Moore takes on Charlton Heston, the NRA (of which Moore claims to be a member), the news media, and the overall culture of paranoia and fear that seems to hold Americans in its grasp. The director views the Columbine High School shootings in 1999 as the symptom rather than the cause of the problem, the inevitable tragic outcome of a munitions-obsessed culture.Anybody turning to this film for a `fair' and `unbiased' study of the problem certainly does not know much about Michael Moore and the kind of movies he makes. Moore is upfront and utterly unapologetic about his own left-leaning sympathies and the film will assuredly outrage many on the opposing side of the issue. Yet one thing that even Moore's greatest detractors will have to admit is that he is definitely a man of passion, an individual who sees a problem in the world and who pools his resources and skills as a documentarian to help awaken public consciousness and, thereby, prompt reasonable-thinking people to come up with a solution.Perhaps, the most astonishing thing about `Bowling For Columbine' is just how funny so much of it turns out to be. Though basically a jeremiad, Moore's film still manages to find humor in the mind-bending absurdity and jaw-dropping irony of so much of what we see on screen. Moore is an amazing satirist, yet in many cases all he has to do is to let the people and situations speak for themselves in order to achieve his laughs. For instance, he starts off his film answering an ad from a bank (of all places!) that offers its customers a gun for opening up a new account. No fictional satirist could come up with better material than that. Why press your issues when your subjects are doing such a fine job of it for you? From that point on, Moore is off and running, taking swipes at not just the NRA but at the defense industry, the Clinton and Bush administrations, welfare reform, and shows like `COPS,' which Moore sees as exploiting and enhancing Americans' irrational fear of crime and people of color. In some ways, these are the weakest sections of the film, perhaps because Moore seems to be casting his net a bit too widely, muddling his message and making assumptions that sometimes seem unwarranted and overly simplistic. One appreciates his attempt to come up with some possible wider answers, but, frankly, he is at his most compelling when - for lack of a better phrase - he keeps the gun industry and those who support it clearly in his sights.Still, Moore makes a compelling case for much of what he is implying in this film - that the culture of violence is all-encompassing in this nation and that incidents like Columbine are just small pieces in an overall much larger picture. Sure there are those who will accuse Moore of being `un-American,' of always trying to cast the United States in the worst possible light, of even, perhaps, giving `aid and comfort' to the nation's enemies. Yet, isn't this what a healthy free society needs - someone who is willing to point out a nation's shortcomings in the hope of making it a better place in which to live? It seems to me we need more Moore's - on both the left and the right - to help keep the powers-that-be honest and connected to the concerns of ordinary people.Alternately hilarious and horrifying, harrowing and heartbreaking, `Bowling For Columbine' will make you cry one moment and laugh the next. Moore is a man in total control of his medium, his message, even, perhaps, his audience. That might be a scary, dangerous thought if you happen to find yourself on the opposite side of the issue from Moore. After all, one man's `truth' can be another man's `propaganda.' All I can suggest is that, regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall on, give the man a fair hearing. The right should be so lucky as to have a filmmaker of Mr. Moore's caliber and skill on its team. Perhaps some day it will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was horrendous. First of all, there were so many factual inaccuracies in the movie. Take the brief history of the United States cartoon, for example. Moore chooses to neglect the fact that the Pilgrims got along perfectly with the Natives for a very long time. Then he goes on to point out that Americans were "afraid to work" and that's how slavery started. Don't be mistaken, I do not condone slavery, but the Americans were simply following the example set by all of Europe, who had been slave trading much longer than the US had. Do I have to mention how he poorly correlated the KKK to the NRA (a group he supposedly belongs to).Let's step away from the cartoon. I was wondering if anyone else had caught Moore's (not so) subtle, but feeble attempt at connecting the Africanized Bees to Black people in America committing crime. I think Moore painted a picture that the bees were a result of black people, but that might just be because of the horrible segue between the two sections. What is Moore trying to prove in the whole K-Mart section? What is he trying to accomplish, that he can bother people to the point where they just give up? They didn't score a huge victory, if any victory at all, because people are just gonna go to their nearest Wal-Mart store to pick up their ammo. The only thing Moore did was hurt K-Mart's revenue, because K-Mart "shot those kids". Wrong answer, Moore; you can't harass the sellers of the bullet. That's like shooting the messenger. And finally, did anyone else notice that all of the people who wrote commentaries supporting Moore and his abomination of a movie had poor grammar and phonetic skills? I did. To me that shows that the people who think this movie was good really are not very educated, or are too young to see the propaganda that bleeds out of the ass of this film. If anyone who reads all of this commentary has anything of any substance to say to me, feel free to email me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE (2002) D: Michael Moore **1/2 Make no mistake, I think Michael Moore is a jerk who made a buffoon of himself at the Academy Awards, and tries to make idiots out of Americans here, too. Regardless of what I (don't) think of Moore personally, he has a semi-compelling documentary at work here, and that's something I will admit. This is an interesting enough piece of work, although if a tough conservative like Ted Nugent (whom Moore doesn't interview here, curiously) were to take a stab at a similar film, I'm sure the "facts" and "statistics" would be reversed. Such is the stupidity of politics. It's really only a matter of who is holding the camera, and how he edits his footage to suit his own agenda. So, as a liberal-based slant on America's obsession with guns, it works.Charlton Heston is the most severely disserviced here. His gun rally talks are edited and strewn about at the most inappropriate intervals, as if to suggest that the first thing he did the morning after the Columbine massacre was to gleefully make his infamous "from my cold dead hands" speech. Fact is, this was months later.Similarily, when Heston is kind enough to invite Moore to his home, the filmmaker (who boasts he's a good ol' fellow NRA member to gain admittance) continually asks the actor questions the man shouldn't be responsible to answer for ("why is there more violence in America?"). Heston's answers are frank, yet I'd love to see this entire 23 minute interview intact, as Moore is sure to have tampered with it to paint the picture he winds up with... For it turns out that Mr. Heston is made out to be a bumbling, clueless, heartless, evil racist. Even worse is that as the frail Heston attempts to walk away on his own property from this trickster, declaring the interview over, Moore continues to follow and hound him and lay a guilt trip on him by showing him a photo of a little girl who was a victim of gun abuse. Heston is filmed distantly from behind and "appears" to turn to look at the picture but then continues to walk away, disinterested. There is speculation on the internet that these sequences may have been faked, with Moore's substituting the shot of himself holding the photo afterward. I wouldn't doubt it. There would have to have been two cameramen at work, and it's clear that there is not one present by Heston in the shots where Heston walks away - so who was filming Moore from the front at this time?Moore's ultimate nerve at taking the liberty of placing the photo of the dead girl at Heston's home is more cruel and unforgivable than anything he tries to expose in his shockumentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a real shame that such a wonderful, hysterical documentary as "Bowling for Columbine" had to gradually sink to a level of infamy this past year - when, around the time it won its Oscar, reports surfaced that a good amount of footage, facts, and interviews were grossly manipulated. I have never seen any other previous works of Michael Moore, but have heard a great deal about the notoriously outspoken, leftist filmmaker who made "Roger &amp; Me" and "The Big One". Apparently he has quite the reputation for fabricating a lot of his material, and putting such shameless spins on certain subjects that it ends up ultimately alienating the viewer.However, as flawed as this film clearly is in some respects, one must give Mr. Moore a lot of credit for having the gusto to put together such a fascinating collage of biting social commentary - biased or not - on the U.S.' current obsessive state in gun culture and violence.Featuring an impressive number of different interviews and celebrity run-ins with the likes of rock icon Marilyn Manson, Matt Stone (the co-creator of TV's "South Park"), and NRA spokesman Charlton Heston, "Bowling for Columbine" is a constantly riveting, never boring, look into some subject matter that I don't think has ever been presented like this before. It's certainly a very powerful piece, and contains a lot of half-serious, half-amusing coverage on everything from American history to violent influential sources to Canada by comparison...and of course, to the film's centerpiece: the tragic massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado on April 20th, 1999. I admire Michael Moore very much for this inspired presentation, its creative interaction, and its bevy of interesting (albeit sometimes exaggerated) "facts" on various issues. Say what you will about its credibility now, but there's no denying that this man can make a film with a rich scope and a thought-provoking atmosphere. Always a ripe topic for discussion, "Bowling for Columbine" is a flawed masterpiece of voyeuristic filmmaking, and undoubtedly one of the funniest, saddest, and most heart-wrenching pictures I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the film was fine. I'm even OK with its falsity as a documentary. We live in a nation where plenty of scrutiny is applied to everything, and what's "fake" in "BFC" has been well documented by now. (Pity it beat a really "real" documentary, "Spellbound," for the Oscar, but no way Hollywood wasn't giving Moore his props.) Moore makes a whole bunch of cases for a whole bunch of rather predictable positions (gun control, America as warmonger, our "violent" history as a nation), but then seems to turn back on himself, continually asking: Why? (re: all these gun deaths in America) and not quite having the answer himself.The questions:1. How do the gun deaths in America break down by region? Mainly in big cities? Mainly in the ghetto? Or mainly in the suburbs? (Moore is at pains to have the Flint D.A. suggest guns are a suburban problem near Detroit.) Is it a nation-wide problem or confined to particular states (California? New York? Texas?) Is "America" gun-crazy, or just particular regions?2. Why did gun control backfire as an issue for the Democrats in the 2000 election? (Aside from the Florida outcome, it has been said somewhere that Gore lost some states he was supposed to win because of his gun control positions.) In short, is Moore on the wrong side of this issue with Democrats as well as Republicans?3. Where did Moore get those HORRIFYING shots of real-life gun deaths? (I'm familiar with two: a Pennsylvania official accused of corruption who called a press conference and shot himself in front of reporters, and a man who shot himself on an L.A. freeway.) And exactly what was the point of showing those scenes?The rest, I leave to the public debate. Hardly a fair film, but one of the kind our nation always needs to see.P.S. Seems to me that the 60's were far more violent in America than now. Any stats?P.P.S. Moore's claim that Bush is a "fictitious President" may be argued on the Florida results, but NOT on the fact that Gore got a million + more popular votes. The Electoral College was designed to allow for exactly that result (it just rarely happens.) So does Moore want to change the Electoral College?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Several inaccuracies have come to light about the information presented in this film. Moore himself has not denied them, so I assume they are true. Use your browser and you'll find more than enough info online.As what people call a left-winger myself, I sympathize with many of his concerns, but his use of many unethical techniques to sex up his claims is unacceptable and sadly no better than the media he rightly criticizes. As one example, he presents false evidence as to what is manufactured at a particular Lockheed factory. Seeing as would not be difficult to make legitimate and verifiable claims against the arms industry, the use of spurious evidence only cheapens what is a valid discussion and puts more noble campaigners at the risk of being ignored or dismissed out of hand.In an age where appearance and pathetic semantics ("I did not have sexual relations with that woman") is all, it is very disappointing to see a voice on the Left use spin instead of the many philosophical, moral, and humanistic arguments available. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that rather than encouraging debate and finding intelligent solutions to our problems, Moore's ultimate aim is sound-bites for self-promotion. Just like a politician....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director is brave and admirable.The movie tries to convince the audience that so many people get killed in US every year because US lacks a law of gun controlling. It provides some figures and analysis which sounds reasonable. The facts are well organized and edited. There are also quite a lot of humor and intense moments, which show the confrontation between the director and K-mart (for selling bullets which were used by the teenage killers in Columbine) and the chairman of NRA. In some sense it goes beyond documentary and is like a drama, but it is enjoyable.However, I think to reach the conclusion that lacking a law of gun controlling is the cause of so many people killed by guns, there is something more to do. Instead of comparing the number of people killed by guns in different countries, we should compare the rate of people murdered by guns to all people murdered. The conclusion may be the same, but it can exclude the possibility that so many people get killed because of high crime rate.It also discusses the "fears" in US, and has some deep insights. In overall this is an enlightening documentary and worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film last night at a post Oscar showing. I found it absolutely heart breaking. With its undisputable facts laying bare a startling (but to be honest, thus far suspected by many non-Americans) cross section of the American psyche, I was left numb and saddened.No one can deny America's achievements, and its theory of freedom and justice for its citizens is indeed a worthy, if never fully realised one. But freedom at what cost? Is freedom the right to own a gun? Yes, probably. But freedom is also the vastly more important right to live without fear of violence as a result of poor gun control. These are some of the issues that lie at the heart of Bowling for Columbine.What this film responsibly shows to the rest of the world watching is the most powerful nation on the planet as a country still very much in it's infancy. America is full of great ideas and promise, not least the movie industry which people from all over the world write about on these pages. But can America rise up above its relative immaturity as a nation and bravely take its fire arms out of its children's hands?This film makes its audience look closely at America, and more importantly, at Americans. Ultimately however, my hope would be that it could help make Americans look at each other and find a solution to a problem that they all have the power to solve.I haven't spoken in much detail about the film itself (e.g Michael Moore, presentation, editing, cameos), but rather I have tried to focus on it's message. I think the film delivers it's shocking message far better than any posting on Imdb ever could, so I urge anyone taking the time to read this to see this film and get the full story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad documentary, but very good agit-prop satire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to see this documentary arouse so much ire from the American pro-gun lobby - possibly those most fervent with criticism haven't seen it, as it extends much of the argument that the NRA itself puts forward: that guns themselves are not the problem. Yes, Moore plays a little fast and loose with the chronology and comparisons. OK, so Germany and Japan have hugely violent histories, but the violence was State violence, committed by governments against their own or foreign populations, not the citizen led "frontier" violence which is seen to make up so much of US history. Moreover Moore can be accused of resorting to the same hype and hysteria that he then berates the US media for indulging in.Moore works a lot on guilt by association - that Columbine and the bombing of Belgrade happened on the same day is only of symbolic importance. In the end, it's not really guns that Moore is after. He sees them as a symptom of the deeper problems that are his favourite targets - US foreign policy, the lack of an adequate welfare system, White America's mistreatment of its minorities, and corporate malfeasance and perniciousness.Moore's real heart and energy lies in issues like the failure of welfare to work schemes, which seems to take up a quarter of the film's running time, and the way big business has left the working classes to rot as they move out in search of cheaper foreign labour and a higher profit margin - pretty much the themes of Roger and Me and Downsize This. But he rightly knows that these are not hot-button issues. Guns are!Seen this way, it's no surprise that his critique of gun culture is so scatter shot and poorly aimed, pardon the puns, relying on the likes of Marilyn Manson, himself an arch exploiter of the culture of fear and alienation to produce popular consumer fodder that he and Moore attack, to spew out glib Oprah-isms: "I would have just listened to them (Klebold and Harris, the Columbine killers) - That's what no-one did", etc. How much of their well documented, pathetic, often racist fantasies and paranoia he would have been able to sit through before telling them just to grow up a little?After this, it comes across as a little unfair that Charlton Heston and the National Rifle Association are held up as Moore's prime scapegoats, (though one has to wonder, as Heston surely does in retrospect, "what was he thinking, if thinking it was?" in response to many of his poor, ill-or-rather-unadvised responses, his alleged mental incapacity notwithstanding).After all, as obnoxious as they are, the NRA's crimes are merely gross insensitivity, blatant opportunism and misguided zeal. However while the gun issue is never satisfactorily resolved, Moore really strikes home by correctly widening the question beyond the simple issue of gun availability, to point out these issues do not exist in a social vacuum, that the violence and fear emerge from underlying structural problems in American society, even though such problems seem to exist elsewhere in the developed world without such lethal results. Could it be that the core American values of self reliance, meritocracy and achievement, and the equivalent distaste at such concepts as social justice (read "social engineering") and community (read "communism") can't help but breed this degree of panic, insecurity and paranoia? If you are constantly in competition with your neighbour, isn't it natural to fear and resent him? In one of the film's few worthwhile celebrity moments, Matt Stone of Southpark fame identifies the fear of failure relentlessly hammered into school children as a major source of the damage. (ironically, and much to Michael Moore's chagrin, George Bush has tried to do something to repair the harm, by exhorting in a graduation speech, that these days "...Even a C student can get to be President")Many have questioned the film's value as a documentary, whether such an obviously partial and polemic film can be considered a documentary at all. After all the film is far shorter on facts than it is on shock, sensation and opinion. Such questions are not asked by people interested in the epistemology of the documentary form, but by those who wish to denigrate the film by holding it against some bogus "gold standard" of objectivity, no doubt inspired by the bland pedagogy of the educational programming found on the National Geographic or Discovery Channels.Bowling for Columbine is not and never pretends to be journalism (apart from maybe in its more "gonzo" forms). Moore's approach maybe more closely related to satire and agitprop than the traditional documentarian would feel comfortable with, but that in itself is not a fault. Those who offer such criticism fail to see that ALL documentaries have a subjective point of view and will never achieve unsullied access to some supernatural truth. "Bowling for Columbine" admits and confronts you with its biases is all the stronger for admitting its position. Identifying it as something other than a documentary would neither mitigate its weaknesses nor diminish its effectiveness and power. Those who disagree are invited to make their own films and add to the debate.</fullReview>

In this movie, only one black man is interviewed-- in Canada -- accompanied by his family at an amusement park. Never does Moore stop to look at the fact that half of the gun murders in this country have black victims (53%), with 94% of those having black murderers. Rich, young white kids with too much time on their hands can easily go to a Super Kmart and yell at them for selling bullets, but how many of those kids are going to go into the south side of chicago and yell at black people for owning guns. That's what I thought. Yet, they seem to have no problem doing it to white-trash red necks, who knows why.

(Although it worked and K Mart agreed to phase out sales of bullets over 90 days in all stores)I think he does skew the perspective to his opinions, and why not, since he made the film? But i didn't feel like i was being manipulated, because he made it clear that he was searching for answers to his own questions.Mainly i was interested in the central issue - why is America's gun fatality rate so much awesomely higher than anywhere else? They gave statistics for France, Germany, Canada, UK, Japan and Australia, which, combined, came to roughly 800 deaths a year from shooting. Total combined population of those countries is about 380 million. Deaths by shooting in America totalled 11, 200 in the same year. With a population of approximately 280 million.The obvious answers included that America 'had a more violent history' (proposed by Charlton Heston) but that was shot down, because Germany and England have a bloodier history. Heston also said (and I quote) maybe it was because America 'has greater ethnicity'. An answer which Moore ,rightly, didn't even dignify with a response.Gun availability? Apparently Canada has 7 million guns in a population of 30 million, freely available from any gun store, with proper permits.In the end Moore puts forward the proposition that the reason behind the violence in America is the culture of fear, with the media largely to blame. One news anchorman admitted that if they had to choose between reporting on a gun related story or the near drowning of a baby (this was filmed at the scene of one such incident) they would go to the gun story every time. The film suggested that Americans are bombarded nightly with TV horror stories on the news and shows like Cops, and that they are so fearful they have learned that guns will keep them safe. While filming in Canada he showed a montage of the news items there, which were far less dramatic, and with less emphasis on ratings-grabbing drama. He interviewed a number of people who said they never locked their doors, even in Toronto, a city of millions, and when he went to check, by opening doors in random houses, it was true. They just said they weren't really afraid in their communities, although they had sometimes been victims of crime.There were issues of racism, and some possibly far-fetched conspiracy theories involving Lockheed and other big corps, but on the whole I was engaged by the argument here, and I'm not even talking about such emotive incidents as the NRA rallies held in Columbine and Flint after the school shootings there. But he made some good points about families and communities and the inefficacy of the Welfare to Work program, on the whole I was gripped throughout and wondered how it was received in America, since it was pretty critical of some sections of American society.Interestingly Michael Moore is a lifetime member of the NRA, but i couldnt help wondering if he had kept it up merely to allow him access to people who otherwise might have refused to talk to him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always make sure that I watch or read the latest work by Michael Moore because I agree with most of his politics. He has an intelligent, left wing outlook and is vehemently opposed to corporate and political greed. But his work is rarely completely satisfying. For example, 'Stupid White Men', his best selling book, has several fascinating, intelligent and thought-provoking chapters, but also a large number that miss the mark.The same goes with BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. For every insightful and entertaining scene there is one that is overly emotive or that doesn't seem necessary. Also, the film's argument changes at one point. At the beginning he seems to be criticising gun ownership, and then he turns around and points the finger at the news media. The scenes that I really disliked were when he takes some Columbine high school kids to K-Mart HQ to try and persuade management to stop selling ammo (this was too much of a publicity stunt) and when he leaves a photo of a dead girl outside Charlton Heston's house.That said, this isn't a bad film, I just felt that Moore should have been more picky during the editing process. If forty minutes of footage was taken out and the argument was a bit sharper then this could have been a very good documentary.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but might better be called "Skating Around Columbine"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore didn't come up with much fresh material this time around. Most compelling scenes were now-old news footage rehashing Columbine pathos. The opening scenes of bank giving away guns looked as if the bank was using Moore to tell their joke, instead of the other way around.Attempts to make Kmart, Charlton Heston and Dick Clark look villainous simply make Moore look antagonistic. In fact, Heston and Kmart looked good holding their own during these confrontations. Agreeing with Heston or not, a fair part of the audience must have felt admiration for his speaking calmly and intelligently, and for walking back into his house at the moment he did. These are not easy concessions for any liberal-thinking person to make; nevertheless Moore somehow assumed that including this standard "Moore" shot (oops, no pun intended) of a celebrity walking away from him would lead an audience to conclude that Moore had gained the advantage. I think that a reason for my liking this film less than did other viewers is that I disagree with the particular angle Moore takes on the shootings at Columbine. In one particularly misinformed moment he even comments that "no one will ever know" why the shooters turned on their alleged tormenters. No one here deserved to die, God knows, but nerd/misfit-bashing on the part of some of the shooters' targets was a serious, often violent causative factor, although no doubt the shooters' access to guns empowered an ending even the school bullies could not control. Drug abuse -- and, okay Michael, perhaps even bowling -- contributed to the final disaster. At least the material linked to Moore because one of these recent school killings was in his hometown of Flint, Michigan, so that this film is a sort of sequel to his earlier documentaries. The statistical part of the film, closer to the end, where Moore compares the US to other countries that have much less murder per capita, is genuinely thought-provoking. The appearance of Charlton Heston, however, must have inspired the filmmakers into some unrealistic sense of grandeur as far as running time is concerned. Like some of Heston's other film accomplishments, this one is just too darn long for the amount of material it has to cover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the kind of thing we want from a documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's good that the guy in charge of the whole thing is willing to stand in front of the camera HIMSELF, and simply tell us whatever it is he wishes to tell us. He doesn't fancy himself an artist (yet he knows enough not to resort to digital tape, and to tell his crew to hold the cameras as steadily as possible, which is more than most documentary-makers know) and he realises that his job is to inform. Simple virtues, but rare ones.Predictably a few clueless souls complain about Moore's "bias". It could hardly be otherwise if the work were any good. It's the object of any documentary - of any work of nonfiction whatever - to be as biased as possible: biased towards the truth. Since Moore's desire to get to the bottom of things is obviously genuine, and since his biases in fact lead him to get things right rather than wrong, the most serious charge that can be laid against him is that he is sometimes tactically unfair - as in the Charlton Heston interview at the end. No doubt Heston deserved it, but that's no justification. Still, the points Moore is making here are correct.So why ARE there so many armed murders in the United States, according to Moore? He answers this question in the only reasonable way: by taking every promising line of inquiry in turn, favouring those that are more promising than others. Some lines of inquiry he dismisses too readily. It can't be that there's so many guns so readily available, he says: just look at Canada, with no shortage of firepower, but a far lower murder rate. Too brisk. He hasn't established that Canada's GUN (as opposed to bullet) control laws aren't relevantly different; and even if they aren't, lax or laxly enforced gun control is still - obviously - a necessary condition for a high armed murder rate, and therefore, in some sense, a contributing cause.It can't be America's violent past, or brutal foreign policy, says Moore, since America is not unique in these respects: look, for instance, at Germany. Too glib. In many ways America IS unique, or almost so. The highest murder rates in recorded histoy occur in California - in the NINETEENTH century. And it's undeniable that, in the past fifty years or so, no country in the world has been so consistently brutal in its foreign policy. Germany looks nasty if you look at the decade 1935-45, but not otherwise. The USA looks nasty if you look at ANY period of time from WWII on; there are simply too many atrocities for Moore to be able to fit them into his montage (which should have begun, I think, with the bombing of cities - Dresden and Hiroshima and Nagasaki - DURING the war, since if there was ever a violent turning point, this was it). Is there a link between the US's unparallelled international brutality and its ALMOST unparallelled murder rate? Not obviously not.But Moore's central claim is still half-right: it's not the fact that half the federal budget is spent on tools of destruction that's responsible for the domestic violence (there's a telling moment when the guy from the world's largest arms manufacturer says that he's making weapons purely for defensive purposes ... and, so help us all, he REALLY BELIEVES IT), but the fact that this money thereby ISN'T spent on medicine, art, education, welfare, public transport ... in short, on anything useful whatever.Okay, Moore can only answer his central question with perfect accuracy because his answer is "I don't know". But he still comes a good deal closer to knowing than most people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although heavily biased, it was still less biased that an average news / current affairs half hour, and if you can't be biased on the issue of citizens of a particular country being encouraged to take the lives of their fellow citizens then what sort of world do we live in.The doco was funny, moving and even thought provoking. Moore obviously understands the USA better than most. Moore didn't ever decide what the answer was the over willingness of Americans to gun down their fellow citizens. Although, in my own view, perhaps of the root of the problem can be seen by reference to two things that came out of the film.1. The USA is probably the only country on earth where you might be able to reasonably argue that you have the right (nay, the duty) to bear a long range nuclear tipped intercontinental ballistic missile - who's to decide who's a 'wacko' wand who's not.2. The USA may be the have the only constitution on earth where citizens have the right (nay, the duty) to bring the down fall of the protector of the constitution - I don't understand at all. What were the founding fathers thinking of?The essential message of the film an be summed up in two wordsCANADIANS ROCK!!The one thing that the film did not answer is why did Carlton Heston (or his advisors) ever allow that interview going ahead. WHAT WERE THEY/HE THINKING?? WHAT DID THEY/HE THINK WOULD BE ACHIEVED?? HAD THEY/HE NEVER HEARD OF MICHAEL MOORE?? My fear while watching the end of the Heston interview that Chucky might have gone off to get one of his much talked about loaded guns and sort Moore,M. out in the traditional American manner.A MUST SEE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>redefining documentary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I found Michael Moore a pretty unattractive character, I liked his documentary. No wonder it was a hit at Cannes. Firstly, the overall structure, the way the material divided up into phases each with a distinctly different feel, was reminiscent of some very enjoyable feature films, creating the impression of guiding the viewer on a tour through a succession of different places. In fact in many ways he&gt; borrowed from the feature film genre very effectively. Phases I identify include: a) Humorous - Starting right out with some nice easy humour to get us on side and relax us. b) Shocking - Flashing up a succession of brutal images. c) Objective - Looking at the statistics, trying to pick up an overall view of the gun/violence situation. d) Voyeuristic - Giving us a nightly news style intrusive view of Columbine massacre, complete with voiceovers of people in emotional meltdown. e) Exploratory - Taking off to Canada to look at alternatives. f) Confrontational - Taking on K-Mart and Charlton Heston. Secondly he had a good repertoire of filmaker trick to throw at us. I liked the way he opened with some of his best material (free gun for opening bank account), which said to us, I've got some good stuff to show you. The use of humour to lull us into a comfortable relaxed state before hitting us over the head with some brutal violence, echoed, for example, what Tarantino did so effectively in Pulp Fiction. The occasional deliberate rough-round-the-edge moment contrasted nicely with the overall polish of the piece. e.g. the grossly overexposed footage for the wheelchair going into K-Mart said to us: "We've only got one crack at this. No time to stop and pretty it up". I especially liked the way Charlton Heston kept popping up, building, though we didn't know, to the final confrontation. Thirdly, his skillful manipulation of the audience in presenting himself as the little guy hero with a sort of child-like innocence saying "Wow, I didn't know I could do this". We see him as a big kid (scruffy clothes, baseball cap) doing things we know are a little bit naughty, but we secretly admire him for getting away with it, pushing the envelope. Like when the camera peers over his shoulder when they've been told to stay out of the bedroom. In fact the emotional manipulation, was probably the key to this film's success. Sometimes I'm tempted to have reservations about whether filmmakers should be doing this, but don't we just allow ourselves to be manipulated? They do it so well in some feature films, but I can't recall seeing it used so effectively in a documentary before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as great as some have said</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I gave this film a 7. I wanted to rate it 6.5 but IMDB wouldn't let me, and a 6 wasn't giving it a fair shake. The first hour of this movie really was moving... I loved the interview with Marlyn Manson (I never liked this guy until after seeing his interview), and the interview with Matt Stone (the whole way he laid out high school and how it is imbedded in us how important it is was entirely too accurate). The Chris Rock clip was priceless, his stand up alone warrants his own movie. To me however, the second hour of the film was more like Michael Moore dragging us through his perception of why America is so violent. Maybe he did this behind the scenes, but I felt its presence all too powerfully. Although he really doesn't investigate into why America is more violent than other countries (and he states this fact), he was basically asserting his views upon us anyways (not that this is a crime, it's his movie!). The fact that he seemed to act like he wasn't was bothering me. The whole movie seemed to suggest our gun control laws were wrong and too lax. And that this was a big reason all these tragedies were occurring. He wanted to show us how easy it was to buy ammunition at K-Mart. He made a big deal about how the boys that shot up Columbine got their ammunition there (somehow pushing us to believe the tragedy might have been prevented had it not been sold there). The truth is, 'Where there is a will, there is a way'. Anyone who wants to go shoot up a school that bad will find their ammunition somewhere. And the whole half hour or longer deal about bothering Heston was just annoying. Sure the guy was wrong (highly insensitive) for holding his rallies at the towns right after these tragedies occurred. But to go to his own home (which Heston was cool enough to set him up with an interview on no notice) and try to rattle him with a picture of a dead girl (whom he is somehow directly responsible for) was just wrong also. This accomplished nothing and moved the movie to a snail's pace. Oh yeh, and let's go annoy Dick Clark while he's in the privacy of his van getting ready to go out with some friends. The whole movie almost had a feeling that Michael Moore really doesn't like America in many ways (the montage of devastation set to Joey Ramone's 'What a Wonderful World' cover is evidence enough). I felt this feeling throughout most of the movie too. Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, I would just rather people to state it out instead of trying to push upon us so subtly. I really think the movie would have been a down right masterpiece if he would have focused his last hour of film on exploring more into explanations (and even more into questions), instead of shoving us down his road using his subtle views as propellents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Moore's film was very good, it made me think and laugh quite a bit and I did enjoy it. However, I have a few beefs with it. The first is how Moore manipulates the numbers. Fine, we here in Canada have fewer gun murders than the US (11 000 to 165 in the film), however, Moore fails to mention that the US has a population of 250 000 000 and that Canada has a population of 30 000 000. Thus, it is more important to look at the ratio of murders than the actual total number, because it is ludicrous to compare two countries' murder numbers, especially when one country has 220 000 000 more people than the other! This is a however a great propaganda movie for the left and you gotta love it when actors look like idiots, eh Hestin?? 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody pushes our hot buttons like Michael Moore, and his m.o. is stronger than ever in Bowling for Columbine.Moore is at his best when he skewers the PR flacks and B List celebrities, and he does it with style, attacking Lockheed, KMart, Dick Clark, and Charlton Heston. His interview with John Nichols is downright creepy. When Nichols flashes his eyes at the camera, or puts a loaded gun to his head, it's scarier than any Halloween flick in recent memory. The film's historical animated sequence (from the makers of South Park) is nothing short of brilliant.Moore loses me, however, when he plays to the 'Death to America' crowd. He hits below the best with his list of American war 'crimes', and image after image of rows of neatly arranged corpses. Moore's rolling list of US led wars is slanted, inaccurate and unfair. As Louis Armstrong croons "Wonderful World" (remember a similar sequence in 'Good Morning Vietnam' in the 80's?), America is portrayed as the bloodthirsy butcher of the Indochinese, South and Central Americans, and Iraqi children. Even NATO's intervention to stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo is portrayed as criminal.Moore is more on target when he leaves foreign policy and sticks with the culture of fear.Yet he totally misses the point on gun violence. America has more gun deaths because there are more guns available, period. Moore's assertion that Canadians have as many guns per capita is only half true. Canadians have shotguns and rifles. America's problems are related to handguns -- portable, go anywhere weapons -- which are rare in Canada and elsewhere in the world.Moore's thinly veiled explotiation of American tragedies is unforgivable. He uses Culumbine kids, the 911 tapes, video from inside the school, images of the Oklahoma City bombing, and the ubiquitous replay of the Twin Towers collapse, not to imform, but to sensationalize.This film is Moore at his best and his worse. An unshaven millionaire making a fortune on the very system he purports to expose.</fullReview>

Moore's central thesis: that it's fear that's responsible for the much greater number of gun murders in the US, is groundbreaking.As a Canadian (who has lived in and around Windsor and Sarnia my whole life), I can confirm a number of the films ascertains about this country:- Most of us don't lock our doors (the lock on my front door in fact doesn't work at all - it broke a few years ago and we haven't seen any reason to fix it) - I agree completely with the guy in Toronto who said locking your door in Canada is tantamount to locking yourself in (as opposed to locking the world out).- Yes, many of us are gun-nuts (my grandfather, for instance, owns dozens of rifles and shotguns, as well as a handgun or two)- Despite what Mr. Heston seems to suggest, Canada really is incredibly ethnically and 'racially' diverse - and there's none of the urban black/white urban/suburban segregation so obvious in the US (if Detroit is representative of the US - which I suspect it is)- Canadian news is NOTHING like US news - and there is certainly no equivalent to the sort of `Action News' common in the US (there's just not enough `Action' I guess :)- Yes, our `ghettos' (which are generally government sponsored 'geared-to-income' townhouse or apartment complexes) are really that 'nice'However, I have to point out a few weak points and mistakes in Moore's film:- His drive to prevent the selling of handgun bullets by K-Mart is inconsistent with his primary message (that guns are not the problem)- The cartoon, while very funny for the most part, seems a tad ...unfair in its connection of the NRA to the KKK- Confronting Mr. Heston with the picture of the dead girl was just cheap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bowling for Columbine" is a very provocative documentary onAmerica's gun culture. I highly recommend this movie, not as anaesthetic achievement, but one in which the medium of film isused to ask compelling questions, expose hidden beliefs, andshow the graphic realities of its subject. This movie shocked me,saddened me, made me laugh, and made me angry.First of all, the writer-director, Michael Moore, althoughunquestionably liberal, is a lifelong member of the NRA and anaward-winning marksman. It is not his aim to question anyone'sright to bear arms. He does not ask if guns or gun ownership isright or wrong. He just wonders why Americans use their guns tokill each other so much more than anyone else does. This filmdoesn't really provide any answers; it just asks some very goodquestions.The trailer for the movie makes it look like he interviewed a bunchof gun nuts who all come off as idiots. Wink wink, tee hee. Not atall. There certainly are some wackos on display here. TerryNicholls's brother gives a creepy/funny interview in which he holdsa loaded gun to his own head. A young man complains that heonly made #2 on his high school's suspected bomb-maker top 10list. His friend claims to have given up gun dealing because itbecame too much of a "hassle" having so many come over for"guns, drugs, and booze." The Michigan Militia justifies its "MilitiaBabes" cheesecake calendar.Some of the things we see in this film:? Graphic footage of U.S.-sponsored violence against civilians inforeign countries ? September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, includingfootage of the second jet plunging into a tower ? A TV reporter reveals that one of the Columbine killers, in a diaryentry, fantasized about hijacking a jet and crashing it into New YorkCity ? Closed-circuit TV video of the Columbine High School killings,including graphic scenes of the massacre in the library ? Charlton Heston appearing at a pro-gun conference in Denver (afew miles from Columbine) just days after the massacre, rifle aloft,proclaiming "From my cold, dead hands" ? Comedian Chris Rock suggesting that if bullets cost $5000 each,there would be no more innocent bystanders ? Assassinations ? An interview with Marilyn Manson, demonized after Columbine,who comes across, surprisingly, as one of the more intelligentinterview subjects in the film ? A man puts a gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger ? Enlightening comparison footage of U.S. vs. Canadian newscoverage ? An astonishing sequence in which Moore takes two Columbinestudents, with bullets still in their bodies, to Kmart headquarters to"return the merchandise." (The Columbine killers bought theirammunition at their local Kmart.) Kmart actually agrees to stopselling ammunition at its stores. ? Heston, once again, this time in an interview with Moore,attributing America's gun violence to its high number of minorities,then referring to "those troubles we had with the civil rights"(movement)Again, Moore doesn't have any answers, just provocativequestions. Fingers seem to point to the media's penchant forscare tactics ("If it bleeds, it leads," one interviewee says) and alingering, underlying racism in America, but the portrait Moorepaints here is much more complex than that. Moore may be amarksman, but this target proves elusive.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, my hopes were not to come true. Politically and socially, I do agree with his viewpoint on the issues of gun control and violence in America, but that wasn't enough for me to enjoy the movie. He made his point early on and just kept beating the dead horse. I shouldn't have expected more from Moore, but I just figured in the 20+ years since Roger and Me, that his filmmaking approach would have matured.All of the points made in the movie, I couldn't agree with more, and Michael does the country a great service by making the average person think about an issue as important as this. As the Columbine drama unfolded, I had many of the same thoughts and opinions. The sujbect and the content was something worth exploring. ...I just had hoped for a refreshing approach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why you should and shouldn't see Bowling for Columbine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early in the film, Moore tells us that he is a card-carrying member of the National Rifle Association, and he points out that Canada has more guns per capita and less gun violence than the United States has. If the guns alone are not the problem, he asks, what is? He proceeds to examine aspects of our culture, especially our media, that may promote fear and hostility (he does not blame the common scapegoats, lyrics and video games). It's an important topic, and Moore points out a great number of facts that seem relevant to the discussion.I didn't agree with everything Moore said and implied, though, and you certainly won't. For example he criticizes local news broadcasts for repeatedly showing African Americans in handcuffs, and this imagery seems to me to be more a symptom of gun violence than a cause. He ambushes Charlton Heston in his home under arguably false pretenses, and asks the actor and NRA chairman to apologize for holding rallies near, school shootings. While his accusation of insensitivity may be on target, Moore chooses, at this point, to ignore his earlier point, that given the example of Canada something other than high rates of gun ownership must be at work. He might have addressed this point in his conversation with Heston and acknowledged the possibility that by holding these rallies the NRA might be making the same legitimate point that Moore himself was making in the beginning of the film; that gun ownership rates and gun violence (with its associated raw emotions) could be separated in the national conversation.Bowling for Columbine is by no means an evenhanded treatise, nor does it offer a clear path to a reduction in gun crime. However it's an important film because of the questions it will raise in your mind, many of which have probably not occurred to you.Why you should see it: You take the duties of citizenship seriously and believe you're obligated to give a fair hearing to multiple opinions on an issue like gun violence.Why you shouldn't see it: Hearing the name "Michael Moore" renders you incapable of giving anything or anyone a fair hearing for approximately two hours.--from my review at www.1man365movies.com</fullReview>

People don't seem to realize that nearly all documentaries (with the main exception of Ken Burns' work and nature docs like Planet Earth) are biased. However, Bowling For Columbine is a pretty objective look at why Americans have more gun-related deaths than any other developed country. Moore mainly uses the Columbine shooting and the shooting of a six year old girl named Kayla by another six year old as his big examples of the violence in America.Moore interviews a wide variety of people from law officials to Columbine survivors to Canadian citizens to shock-rocker Marilyn Manson. He interviews Canadian citizens and politicians as to why Canada, despite having 7 million guns in 10 million houses, has only a few gun deaths a year. Michael uses Canadian interviews juxtaposed against Americans' opinions why gun violence is so prevalent in the US. All the reasons people list are refuted as Canada has the same issues and population.Moore spends the bulk of the film analyzing the Columbine massacre (makes sense; Columbine's in the title), and interviews people who knew the boys, survivors, Lockheed Martin execs (the company that made the weapons), and the outspoken father of one of the victims. The best interview, however, is with Marilyn Manson. Manson received a lot of blame for the massacre basically for being weird and a rock star. He has the most articulate musings on the killing. You can tell as Michael interviews him that Manson has thought long and hard about this. As someone who became a scapegoat for no justifiable reason, he has studied the event and what may have actually caused it, something the media never really did. He gives the most thought-provoking response in the entire film when Moore asks him what he would say to Eric Harris, on of the Columbine shooters. Without hesitation he says "I wouldn't have said anything to him, I would have listened to what he had to say." Anyone who considers Manson a brainless, evil rocker should check out this interview.Moore, a member of the NRA, doesn't condemn the organization, though he strongly objects to some rallies that Charlton Heston held following both of the shootings Michael covers. Many accuse Moore of bullying, but in his interview with Heston, Michael is the calm one. Where some would just lay blame at Heston's feet, Moore is genuinely interested in the man's opinion of the root of the number of gun deaths.Despite funny interaction, powerful archival footage, and captivating interviews, the film is not without flaws. While Moore investigates the cause of the death of Little Kayla, he confronts Dick Clark because the mother of the boy who shot the girl worked a second job at Dick Clark's restaurant. Dick Clark has the thinnest possible tie to the case, yet Moore makes him out to look like a jerk for not granting an interview. This is where the accusation of bullying could be valid. Also, he uses certain camera shots to suggest things about some people (Clark, Heston, and an LA sergeant) that may or may not be true. He makes them into jerks or racists, which really can't be determined by a little camera work though it can mislead. Still, this is a wonderful look into violence and the media that feeds it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore hit the road of glory with this documentary. He speaks of the High School shooting in Littleton. He is always surprising. We expected an approach that would try to recapture the two young men who went berserk, their backgrounds, their surroundings, their friends and families. In one word try to explain why these two perfectly normal young men could have run into such a pile of guano. But no. Michael Moore attacks somewhere else. He attacks the National Rifle Association all along, and yet he comes to the idea that it does not explain anything because in Canada they probable have even more guns per head. And they do not have a number of killings with fire-arms that could come close to comparing with the US. That's just the point here. The whole film is built on a line that in the end he has to push aside. And he comes up with another completely different and hardly supported in the film: Americans have a problem with their psyche. He does not specify if it is their individual psyches or if it is their collective psyche. And I must say it is kind of disappointing. He brutally interrupts the President of the NRA, Charlton Heston who is speaking of the wide presence of violence in American history (and the ethnicity of that violence) by quoting Germany, Russia, England and Japan as violent countries. But that does not in anyway bring him towards his conclusion. In other words he concludes with an opinion that is not supported by what he has shown in the film. For a documentary it is harsh to say so.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine tells a delicate theme.And I love the way in which Michael Moore told the theme.He put touches of humor in the correct parts and he put serious things in the correct parts.The film shows the Columbine massacre,that happened on 1999.And it tells violence on the USA and all the people who die because of violence.There are interviews to people who are,probably,the violence generators.Bowling for Columbine is a powerful film that deserves to be seen. A must see.Movies like this one aren't seen everyday and the message this movie has is excellent. Rating:10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's finest but as heavily one-sided as the man himself -92%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me a long time after release before I sat down to watch this. But I do remember being intrigued - I hadn't lived in London for very long and had spotted the posters on the Underground (which seems to have more posters than trains these days). Having read Moore's book "Stupid White Men" (and later, "Dude, Where's My Country?"), Moore technique could be described as using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. He is more in-your-face version of British comedian and political activist Mark Thomas. And while "Fahrenheit 9/11" might have earned more at the box office, this is by far and away his best film.Moore examines the reasons behind the tragic school shooting at the Columbine high school in Colorado (and others, including one in Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan). Desperate to discover why more civilians are shot and killed in America than almost anywhere else, he explores the given reasons that it's violent video games or Marilyn Manson but quickly finds out that this is nonsense. Moore believes that the answers lay with a media that perpetuate the myth that America is gripped with violent criminals (it isn't - as one vox-pop says, crime is actually falling yet fear of crime is rising), the politicians that continually reinforce people's fear and the blatant hypocrisy of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and their ageing leader, Charlton Heston.Despite being marketed as some sort of comedian, Moore's points are far from funny. America is seen as a paranoid consumer-driven land of gun-owning maniacs and befuddled individuals lost in the chaos. True, the point does come across as amusing some times such as the bank that gives out a free gun on site whenever you open an account or the "South Park"-style animation halfway through detailing America's past and it's love of all things that go bang. At times, you can't help but shake your head at some of those who appear. One guy, who frankly should be locked up straight away, is telling Moore how hacked off he was when he discovered that he was second on the police's list of potential bombers. Not that he was upset at being appointed as some kind of risk but because some guy was actually more a threat than him - despite owning a manual describing how to make explosives and the guy making bombs a little smaller than a pipe-bomb. What the Hell did the number one guy have - a stealth bomber perhaps or a stolen warhead maybe? Moore's argument is undeniably convincing, given that the point is rammed home throughout the film that it is the media and government that have driven America to the brink of implosion. Moore's argument is helped by a cunning combination of interviews (or attempted interviews) with those in the heart of the matter and biting questions to those who Moore knows will not answer. Heston is worked over like a featherweight training with Tyson, storming out of his interview and leaving a poignant moment as the film closes. A number of those Moore speaks to recognise that there is a real problem in America, including K-Mart who Moore visits with two survivors of the Columbine massacre and who then agree to withdraw selling bullets in K-Mart ninety days later. The trouble is, Moore's detractors aren't allowed too much time to make their point of view. Personally, I got the sense that Moore was fighting a losing battle against American society as a whole and the corporations making a shed load of cash from people's fears. It isn't quite as one-sided as "Fahrenheit 9/11" and to be fair, most non-Americans know that there's a problem with guns in the States anyway. Indeed, he has a hard time convincing most Americans that there even is a problem.Disturbing as the truth may be, "Bowling For Columbine" is essential viewing. Despite a few sickening shots of people being shot (no pun intended), this is a film that should be watched by everybody. And although the film pulls no real punches, it is a wicked indication of what's happening in America and how, after recent events in Iraq and Afghanistan, American attitudes are damaging beyond their borders. Even for those who live with their guns under a pillow such as the Michigan Militia, this film will hopefully ring plenty of alarm bells and if it prevents just one more school shooting then it will have done its job. Documentary-making at its finest but not necessarily at its most balanced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A documentary that looks at America's love affair with guns and some of its more famous victims and supporters.Guns are fun. Well that is what my mother thought because she bought me one for my birthday when I was seven. Well not a real one, but a plastic one. I have never even touched a real one in my forty plus years on the planet and hope never to do so.Taking a European prospective on guns you meet people here that are stupid, reckless and violent. But they are not allowed to have guns and that makes it hard for them to kill other people. Yes there are other methods, but a gun has only one purpose: It is an industrial tool for death and injury. If England had the same gun laws as America how many petty arguments wouldn't have resulted in a shooting rather than a black eye? Michael Moore is a liberal with flashing neon lights over his head, but at least he has a sense of humour. I like his films and his TV shows, but I can also live without them. He likes to sacrifice a lot of light for heat.The central points only take about five minutes to tell, but Moore stretches it out to two hours. For a documentary maker he also likes to be standing in front of the camera. No one is going to lose themselves in this story and forget who the star is!It is easy to buy a gun in the United States, we all know that, but Moore wastes a long strip of celluloid proving it. Anyone can join the National Rifle Association, Moore proves this by joining.(And why not - its is only a club that hands out cards. It is not a license to kill! Does the Doris Day Fan Club vet members to check they really are DD fans?)While what happened at Columbine was terrible, it could have happened anywhere. Even in the UK which has one the strictest gun control laws in the world: Look up events at Dunblane and Hungerford on a search engine if you want to see what a well motivated maniac could do with a gun.There are no borders when it comes to tragedy and stupidity, you are (at best) only sitting back and saying, post tragedy, "well at least everything that could have been done to have prevented that was." Gun laws are about mathematics and morals, you are not dis-inventing the weapon itself.(Does Moore call for the US police to be disarmed in his "ideal society"?)In many ways Columbine to the USA doesn't really mean any more than Dumbliane and Hungerford means in the UK. They grab headlines and sell newspapers, but the real victims of gun crime are out of sight or buried in the inside pages of the newspapers.Canada is not America and Moore makes it out as a friendly place where people don't lock their doors no matter own guns. Well I will bare that in mind if I want to find a new country to live in, but it doesn't add a lot to my understanding of the problem in America. Moore made a lot of money with this movie because he stands on the side of right. The good people that had supermarket bullets pumped in to them because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But at the same time he lives in a society with a lot right about it too. He is allowed to critique his government and his society. There are plenty of places that have few guns - but are not allowed this rare privilege.I think the guy cares, but I think someone should do a documentary on him and ask why someone that can't run their own body very well should be telling us how to live!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dick and Columbine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday I re-watched the movie, care of Japanese non-cable T.V. It seems to me that a core area that is mostly ignored in other watcher's comments is the point Moore made concerning the wholesale manufacture of weapons of mass destruction that occurs 'next door' to the communities in which we tell our children that violence is unacceptable. The man Moore interviewed at the weapons factory (sorry I cant remember the company) was unaware that there could be any sane connection between what America has unleashed upon weaker countries world wide and the horror that happened at Columbine. Maybe that's how he can sleep at night (don't think too hard). In regard to this inability (or unwillingness) to look at the bigger picture, I would mention Dick Clarke. While Dick may be a person with genuine good intentions, the way he refused to examine his conduct towards a situation that he has obvious connections to was a scary pointer of how many of us relate to the world and others in it. A dismissive attitude is not good enough Dick. Thank you Mr. Moore for raising questions about a country that sees itself (for what ever reason) as the world's policeman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This type of film really pisses me off to no end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Some Spoilers.Firstly and foremost I enjoyed the film for what it was. A rather funny "White people: aren't we so lame" type of comedic spoof. The little cartoon detailing "Europeans" with guns was very funny. And Mike Moore emerging (due to advantageous editing) from a bank with a shotgun held triumphantly above his head, made me chuckle. What infuriates me about this film is that anybody, anybody at all took it seriously. I saw this film in Australia, and the smug laugh of the converted to whom the film preached made me want to be physically ill. All I can say is thank god I didn't see this film in France, that would have been almost unbearable."Bowling for Columbine" is a nasty film in some ways. It bullies simple minded conservatives, who haven't the vocabulary, or geo-political savvy to fend off Mike Moore's aggressively condescending questions. I have no great respect for Charlton Heston, in fact my politics are diametrically opposed, but what happened to him at the end of the film was one of the worst cases of 'real time' bullying I have ever seen, I felt sorry for Mr Heston. In addition that pathetic placing of the murdered little girls picture was grotesque, really I was horrified.The only thinking that this film made me do was the reflection on how conceited, arrogant, and self righteous Michael Moore has become over the years. I was once a fan, but he has become a poster child for the evils that exist in the moderate to far left.Sure the film had some inaccuracies, it also touched on some facts as well. What was really galling was that it was, to use some Australian vernacular "all over the shop!" One minute he's on about guns, then he's talking about McDonnell Douglas, then Canada's welfare system and how they don't lock their doors, then about welfare programs in general. Interspersed are the aforementioned cartoons, some drivel about Americas involvement in the domestic disasters of various third world countries, and the racism that fuels all of the above. It was a rudderless pastiche of loosely related anecdotes, not a well researched and well structured academic critique of the USA and its gun laws.It was quite funny, I will concede that, it was quite entertaining. But it should be viewed in the same vein as Woody Allens 'Bananas' not Ken Burn's Civil War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(SPOILER) Proof that a documentary need not have any factual content.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Bowling for Columbine, Michael Moore has demonstrated that he wouldn't know truth if it tap-danced on his dinner table. That it was awarded any kind of recognition as a documentary demonstrates that its viewers don't know any more than Moore.Some examples of Moore's lies in this movie include:His alleged membership in the NRA: Michael Moore told Tim Russert that he bought a life membership in the NRA specifically so he could be elected president and make the organization support victim disarmament.The hunting dog video: A complete fabrication, from beginning to end.McVeigh &amp; Nichols: The Michigan Militia threw these two individuals out of their meetings, yet Moore claims they were involved.America is uniquely violent: Not according to Interpol. There is NO record in any crime database of the numbers Moore claimed, for ANY of the countries he mentioned. He deliberately increases the US numbers and lowers the other numbers in every case, and does not mention that Japan's suicide rate ALONE is greater than America's homicide and suicide rates COMBINED.Charlton Heston: Moore is at his most creative here, cutting between numerous public events that take place up to a year after Columbine in order to make it appear that Heston was crass and barbaric just days afterwards. He not only deliberately lied about what Heston said, and when he said it, he lied about Heston's long history of civil rights activism. (What other actor do you know who joined Martin Luther King Jr. in his 1963 march on Washington?)The Michigan bank: Moore lies, claiming that one could go into the bank, open an account, and walk out with a gun. What he doesn't tell you is that you go into the bank, open an account, and get a gift certificate that you have to take to the gun store the bank was working with, submit to a criminal investigation, and then get not just any gun, but the riflery equivalent of a Rolls Royce. The only difference between that bank's program and those of other banks that give cars as premiums is that up until the PATRIOT act, you didn't have to submit to a criminal investigation to get a car from a dealer. Now you have to prove that you're not a terrorist even to get a car, which FINALLY puts car buyers in the same boat gun buyers have been in since 1968.Canada: More lies, of course. Far from Moore's vision of Canada as a gun-free haven, the fact is that nearly 2/3 of Canada's homicides are committed with firearms, according to the National Post. And the Canadian health care system that Moore describes in such glowing terms is in reality so poor that medical professionals are moving to the US to escape it, and many Canadians cross the border in search of American medical care because they don't trust the quality, nor can they afford to wait - sometimes for years - for basic care that one can get in a matter of weeks in the U.S. And then there's the Canadian Walmart scene, which was either in violation of Canadian law or deliberately edited by Moore to appear as something other than it was. Moore has refused all requests by the Canadian government to explain whether he faked the purchase, edited out the ID request, or violated the law.Race in America: A few points Moore either skips over or deliberately lies about include: Canada's minority population is incredibly low. The black population, for instance, is just over 1% (vs. 11% of the U.S.) of Canada's population - in fact, Detroit alone has more black people than the entire population (white and minority combined) of Canada. According to the FBI and the DoJ, over 70% of the violent crime in America takes place in inner cities, and in over 50% of violent crime, either the perpetrator, or the victim, or (usually) both, is black. Moore tries to link violent crime to slavery - yet fails to explain how the freed slaves and their children had a LOWER crime rate than inner cities do today. Willie Horton Ad: Moore combines two different ads, AND adds text that was not in EITHER ad, in order to make it appear that the people responsible for the phony ad he created for his movie were racists. He also fails to mention that it was Al Gore who originally condemned Michael Dukakis for his prison furlough program.Dick Clark: Kayla Rolland's killer's mother worked at a restaurant owned in part by Dick Clark. Somehow, this gives Moore the basis for a claim that Dick Clark is partially responsible for Kayla's murder.Kayla Rolland: According to Moore, her killer "just happened" to find a gun that he "just happened" to shoot her with, and nobody knows why. Oddly enough, the school she attended knew why, as did the police and prosecutors. The boy was known to the school to be violent, had previously been suspended from school three times, and had previously stabbed another girl. On top of this, he lived in a crack house that his uncle ran, his father was in jail, his grandmother and two aunts were in federal prison, and three other relatives were in jail for dealing crack. The gun he shot Kayla with had been given to his uncle as payment for some crack. So, we have a child with a history of violence, who had attempted at least one other murder in the past, living in a house surrounded by criminals, and somehow this is a reflection on the civilized part of society?All in all, Moore demonstrates that truth means nothing when it gets in the way of putting his point across, and therefore he will lie as much as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Moore's Bowling for Columbine is a warped fictitious, mismatched, jumbled, cry for help from a wretched man in need of his Lithium Anti-Depressants and some serious mental rehabilitation, a visit from a Gillette razor and a wardrobe consultant. Did I mention this was fiction?First off - There is no point to this movie and Mr. Moore is trying to make every point. He talks about gun ownership, gun control, Africanized bees, bowling, locked and unlocked doors on Canadian homeowner's houses, socialistic health care reform, welfare and welfare advocacy, racism, the National defense of the country, school shootings, business production and the closing of businesses, 9/11 and a host of other unrelated military events. He also mixes in pollution and smog for good measure and adds a dash of media induced paranoia along with the T.V. show - Cops! Finally he brings up the warped discussion of the NRA and the KKK and somehow tries to infer (incorrectly) that these 2 organizations are connected (they're not).The topics of discussion are all over the map and in some cases, so bizarre that it dis-credited and muddles whatever his message was intended to be.Second, He makes no connection whatsoever between any of the above mentioned topics. What Moore does instead is rambles on about the issues with no point or direction being offered. This 2 hour waste of film clearly illustrates what a raving,(and undoubtedly left-wing) freak Moore is. Seriously folks, this unkempt, overweight, disgusting slob is not someone you want to give credence to. He's a lunatic.Third - and most importantly is that - what you're watching is a fictional movie account of some mix-matched and heavily edited interviews that tries to come off as accurate reporting, but rather is truly a farce. This film is not a "documentary", (which in the truest sense of the word is based on "facts"), but rather a flim-flam attack on many principles that as Americans we hold dear to ourselves.It's a charade of feel-good topics that are meant to horrify the ignorant and bring them to action (although for what -we're not sure).The very fact that this film is so popular with Hollywood goes a long way in explaining the inane and outrageous comments that many of your Hollywood stars tend to make. Hollywood and "reality" don't have much in common and Mr. Moore's Bowling for Columbine displays this in perfect form.It's unfortunate that many individuals outside of the U.S. (and inside too) will view this film as "fact" and not the true fiction that it really is.Bowling for Columbine falls into the same category as movies such as Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and the Jerky Boys. It's just nonsense - good for a few laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragedy and manipulation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that leaps out at a behavioral scientist is how problematic conclusions can be when they're drawn from a documentary movie rather than a respectable scientific study. Example. Near the beginning, Michael Moore interviews a relative of one of the guys who blew up the Murra Building in OK City. He seems a decent sort, describes himself as a "food farmer" and grows soybeans to be turned into tofu. Moore speaks to him in his kitchen about explosives and guns, and the guy begins to get slightly twisted. He carries on about all the explosive ingredients he's got stashed around the farm, about how nobody can protect a person except himself, certainly not the federal government. Does he keep a gun in the house? Absolutely. He sleeps with a .44 magnum under his pillow every night. Moore acts doubtful and asks the guy to prove it. The guy takes Moore into his bedroom, produces the .44, cocks it, and puts it against his own head, chuckling. He's a complete whacko, right?Now let's turn the picture around. Let's imagine Moore interviewing some rabid anti-violence type. It's easy to imagine a nice decent sort of guy who, during an interview, begins to seem twisted and by the end of the talk is raving about aliens being beamed down from UFO with armloads of weapons that they pass out.The kind of nut that Moore looked for, found, and interviewed may be more numerous than the second -- but the fact is we don't know. And before Moore's interview is over we have already formed a picture of the sort of person who collects guns and belongs to the NRA. I imagine there must be thousands of highly responsible NRA members out there, somewhere, but we're stuck with Moore's choice of respondent. That's what I mean by manipulation.Moore raises some extremely important questions -- tucked away amid the irony and agitprop. Countries of Western Europe -- the cheese-eating surrender monkeys -- have a handful of gun-related homicides a year. Canada, with its vast population, has a hundred and some odd. And seven out of ten Canadian households own guns. But the good old USA has over 11,000 shooting deaths during the same period. What's going on?Moore explores a couple of hypotheses. Violent movies and TV shows? Nope. People in other countries lap up our gore fests. The availability of guns? Nope. That's what is known as a necessary but not a sufficient condition. The Canadians have at least as many guns and, though Moore doesn't mention it, Swiss households are required by law to own guns -- it's just that they don't shoot each other the way we do.Moore pins it down, more or less, to the culture of fear we live in. Homicide rates in the USA have dropped precipitately over the past 30 years, but reports of violence have captivated the news media. So while murder has dropped to 20 percent of what it was, reports of violence on TV news has increased by 600 percent. That's okay as far as it goes. The Canadians in Windsor, Ont., may watch the same programs as the people across the river in Detroit, but they probably watch different news programs and are exposed to different role models in their news. (They don't, for instance, have politicians telling us that gays deserve to get AIDS.) Then Moore does something interesting at this point. Windsor is not unfamiliar with crime, including burglary -- it's a big city, about the size of San Francisco. But people in Windsor claim they don't lock their doors. So -- get this -- Moore goes out and walks from door to door checking to see if they're open. (They are.) It's a cute trick and a valuable one, absent a long and expensive survey. Reminds one of the old story about the rationalists and the empiricists in Ancient Greece. The rationalists would sit in a tavern and argue about how many teeth a horse should have in his mouth. An empiricist goes out to the nearest horse and counts the teeth.There isn't space to go into this complicated and controversial movie so I'll just make a few points. Let's grant Moore's proposition that a culture of fear begets the purchase and use of guns. It's a bit murky, but let it go. What, then, creates the fear? What ARE we afraid of? A clue may come from one of the few statistics one of Moore's interviewees cites. Murder has declined to some 20 percent of what it was some 30 years ago, I forget the exact figures but the decline is well established. Why did it decline? There's general agreement that it declined partly or even mainly because the Baby Boomers got older. Thirty years ago they were in their teens and twenties, the age at which violent crimes are most likely to be committed. That leaves the Baby Boomers now in their 50s. They look in the mirror and see what is happening to them -- the declining potency, the falling hair, the bulging thighs, the sagging breasts, the menopause, the intimations of mortality -- and they're frightened. And who can blame them? We have Ralph Nader telling them that everything they drive (or eat) is unhealthy. It's enough to scare anyone, but it's a difficult fear to define, or to aknowledge. The terrorists, the rioting ghettoes, poison in the aspirin bottles, African killer bees, the obesity, the second-hand tobacco smoke, the razor blades in the Halloween apples -- all objectify that nameless dread. I am falling apart but at least NOW I know what I'm scared of. Not impending dissolution but some maniac shooting me at random in the streets.Moore missed another popular explanation (there are surely lots of factors involved). It's been called the founder effect. Homicide rates not only vary between countries but also within the United States. They generally decrease as you move from South to North. Even within some STATES, like Ohio, rates are higher in southern counties than in northern ones. The Western shootout was an extension of Southern codes of honor brought first to Texas, then diffusing throughout the West. It's probably not coincidental that the North was settled by religious Puritans and Quakers whose culture centered on community law, while the South was settled by Cavaliers who were mainly concerned with getting rich and consolidating power on plantations, people of pride who made their own laws.It's a compelling and humorous movie, but it's irritating too. Moore pulls a couple of stunts that will strike many viewers as being in bad taste. He also inviegles his way into an interview with Charlton Heston and then begins challenging him, asking Heston if he'd like to apologize to the people of Littleton, Colorado, for holding an NRA convention there so soon after the shootings at nearby Columbine School. Heston is sadly aged but retains his dignity. He shakes hands, politely excuses himself, and hobbles away while Moore shouts embarrassing questions at him. Moore should watch out or he's liable to start believing in his own myth. The last shot of the film shows Moore rolling a bowling ball down the alley at Littleton. The camera follows the ball thundering along the wooden path so purposefully, so driven, so unerring, until it knocks every pin clattering and Moore racks up a strike. I wish that ball had left a couple of pins standing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that this "documentary" won an Oscar isn't that far fetched when you look at the Hollywood left. We've got Martin "Not In My Name!" Sheen, a confirmed liberal who supported bringing illegal immigrants with AIDS into this country. (Just as long as they weren't in his neighborhood). Then you've got Mr. and Mrs. Tim Robins, long time supporters of a socialist agenda. And too many others to name. While the big Hollywood types applauded the Oscar win, many in the audience booed. Gee, I wonder why? Could it be that the Academy doesn't speak for the majority?Moore's editing of the film leaves the viewer to believe events occured a certain way when they actually didn't. Case in point: the trip to the bank to open an account and get a gun. He didn't walk out of the bank that day with the thing, but that's what he wants you to believe. Just like the rest of the film, it's all a flim-flam.There's been so much backlash relating to the Oscar win that a movement is actually under way to have it revoked. And personally I hope it succeeds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good film, lousy documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film should NOT have won best oscar for documentary, though I rather enjoyed Moore's speech. Primarily, this is because it isn't a documentary but a good film nonetheless. I rather enjoyed this film and firmly believe its plot structure (and villainization of the NRA) while embellished for dramatic effect, is excellent. I also thinks its amazing that a film that was political and reality-based in nature could have gained such a wide release. I think I know why. It engages one's narrativity in the same way most feature film does, in a way documentaries often don't. I agreed with many (though not all) of the political points made on gun control before I entered the film. Yet, I can admit many of Moore's statistics to be highly misleading. Let's face it though, as a documentary this is the least objective thing I've ever seen, and as journalism, it's even worse. At least Triumph of the Will didn't have a voiceover narration. Moore even interacts with the events he's supposed to be documenting . Objectivity is completely non-existent in this film. This IS a propaganda film, a liberal one, and a damn good one at that. The editing in this film is brilliant and makes a coherent plot out of seemingly unrelated issues. While his racial theory of the nature of gun violence stretches at times, as a whole this political satire is still intelligent, incisive, funny and interesting. It's nice to see someone evening the playing field so that finally we have filmic counter-attacks to the recent barrage of pro-war propaganda, but it seems shameless to label this a documentary (though that might have been a studio decision) and ironic that the man who brought us "The Awful Truth" is so good at bending it. I guess propaganda film doesn't sound as good. Highly Recommended, and enjoyable if you could picture celluloid comeuppance for conservatives (like me), and are intelligent enough to realize not everything you see onscreen existed in the chronology in which it appears and statistics are often taken out of context.</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong, I'm in favor of gun control, but Michael Moore and all the support he gets despite his lackluster skills as a filmmaker is frightening. In addition, his treatment of certain people to make this "documentary" was cruel and I feel sorry for the innocent individuals who were used at the expense of Moore's desperate seek for attention. The whole thing was just a mess, Moore just jumps around various topics without exploring any of them in depth. There were some funny moments, but they did not belong in a documentary. It felt more like I was just looking at what was going on in Moore's twisted mind rather than what was REALLY going on. So if you want to watch this in order to learn something or to inform you, don't.</fullReview>

But that is a OPINION piece, not a message of fact.Even the title is misleading. It is based on the notion that the students who perpetrated the Columbine killings took a bowling class as the last thing they did before the shootings. However, they SKIPPED THE CLASS that day.Moore changed stock footage (such as the "Willie Horton" ad as given in the film to accomplish his ends. This makes him worse than those he accuses, because he says to others to "stop lying" so he can lie more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a strange, strange world and Moore's camera captures that perfectly. But are guns the problem? The NRA? The violent media? The corporations? Is everything to blame? Is nothing? Moore's documentary sure raises questions, but it gives almost no answers.Ultimately, the Columbine killers were only helped by this documentary, with the gruesome footage from the cafeteria giving the shooters the fame they always wanted. Instead of blaming everything else, why not blame the Columbine killers themselves, or their parents, or their peers, who were around them more than anyone else?Their targeting of "jocks" and "popular" kids shouldn't just be written off...it's symptomatic of the growing schism between the experiences of baby boomers and their children. Lacking the support of communities in increasingly anonymous suburbs, kids feel more isolated than ever. If anything, Moore's documentary is a disservice to all those who died at Columbine. Sure, it's fun railing against Vietnam and Heston and K-Mart and practically EVERYONE you even slightly disagree with (the French love the movie, by the way ;P ), but does K-Mart really have responsibility for the bullets that WERE BEING FIRED BY THE COLUMBINE MURDERERS?!An uneven documentary that doesn't compare with "Roger and Me" or "TV Nation."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the record-low television audience that sat through Hollywood`s latest celebration of Hollywood knows, the Academy Award for a feature documentary film was given to Michael Moore`s Bowling for Columbine ?a painfully pretentious work of anti-American, anti-gun, anti-NRA propaganda.But many don`t know that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had to violate its own rules to allow Moore to compete for, much less win, an Oscar. The Academy`s "Special Rules for the Documentary Award" define a documentary film "as a non-fiction motion picture," with the emphasis "on factual content." Bowling for Columbine miserably fails this practical test. It is a work of propaganda, pure and simple, riddled not with slovenly conducted research but with calculated dishonesty.For example, Moore splices together two separate speeches by NRA President Charlton Heston to create the false impression that viewers are seeing a single speech given at the 1999 NRA Annual Meetings in Denver. Moore`s intent is to make NRA`s president appear insensitive to the senseless murders at Columbine High School earlier that year in nearby Littleton.To further his lie, Moore depicts President Heston raising a musket at the Denver meeting and delivering his familiar line "from my cold dead hands." The facts?that President Heston was actually filmed one year later and 1,354 miles away in Charlotte, N.C.?aren`t something Moore cares to document.The deception continues with Moore repeatedly referring to the Denver meetings as pro-gun rallies. He fails to document the well-known fact that out of respect for the families victimized at Columbine, NRA canceled all events and meetings in Denver except those required the Association`s bylaws and laws regarding not-for-profit corporations.No lie is too poisonous for Michael Moore. He actually tries to make viewers believe that NRA makes a habit of holding rallies in the wake of tragic shootings. After failing to document that NRA`s Denver meetings were scheduled years in advance, Moore jumps to a Michigan campaign rally, claiming: "just as he did after the Columbine shooting, Charlton Heston showed up in Flint, to have a big pro-gun rally." Moore wants viewers to believe the Flint rally took place immediately following the shooting death of child in a local classroom. In fact, the rally took place eight months later during the regular campaign season.Another outrageous sequence in Moore`s supposedly "non-fiction motion picture," tries to associate NRA with the Ku Klux Klan and depicts an NRA member assisting in a Klan cross burning. The rationale? NRA was founded in 1871?the year the KKK was declared an illegal organization. The absurd connection is intentional. It`s Michael Moore`s idea of humor.An honest documentary would record that NRA was founded by former Union Army officers who fought a war to bring an end to slavery. It would record that Civil War veteran Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside was the Association`s first president. It would record that the man who signed the act making the Klan an illegal organization later became NRA`s eighth president?Ulysses S. Grant.A true documentary would note that NRA`s early history was written by figures who had not only fought to end slavery, but who would later oppose the persecution of freedmen. Such a man would assume command of the Fifth Military District, and he would then remove governors in Texas and Louisiana for failing to oppose the KKK. That man later became NRA`s ninth president?Gen. Philip H. Sheridan.Bowling for Columbine is a compilation of deceit piled upon deceit?facts omitted, time lines distorted, and editing tricks employed to present a false view o f American culture in general and the "gun culture" and NRA in particular. And yet, no matter how shameless its deceptions, no matter how brazen its lies, Moore`s propaganda film does have its fans, including the Brady Campaign.When Moore`s Oscar nomination was announced, the gun-ban group was "very pleased" that " Bowling for Columbine is receiving the acclaim it deserves." The Brady bunch fell silent, however, in the days following Moore`s win. Possibly they found him less appealing after his tasteless Oscar acceptance speech. Unable to resist a captive audience, the self-indulgent Moore railed against the war in Iraq and President Bush. He may have been warmly received by the Hollywood millionaires in the Kodak Theater, but the poseur-populist was booed loudly by the stagehands actually working the event. A clear message was sent.As more and more Americans catch on to the deceit that is Bowling for Columbine , its maker will have to seek out a more gullible audience. The Wall Street Journal`s John Fund provides a road map: "Mr. Moore is naturally a big hit among the French. The jury at the Cannes Film Festival created a special, one-time only award to honor his film and then gave it a 13-minute standing ovation." Most Americans would gladly say, Au revoir, Monsieur Moore!</fullReview>

What ruined the whole documentary for me was at the end, when he could not find an answer, he quickly blames an unequal distribution of wealth and power and promptly ends the film. Edit this part, and the film is at least an 8.5 because it is rather well done, but since it becomes quite clear he is only pursuing his own agenda, one leaves disappointed that Moore could not admit his failure. Why do Americans shoot each other so often? Perhaps Moore should have looked more closely at single parent homes and high school drop outs and the trafficking of illegal firearms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Moore's Bowling for Columbine is a warped fictitious, mismatched, jumbled, cry for help from a wretched man in need of his Lithium Anti-Depressants and some serious mental rehabilitation, a visit from a Gillette razor and a wardrobe consultant. Did I mention this was fiction?First off - There is no point to this movie and Mr. Moore is trying to make every point. He talks about gun ownership, gun control, Africanized bees, bowling, locked and unlocked doors on Canadian homeowner's houses, socialistic health care reform, welfare and welfare advocacy, racism, the National defense of the country, school shootings, business production and the closing of businesses, 9/11 and a host of other unrelated military events. He also mixes in pollution and smog for good measure and adds a dash of media induced paranoia along with the T.V. show - Cops! Finally he brings up the warped discussion of the NRA and the KKK and somehow tries to infer (incorrectly) that these 2 organizations are connected (they're not).The topics of discussion are all over the map and in some cases, so bizarre that it dis-credited and muddles whatever his message was intended to be.Second, He makes no connection whatsoever between any of the above mentioned topics. What Moore does instead is rambles on about the issues with no point or direction being offered. This 2 hour waste of film clearly illustrates what a raving,(and undoubtedly left-wing) freak Moore is. Seriously folks, this unkempt, overweight, disgusting slob is not someone you want to give credence to. He's a lunatic.Third - and most importantly is that - what you're watching is a fictional movie account of some mix-matched and heavily edited interviews that tries to come off as accurate reporting, but rather is truly a farce. This film is not a "documentary", (which in the truest sense of the word is based on "facts"), but rather a flim-flam attack on many principles that as Americans we hold dear to ourselves.It's a charade of feel-good topics that are meant to horrify the ignorant and bring them to action (although for what -we're not sure).The very fact that this film is so popular with Hollywood goes a long way in explaining the inane and outrageous comments that many of your Hollywood stars tend to make. Hollywood and "reality" don't have much in common and Mr. Moore's Bowling for Columbine displays this in perfect form.It's unfortunate that many individuals outside of the U.S. (and inside too) will view this film as "fact" and not the true fiction that it really is.Bowling for Columbine falls into the same category as movies such as Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and the Jerky Boys. It's just nonsense - good for a few laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore looks into the gun culture of America to try and find out why America has significantly more gun-related murders than other societies. He focuses his efforts on several small towns where schools have seen several high profile shootings and enlists many people from all walks of life to help him find answers.I enjoy Michael Moore's material. I watched TV Nation, read his books etc but yet I managed to miss this film at the cinema and then not really rush out to see it when it came on video. I finally got round to freeing up some time to watch it and I must admit to having mixed feelings about it. The main thing I think I came back with is that Moore is not as good a satirist as he thinks he is and he often goes over the top and damages his own point.However that is not to say that his work is without merit, because it is and this film deserved to win the Oscar from the pack that it was part of. The plot of the film is an interesting look at the gun culture (and wider issues ) of America. I think it worked well the way it covered a wide subject but occasionally he side tracked himself and confused the issue. Running after Dick Clark to badger him about using welfare workers was pointless for one. He certainly has a good point to make generally and it is hard to watch the film without feeling something.However Moore weakens his own film in two ways ? 1) he presents things as fact that aren't, and 2) he loves to be the centre of things. Firstly Moore uses facts liberally but never really separates the fact and the comic fiction. For example the footage of Heston saying `from my cold dead hands' is edited to suggest he said this in Columbine a few days after the shooting ? this was not the case (as the change of shirt shows). Also comments accredited to the NRA days after the shooting of the little girl were actually a significant time afterwards, right down to little things like the missile plant featured not actually producing weapons at all ? but I guess the transporting of the missile through darkened streets is a powerful image. However I still think he had more than enough good arguments to stop this `spin' spoiling the film.Secondly Moore simply can't do satire as well as some of the top UK people. To illustrate an example of this witness Moore's heralded interview with Charlton Heston. Heston begins to tie himself in knots and comes very close to saying that America has more gun crime because of it's high numbers of ethnic minorities! Rather than giving him enough rope to hang himself, Moore continually interrupts and actually gives Heston time to talk his way out of the hole ? with space Heston would have just dug himself a deeper pit. The interview still has merit (Heston walking off is a good shot) but it could have been better. Likewise, the Columbine kids at Walmart is a powerful few scenes and Moore should really have let the kids take centre stage ? instead he came across as someone who was exploiting the kids to his own ends.These are important flaws but I still found the documentary an interesting if harrowing affair. The scale of the problem is obvious and Moore has a good crack at trying to get answers. Some of his editing is in poor taste (a correlation between the NRA and KKK is drawn but then retracted ? but the retraction is treated as a gag) but the majority of the arguments presented are convincing. I actually found the film better when Moore let the material do the work rather than him. Seeing the history of the US was jaw dropping (and still is everytime I hear the same things in different sources) and to hear the speech by the father of one of the Columbine victims had me starting to cry. But sadly Moore too often badgers people rather than letting them speak.Overall I thought this was a good film that was thoughtful and reasonably well presented. It is a little misleading at times and Moore is given to going off on side issues too easily or hogging the camera when he should let the story speak for itself, but it is still hard not to get involved in this film and go away with a feeling that, whatever the causes, America has certainly gotten itself into quite a state and needs some strong domestic solutions just as much as we are told it needs military action abroad.</fullReview>

Do the Right Thing and Traffic are two examples of this phenomenon, and Bowling for Columbine is certainly in this category. Moore asks all the right questions about America's culture of violence - not just gun violence - and comes away as confused as we are about the possible solutions. I'm glad he didn't just point the finger at gun ownership, movies, religion, or any one thing as the bogeyman which brings us such horror.The only problem I had with the film was Moore's treatment of Charlton Heston, who (as we know now) suffers from Alzheimer's Disease. It was painfully obvious from Moore's interview that Chuck ain't as sharp as he once was, and he made an unfortunate slip of the lip that might lead the audience to think he's a racist. I don't know the guy, but I do know he marched on Washington with MLK Jr., back when being down was not cool at all. So IMHO he's earned the benefit of a doubt on that particular issue.Overall, a great, great movie that everyone should see. There is some graphic violence of people actually getting shot, so those with weak stomachs may wish to skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>9 out of 10I have done my homework, watched the film, and read so much counterpoint. Let me first say that I admire Mr Moore.... not for his honesty, but for his courage to make a stand on an issue. A lot of the sites and publications that attack Moore do so by pointing out, word for word, his falsehoods. I say look at the bigger picture....So what if Moore slants the facts to one side.... isnt it apparant that he has to? Mr Moore isnt the first person to utter "if it bleeds it leads" Watch this film if you want to see another approach to a problem that the majority of Americans wont allow themselves to believe in. Yes there is a definate bias to the documentary, but if you get to the heart of what is being said, you realize that maybe we do have a problem with one of our basic rights, maybe being no. 1 isn't so good for America in this catagory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right-wing viewers will balk early, leaving Michael Moore preaching to the already-converted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sly documentarian Michael Moore examines America's fascination with guns (and not just its fascination, but also its fear of violence and race relations brought on by the media, by entertainment, by politics, and by poverty). There's a lot to engage your mind here (old film clips, Columbine High School security-camera footage, an animated look at the History of America, a funny segue to Canada where the gun-violence rate is much lower, etc.). Still, Moore's "ambushing" style can be excruciating to watch, especially when he takes two Columbine survivors to the headquarters of K-Mart (who sold the bullets) and makes everybody there REALLY uncomfortable. I'm not sure Moore's sincerity is always 100% true, but he is a tireless worker, deadpan sarcastic and ironic with his presentation, and seemingly unafraid to defend the little guy. He's a definite left-wing liberal, and that will turn some viewers off, but those who stay will get an interesting dose of Moore's world--and he has the power to open minds when he's not wearing out his topic. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some own opinions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an English documentary that is director by Michael Moore. The reason why Moore directs this movie is the campus shooting happened in Columbine High School. This movie makes the news clips, interviews and speeches, which are about the people who are involved in Columbine High School shooting and Oklahoma bombing, together to show people's fears and contradictions about guns. In addition, the movie also talks about violence like a 16-year-old boy who bought all the bullets in a store and causes an incident of violence. Moore talks with Matt Stone, Charlton Heston and Marilyn Manson, and gradually shows us the reason of the high violent crime rate in the United States. Before the shooting happened, two killers went to play bowling. What does that mean? When you throw bowling, bottles fall down. Just like victims fall down after killers shoot them. Why there are so many shootings in America? People may say many reasons like dark music (Marilyn Manson), violent movies and games, domestic problems, high unemployed rate, or people are easy to get gun here. But other countries also have these problems, like Germany, Japan, England and Canada. So the reason is so deep that American people even can't notice that, the rugged individualist. Under the influence of that, American people prefer to use guns to solve problems, and many young people have become desensitized to the sight of violence and killing. Although the rugged individualist has been criticized, the influence is so influential now that make the problems, which are mentioned before, more prominent. After I saw this movie, I have some own opinions. First, media like to publicize violence to boost their ratings, and rarely care about the reason, which make people more scared of these things. So they are more sensitive to response. Second, government wants to put more money into military. So they tend to build people's fear to have their support. Finally, people are now more scared of violence, so they buy guns to protect themselves. Some people want to benefit from these people, so guns are easier to get now. However, people don't have time to take care of their children, which makes many tragedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly on target</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Bowling for Columbine' is Michael Moore's entertaining, and scary, journey through America's gun culture. As ever, Moore's style is more discursive than forensic, not every point he makes is relevant and some appear contradictory: he asks more questions than he answers. But he never loses sight of the bigger picture, namely that, unacknowledged by politicians, the U.S.A. is divided between the privileged and the under-privileged, and that this divide is crucial to understanding American society. A more telling criticism can be made of Moore's liking for stunts, in which he usually ridicules a soft target with emotive arguments. This use of emotion sometimes seems to ignore the fact that we are all morally compromised, one way or the other: picking on a random institution or individual and asking them to justify their behaviour could be seen as missing the point. For example, Moore attacks K-Mart for selling bullets for automatic weapons; but if it is legal to sell such ammunition, why shouldn't K-Mart have the same rights to sell it as anybody else? And is it fair to attack companies for trying to make profits when you own (via your pension) a share in such firms, and would doubtless moan if your pension collapsed because the management didn't pursue the profit motive? At times, Moore makes one squirm; and yet the alternative is to accept the status quo, and to assume that if everyone is doing evil then it can't be evil after all. Moore personalises issues; but without such personalisation, is there any possibility of change? We make the world we live in: at some level, we have to take responsibility. If you don't like Moore's choice of target, then the challenge is to find another. Or to do nothing, and watch as the murder rate continues to rise. In Europe, there might be little need for this film. But in America, it's an important movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bowling for Columbine - Before you load your gun? Watch this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a documentary on America's menacing gun culture, constructed with sarcastic humour and witty satire, by the director Michael Moore. Shockingly, in 1999, at Columbine High School, US - two teenagers killed 12 students and a teacher and finally shot themselves.The news infuriated millions of peace-loving people across the world and this film prudently presents the different views on this subject. Michael Moore takes us a journey across Americas to competently provide 'touch and feel' effect of this troublesome 'gun mania.' In this process, we learn, there are staggeringly more than 10,000 killings, highest in the world, occurring in US alone every year. A comparative study?stating various developed nations gun deaths per year?shows the danger with its hard-to-believe statistics.Moore interviews with Columbine High Schools authorities, students and people who were eye witnessed those horrifying moments. Is it easy access to guns or the violent nature of American history to be blamed? - The filmmaker throws light on this scarily dark side. Immediately after the Columbine massacre, the renowned Hollywood star Charlton Heston ? President of National Rifles Association participated in a public forum in favour of people having guns. Moore's candid camera enters into his house to find out the motive! There is a chat with radical pop singer, who is labeled as an extremist and provocateur of violence. The filmmaker leaves no chance or choice. He takes two victims from Columbine school and succeeds in convincing K-Mart to stop selling bullets! On learning about peaceful neighbour, Canada?country having maximum guns, minimum gun deaths?Moore takes us there to find out the reason. The film also highlights the fear induced by the sensational media.Above all, how the leaders keeps their citizen constantly under 'fear grip' to hold their position, this documentary reveals the hidden truth. Eventually, the documentary won many coveted awards, including the prestigious Oscars.At Cannes, the film didn't fit neatly into any established categories, so the Jury created a special 55th Anniversary Award just for the film! This self-appointed probing mission, piercing the seemingly calm outer layer of American society, brings out the insightful truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore's film, "Bowling For Columbine", is the best documentary film I have seen in a long time. I also think that this film has paved the way for a new growing interest in this genre of movies. Would people have been interested in films such as "Capturing The Friedmans" or "Super Size Me" if this film hadn't been made? I doubt it.The film started with Moore's characteristic sarcastic humour. The pun on the President bombing yet another country "whose name we couldn't pronounce" was inspired. Interestingly, though, Moore did not attack the US government as much as you would think he would. In fact, unlike his follow up film, "Farenheit 9/11", he actually pretty much pushed it to one side to concentrate on the true subject of the film: gun culture.What was interesting was how Moore almost immediately confessed that he, along with many American boys, had a toy gun and even became a member of the NRA. It seems to me that his attitude to the whole gun culture topic was changed dramatically by the Columbine tragedy. Something that was looked upon that would have pushed this further was the later shooting of a six-year old girl by a boy in her class at their school in Moore's home town.This matter heralded the arrival of the film's first "bastard", as it were. Moore has this wonderful way of turning a wholesome, much-loved American celebrity and turning them into cold, unfeeling, selfish snobs. Dick Clark was the first victim of this. The "Bandstand" wonder man - who had been celebrated so much in housewives's favourite Barry Manilow's song "Bandstand Boogie" - had a welfare scheme that proved to be the reason behind the six-year old murderer's mother's economical difficulties. When confronted by Moore of this fact, Clark slammed the car door in his face and drove off. Yeah, nice move, Dickie. I doubt Manilow will write a sequel to the "Boogie" now.The person who was supposed to be considered the "bastard" - and was indeed by many of the authoritarian figures in the film - was Marilyn Manson. His music was criticised heavily after Columbine, as that was what the two boys listened to in their free time. Sure, blame music! Moore went to interview Manson, and what came out was an intelligent, well-spoken man who knew exactly what he was doing. His most valid point, other than the fact that it is all just a stage act when he performs, was that the President's actions on that day - the most severe day of bombing in Kosovo - were probably more influential than his songs. It is the same over here in the UK with the growing presence of garage music and gun crime here, though it is way lower than in the US of A.The last part of the film was probably the best. After his victory with two of the survivors of Columbine at K-Mart, where they forced them to agree to stop selling ammunition, Moore went to visit Charlton Heston, leader of the NRA. he proved to be the film's second and biggest "bastard". At first he was all for the interview, politely answering the questions Moore gave him as best as he could. It is certainly true that, in America at least, he had the freedom to have a loaded weapon in his house. But when Moore suggested he apologise to the towns of Columbine and Flint for holding NRA rallies in the same towns so soon after the shootings occurred, however unintentional they were, Heston just upped and left.Finally, I'd like to say that Moore's acceptance speech at the Oscars for the film, and the follow up, "Farenheit 9/11", was not really in my taste at all. His next film, "Sicko", is about the US health system. Maybe we will get back to the kind of Moore film that can be enjoyed INTERNATIONALLY as well as in the United States.In memory of Columbine and Dunblaine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding, thought-provoking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's Academy Award winning documentary examines the reasons behind America's often violent society and gun-related crime rates. This has long been a hot-button topic, particularly in the gun-control/Second Amendment debate. Moore doesn't just stop with the availability of guns and America's violent past; he goes beyond into the psyche of the country and the culture of fear.Using the tragic shootings at the Columbine High School as a launching point, Moore depicts America's love affair with guns, from children's toys to adult assault weapons. Some of the footage is amazing, such as a bank which offers a free rifle with a cd account! Moore asks the obvious question about the sense of giving out guns at a bank. He also talks with many gun advocates, including militia members and highlights the everyday nature of it's members and their often bizarre viewpoint. He also shows the often tasteless by-products of the gun industry, including videos with scantily clad models firing assault rifles.Moore continues farther, examining the scapegoats cited by the media and politicians, such as violent video games, music, and movies. He points out that this same material is available in other countries, some in greater degrees, yet they have far less gun-related violence. Why? The answer Moore comes up with is the fear mongering of the media and politicians.The film documents multiple instances of fear inducing stories, from sensational murders to stories about killer bees and other "hidden terrors".These stories are sensationalized for quick effect, with little background investigation or expert input. The result is a perpetual climate of fear, causing the populace to react rashly. The Millennium fears provide a perfect example, as the film shows news footage of people stocking up and emergency supplies as a result of stories about potential disasters. These stories rarely pointed out that experts had been working on the problem for years and had started on major systems first; or that the world existed before computers and could sill operate without them In the end, nothing noteworthy happened.Moore compares this culture to that of nearby Canada. Canada has a similar ethnic mix, history, gun ownership, economic problems, and access to violent entertainment; yet, it has a much lower murder rate. Why? Well, as the film shows, its news media is not littered with sensationalistic stories which spread panic and fear. It also ensures that the basic needs of the population, such as health care, housing, and food, are met. Juxtapose that with America, where there is no national health care, and job programs center on menial minimum wage tasks, and racial fear is exploited.Moore also gives a voice to those who have been singled out as the source of violence, such as Marilyn Manson. Instead of a crazed psychopath, as he is often portrayed in the media, Manson is revealed to be an intelligent and insightful individual. At the same time, Moore gives NRA president Charleton Heston a chance to respond to some of the charges leveled at the NRA. Heston does try to give a reasonable, if not convincing rebuttal, but departs the interview when Moore makes a grandstand play. Moore does take a few cheap shots; but, so does the NRA and Heston has been a party to their grandstanding.In the end, we do see some positive change, after a couple of Columbine students accompany Moore to make a plea to the K-Mart Corporation to remove handgun ammunition from its stores. To their credit, representatives from K-Mart do listen to their requests and, later, act upon them. When Moore and the students present them with ammunition bought at one of their stores, the company makes an announcement that it is removing handgun ammunition from its stores.Moore's true aim seems to be highlighting the role of the media and government in perpetuating fear, rather than working to ensure that its citizens are safe and happy. This fear causes people to act rashly and seek protection through guns and violence, rather than analyzing the problem and finding a more positive solution. His theme is that its not the guns, but the reasons we feel we need guns that are at the heart of the problem.Michael Moore is a provocateur, but he always focuses on important issues. He stirs debate that hopefully leads to positive change. He isn't objective, but few documentarians or even journalists really are.</fullReview>

I respect that he trys to convince us his side. The movie covers a lot of things but I was interested that he never came to the conclusion that some people have said, that they were nazis. He didn't bring up they lined up people asked them their religions then shot them or that they did it on 4/20 hitlers birthday. maybe he never came across that theory anyway you should see this movie especially if you are a middle/high schooler. It's one sided and moore picks on people but that gives it focas and makes it interesting.I loved it and I'm not a person who likes liberal janger.violence is more powerful then the idea of conservative or liberal SEE IT even if you hate it after you do see it first before you complain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK this movie was made by Micheal Moore in 2002, focusing on the level of gun obsession America has as a nation and how this is reflected in its society and cultural climates. As a film it is very entertaining, as an Englishman it is clear that the society that i live in is totally different to that of America. How accurate this is i cannot vouch for as i have never been to America but the picture it details show that America has a love affair with the gun which has ultimately affected the culture locally, nationally and create an image of America internationally. I am dubious when ever statistics are used in films as they can always be manipulated to show what the researcher wants it to. But Micheal Moore as a film maker creates a very passionate film which does actually display (albeit possibly inaccurately) the warped and twisted minorities in society see to blame and get redemption through the gun culture in America.I really want to come to America,and experience it the differences within the country when compared to my own, but after watching this film it did make me proud to be English.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why is there so many gun deaths in America?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>there are three reasons why i think there are so many gun deaths. the first reason is because the united states gives Americans the freedom to have a gun in their possession. we have the right to bear arms, to me that means we have the right to own a man made tool that kills people. canada does not give the people the right to bear arms, that's why there are not that many killings, but yet a lot of people have guns over there because they go hunting as a sport. the second reason is because the government instills fear into the American people, this was a point made in the film. they say that y2k will happen so the economy can be boosted and people can get paid by others buying flashlights, food and water, or whatever people need in case of a disaster. it all has to do with money, it comes to the point where bush can say anything and people will believe him without no evidence of the scare.the third reason why is because of the acceptance issues, and also the unfair treatment by the government and also by people in the slums. the government makes enviorments out of many places in America like Vietnam, everyone is poor and whoever is rich gets robbed. because the government splits societies into those who have and those who ain't got.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I chuckle at all the people who seem to think this movie is an NRA bashing film that tries to convince people that guns are bad. Far from it. This film tells us that "people kill people, guns don't kill people." It does suggest that the NRA (and Heston)is a group of paranoid self-serving, insensative, nuts that can only talk about 1. the second amendment, 2. I need a gun to protect my family, and 3. It's my right to own a gun, so I will. Instead, this movie tells us that WE are the problem. The media and our own fears. And that if we get scared and fearful enough we will pick up a gun and use it. He also places a huge amount of the blame on the government, suggesting that how can the government tell us to treat each other nicely if they are overthrowing governments and assasinating leaders. Even though I don't believe it all, it was a film that makes me think about these issues. Plus, this has some very funny moments, and nobody does satire like Moore. Worth watching, just put your politics away for a couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So who's to blame?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So who is to blame?? Is it the government, the NRA, the media, guns, parents, music, movies, K-Mart, television, Lockheed, or is it simply ourselves? That seems to be the question that Michael Moore is posing in Bowling for Columbine. However, he never seems to present an answer. If you want to blame guns, then blame guns. The media, then the media. It seems like he had no clear idea going into this, and leaves with no clear idea coming out of it. He seems to blame the media, then he blames the government, then he blames the NRA. There is no doubt that this documentary is well made, and that Michael Moore is a masterful editor who uses the best of the footage that he gets to illustrate his points, and heighten the emotional impact of his ideas, but unlike his other "documentaries" he seems doesn't seem to know where to go with this one. He doesn't seem to be able to show who is to blame. I do have to commend him on his equal attacks on the presidencies of Clinton and Bush however. It seems that people want to blame Bush for everything lately, and he very clearly shows that Clinton had a hand in some violent things that people would quickly protest had Bush done it. I am not a Bush supporter either. I just desire fair viewing of both. A word to those who watch this film, know your history, it will help you seperate skewed facts from truths.On another note, I have no idea if there is any truth to the accusation that Michael Moore created some of the situations so that he could film them, but take this with a grain of salt as you probably would everything else. And another thing, Marylin Manson is an very well educated individual and he makes some very valid points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing I knew of Michael Moore was his anti Bush speech at the Oscars sometime ago. To be honest I thought he was a chat show host, I have no idea why I just got that impression. If it wasn't for his controversial speech then I would not never have known about Bowling for Columbine which is much better than any mainstream movie I have watched over the years.It all tells about the massacre at Columbine in April 1999 where a dozen teenagers and one teacher were killed by two young boys who were students at the school. The documentary is not just all about Columbine though, it's about gun culture in America and also about other incidents around America where guns have been the issue in teenage killings whether it be an accident or on purpose. Micheal Moore is the hero in this as he is shown and then you have you're villain who is Charlton Heston who is the president of the N.R.A and throughout we see how Heston and his supporters do Gun rallies in places where teenage killings or massacres have happen. Whether it would be for Heston's publicity about the N.R.A or whether he didn't know about what had happened in the states he visited I do not know. As much as I love to see Moore in action I do believe that he is forcing feeding you his opinion in parts but in others he making very good points which are not looked at in the United States of America. The scene where I only imagine was thought up by Matt Stone from South Park where we get a hilarious though thought provoking look through animation of racial history in America over the last the two centuries is excellent and more like it should be made to in the future to get it's political or public service announcements across to the public and young children, not just in America but in the whole world.The scene also where he does the math on how many people are roughly killed in countries all over the world by guns is really scary when you think of the statistics, but I live in the UK and he says that there is well under 100 murder by guns in the United Kingdom but as someone who actually lives there, there is just over 100 and not that's not counting the people who are killed in knife fights. I was comparing America's 11,000 and something death's to the UK's and it makes you wonder, but America is a huge place and even though the United kingdom holds a round 56 to 58 million people it is a small country in the way of size. I would imagine if the UK was the same size as America or just a bit smaller it wouldn't surprise me if we were just a couple of thousand gun murders behind them because every night I switch on the news and see someone else has died today by the barrel of a gun.If Michael Moore intended to scare America and give them food for thought well I think it's fair to say he has accomplished both and I live in the UK and it scares me. Is Michael Moore actually Canadian by any chance because he is hell bent on making them look better than the Americans but if what he says is true about how safe Canadians feel in their neighbourhoods then who am I to argue.This is a chilling masterpiece of work by Michael Moore and I hope in years to come people will look back at this and try and come up with some logical ideas of where they went wrong and how to put things right and make tragedies like Columbine never happen again. </fullReview>

He takes a scathing look at how America has (is?) becoming so violent. Moore isn't hypocritical either, himself being a lifetime member of the NRA. This also gives weight to his argument by knowing what he is actually going on about.Moore also uses humor as his second choice for weaponry with making fools out of not only the president of the NRA (Charlton Heston.) But also of various members of the government. Top marks on how he describes how the culture of guns came to the Good old US of A.Moore's cast list may be recognizable too as he uses many people who you will see walking on the street. He talks to the disillusioned teenagers which (To a part.) Are ignored and even to people who have suffered tragedies. By doing this, It gives a gritty realism to the documentary and furthermore shows the plight of not just one, but a whole nation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well done Mike Moore for taking the difficult topic of gun control and highlighting what can (and does) occur as a consquence by having people arm themselves from fear of what could happen if they don't.This documentary was a hard watch for me because the content is so real. It is not a movie, it IS a documentary.Although this is a must see, due to the nature of the content many may not bring themselves to watch. Regardless, I hope at least our politicians watch to emphasize the responsibilities they have in promoting social unity and indeed the influence they have in molding social standards. Promoting fear obviously does not work!And it made Charlton Heston out to be a monkey after all! After shooting tragedies such as Columbine and also the 6 year old girl who was shot, what is the measure of your insensitivity Charlton ? "From my cold dead hands". Get a life!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very sound documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Bowling For Columbine' is a very hard-hitting and interesting documentary in which award winning satirist and author Michael Moore goes in search of the answer to the question 'Are America a nation of gun nuts or are we just nuts'. This question comes in the light of the Columbine school massacre where there were many deaths as a result of a crazed gunman. Moore explores this topic extremely well and comes up with the reality of gun culture in his homeland. I have to say though it really annoys me when I hear people going round saying Americans are nuts etc and Britain doesn't have such a strong gun culture therefore they're a civilized country as a result which is absolute nonsense. Excuse me, UK look what happened up here in Scotland in Dunblane. Don't call yourselves angels just because the country's got tougher gun laws and just because you've seen through 'Bowling for Columbine' that Americans can get guns over a bank counter. They should make a British equivilant 'Bowling for Dunblane' Now that would be interesting. 'Are the Brits civilized compared to their American counterparts or are they just as daft' I'd certainly say the latter. Anyway see 'Bowling for Columbine' a ground-breaking and excellent documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am Canadian and how much more proud could I be? After this, my pride sky rocketed... and my fear of the US did as well. Why would anyone want to live there? Why is their population so high, and ours that much lower? Sure, they speak of their freedom, and after Sept. 11th, their national unity. But... we have that too. We are the forgotten about neighbors to the north. Yes, I am an excited Canadian because our little country was mentioned in an Oscar winning American documentary... and it wasn't to make fun of hockey or our excessive amounts of snow, or our beer, or the Leafs, or the French. In fact, it was an American movie glorifying us. How rare is that? Well... as much as I am excited about Canada's mention, I am also distraught about what I was shown about the States. As much as they attempt to cover up their mistakes from the past (i.e. staged coup in Chile to replace democratically-elected Allende with Pinochet) they were again brought to the fore-front. Take this to heart, America. Look at what you're doing overseas now. We say colonialism no longer exists... bull... what's happening to Iraq? I'm glad that these issues that have been bothering me for years are finally on film for all to see. SEE THIS MOVIE, and hopefully, for once in their history, America will learn from their mistakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many fine reviews for it, but to me it was not worth it. Mister Moore needed a bad guy for the subject and he used - in a bad way, to my understanding - Charlton Heston for it. He presented some clips of The Omega Man and of Alaska, showing him as if he were some kind of a fanatic rifle user mad man. Eventhough that Great Actor and Wonderful Man received Mister Moore, clearly not knowing what was all about, Mister Moore distorted everything and got away with letting people believe that Mister Heston is a confused person. NOT AT ALL!! He has been standing alone defending the USA and a lot of good things of that country for a long while now. The documentary goes on and on with some things, stating one point once and again. He tries to confirm some of them, stating erroneous affirmations like saying that President Allende of Chile was murdered by the US: everybody knows that even his daughter said that it was hard for her to recognize that he commited suicide. Worst of all: why Mister Moore considered appropiate showing himself all over the film bearded and looking kind of dirty?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw BfC, I was surprised and overwhelmed. Moore is passionate about making America a better place, but you can't help but feel that perhaps he's going a bit too far. Some controversy in the end where Moore interviews and cross-examines C.Heston. He is supposedly demented and as anyone can see, he's and old man. But at the same time how can a sick man be a leader of the NRA. And yet keep on doing some pro-gun rallies around the USA.Michael Moore's documentary subject is interesting. It's not a difficult to subject to make an interesting documentary about. The footage from the Columbine High School is something most people are excited to see. It would be interesting to see Michael Moore doing a documentary about something less radical as this.Michael Moore keeps on talking about the same thing in his books and in this film. It's just that although many feel that it's exactly what he should do, it just gets tiring. The same things we hear over and over again.Michael Moore had the courage to take this subject about gun violence in the USA, and as a documentary "Bowling for Columbine" is very interesting.

		<shortDescription>Many interesting viewpoints, but no conclusions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine is Michael Moore's look into America's gun culture. At least that's what the promotional materials say. As a treatise on America's supposed worship of the gun, it falls flat. The movie puts forth a variety of interesting anecdotes (banks giving out rifles for opening new accounts); surprising truths (there are more guns per capita in the suburbs than in the inner cities); and disturbing attitudes (the NRA holding a rally within weeks of a grade-school shooting in Flint, Michigan).But the movie fails to link the anecdotes into a coherent, logical theory substantiating the idea that America has a gun problem. At one point, Moore argues that there are simply too many guns. But in another segment, he points out that Canada has roughly the same number of guns per capita with nowhere near the same level of gun violence as in the States. There are other examples where he goes in one direction and then provides evidence that this, too, is a dead end. This film is simply a collection of anecdotes &amp; Moore-badgering which, although entertaining, never comes to any conclusion regarding gun worship and gun violence. The one redeeming notion in the film is the look into America's culture of fear. Fear is used by politicians to maintain political power; used by bureaucrats to maintain control; used by corporations to increase sales and therefore profits; and used by media outlets to gain viewers and readers. This fear leads Americans to lock themselves away and arm themselves against the boogie man. This is where the film shines, but unfortunately even this is left hanging and not put into relation with any other idea presented in the film.I suppose documentaries are only supposed to show what's going on, and leaves the conclusions to the viewer. But it is still a form of storytelling, and as such requires coherence. Bowling for Columbine has many interesting facets but lacks the central core that would give that coherence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly opinionated, but generously informative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has not let a single stone unturned in his quest to disparage the loose gun-control this country faces. Although this is definitely an opinionated piece of work, I would refrain from saying it is one-sided. An example is when Moore talks to the arrogant and care-free pool player who when questioned whether the buyers of his stolen arms and drugs were black, replies "Yeah, predominantly."In the same documentary where Moore tries to inform us that TV series like "COPS" encourage false perception like majority of criminals being black, he shows this true on the face comment of a guy who from his own experience tells us that most of the gangsters are black. If moore were really one-sided he would have excluded that footage since he himself would be falling into a pit of showing blacks in bad light.I particularly liked the K-Mart scene and also the scene where he appeals to the news media to cover pollution that blocks the view of the Hollywood sign. The documentary takes a gripping and chilling turn when Moore focuses on the Columbine shooting and when he reveals to us a harsh truth that this country breathes with fear which is also a view that is expressed by Marilyn Manson the rocker. Manson definitely did not soil my stereotype of an arrogant rocker who does not give a damn about the society and media. Manson did not judiciously justify that the kids and teenagers followed the President more. How many of us believe that kids today come home from school and turn on CNN or MSNBC to watch their president brief about middle-east or something? On what basis did Manson conclude that the president has more influence on kid's minds? It was even more sillier when he says that with an undeservedly arrogant tone!Moore's courage and guts to ask the supercilious NRA chief Heston to apologize to the people of Columbine and Flint deserves a special mention. So does his last act in the Heston estate when he places the girl's photo against a pillar.Over all, a great film that made me laugh, cry, fear and finally sit up and think hard about something that convolutes this country into unending fear violence and paranoia!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just as in essay,it is the nature of film to be based on opinion. It is unfair to say that this movie lies or manipulates. The fact is that no one forces you to sit and watch this movie, or to agree with anything it implies or says. To me the best part of this piece is its controversial nature, and that it gets people to think- one way or another. I also find it amusing at the number of people who viciously bash this movie and Moore. I find much of what you all say one-sided. I see no objectivity in what you say, (though I recognize that this is a review, and as such, biased) be more fair- there is prejudice and bias all around us every day. The news is far worse than this movie in that it really SHOULD be fact, since that is what it claims to be. Yet, I see no one balancing out their statements with the other side of the "falsehood scale." If you haven't seen it, and you are up to the mental task, sit down and watch it, and think. We as a people could all learn a lot from Moore not by his opinions, but by his ability to address an issue, and to really think about something. All of you loud conservatives, stop sweating bullets, you have your media of propaganda... don't discredit others' opinions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Michael Moore's documentary last week on British television and thought it was a fascinating documentary on the gun culture in North America. I have read some of the negative comments posted by some of the IMDB members but feel that they are missing the point. There IS an issue of gun control within the country, and the plain and simple fact of the matter is that there is less homicide in all of the other 'Westernised' countries because of the absence of guns. I really don't think there is a quick and easy solution to the problem and I think it is very hard on Mr Moore to expect him to end the film neatly with an nice sensible answer. The answer lies within every citizen to have a change of heart and the film was a nudge in the right direction, a talking point to get people thinking about the subject. Yes, there were occasions when some links were stretched (Dick Clark), but do you really think that every documentary maker makes a film to sit on the fence and not show a point of view about the subject at hand? It kept me hooked though the whole of the film and I was disappointed when it ended. If some of you think that we will judge America because of an interesting and thoughtful documentary, what do you think of the ultra-violent movies churned out by hollywood year after year? The Government do have a resonsibilty for the violence that is portrayed in the film because they are bombing people (many are children) in other countries -should they not set an example? Overall, a great film -you may politicize Moore's viewpoint and as a republican reject his 'leftist' liberal stance, but that is probably because you have never had your son or daughter killed at the hands of someone wielding a gun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thought Provoking Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary was shown on British TV last Saturday and I found it very enlightening. I knew that America was a gun culture (being written into the Constitution that every American had a right to bear arms) but was unaware that guns could be offered at banks if opening an account. Michael Moore showed considerable courage and boldness in interviewing people he clearly was in disagreement with, i.e. Charlton Heston. How could the latter show such inconsideration in speaking in the town just after the school murders took place (I forget its name)? Maybe the real reason Heston is so militant is his comment about Canada not having the "ethnicity" that the US does, and maybe the reason he is so paranoid, as well as racist. I don't know Canada that well, but they certainly do have an ethnic population. We here in Britain had to tighten up our gun ownership laws after the terrible tragedy at Dunblane in 1996 (for non British, an armed man went into a school in Dunblane and shot several children and two teachers). Maybe the uncle of the little boy who shot a classmate bears some responsibility for having a gun in the first place, but one has to ask oneself why he needed one at all. As for me, I'll never view Charlton Heston in the same light again.</fullReview>

But what Michael Moore does exceedingly well is tackle many profound outrages andpresents them compellingly, with humour and a clarity that isworthy of our respect and attention. What Michael Moore implies isastounding in the fact that it's so obvious that I've never seen itbefore: As we speak, one of America's main products for bothdomestic consumption and exportation is VIOLENCE. My God.Michael Moore presents no answers, well meant K-Mart sensationalist stunt aside. What he's doing is presenting theissue, cracking wide open a gigantic taboo. It's the FEAR, stupid. Why do we hold on to our fear? Is the fear real, or is it fabricatedfor us? (Orange Alert! You are in danger! Go shopping! Stimulatethe economy!) What is the price we pay for our fear?The urgent message of Bowling For Columbine is that FEAR hasfound fertile feeding ground for itself in America and has turnedinto self-fulfilling prophecy, spiraling ever deeper.The ultimate unanswered question is: How can we stop this cycleand learn to fear nothing but fear itself? The answer to this one is,ultimately, up to us. Don't hold your breath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Worth Seeing But...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore should certainly be commended for confronting the extremely important American topic of gun control and he approaches his subject with enough gravity to empower his trademark literal humor. But Moore also approaches his subject with a chip on his shoulder and much of `Bowling For Columbine' is determined to aggressively portray a country alone in its wrong-headedness, as compared to the rest of the world; it's as if the current state of global affairs is America's fault--our bloodlust begins, Moore claims, with the Commander-In-Chief--while the violent tendencies in other countries have been quelled. Unfortunately, Moore makes his argument seem spurious by not offering to substantiate his facts (when listing the number of deaths by shooting per year in various countries--in order to show America's overwhelming leadership in this category--he fails to identify specific years) and his relentless stock-in-trade of ambushing his subjects seems self-serving and less a product of journalistic intent than the rant of a deeply unhappy attention-grabber. The ironic thing is that when Moore finally effects social change (K-mart decides to discontinue firearm sales after he and two Columbine victims protest to management) he seems genuinely non-plussed, as if being co-opted into giving up his contrarian attitude. (This forces him to go even harder at a deserving N.R.A. President Charlton Heston.) Moore is at his best when he exposes television news' exploitation of society's fears (the grab for viewers requires shock reporting) and he's extremely effective in pointing out that black males are consistently singled out as criminal scapegoats. But he carries his points to such an extreme measure (an animated segment paints a simplistically misanthropic history of the United States, filled with the alarming type of vitriol usually dished by the Far Right) that you find yourself deflecting the anger and hostility while trying to concentrate on the core arguments. Well-worth seeing but not without some apprehension.</fullReview>

That is just a sad, appalling, statistic, and all of us should be ashamed of that record. I think that, yes, we do have a right and responsibility to have firearms, but we also have a right and responsibility to use them correctly.

		<fullReview>Wonderful the connection that Moore makes (though not explicitly) between the megalomania that every American participates in because he is a citizen of the "world's most powerful country" and the penchant for using violence as a means to "resolve" conflicts. Much of the country's greatness is, regrettably, associated with its military might, and each citizen feels a part of that greatness. But it's not matched in the everyday lives of individuals, who struggle mightily to hold on to a job and keep up with the payments on their mortgage and credit cards. And that rift or tension (combined with easy access to guns) means that this is a very violent place: millions of people, living lives filled with insecurity and feelings of inadequacy ("if I'm a citizen of the world's most powerful country how come I'm so weak and have so little to show for it?"), are no more than a hair's breath from snapping, grabbing a gun, and attempting to "solve their problems" with the pull of a trigger. Just as our leaders are often tempted, in the popular vernacular, to turn non-compliant countries into "parking lots."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler alert - if you plan to see this movie, don't read past the first paragraph. This documentary was a complete waste of time - Michael Moore presents one pertinent question in the film but he does an exquisitively poor job of exploring it - don't waste your time with this one.First of all, the central question of the documentary is "why are there so many more gun deaths in America than there are in Europe and Canada?" Moore presents some shocking statistics comparing the vast number of gun deaths in the U.S. with Europe and Canada's scant numbers. Moore then goes on to establish that Canada has the same number of guns laying around as the U.S., violent movies and video games abound there, ethnic diversity is similar, and the two countries are equal in seemingly every regard. Great, now we can get down to business! What factors are present in the U.S. that aren't present in Canada? If both countries have the same number of guns laying around waiting to be picked up, then the question should then become "why do people in America USE those guns to kill people more than people in Canada?"The documentary doesn't come close to answering this question, or even presenting any possible explanations. Instead, Moore decides to attack K-Mart, the store where the Columbine killers bought their bullets. He also focuses on Charlton Heston (NRA President) and Dick Clark (owner of a restaurant using "Welfare to Work" labor which caused the mother of a child who used a gun at school to be away from home).These confrontations don't tell us a thing about WHY people kill each other with guns in America. Moore, didn't you already establish that Canada and the U.S. have equivalent guns per household? If that's the case, then why does the NRA have anything to do with WHY people are killing each other MORE in America? Charlton Heston has nothing to do with it! Dick Clark has nothing to do with it! K-Mart has nothing to do with it! Sure, people might have access to bullets at K-Mart, just as they do at the local gun store, but that tells us nothing about the central question here - MOTIVE! What motivates people to shoot each other in this country, if it's not the guns themselves? People might treasure the fact that they have the right to bear arms (so they join the NRA), but what causes them to kill people with those guns?Moore starts to hint at this while talking about the media's tendency to put gun murders at the top of their list, and in the process he mentions that murders are actually declining while media coverage increases. An interesting follow up question - WHY are murders on the decline? Has something changed? Do people have more money in their pockets? Are there any social trends that we can point to? That question is not addressed. Moore focuses instead on the guns themselves, the presence of which he already established were not the CAUSE of the gun death differential, and he pays little to no attention to the essential question of what's actually happening in the minds of the people who use those guns to kill other people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie I've seen in quite some time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you're a major film buff or just an average joe watching the Oscars, there's no way you can't know who Michael Moore is and about his massively controversial documentary, Bowling For Columbine. Many have raved about both the director and the film, while others (namely Stupid White Men) have protested its claims about guns in America. With all of this hemming and hawing over one film, I knew that at some point I had to obtain a copy. Amazon.com wasn't very helpful at first, since the only VHS copies of the film cost upwards of $33, but eventually I struck gold and found one for a cheap twelve bucks. Let me tell ya, it was money very well spent. This is one of the best movies I've seen in quite a while, so wonderfully crafted that it strikes the perfect balance of humor, horror, and anger. The blanket theme of Bowling For Columbine is how America has become gripped with fear and armed itself with millions upon millions of guns. Mr. Moore attempts to convince viewers that because of the mass media, which obsesses over every single murder/scandal/threat that will improve ratings, U.S. citizens have turned into worrisome, gun-toting psychos who kill each other with guns more than any other nation on the planet. Some very troubling facts, stories, and statistics are presented here, like how while murders in America have decreased by 20%, media coverage of murders has gone up 600%. All of this research really strengthens Moore's argument, and by the end of the film I was totally convinced that our country has gone down the toilet. There are also many fascinating interviews with various celebrities and everyday citizens, such as the brother of the Oklahoma City Bomber, Charlton Heston, and Marilyn Manson. Sometimes the documentary literally shook me or made me cry, like in the timeline sequence where we are shown the many horrors America has suported throughout history (put to the oldies tune "What A Wonderful World," ironically), or when Columbine High School's security camera footage is shown in its entirety. Aside from those chilling moments there are also many hilarious scenes, like the animated cartoon that details the history of America. Filmed by the men behind the wonderful South Park series, this short segment is filled to the brim with laughs (that is, if you're not insanely conservative). After seeing this movie I have become a strong supporter of Michael Moore, and have picked up his two latest books, Stupid White Men and Dude, Where's My Country?. If you think that this "great" nation of ours needs some serious work, then I suggest you try and find a way to see Bowling For Columbine. It's a sharp, witty look at violence in America that will get you thinking, laughing, and crying all at the same time. 4/4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for the thought-provoking parts, ignore the preachy ones (MINOR spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MINOR spoilers!Moore makes some good points in this movie, and engages us by showing a side of America's gun-owning public whose beliefs about guns seem ridiculous to most people. Then, he does what many Americans did after the Columbine massacre: try to figure out who is to blame, why America has the highest murder rate with firearms of any developed country. At first, he eliminates sources: Violent movies and videogames (watched and played en masse around the world, especially in east Asia), violent history (Europe's whole history is wars and power struggles; most of Asia's is, too), and gun control (while gun control is prevalent in Europe and Australasia, what about Canada? They love to hunt! 7 million guns for 10 million people!).Then, he starts on the offensive: He reminds Americans that nearly everything we see on TV and in print is controlled by a few major media conglomorates, and his depiction of the fearmongering from the news organizations is so apt, it is, well, scary. Fear makes people consume, especially pouring money into security systems and firearms. So far so good. The excursion to Canada was funny and thought-provoking, but it starts to get preachy, and the preachiness escalates from that point forward. Instead of allowing viewers to come to their own conclusions by showing them captivating film, Moore shifts tactics, and tries to ram his point home with anecdotal evidence, blaming welfare-to-work (because one welfare-to-work child was left alone and committed a crime as a result, welfare-to-work is bad?), and the lack of state-administered health care in America (where does this fit in with guns?). It seems like he is pushing for a welfare state, and he believes that it will solve America's problem with violence, although he never states this opinion explicitly.Then, he goes from Moore the filmmaker to Moore the activist, with a publicity stunt to get K-Mart to stop selling ammo, and an interview with Charlton Heston. By the time the interview was over and Moore had left the picture of the little girl murdered by 6-year-old welfare-to-work boy, I wanted to grab my gun and shoot both of them. Well, seriously, I could not, because I am in China and NOBODY is allowed to own guns here. Even though Nanjing is a city of 5+ million people, most of them far poorer than any American, I still feel much safer walking the streets here than in the US. I think Moore is on to something with the media making Americans feel inadequate so that they will consume, but he overshadows the exposition of this sad truth by revealing himself as a preachy jerk and focusing on his own actions during the later part of the film. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sickening (and not in the way intended)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I viewed this last weekend with an open mind, not particularly caring for Moore's earlier work, and finding his Academy Award "speech" thoroughly repulsive. I heard a lot of good things about this one, and I was expecting a sardonic look at gun culture in America. The first ten or fifteen minutes or so delivered on this perfectly. The bank that gave away guns, the sociopathic McVeigh relative . . . I could have easily watched 90 minutes of this kind of ironic cinema verite. But the film derails with the montage of "American crimes against the world" and never gets back on track. Moore throws everything against the wall and hopes that something sticks . . . the defense industry, the COPS show, Africanized bees (??), liberal revisionist history, welfare-to-work programs, you name it. There's no real thread here, it's all just knee-jerk reactionarism and finger-pointing. But the Kmart and Charlton Heston sequences really take the cake for misdirected heartstring-tugging. Leaving the picture of the slain kid at Heston's house while Moore walks away with head bowed literally made me want to puke. I think the best documentaries are those where the filmmaker has some kind of passive distance to the subject matter. I thoroughly hated this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing about how great this film was for two solid months, I finally got around to seeing it. It has been my experience that the more hype something generates, the more worthless it usually is. This was not the case with Bowling for Columbine.... at least not entirely. Before watching Bowling, or any other Michael Moore movie for that matter, it is important to realize what you are setting yourself up for. While Moore is not the flat-out liar some have made him up to be, he does to a good job of distorting the facts and is VERY manipulative in his presentation. With that in mind, his films are generally of value for the questions they raise.... not for the "truths" they claim to reveal. The question raised in Bowling For Columbine is one of why America is so violent. Moore contrasts our country to our northern neighbor, Canada, and looks back into our history. Interviews are conducted with falsely labeled "promoters of violence", such as Matt Stone (South Park) and Marilyn Manson. He also examines the town of Littleton, Colorado (sight of the Columbine massacre) and draws some interesting conclusions. In my opinion, the film falters when Moore changes roles from that of an observer/inquirer to that of an active proponent. He pressures K-Mart into removing bullets from their store aisles and his unwelcome `interview' with Charlton Heston is little more than a denouncement of NRA activity.As a journalist, I find Michael Moore to be unethical and Bowling for Columbine lacking in integrity. As a film watcher and a student, however, its value cannot be denied. Whether you've heard good things about it or bad; see it and draw your own conclusions. You will be doing yourself a favor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An incredible, thought-provoking documentary. A sometimes funny, often poignant look at the ugly face (is there any other?) of gun culture in America.Moore sets out to find answers but doesn't seem to find any, rather he explores numerous themes and ideas, perhaps creating even more questions. I find myself contemplating all of the points he raises and it's definitely exposed me to another point of view - I'm thankful for that. The only way to get anything out of "Bowling for Columbine" is to approach this film with open ears and an open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore gets his message through and wins an Oscar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the Oscars that were given out at the 2003 ceremony, Michael Moore's win in the documentary category for 'Bowling for Columbine' was the most deserved. Moore takes on the billion dollar gun industry and provides startling facts about why America needs gun control instead of gun profits. His message of social conscience (or lack of one) is stunning. Moore corners many individuals who can't defend their pro gun message as well as he can defend his anti gun message. He's right and everybody knows it. 'Bowling for Columbine' forces American to take a look at itself and to finally admit that their love of guns and the freedom to have them is wrong unless some responsibility follows, which, in a lot of cases, it doesn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not only the most important film of our era, it is the single greatest expression of the American experience. Michael Moore has put into moving picture what many have failed to put into words: why are Americans dangerous? The question is as complicated as any of the answers. This film as at once hilarious, political, endearing, depressing, and infuriating. Especially considering global sentiment toward the extension of American foreign policy since the end of the cold war, Moore's endeavor is unnervingly pertinent. This film both chronicles our national obsession with handguns and divulges our national pasttime with ignorance. "Bowling for Columbine" will make you want to know more about your country, and never want to own a pistol. If you love your nation, but wonder where it all went wrong, you must study this work of art.</fullReview>

Moore uses his clever techinique of analysing each area of the topic of guns, and even adds many laughs along the way. Something like this really made me think.All i can say is its worth watching.

(Although I am very happy he made BFC.) I had never thought much either way about Charlton Heston (except him being Moses) but after MM interviewed him I lost all respect for him! "from my cold dead hands", what an idiot! Moore uses irony to make his point. I liked when he found the bank that GIVES YOU A GUN for opening an account. CRAZY!!

		<shortDescription>yes, there ARE conclusions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've loved everything I've seen of Michael Moore's and this is no different. It's great! I've heard people frustrated at the movie, mostly for two reasons. One, is that he doesn't come up with any solutions. Well, it's important to notice what the conclusions are and then the people have to decide on some solutions. Moore is showing us that, ultimately, there isn't a difference between the U.S. and other countries that would explain the thousands murdered in this country by guns, with the exception of one: that we are utterly obsessed with violence. Afraid of it, yes, but embrace it as the best solution to everything as well. Violence exists everywhere but we perpetuate it more with our reaction to it...more violence! We look for scapegoats like Marilyn Manson but we don't realize he has a lot of hate built up inside and expresses it through music instead of through violence which is the first reaction of our government. But we don't try to hold them accountable for setting a national tone.The second problem I hear of is the situations with Kmart and Heston/NRA, that Moore tries to blame anyone but the people who committed the actual crimes. I must admit that I was VERY uncomfortable with these scenes, but they are crucial! Who gives a crap about the comfort of these people when we are talking about people, children...losing their lives. Moore is trying to get an answer as to why these authority figures and celebrities refuse to take any responsibility or admit any influence on these situations. Dick Clark blew Moore off, and why? Because Clark knows deep down that if he really cared about his business perpetuating the poverty level and the violence that ensues as a result, then he could do something about it. But he's comfortable, he's got what he wants, and ultimately doesn't care. But Moore does, and that's why he stands up, uses his voice, and could give two squats if he seems rude or inconsiderate considering, "Heston invited him into his home".Our government, media, and many others kindle the fear and violence. Moore is trying to kindle the voice that says "we've had enough". There ARE more people than just the perpetrators that need to be held accountable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason why everybody likes movies and especially Hollywood movies is that the main purpose of making a movie has to do with selling dreams. Our lives are so monotonous, routine, and uneasy, that everybody wants to escape from that reality and movies seem to be the best and easiest way to do so. However, unlike most of the American movies "Bowling for Columbine" does not sell a dream, it sells you a reality the American one.This movie, actually documentary, tries to find the answer to the question: Why in America there are more homicide cases than in any other country in the world? It looked like Michael Moore couldn't find the answer to that question. And I don't know about him, but I have my answer, which I would like to share with you:First of all, there is no way you could compare 30 million Canada with 300 million USA. Demographical structure, population density, economy, and I would say even the climate are completely different. The same applies to the comparison with Germany and especially Japan where 99 % of the population are Japanese.Secondly, of course the historical factor matters and here again the inappropriate comparison with England, Germany, France and Japan. You cannot compare a few isolated incidents (OK even more than a few) with the everyday killing that was going on thought out the American history.The mass media in this country. It is one thing to go and see one Schwarzenegger movie at the movie theater, another is to watch violence and shooting everyday on the TV in your home. No other country has such TV programs. Marilyn Manson also provided part of the answer to that question. By the way, this guy is good.And finally, I think that there is no other nation in the world that has made money a cult. In the USA like in no other nation everything is money; and we all know that where there is money there is blood.Well anyway, I will stop being a philosopher for now. Going back to the movie a would say that it is definitely a worth seeing one. Very entertaining. Recommended-9 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to go into the gun control issue, but rather I will focus on the most interesting aspect the film touched upon. The being the 911 commentary where Moore states that Bin Laden used to be a CIA operative and that basically, they fired him, then he used his training and remaining money to get back at him former employers.If this part of the documentary is true, and I suspect Moore would not said it if it did not have some kernel of truth to it, then it certainly is the most compelling aspect of the film.I for one hope that Moore's next film deals entirely with 911. He may have extremely leftist views as a film maker, but he is also an extremely smart, outspoken and in a strange way, charismatic person.

		<shortDescription>It only said what I've been saying for years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The people who deny this films plausibility and truths by blocking their ears and closing their eyes are the very examples of why this film exists. It only supports what I've been saying for years; that Americans are scared to death of each other, and perpetuate their own fears through media and prejudice (which could be seen as one in the same). It speaks of the merit in the 2nd amendment, which of course supports the right to bear arms. I've never been totally on one side or the other, and in my opinion this film isn't that way either. It gives a good perspective from both sides, and allows you to choose for yourself what you want. It supports the fact that tens to hundreds of other countries have just as many guns as we do, possibly more. But what's the difference 'twixt us and these countries, who have such low death rates by guns even with their own possession of firearms? Like the film stated very clearly through history and present tense. Fear, plain and simple. Someone commented on how the facts are stunted and without merit. What research have you done on this subject? I have friends in England, one of them a reporter for her local town's newspaper. She went on a drug raid that their police did. I was in shock: "Weren't you afraid of getting shot??" She laughed out loud, saying "What? Vee, we don't HAVE the guns you do. Not even the cops going INTO the raid had guns." The sheer disbelief that I'd suggest guns would be at a drug pusher's house, or even have the cops have guns showed me a lot, being that I'm from a country where a cop has to carry thirty-five different forms of artillery just to write a speeding ticket. I DO love my country, and I'm glad that we can bear arms should we want/need to. But do we NEED guns that can shoot 900 rounds into a person breaking into our home(s)? Honestly? I know I've spoken more on my views rather than the film itself, but that's what this film did. It showed me what I already knew from another's perspective, and gave me real proof to boot. Unless you want to shoot back 50 years into the past and get a McCarthy hearing going, what reason would Moore have to lie? This of course is directed to the person disagreeing with the statistics of this film. Granted I haven't run my own personal census so I don't know 100% myself that these statistics are true. Yet what does anyone have for proof... besides the dead bodies of innocent people we killed in our meandering around, supporting Iran, then Iraq, then Bin Laden, etc. etc.? These aren't even undercover facts or conspiracies, it's WELL KNOWN that we taught Bin Laden everything the CIA knew. Is the denial stemming from the fact that you don't want to believe?That's what these films are here for. To make you think past the box Americans have been put into. What is wrong with seeing your country's faults? Do you deny you have your own? Are you selfish sometimes, or gullible, depressed, manic, etc.? Then how is it a whole conglomerate of Americans and their elected officials aren't WRONG a good portion of the time? I'm wrong about 78% of the time dealing with my own LIFE, nevermind anyone else's. I don't agree with taking guns away. I agree with taking people's minds and stirring them around a bit. That's what this film did. I think it was truth no one wants to hear. Because everyone's scared to death, everyone's depressed and on some sort of medication, everyone's hoping the bombs don't land in their town, everyone's worried about taking the bus because they don't want to get shot... and it's sad that not everyone will get to watch this film to learn WHY they think that. Or, to learn that they have to open their minds more to other peoples opinions. This movie was so well done, I wouldn't eat it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read many criticisms of this film, and they seem to boil down to two things: it is largely made up of lies or distortions of truth; and Moore fails to make any kind of solid point or answer any of the questions he raises. I cannot respond to the first claim, as I know the film certainly has some embellishments, though I am not aware of any blatant falsehoods. The second, however, is an interesting point to ponder...Is a documentary filmmaker required to answer questions? Surely if he did, he would be regarded as being "preachy". I believe that Moore's main aim in Bowling for Columbine is to get his audience asking those questions, and seeking their own answers. Why does the USA have such a high homicide rate? Is it the guns? Is it something else? I doubt Michael Moore knows the answer, but I believe it is a very important question.Moore isn't some kind of prophet - he just wants to make you think.</fullReview>

The inaccuracies and deceptive tactics used in the film have been well documented elsewhere so I won't waste time rehashing them.My biggest problem with Moore's work here is the various contradictions in his approach to the gun violence issue. As a viewer I couldn't tell what Moore was trying to prove. Much of what he presented actually supports the NRA point of view - guns don't kill people, people kill people.Watch Bowling for Columbine and enjoy it for what it is.

Along the way he manages to shoot a few holes in a couple of major American icons (to wit...Charles Heston and Dick Clark) and raise some substantial questions about the hows and whys of gun violence in this country. You can agree or disagree with his conclusions...but there's no arguing with the necessity or timing of this film.

		<fullReview>Sure, Moore is a showman and a bit of a ham. And sure the scenes were staged; they had to be because there was a big movie camera in the room.But he made his points. And he backed down not only Charlton Heston but also K-Mart.The message I came away with is that Americans have a tendency to be paranoid--more so than, say, Europeans or Canadians. We believe that the best defense is a good offense. And in preemptive strikes. We're trigger-happy. And we think it's cool to say "Shoot first and ask questions later."Jacques Lacan said the the Ego IS paranoia in its essence. Well, maybe, but I would say that paranoia is a fearful ego. And Moore said that that was exactly the problem--fear, exaggerated by the government and by the nightly news.Unfortunately, I can't cite the figures, but I remember reading somewhere that there are more relatives than intruders killed by guns in the house. Since so many families are nests of violence, or at least simmering resentments, etc, why would guns in the house be a good idea?I'm not saying BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is flawless. I'm only saying that it's a powerful, effective film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right or Left, this is not untrue...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a documentary, many have attacked "Bowling..." as total fiction and appear to think Moore should apologize and feel guilty for his portrayal of certain "facts." However, as another reviewer noted, Michael Moore did not create the Columbine massacre for his own personal benefit, as something to exploit.Some documentary works simply inform and some show a slant from one direction or another in order to stimulate thought. Depending on what side of the political fence one sits on, we may all sound like idiots for spouting out garbage that has no basis in fact like Ann Coulter or other mudslingers from the left or right, purely believing so surely in their own self-hype, that they lean consistently away from the facts. While Moore obviously used certain cuts to this advantage here, clipping Heston's speeches and using them liberally as filler around certain events, such as the shooting of a six year old girl in a Flint Michigan school, he did not create the shooting.He did not give Charleton Heston the words, scripted, in which to speak. He did not hand the gun to the little boy. He did not overthrow Salvador Allende, exterminate Jews by the millions or buy the ammo for Klebold and Harris. He also did not make up the numbers of gun deaths and even if we look at the per capita numbers the US is still number one, with countries like next door neighbor Canada far back in the pack, but of course Mexico on the other hand...vying for contention...The greatest thing accomplished here is Moore's ability to incite activity in thought. While on the extreme end, some of this radical thought might be attributed to lack of real thought and observation and we might blame some opinion simply on the lack of education present in the American system...some is probably just inability to be objective whether we buy it or not.Powers of observation being used in the awry manner presented here, some notes from the other side...it was K-mart and not Wal-Mart which was attacked for its sale of ammo when he camped out with the two Columbine high students. Allende was democratically elected by the way, and Iran was a democracy, which all Americans are supposed to so closely cherish, lest we forget...prior to the US government's installation of the Shah. Is it anti-American to accept the fact that the US has been involved so blatantly in the overthrow of so many world neighbors or demonstrate that perhaps it is something else besides the guns that causes so many in the US to actually use them?Boo-hoo for those among us who cannot get past certain simple embellishments, like the placard for a B-52 bomber that Moore notes was "killing" at Christmastime, far far away. Let's remember these things weren't designed for dropping food packets...Okay, so good or bad, you decide (as is hopefully your right wherever you are), but relax and have a cold drink to cool a hot head when you think about whether the numbers are good or bad and if you'd like to live in this neighborhood and raise a family and so on, or if Michael Moore perpetrated all these criminal acts just so he could make a buck. And by the way...he hardly has enough of these bucks to revive Flint, Michigan. Would you spend all your money trying to make brooms in some old General Motors factory?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IF nothing else, thought-provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this is a one-sided documentary. But the questions left unanswered are what makes this film great. Mr. Moore points out in an interview at Cannes how groups of people outside the theatre were discussing the picture after viewing it. This is what anyone should hope for....discussion, debate, action. If there is one fact that can be taken from this that is reality, it is that we have 100 times more gun violence than any other country. Some arguments are presented, and it is up to the intelligent viewer to ascertain why this is a sad truth. You would think that after decades of proving themselves not worthy, that blind faith in our government would no longer be, but from what I've seen in the last year and some of the comments on this website, many Americans still want to believe. What I would like to see from Mr. Moore is to question these Hollywood "liberals" who would rant about gun control, then appear on a giant billboard with a gun in their hand. It's not just the movies or the video games or the music, but that we are constantly bombarded with violent images like those and other types. I would also like to see Mr. Moore put his money where his mouth is, and invest some of the millions that he has surely made from this film and his other projects into his hometown of Flint. There isn't a rich person out there who is generous enough, in my opinion, and until proven otherwise, you are among them, Mr. Moore. Bravo to Michael Moore for giving us food for thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bowling for Columbine: 9/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. Michael Moore's controversial but exceptional Bowling for Columbine is one of the most disturbing yet necessary movies I have seen. I think it's more important to show how blind patriotism is these days then to show Requiem for a Dream or Schindler's List, albeit important for those two to be shown. Most of the kids in my social studies class were pro-war, with no backing, just because that's what the news tells them to think. How I admire Canada now: their `breaking news' isn't how our president bombed another country or that another `potentially dangerous' thing will be entering our country soon but never will, but that a new speed bump was installed. Children today are becoming what the government wants us to be, just blind drones who believe what they're told to be. In case you couldn't guess so far, during Moore's Oscar acceptance speech, which I was watching at home, I almost stood up and cheered.Bowling for Columbine is one-sided, but I'll bet even the most conservative of people would agree with at least one point that Moore makes on his two-hour crusade to spread the word on how guns are being used wrongly and put into the wrong hands (even though he's a lifelong member of the NRA). He investigates a bank that gives away a gun if you open a checking account, which is just ridiculous. Moore talks to shock rocker Marilyn Manson (who actually seems to be a pretty decent guy, at least well spoken), who says that he considers the President to be more influential than he is (personally, I'd rather have my children follow Manson than George W. Bush), and an impromptu meeting with NRA leader Charlton Heston (which seemed edited/butchered).Not only does Bowling for Columbine deal with gun control, but also tackles the issues of racism and the media. During a news report on when a six-year-old boy shot another six-year-old, the news camera never left the school, while about a block away were shantys and what most of America didn't want to see. It really opened my eyes. Also, he showed how much people just assume that black people do crimes, while rich white folk can blame them for it, and it works. Although it's a side note, it's an important one that Moore rightfully wanted to include.Moore's Oscar speech sums it all up: we're living in fictitious times, with fictitious election results, with a fictitious president, fighting a fictitious war. America has had more bloodshed, mostly unnecessary, in the past 250 years than most countries have had for however long they have been around. Canada, with 10 million people, has 7 million handguns, but they don't feel the need to shoot their neighbors because they didn't have a cup of sugar to bake a cake for their granny. It's almost disgusting how vile, brutal, and trigger-happy Americans are.I just realized that this is less of a review for Bowling for Columbine than a leftist rant by me, but every decent person needs to view Bowling for Columbine, the most important film in the last half-dozen years or so. You'll learn something, and you'll come to your senses about what you believe in.My rating: 9/10Rated R for some violent images and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, now that the movie is out on DVD, I finally got to see Bowling for Columbine in all of its glory. I was thinking I'd get an anti-gun movie with some hilarious moments inserted as to keep the audience awake. However, what I got was a movie with a message that was much deeper and bolder than some report about how bad guns are. Moore points out that guns aren't the problem, neither are parents or the bloody history of our country. The problem is fear. Fear makes us get the guns. Fear makes us kill other people. Fear makes us lock our doors at night, and fear makes us loose our humanity. This is why Bowling for Columbine is such a great documentary. It skips all the crap and gets to the root of the problem. Now the question is...how do we stop it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of questions, and a few answers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched Bowling for Columbine, and read all the related topics and web pages. There are mainly two views, some people love it, despite that it uses cinematographic technics to make its point, and hardly gives any answers to its questions. Others hate it, feel like it's anti-American, anti- democratic or even communist. I personally liked it, because I do know what's the difference between communism, and social sensitivity, or between a fraud, and skilled movie making. The fact is, that Americans (US citizens) have a strong habit of shooting on their fellow citizens, and that fact can't be denied. It worths a descent movie, and this movie, in its intentions is a descent one. The only thing what bathers me, is the conclusion. I don't think that the correct answer is that: Charlton Heston and/or the American media is the responsible for the regular annual massacres. I think the answer is much complicated, and needs more research in social psychology than in sociology. It roots in the attitude of the Wild West heroes, like Wild Bill, or Jesse James, - the shoot first, ask questions, later, method. That's what everybody was trying to express, mourning words about the bloody American history, which actually compared to the European, seems like a paperback for girls compared to Tolstoy's War and Peace. In the US, if someone has enough of his miserable life, (fortunately the women are more intelligent) he gets tempted by the idea of being a hero for once in his lifetime. So he gets armed and begins to shoot people, like the great ancestors. It's not the guns or the fear, but actually the heroes they worship from their childhoods that make these frustrated teenagers and men into killing mashines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrified Americans, Happy Canadians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very, very interesting documentary. Very well deserved Oscar.The documentary focuses on the central question: Why do Americans kill more people with guns (per head of population) than any other Western country in the world?But the documentary also raises two more key questions:1. Why are African Americans and Hispanics demonised in American media?2. Why are Canadians so easy going that they don't even lock the doors of their homes?Moore proposes an answer which I found both surprising and fascinating.I believe BFC should be compulsory viewing for all human beings. Yes Michael Moore has an agenda and he pushes it. Yes not everyone will agree with everything he has to say. But he makes a lot of strong points very, very well and he is extremely good at getting people to reveal a lot of interesting information about themselves. SLIGHT SPOILER:The only point about the BFC which I wasn't so happy with was the way Moore conducted his interview with Charlton Heston. I think Moore was too emotive and aggressive. I got the feeling that Moore would have been able to glean more material from Heston if he hadn't been so aggressive. And that's probably the most important thing about interviewing subjects ? getting them to talk and reveal as much interesting stuff about themselves as possible. If a subject becomes upset or annoyed, they'll stand up and walk out just like Mr Heston did. Overall 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most intelligent documentaries ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Bowling for Columbine, based on the perception that it was a half-documentary, hillariously funny blockbuster thing with an anti-gun message. That impression was based on the trailer.Instead, what I got to see was something fairly different. First of all, it seemed a genuine documentary which admittedly chooses the material on display carefully to make a point, so is not objective, but despite that it is genuine and truthful. And it isn't nearly as funny as I was made to hope. Instead, it manages to be clever, convincing and moving (although it does go a bit far to achieve that effect towards the end)This is a documentary, so I am wondering whether such a thing as "Spoilers" are possible or not. Let's just say the rest of this comment will deal with the documentary in more detail, giving away some of its points and features, so if you want to see it on a blank mind, you might not want to read on.The point of the documentary - against all expectations - has little to do with guns and gun control. Michael Moore is a lifetime member of the NRA, he happily points out that there's 7 million firearms in Canada, a population of 11 million families, with a dramatically smaller amount of violence plagueing that nation. So what is the point of the documentary?There are several points. While attacking big business (especially Lockheed Martin), schemes that eerily resemble forced labour for poor people (inluding, most mercilessly, single mothers), schools, politicians, nutjob extremists and others, those that come out worst out of this documentary are undoubtedly the media - specifically, the US media, for savagely going after that which gets good ratings - violence and mass hysteria - and thereby scaring the population into a stage where they no longer bother to think straight.Some of the points are very well-made, others are less convincing, but the overall documentary is a truly thought-provoking, interesting look at America today. Sadly, it is hard to laugh, because the entire thing is tragicomic, you are never sure whether you should laugh or cry at the situations displayed and documented here.There are moments when Moore aims for the laughs - the cute dog who shot his owner with a shotgun is more funny than tragic, and the most light-hearted bit of the documentary occurs when Moore pitches a show to replace "Cops" on American TV. But then we get to see people who seem to have lost all touch with reality, who tragically live in microcosms of fear and who prepare themselves for violence every day until it is they themselves (or their friends) who bring it about, not the rest of the world that they try to protect themselves against. We get to see people choking on their words, still affected by tragedies years after the fact, and we see snippets of real life footage that are gory and terrible.Towards the end, Moore aims for the dramatic, and while the visit to K-Mart headquarters appears to be a triumph, his escapade with Charlton Heston is little more than an attempt to find a villain in all the mess. While Moore points out faults left right and centre, he appears to need to give the villain a face - that American disease of identifying good and evil, of having someone to identify as enemy, has not left Moore unaffected, and so he picks the head of the NRA. In a way, it is a let-down after one of the most intelligent and moving documentaries ever.As last remark, I'd like to compare it with another American documentary that took the world by storm recently. The 9/11 documentary might have won prizes and popularity, but if you really get down to it, that documentary is nothing but a bubble of emotion, without point or thought, without statement or content. If you want to see something that bubbles with emotion, but doesn't forget to think, watch Bowling for Columbine. You might not agree with all of its points, but it is worth seeing anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore at it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got my first taste of Michael Moore's work on his TV show "The Awful Truth" which was hit-or-miss depending on the social injustice exposed in that episode. "Bowling for Columbine" is pretty much a feature length version of The Awful Truth minus the bits at the start and end where Moore chats to the audience. I was concerned that there might be parts of Bowling for Columbine where Moore just tended to be a nuisance and got a 'let's get out of here' or 'our security will escort you to the nearest entrance' reaction which is just a cheap way of making somebody look guilty (this happened a few times in The Awful Truth). Fortunately this only happens when he tries to speak to Dick Clark who is just about to set off in his car for somewhere and is running late, and when interviewing Charlton Heston, where Moore was a bit tactless in confronting the ageing actor/NRA president.The basic message I got from the film was that the deeply embedded culture of fear present in the USA (reflected in its media) is responsible for the high rate of gun-related deaths (Canada having a similar amount of guns per person but far fewer deaths).I didn't really feel that this message was hammered home in the way that an episode of The Awful Truth's might have been but Bowling for Columbine is definately the most informing work of Moores I've seen yet. Despite the flaws Michael Moore is the only one willing to address the issues that everyone else in the media would rather not think about.Highly recommended for anyone who likes documentaries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie that asks the question many Europeans ask: Why are the Americans so afraid? You have the richest, mightiest, most powerful nation on this planet. You have enough firepower to eradicate all life 12 times. You have enough money to buy several countries each year. Still, you may be the most frightened people on Earth. You build larger and larger prisons, use more and more on defense and you own about 250 million guns(!) Why so afraid? It can't be just because of the 9-11 tragedy.Moore points out that the real problems aren't Marilyn Manson, violent movies or South Park. The problem is the way that poor Americans have to work 70 hours a week without earning enough money to pay the rent, while the rich Americans only get richer and still more afraid of the rising number of poor people. That most of the American media discourse is about violence and shooting. That the Bush government is using the fear to earn money for his friends. And that hand guns are everywhere.With Bowling For Columbine Moore urges the US to stop the paranoia, stop shooting each other, put away the gun and maybe have a look on how they are doing things in Canada or in most of the rest of the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stark look at gun crime in america</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, an hour and half documentary would not usually interest me, however if it was made by someone like Micheal Moore, then it would get me hooked. The basis of this movie is to find out the reasons of why gun crime is so high in america. Many conclusions were made from, Marlyin Manson (sic) to inner city black crime. He compares the gun crime in america with the northernly neighbours of Canada. The latter group have a lower gun crime, though they have the same amount of gun ownership as in America. This poses the question "Why is the US so different from other countries, in terms of gun crime?" This movie gives a very stark account of the serious gun crimes which have occurred in America, like Columbine and Buell( whereby a six year old child was shot dead by another). The CCTV footage of the massacre of several kids in Columbine High School was deeply disturbing, and the plea and sobbing from the headmistress in Buell did actually make me weep.To conclude, a movie like this should be made, to realise the the threats in the world is not only those from third world countries but those in your neighbourhood. If people are reluctant give up their guns, (due to constitutional rights) then more and more shootings will occur. They should have taken a leaf out the book of Britain, when all guns were banned from sale, after the tradegy of Dunblaine. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not a revelation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose one of my reactions to this film was "Gee, I thought everybody already realised that about America". I suppose maybe most _Australians_ realise that about America, and most Belgians do. Perhaps this film is more of a revelation to Americans. I don't know.Ok, I had a few problems with this movie. First of all I should say that I'm 'on his side'. Politically I suspect I would agree with most of Michael's opinions - but there are several times when the arguments he presents just seem incomplete, or occaisionally plain don't make sense.For instance:He frequently makes the case that Americans are driven into a fearful state by the media, which exaggerates danger by harping on about crime and violence. This is very credible. For instance, I believe that in 2001 or 2002 there were actually fewer terrorist attacks worldwide than in any year since 1961 - but to watch the TV....He even presents a statistic that crime rates have actually _fallen._However.... doesn't this undermine one of the main premises of the documentary: that violence in America is out of control? I mean, you can't logically argue that the reason that America is consumed by violent crime is because people have been duped into believing that the crime rate is out of control when it's actually falling. Am I just confused here?There were a few other things that bothered me. Some of his scenes, with the shooting victims, with Heston, smacked of the same sort of emotional manipulation that he seemed to object to in the mainstream media.And please remember that this documentary is just another version of 'the facts'. How do we know how many doors he had to knock on in Toronto, to find three that were unlocked? Don't get me wrong; I enjoyed it; it raised some good arguments, but it's thinking was erratic and unsatisfactory in many respects. I have seen far more compelling documentaries than this.Still, it was thought-provoking, and that matters. Perhaps the best argued point was the way in which the media keeps the public in a state of alarm (regardless of what the crime rate really is).I'm giving it about 7 out of 10, but if I were a conservative I would no doubt have been harder on it.(For the record, I've been to the USA many times. I was there on September 11, actually)</fullReview>

Do the people who are against this film, or who think it is propaganda or that it is 'made up', also believe that the incident at Columbine didn't happen at all? Or Moore somehow faked the whole thing to make his point? It is the only explanation I have as to why people have anything against this deserved oscar winning masterpiece, that is how stupid it is to ridicule a film of this nature. Those of you who I am talking to, go and put your I still know what I did last Summer DVD on and enjoy Sarah Michelle Gellar, that is probably about as deep as you can go. I welcome any response.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where did this film come from?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dont get it!? I have been waiting for ages to see all the Hollywood blockbusters just to be let down after seeing them realising that they were just a pile of hype.Then along comes this film, which I have never heard of before, and it was really good.Dont get me wrong, it aint ground breaking stuff, and picking holes in the American theory of guns aint hard, but it does keep you watching all the way. Although near the end it does feel a little too long.....As a European it is so easy to watch this and be disgusted at the bloody mindness of those who reckon guns are good and they have a "right?" to carry them. But I very much doubt that this film will have any impact on the American public what so ever, because for some reason they think the right to have a gun, made by some old fart years ago, is justified!?The chances are that if you are American you will hate this film and feel ashamed after. If you are from the other side of the water, you will be very surprised at just how funny this guy can be.And for Charlton Heston. Once a great actor, forever known as a mental case who loves the promotion of guns!Recommendedps: Why are all the reviews on this film all soooo long winded?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing is certain after you have watched this film, you will like certain people a lot less than before. Probably - the various American presidents who have been in office over the past 30 years or so, especially those whose greed supplied the Middle East with the weapons and the intelligence to fight against the US, (the people in power will always be safe from attack, it is the unsuspecting who suffer from the actions of those whose decisions matter - somehow). Definitely - Charlton Heston, generations of people have revelled in his performances being it from Ben Hur, Planet of the Apes or his cameo role in Waynes World II, but now he will be seen as a cold hearted leader of an organisation which has done much to destroy the lives of many (some may say all - psychologically) Americans. However Michael Moore will come out of this with a shining light greater than any before, detractors may say a driving force behind his work is to further his career, but his honest and truthful approach, and the fact that he isn't scared to do it, stands him apart from many of his peers. This film is incredible, in all its forms, and should be viewed with an open mind and the conclusions made from that. If you own a gun (and I don't) he is not picking on you but the system to which you have been brainwashed to believe is right, hopefully you will see the error of your ways, hopefully you will rid yourself of your (protection) weapon. Hopefully you will listen to what is being said - it is an important message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lightning of the terrible swift sword</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the documentary opens with the steady tempo of Battle Hymn of the Republic, I made a subconscious leap from "lightning of His terrible swift sword" to "thunder of the terrible swift bullets".Like many people, I'm sure, I am attracted to the documentary by Mr. Moore's gutsy statements at Oscar night. Each of the several subject matters touched on by BFC would take at least a books, and some a lifetime, to explore. The documentary is unquestionably successful in giving the audience a lot to think about, for a long time.BFC is well structured. I would try to see it in six acts, in roughly (but not exactly) the order they are presented.Act 1: Columbine Act 2: America the aggressor Act 3: White's fear of Black in the U.S. Act 4: Northern neighbour - Canada Act 5: Flint, and social problems Act 6: Crusades - Walmart and Heston One of the risks in presenting these subject matters is making sweeping generalizations. BFC does reasonably well in avoiding that. The documentary does take a view, and I have absolutely no problem with that as long as balanced material are presented. On this score, I don't have a problem with BFC either. As I said, it would take much more than a two-hour documentary to discuss these issues. What I'm going to do is just to make a few observations on things which I think are interesting.I'm glad to see the coverage given to Canada, and particularly Toronto, my home for over two decades. While it's only a small step, it's an improvement from the "moose-beaver-snow" mentality many Americans have when it comes to their northern neighbour.I like the statistics given about gun deaths in various countries although it would have been much better to have the figures as percentages of the population. However, the absolute figures here, while not ideal, do tell a story, as we see two or three digit numbers for all the other countries against the over 11 thousand in The States.Finally, I think the best "speech" in the entire documentary is by visually intimidating (to some) rock singer Manson. The viewpoints are expressed lucidly and logically, and certainly make a hell of a lot more sense than the "if you're not with us, you're against us" rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good up to a point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary clearly depicts the paranoia of the American nation at the moment. The core reason for this is the information fed through television. Fear the black man; fear terrorists; fear anything, and the cash will keep rolling in. The perfect consumer nation.The documentary is thought-provoking, up to the point where Charlton Heston is grilled by Michael Moore. This last interview is in poor taste and sadly, pulls the entire production down. It smacks of bias and in the case of Charlton Heston, it just doesn't have enough foundation. I left the theatre wondering why Michael Moore had to find a big time celebrity to justify the message in the film.Apart from this indulgence, the message is clear. Americans are pathetic in dealing with the gun control issues they created by themselves. I thought the inclusion of the South Park and 'bullet' cartoons were clever and entertaining, yet I have to question the validity of these cartoons as comments on social life and the history of the country. Also, the film is at least 30 minutes too long and gets seriously boring.Oh, and the use of the song "What a Wonderful World" in the film as well as at the end, was well, so done before. Pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great docu-movie. USA-citizens should start asking themselves some questions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just happened to see a documentary this week of Michael Moore, where he batteled the NRA's kids symbol "Eddy the Eagle" with his own made icon, ... a guy dressed as a gun (forgot how it was named, ... M.M.'s icon). A very nice documentary.At home this weekend my brother hired THIS movie. Based on the same issue and also by Michael Moore. My brother hadn't seen the earlier documentary, neither did I know he hired this movie, neither did we speak earlier to each other about it.Sad to see the hardships people had to endure in this documentary-movie.But I think lots of European people really do not understand the USA's need and love for guns. What I noticed most was that the USA has above 11.000 gun killings a year, .... and still they cry that it is their civil right to have arms loaded at their home.Okay, I understand that. I have civil-rights to in my country. But above 11.000 gun killings ??There is no other democratic country in the western world that has so much gun killings. The USA out-guns us other democratic countries, on killings, 1000 times multiple.Michael Moore made a sneaky comparison with Canada, ... a country of hunters and having 7 million guns, .. jeeZZzzz just see this movie.Personally, ... I hope someday the people in the USA WAKE UP and see and notice there is something really really wrong with your constitution.You are the only country, I think, that have "The right to bare arms" in the countries constitution, .... but you are also the country with the most gun killings. ... 1+1=2 ???Well, ... South-Africa might come close, ... it has lots of killings too.Still this should not be used as an excuse, for the USA, to continue the madness. It should be a lesson !!!But S-Africa is a whole different story. It still has an excuse, ... it is a democratic country reforming itself into a new kind of democracy, it never had before. People will be looking bad at S-Africa in 40 years time too, if they will still have such a high crime rate and killing spray.I can go on about it, .... but I think I better stop talking, before I will confuse the topic.See this documentary-movie, ... it is really great. An eye opener for USA people, .... I wasn't so shocked myself though. I'm am European, ... For me this strange and stupid USA madness seemed very logical.But perhaps USA-citizens should start wondering when ppl like me bother not and find this normal USA behaviour, ... ...Houston, .... ... Washington ... ... you got a problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Mike Bowls 'em Out !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not as fantastic as some folks make out. However, Moore's movie is a powerful, witty and often moving look at the USA and guns. The gist of it all seems to be that Americans are more likely to be killed by fellow civilian gun users than any other country in the world. Moore asks more questions than supplying answers but the whole project is intelligent and entertaining at the same time.BFC only falls flat near the end when there is an interview with Charlton Heston.With Heston, Moore is obvious in his questioning and really the lasting impression of this is seeing an old man being bullied. I am sure people will grasp the points made without seeing a decent old gent being heckled in such a manner.That said, BFC is a fascinating look at the flipside of Americana. Reccomended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Brilliant Documentary from Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those not familiar with Moore's earlier work, both as a documentarian and as a journalist/author, this is a great introduction to the brilliance of him and his inspired style.In this film, Moore turns on America's lunatic gun culture and focuses in on the results of it, specifically the horrific Columbine gun massacre and the 6 year-old on 6 year-old shooting in Moore's own town of Flint, Michigan. This is a great film for those who want a piece of cinema that will really stimulate them and make them think. Moore is superb throughout the film, pointing out the absurbities of the American attitude to guns in a way that makes you just shake your head in disbelief. He perfectly analyses the effect the American media has on white America, the way it breeds fear, which in turn creates the belief that every American must arm themselves to the teeth to protect themselves. The film is often hillarious, often moving and always thought provoking and and easily the most deserving of all the Oscars awarded this year.Moore's real talent is that he treats everyone he interviews exactly how they should be treated. He is sympathetic, kind and comforting to those who have suffered and he is merciless to those who inflict that suffering. He listens to those who have a genuine point to make (note the excellent Marylin Manson interview) and he lets those with nothing to say make fools of themselves brilliantly.This is a film that does what many films rarely do nowdays, it educates and stimulates. After seeing it you really see America in a different light and want to grab a pen and paper and give Dubya a piece of your mind. It is a terrific documentary and a terrific film. If you have any opinion on social issues, or you want to get one, then go see this film now.Terrific stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the americans have being controlled by their government, in such a way that they can't even see it. They believe in freedom, but exactly what freedom.For instance, the whole thing of being un-american is quite frankly ridiculous. One can argue that the heard the term 'un-deutcsh' from some obscure german politician, but in america, it seems to call someone un-american, you might as well call them 'Nazi fundamentalist terrorists'.You go on so much about your freedom. What freedom, journalists are fired for speaking their minds. Peter Arnett is a good example. The man was simply reporting what he thought was true, but he had to be let go because 'in these times of war, we americans have to pull together'. WHAT BULL.Another example is the The Dixie Chicks. When did it become such a crime to criticise your own president, who you elected (or tried not to elect) into power. All of a sudden, they are the official mascot for 'un-americanism'.I live in britain, and here the journalists have the freedom to report what the think is fair. I cannot imagine anyone be them famous or not, getting into so much trouble because they want to exercise their freedom to speak what's on their mind. Over here you get those that are anti-war and those that are pro-war, and you as an individual can hear both arguments and decided what side you want to belong to without the fear of persecution 'because we are in times of war, and we should stick together or else you would be hunted down and punished for you unpatriotism'.I do not want to go on and on, but i have just on question for all americans.

		<fullReview>ball games, the star spangled banner, moms apple pie guns, knives, paranoia, fearThese are the two sides of the silver dollar in the land of the free, and rarely are we shown the dark side. Rarer still is the fact that the dark underbelly of the most powerful country of the world is exposed by a citizen of this country, notorious the world over for its image of boorish pride where there is little pride to speak of. Continuing the trend of holding the United States up as a global showcase for moral decay, Michael Moore's film is as compelling and moving as it is disturbing and ultimately saddening. As an inhabitant of a city that has seen its fair share of arms related activity, I found this film particularly fascinating, even though the sets of circumstances between our two locations could not be further apart. When Samuel Colt invented the first rapid firing weapon could he have envisioned that the trend that he had set could have unraveled the very fabric of his country? Would he NOT have progressed would he have known that this would turn out to be the case? I liked the fact that this film did not attempt to villify the people who used guns, and did not paint the majority of gun users as crazed homicidal maniacs, but instead tried the reason the fact that the millions of weapons that are freely available in the United States really have no purpose and do not add to benefit the standard of living. Ultimately, every person who spoke of personal gun use showed a genuine sense of responsibility towards protecting something that they loved, be it country or family. The sad part is that no-one told them that they didnt have to use guns and take life to achieve this. The futility of the situation, the apathy of the people in authority and the intense paranoia of these citizens of a country kept me gripped for every second of this experience. The paranoia is linked directly to the citizens on this country being poorly informed by the media and the government. The scenes of the New York interviewees was frankly shocking and pathetic. To grasp at straws and try to provide reasons why a country directly next to their own had got the point and theirs had not was nothing more than a pathetic and misguided arrogance and ignorance. To live in a country whose government sees these evils happening to their people and chooses to take no action to subvert the means and ways that people can carry out these activities is truly beyond me. Thank you to Michael Moore, because if he has changed even one persons mind about the futility of weaponry in a supposedly civilised society, then thats better than the Bush administration can ever hope for. My heart and prayers are with every family member in the USA who has had their lives destroyed by all the tragedies depicted in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first tried to see this film at the arts centre cinema at the university im studying, both screenings where sold out, so when they announced that they where showing it the following month i brought my ticket in advance and the screening that me and a friend attended was sold out, and its no surprise, this documentry is one of the most moving, haunting and devestating films ive ever seen. Its funny, heart breaking, and makes you angry that a country as big as America is ruled by so much fear caused by the media and government, in providing a picture that no one in America is safe in there home and the only way to protect yourself is to get a gun, giving a nice tidy profit to the arms makers. One of the most haunting scenes in the film is the cctv footage from the columbine high school shootings, even though we thankfully do not see any killings what we see is scenes of panic, terror and chaos caused by two teenagers armed with weapons that have been purchased in shops, accompanied by distressing emergency phone calls over the soundtrack which will move and shock you. The interview with Marilyn Manson, provides us a picture of an artist falsely blamed for influencing the teenagers, yet shows him to be a very intelligent and sensible person who speaks far more sense than any politician in power. If you havent seen this film then please do as it is one of the most important, intelligent and essential films you will ever see.</fullReview>

I would say, although it sounds weird, it's the typical Hollywood kind of way of saying things: shout hard, maybe they hear you! The biggest problem is that mr. Moore doesn't give any real answers. He sometimes gives his cynical commentary to show how bad guns are, that's about it. The thing that bothered me the most is that it just took too long. After the first 3/4 of an hour or so the documentary just drags on and only at the near end it starts to get good again. I would definitely not give this documentary a 10.

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.It's a pretty interesting world, indeed, when a man is able to walk into a bank, open an account, and walk out with a free gun as a gift for joining. Situations like these may seem foreign to many of us, and Michael Moore is able to bring them to life in his breathtaking and ground breaking film Bowling for Columbine. Moore received high acclaim for the documentary, and it is rightfully deserved. Never have I sat through a film only to have the audience finish giving the absent director a hearty round of applause. A well deserved reaction indeed, for Moore's film is able to take us on a journey which is painstakingly real, and makes us all realize just how scary the world outside, and inside, our homes truly is. Moore's plethora of footage spans decades of interestingly related events on the use of violence in society, and the ghastly ignorance portrayed in those who use it. In between takes or Moore-shot footage and archive materials, the film captivatingly shows the intense battle of America's embrace with violence, guns, and fighting. Many interesting statistics, historical facts, and tidbits are given, but Moore is able to arrange them in a fashion which doesn't shove anti-gun tolerance down the viewer's throat. The most intriguing part of the film is that Moore states his opinion visibly without actually stating so. It's easily clear that he knows the hazards and hell of firearms in American schools and streets, but he cleverly presents the information to the audience and lets them decide their reaction on their own. He balances his views with counteracting points of gun-lovers, including NRA heartthrob Charlton Heston, and shows the fright of how they can coldly deny the problematic side of guns and, instead, sleep soundly with a loaded firearm under their pillow at night.Moore gives shocking footage here of the Columbine School Shooting, and takes two permanent wound victims to a K-Mart hot-shot and lets the bodily bullet holes do the talking. After the fact, the Kmart representative holds a brief press conference announcing the chain's discontinuation of firearm ammunition. Perhaps the fact that K-Mart won't sell ammo anymore will not stop shootings, or violence in general. But the movie as a whole, however, may make many people sit back and realize the true danger that could unknowingly occur within any of us. Moore tackles each little detail he can, on the never-ending search for truth on the subject of violence and why it exists. Not only does he interview an ex-producer of Cops, and suggests the importance of a could-be hit "Corporate Cops", but he goes so far as to interview shock rocker Marilyn Manson, the man blamed for much of the Columbine disaster. Moore asks Manson what he would have said to the murderers in hopes of deterring them from their actions. "Nothing," Manson stated. "I would have listened to them." I couldn't have said it better myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nation of gun nuts or just nuts?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extremely effective, if not rambling film that asks the question `Are we (America) a nation of gun nuts, or are we just nuts?' Director Michael Moore uses the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado as a jumping off point, then takes us on a journey that includes stops in Michigan, where it seems everyone owns a gun, a sit-in at K-Mart's corporate headquarters and an amusing side trip to Moore's idealized Canada. The movie is all over the place, and offers very few answers to the questions it raises, but I think it was Moore's strategy to present the facts and figures and get people thinking for themselves. Moore's everyman appearance is put to good use in the film's most effective scene. He talks his way into gun-nut Charlton Heston's Hollywood hills home for an interview, claiming to be a member of the NRA. Once inside he gradually warms Heston up before asking the hard questions about the consequences of living in a heavily armed society. Heston stiffens, ends the interview and walks away. Moore's camera follows him as he shuffles down a long hall. The Grand Wizard of the NRA is revealed for what he is, an old man, not the Moses of the gun movement. It's impressive footage that caps a film full of powerful images and ideas.</fullReview>

I can understand why this movie can leave a bitter experience to some people because it hurts, at times as it goes along in finding the truth behind the tragedy.No matter what one might think, Moore just established himself as a new sensational voice in the history of film making and Americans lives. Hopefully, more documentary of this kind will be produced in the future, because this is one of those movie that makes you think rationally and ponder about its message for hours and hours.

		<shortDescription>Michae's Moore's best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard a lot of great things about this film. Initially, I thought it was a film about how guns do not cause violence. Unfortunately, that's exactly what most people think it is--an anti-gun film. That is hardly the case at all, especially with a title like "Bowling for Columbine". I wonder if these people were watching the same movie or were a victim of extreme wishful thinking. The first 1/4 of the film kind of turned me off, because Moore came off as cocky, arrogant, and unintelligent. This is the setup. As I watched more and more, I started to realize that this was Michael coming into his own. Instead of the modest wit and humor we saw on TV Nation, we got a "harder" Michael Moore, one that was on a mission. It is true that a lot of the movie is entertainment and much of it was used to easily prove his point. Even though he didn't go into as much detail as many want, he's not exactly qualified to do so, and he doesn't need to. It is our job as intelligent humans to find out the information on our own. We shouldn't limit ourselves to edited news coverage to make up our minds about something. This is a wonderful film. I can see how Michael got an award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The people below who criticize Moore for splicing Heston's speeches are completely missing the point of the film. We have over 11,000 gun related deaths in this country each year. Canada has 161. Someone mentioned the population differences- if the US is 9 times larger than Canada then we should have approx. 1,400 deaths a year..but we have over 11,000! That is the point. What is it about American society that makes us much more trigger-happy towards one another? Is the blame on music, movies, or video games? The whole world eats that up. Moore claims accessibility, media-created hysteria/fear (Y2K, African Bees) &amp; racism are at the heart of gun issues in the US. 'NRA member' Moore maintains that the NRA is particularly racist and Heston does little to dismiss the argument. He makes some very dumb statements about gun control during his interview with Moore. It's particularly disturbing that he sleeps with loaded guns when he lives on large, gated estate and admits to never being robbed or burglarized in his life. Right vs Rationality needs to be addressed. This movie is bias, sad and important. Regarless of how you feel about "Bowling for Columbine" it is closer to reality than farther from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How important are guns anyway? and what makes america more violent? I honestly feel that this is the best movie of the year. It is a must see, you definetly get your money's worth. It is one of the best documentarys out there. And there is humour as well as truth. I learned stuff that i am glad I now know and was entertained. And the movie has a few celebrities in it. (the creator of south park, for example, and marilyn manson has his say.) I will defintely buy this one. This is as good as documentarys get. Now that i know about Michael Moore I will now have too see The Big One, Roger and Me, TV Nation as well as The Awful Truth. (and read his two books as well) 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore's "Bowling for Columbine" is the ultimate important film for every American to see. It is a fascinating and brilliant documentary about why we have so many deaths due to gun violence. There are no answers to that question in this film, but perhaps it is our jobs as Americans to find the answers ourselves. Michael Moore, using a combination of comedy and tragedy to get his points across, is a very logical human being. He can very simply and truthfully tell us what our own problems are, and the viewer realizes how right he truly is. "Bowling for Columbine" includes very real assassintation footage and disturbing footage from the Columbine shootings. There are too many sad scenes in the film to pick out the saddest, though. Some that come to mind are a montage of footage of assassinated leaders, played to Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World", that ends in scenes from the World Trade Center bombing, a visit to a school where one 6-year old killed another, and of course the Columbine shootings themselves. There are also scenes of humor, such as when Michael Moore talks to the brother of the convicted Oklahoma City bomber and he is completely unfamiliar with Gandhi's non-violent approach. One of the most redeeming scenes in the movie is when Moore brings two students from Columbine, who have bullet wounds from the shooting to K-Mart headquarters and it persuades K-Mart to stop selling bullets at their stores. And there are scenes which make you realizes how much of a-holes some celebrities are,such as when Dick Clark has the door closed on Moore and Charlton Heston says that he didn't know about the Columbine shooting when he had an NRA pro-gun rally ten days after the shootings. And the amount of shootings in our country to other countries is probably one of the most surprising things of the film, considering that gun sales in Canada are just as high as in the States. I highly agree with Michael Moore, but even if you don't, this is still a remarkable film that needs to be seen.....by everybody. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bowling for Columbine" is perhaps one of the most important pieces of work ever put together. Those who do not appreciate Moore's politics will find fault with it because of who made it, however this movie deals in fact and shines the spotlight on what America's news media refuses to. Moore suffers from the "Cult of Personality" of being Michael Moore, which unfortunately sends Republican's into fits of rage, and undoubtedly will bias some viewers; but the film is a brilliant piece of work, which every American citizen should see, whatever their politics.

		<fullReview>Very thoughtful movie and very accurate depiction of American life contrary to many posters from US. I have lived in South Carolina for 3 years while studying in the university. After just 1 month in the US I was able to purchase a gun in a store using my temporary driver's license. Purchase took about 15 minutes including 10 minutes of just browsing through great selection, the clerk ran my driver's license through police records and obviously nothing came up: I got a handgun. TEC9, AK-47, M-16 were all available to buy. I came to the store out of curiosity and did not actually think I will be able to buy a weapon.Another point Moore identified is a racial tension. It is also very real. You can cut the tension between whites and blacks with a knife.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the question; what is the answer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I found interesting about this film was that it considered the conservative explanations for violence (such as rock music) as well as the liberal explanations (poverty and the availability of guns) and came to the conclusion that none of these things can really account for the situation in America, given that other countries have music, poverty and guns, without the same results.Yet I'm not certain that the film's apparent thesis, that the American media's focus on fear and violence is that different from what is available in other countries. I sometimes follow the British news, and it also seems as if every murder, no matter where it happens in the country, winds up in the forefront.The film does show--rather convincingly, I believe--that people have become afraid, sometimes beyond the point of reason. The young student who was suspended for having nailclippers demonstrated how fear can overrule logic. I think it would have been an interesting point to explore: who benefits from a scared public? Obviously, papers and TV sell more, and weapons and security firms also do a brisker business. These things are mentioned, but briefly, as they are not the focus of the film.That is not to suggest that the question that the movie poses, considers, and does not really answer, is not an interesting one. It's something people should be thinking about: why is there so much violence in America (and is there, or is that just the perception left by the news?)? I just don't think it's the only question. To solve this problem, it's important to look at who benefits from a terrified public, and I suspect it isn't just K-Mart, who used to sell bullets, nor the TV station that probably has more viewers when it shows football games.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who cares if it's not perfect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Michael Moore has an ego. Yes, he has an agenda (translation: a point of view that some people disagree with). Yes, he can be occasionally misleading or irritating.But, who cares? This guy is consistently provocative and supremely entertaining. I'd rather watch one of his movies than a dozen standard political documentaries.Bowling for Columbine asks a simple question: why do Americans kill each other with guns at ten times the rate (or more) than in any other developed nation? Of course, Moore himself doesn't expect to find a conclusive answer. His search, however, is fascinating.Who else would even try to tie together themes ranging from gun control, to sensationalism in the media, to health care, to US international political violence, to rock 'n' roll, to corporate malfeasance, and beyond? It's a hugely ambitious juggling act, and we shouldn't be shocked or disappointed if Moore drops a few balls here and there.For example: no, Canada is not the harmonious, happy-go-lucky heaven Moore portrays. However, we take many things for granted that Americans can't even imagine (like universal health care).No, it's not a perfect movie. But at a time when the US is once again spending billions of dollars overseas on bombs, and billions of dollars at home to expand tax breaks for the rich, we don't need Michael Moore to be perfect. We just need Michael to be Michael (even -- or especially -- at the Oscars!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have spent a part of my life living in America and yes, I agree totally with Michael Moore's depiction of the typical US citizen. While living in the US, I learnt that the common American is a good-natured welcoming person who is sociable and friendly, more so than any of his European counterparts. Yet, to see common Americans displaying all levels of paranoia towards even the smallest print read in a newspaper or shortest phrase heard on the news channels is quite saddening. Michael Moore's documentary is an amazing piece of filmmaking that tackles this issue eloquently and articulates exactly what I feel about American culture. It raises the question "why are Americans conditioned to be paranoid?' what is the reason behind news channels to preach this fear. Is it Money? Ratings? If so what about the American government? Whose attitude to fictitious threats (mirror to the attitude of the common American) has made American policy a revered and hated notions in almost every foreign culture and drove America to almost ritually make a new enemy every decade or so; communism (led to cold war, north Korea and Vietnam) drugs (led still ongoing US military attacks against Columbian drug lords) and NOW Muslims and terrorism. By far the best documentary I have seen, its true that it will not change the fear-addict attitude of every American that sees it, yet "not every one who watches a Lexus advert goes and buys a Lexus, but some will".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an American living in the UK, I waited until I moved out to see this movie. I actually think it handles the gun hysteria &amp; violence fairly. The media &amp; advertising does give a culture of "consumerism through fear" which I always read about (e.g. "Manufacturing Consent" etc) but never realized until I moved out of the US. And Moore shows the NRA as it is, a group that moved from encouraging guns via sportsmanship (e.g. target shooting contests etc) to a quasi-fascist ultra-right political movement. The zeal with which they have "meetings" (which are Republican political rallies basically) right in the communities after there's a tragic shooting (school shooting) is disgusting. And Charlton "Moses" Heston's refusal to acknowledge let alone apologize for being insensitive to a community in mourning just reinforces the point. But the movie certainly doesn't blame it on the availability of guns alone. The NRA-Freeper-zeal (probably the ones who voted this movie with the lowest rating possible) is really overdone once again for these types that have a single knee-jerk reaction whenever they feel their "right to bear arms" is threatened. I think it's more based around the culture of fear &amp; death in America, not to mention the hypocrisies of the war machine (i.e. you can have Lockheed making enormous missiles to kill millions in suburban Colorado but the press turns the school shootings into a media circus).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore's film is a documentary look at guns and gun control in the United States. I found this movie to be extremely enlightening. He presented facts on crime rates involving guns for many countries, and presented the current issues surrounding guns very well. The tragedies that occured at Columbine and other schools in the U.S. have raised many concerns about the use of guns, and responsible ownership of them. The disourse of fear that he presented also rang some truth. The media and politicians contribute to the fear Americans have of others being more powerful than they are. And perhaps it is done on purpose. It was interesting that on the same day of the Columbine shoting, the president of the United States dropped more bombs on Kosovo than they had ever done before. This fact is overlooked becuase of the tragedy in Littlton, but it is important for him to mention this. They types of events do have an impact on the behavior of the citizens of America. Moore's depiction of American society was not so much an eye opener for me as a Canadian, but it should be more so for those who live in the United States. Awareness of the use of guns and the attitude towards the use of guns by Americans was depicted, and it is hard to see this when you are living in it. However, the view of those in only a few States was presented and this cannot be taken as a generalization of how all Americans view guns. I believe he should have explored the views of a variety of American citizens to fully understand the state of gun use in America. His comparison to Canada I found particularily interesting, being from Canada. We too have had our share of tragedies involving guns, think about the Montreal Massacre, but it was downplayed in the film. However, it is true that Canadians think differently when it comes to guns and are a lot less fearful generally. We do, after all leave our doors unlocked on a regular basis. Generally, this film has made me think about policies regarding gun use, as well as Canada's relationship with the United States. After seeing this movie I see the news in a new light, and I also see Canada in a new light. I highly reccomend people go and watch this movie, it is sure to stir up issues and make for interesting conversation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put, its the film that everyone should see. It raises issues not seen before, in such an innovative and interesting way about gun laws, government screw-ups and how the media incites paranoia and fear in citizens.Even if you are not a fan of Michael Moore's somewhat boorish attitude to documentary on the television, he is much subtler and grounded in this film. If you are a fan however, he remains the one of the greatest thought provoking documentary makers with really inciteful points being made throughout.Gaining access to Marilyn Manson, Charlton Heston and two of the boys who were paralysed in the Columbine high school massacre was a real coup for him and are used to great effect in the film so much so that I went from dismissing Manson as a shock-rock artist to a real person who is actually very sensitive to others and extremely smart - much respect to him for appearing in the film. My opinion on Heston however, remains the same, but i dont want to appear slanderous so I will keep that opinion to myself.In all, a fantastic film that needed to be made that made changes in the sale of bullets in a major supermarket chain and to make people think for a change instead of walking out at the end of the film thinking about what they're going to eat at the snack bar on the way out. More films like this need to be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few movies can actually make me change my political beliefs and can make me sit around thinking for a long time. I am not talking about movies like Caddyshack or Duck Soup, which I think about because they make me laugh. This movie shows a side of America I don't think has been portrayed by anyone. Michael Moore, who brought us Roger and Me as well as the show TV Nation is the brains behind the film.I live in the ultra-conservative southeast US. Gun rights are not only an aspiration where I live they are a motto, something like a religion. I am not originally from here but I am around it quite a bit. It was less than a week before I drove two hours to see this movie that I was arguing the gun control issue with various people who were not your most conservative people but were not as pro-gun control as I was. I saw it in the days leading up to Bush's election victory in 2002. I think this movie was very timely.This movie completely threw away my arguments on gun control. But on the other hand this movie presents an almost damning argument of American values and culture. Well on one hand it doesn't but on the other hand it does. It talks about how America is so paranoid and how it is a big business to make the world paranoid. I have heard many different things about corporate America but nothing like this.The movie talks about so many different things from television to crime. A lot of the stuff the movie brought out like how crime is not necessarily related to big cities I knew mostly before I saw this movie. There is an amazing amount of footage of the Columbine shooting here and I got a much clearer view of what happened that day.I have to admit when Michael Moore was in Northern Michigan and talking about all of the activity up there I got goosebumps. Moore showed me people I never knew before and I probably wouldn't want to know. His interview with Jim Nichols was brilliant. Talking to those former students was also interesting. It is amazing how stupid some people are. The part about Canada baffled me. A lot of what the people Moore asked I believed about Canada having almost no guns. It changed my view on gun control. But I came out of that movie looking at America in a different way. In the movie Michael Moore interviews Dick Clark, Charlton Heston, the father of one of the Columbine victims, Marilyn Manson, Trey Parker, among others. The interviews with Marilyn Manson and Charlton Heston were great. I do not like Manson's music but he was very smart and he had a lot of good stuff to say. The Charlton Heston interview I still can't believe it. He revealed his true colors in this movie. I don't want to give away too much but this is excellent.This was definitely a great comeback for Michael Moore. He was absent for a little while. His TV show the Big One went a little awry and he was absent from film for too long. This was perhaps his best movie out doing the excellent Roger and Me. And I have to admit even if Michael Moore really doesn't care he comes across really like he does and he is good at least at pretending he cares.In the movie he talked to people of all different backgrounds. Some of them were snobby some of them were not. I saw Moore and he talked to everyone equally. Other people are condescending in television, movies and the like to people that are lets say not white. He shows little if any prejudice to anyone. He listens to all sides and lets them talk. This movie is exactly what we need more of: open dialogue, people letting you know exactly what is on their mind. You don't have to like what anyone on here says but at least people are being honest for once. This is a brilliant documentary and I loved it. This is one of those movies everyone should see. Long live Michael Moore. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most important films of recent years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shocking, direct, upsetting, emotional, exposing, frustrating, painfully funny and very, very important, Michael Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine' is one of the most absorbing films you are ever likely to see.Moore explores America's gun-culture in a quest to work out why US citizens are so intent on killing each other. He explores the part played by the national media and the government in creating a country where people are brought up to fear one another. He provides interesting comparisons with other countries, and is able to dismiss inaccurate explanations of America's disproportionate murder rate by using the example of Canada, where despite even higher gun ownership than the United States, experiences a much lower number of gun-related killings.Some of the footage is disturbing, including CCTV footage of the shootings at Columbine, which even the hardest of viewers will find painfully upsetting.Moore tracks the record of the US government over the past fifty years, namely the part played in foreign affairs. He paints a disturbing picture of corruption, hypocracy and brutality and includes a frightening connection between the US government and Osama Bin Laden. One could argue that his inclusion of the images of 9/11 were unnecessary, but this is open to interpretation.Bowling for Columbine is a classic satire, but is better seen as an emotional roller-coaster. A speech by a father of one of the boys killed at Columbine had me desperately upset, but Moore's sarcasm when interviewing an accused (but freed) conspirator of the Oklahoma bomber was squirm-in-your-seat funny.I beg you to go and see this film as it is important for many reasons. For Americans, it is a reminder that you are actually safer than you probably think. Moore brilliantly explores this point, concluding that both the TV Media and the government, are selling you fear. The Bush administration in particular, has justified such an enormous military budget by scaring US citizens into thinking that it is necessary. Moore will make you rethink the way you look at America as a gun culture and as a culture of fear. You may leave the movie theater a bit stressed or bewildered, and probably horrified by your government, but it's worth it. Your overwhelming feeling will be one of relief that you have seen it. I trust that you will feel, as I do, almost a duty to spread the word.Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

At the same time, he clearly made this movie as himself, putting no distance between him the person and him the filmmaker. The whole film then a chronicle of the bewilderment of someone who cares about his neighborhood and about other people. For this reason, it is really easy to see the world through his eyes. In the movie, he's a real guy. He screws up some interviews, you feel embarassed for him in places, but you see why he's there.This movie needs to be burned into the minds of Americans.

		<fullReview>I watched Bowling for Columbine for the second time recently. The first time was in Laussane, Geneva and the second in Stoke-on-Trent, England. Both times every seat in the cinema were filled. I tell you this as I think it emphasises that the people of Europe are very interested in what Michael Moore has to say. I'm familiar with some of Moore's TV work (TV Nation, The Awful Truth) but haven't before seen any of his longer documentaries and films. Here he examines the thorny subject of gun violence in America, using two incidents involving guns as starting points and then trying to get to the root of the problem. The first half mainly deals with the Columbine shootings, with the montage of America's involvement around the world overlaid by ?What a Wonderful World' followed by the Columbine school CCTV footage being one of the most moving and horrifying things I have seen in the past few years. I think that the second half of the film contains a lot more emotion, the story of 6 year-old girl who was shot by 5 year-old boy in Moore's hometown seeming to have really touched a nerve in him. Throughout large amounts of information are presented to the viewer covering numerous topics and it can be a bit too much at times. But it's through this collection of information that connections are made, such as Lockheed Martin's name cropping up in the background to both incidents.Towards the end Moore does achieve a victory of sorts, with K-mart agreeing to remove 9mm bullets from its shelves. But really nothing has changed and that's what makes this documentary so very worrying</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** SPOILERS WITHIN ****** SPOILERS WITHIN ****** SPOILERS WITHIN ***This is the first documentary I have ever seen, but I am familiar with Michael Moore's work, so I wasn't surprised at the provocative nature of the film. In it, Mr. Moore asks the question: why does America lead the world in gun homicides?He looks at a number of different factors: is it shock rockers like Marilyn Manson (who sounds much more intelligent than his detractors)? is it violent video games? is it the proliferation of guns available to consumers?The answer to all of these questions is NO. Other countries have all those things as well, yet annual gun homicides are below one thousand, so what is it about America or its citizens that result in over ten thousand gun homicides a year?It's a very good question, and the answer may well lie within a short cartoon presented during the film: fear. Americans seem to perceive threats everywhere, from every angle. To illustrate this, Mr. Moore spoke with some Canadians, and they said that they didn't lock their doors, even after their homes had been broken into. Yet in America, a person who does that is seen as a victim waiting to happen.What does America have to fear? I wish I knew. And if I did find out the answer, I would tell everyone, and then maybe gun homicides would drop into four digits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Moore's latest documentary is honest and makes you think about the real problem of violence in America. Through the many stories he presents about what might cause violence in America, Moore makes you think, and think deep, about why there is so much hate and violence in the world.In my opinion, each and every 6th grader should watch this film, in hopes that it may cut down on the growing amount of violence in the world.The film is good, not great, but it does what most films don't.

		<fullReview>I have long time been a fan of Michael Moore, and when I heard that this praised movie would premier in Denmark, I was thrilled (to the point I had stomach ache the last 2 hours before the screening). I had great expectations, and I was afraid that it wouldn't live up to them....I was pleasantly surprised.For anyone who likes the revolver-journalistic style of Moore, this is a 2 hour feast. A usual Moore uses the old saying "exaggeration promotes the meaning" to bring out the meaning in things, the great thing about this, is you have to take an interest in the areas covered and know a little about as well, then you can lean back and be entertained by the razor blade of information, we call documentary.It is a joy to watch how "an ordinary guy" Michigan, who really takes an interest in the society he lives in, by putting topics on the edge. This is rare, especially within American journalism. The way he does it, shows his great love for the country and his willingness to take a critical stand, which equal to the "ordinary Joe" who actually cares, only difference: Michael Moore has a camera, a microphone, and a large devoted audience....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never tries to be fair, but so what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This message is a response to the posts below that accuse BFC as "propaganda" (quotation marks needed because the word itself is really neutral but most people use it derogatively as a given), unfair/biased, and/or even all lies.Personally, I loved the film. Nonetheless, I was glad to read about the ways in which Moore manipulates facts (generally, by telling only one side of an issue--an example being his failure to mention that Kayla's uncle ran a crackhouse). I don't think any less of the "documentary" if you insist to call it that; I only think differently of the issue(s) that BFC tries to address.First of all, it is unreasonable and pointless to demand an "objective" perspective from a documentary or any other representation of reality. Even if such a perspective really does exist (I think it doesn't), it or approximations of it exists in the intelligent viewer, not the film. Since the work is only two-hours long, there are bound to be facts and viewpoints omitted and ignored. No arrangement is ever innocent because there is, if nothing else, selection and prioritization. If Moore were to simulate reality as a cacophony of random opininons, BFC wouldn't even have the coherence to be watchable.Americans who accuse BFC as manipulative and "unfair" need to look no further than their own news media for a much more systematicexample(&lt;http://www.thenewamerican.com/focus/mcdonald/kal/kal2.htm&gt;). The American news media operate in a mode much more dangerous than the one BFC operates in because the former give the _illusion_ of fairness.Many of the posters I am addressing seem to be bothered by the category "Documentary", which traditionally has always been _supposed_ to be objective. Beyond the theoretical/philosophical impossibility of being "truly" objective, I suggest we not be stuck on a problem of categorization (just as the categories "fiction" and "non-fiction" are meaningful perhaps only to librarians and book-award contests). That BFC is in the Documentaries category in the Oscars means nothing more than just that.If BFC told you it tries to be fair (like mainstream US news media do), you could accuse it for its failure. But it is obvious from the start that Moore has a message to deliver, that he has a personal stance in making this film. The first scene with the ridiculous bank giving away guns is comical but immediately sets up the overall agenda. Whether the final scene with Heston is distasteful from an artistic standpoint, the message cannot be more explicit. Why would one demand objectivity from a film that evidently disregards it?The following is anecdotal and without reference, but I think reasonable and obvious. In a philosophy class my professor mentioned an experiment conducted on two groups of 15 or so people, one very pro-war (Iraq) and one very anti-. In a 3-day period, the 30 people were lectured on the historical, cultural, and political contexts and consequences of the war. Afterwards the researchers asked for their opinions again, and this time they became much more neutral.Whether you are convinced or not by the above, I urge try to think of BFC in a larger context (of films or media whatever), as _one_ opinion in a collective voice (along with the opposite opinions) dealing with the issues of guns and American violent culture that _taken as a whole_ will yield (an approximation of) objectivity and fairness.Just look at this forum for an immediate example. While the posts may be biased individually (some more than others), together they form a kind of social consensus that is much more valuable and desirable. Ultimately one text only says so much; "fairness" is in the critical and intelligent audience.</fullReview>

And in an american movie too! The movie rightfully received the "caesar" (european equivalent of the oscar) for best foreign movie.My recommendation: If you are going to see/rent one movie this year - get this one (and this from a guy who likes his splatter gory and his sci fi without a story!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever wonder why most of the world hates us? I just got around to seeing this movie at a small indy/art type theater in Washington. Apparently it has been playing there for the past 3 months and has sold out every show. When I heard that I thought there must be more to it then the critics were letting on - I wasn't disappointed. I was at the final showing and even then they filled the neck breaker seats. It's a open honest look at why we in America are so obsessed with guns, violence and racial friction and have thousands upon thousands of gun related deaths per year when countries like Canada, Germany or England have less than a hundred a year each. Did you know that? That statistics alone make it worth seeing the film. Just one of our large cities can rack up more gun related deaths then an entire European country! At first you blink and rub your eyes thinking "is this right?". Michael Moore asks all the right questions and then takes a hard look at our media and the role they play in working us into a mass frenzy. Shows like "Cops" and the nightly news are taking every incidence of violence and propping it up to make it look like someone of another color is committing a crime right around the corner from you at any given moment. There's an amazing interview with Charlton Heston that gives a peek into the conservative gun lover's mind and makes your skin crawl. Our whole country needs to see this movie.</fullReview>

I believe that in viewing this film, the outlook towards the glorification of guns may diminish and the real underlying causes of this `epidemic' in America may be realised.I recommend this movie regardless on your stance towards guns.

		<shortDescription>America the beautiful??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has always been a blunt critic of the corrupt politics and socio-economic problems rampant in America, and this film shows more proof of it. This is a movie that everyone in the US needs to see right now, especially as Americans become more paranoid and fearful of the rest of the world. My brother, currently living in Europe, cited this film as the reason he's decided it's no longer a place he'd like to live and therefore left. Having just seen the film a few hours ago, I can clearly see his point. Bear in mind, this film can be quite bleak and grim in its outlook for the future. However, with Moore's tireless (and usually thankless) fight against ignorance and injustice, you will gain some insight on what exactly has lead to the current chaos around the world and in the US itself. The film was funny, but I also felt physically ill and angry after seeing it. Some of the film is very graphic and difficult to watch (i.e. dead bodies, people being shot). Do not let the disturbing nature of the film stop you from seeing it. It will open your eyes.WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!!This movie examines why crime and violence has risen so dramatically in the US since the nation's birth, in comparison to the rest of the world. The argument is that the root cause of the violence and increased crime IS guns. Specifically, the NRA's continued efforts to distort the 2nd Amendment to their agenda, thereby guaranteeing every citizen's right and access to bear arms in the US, has been a disaster for the country. The film also indicates that the US media needs to be revised and gun control is badly needed.Before anyone argues against gun control and points out Moore's apparent hypocrisy (he is a lifetime member of the NRA, as he freely admits at least 2 times in the course of the film), Moore brings up a number of relevant points. First of all, he's joined the NRA to gain access to areas that would otherwise be closed to him, such as being able to tape at NRA meetings and interviewing head honcho Charleton Heston himself. The interview with Heston, which occurs at the very end of the movie, is both revealing and disturbing. Heston clearly comes off as both uncaring of the innocent victims of gun violence (in the film's example, a 6 year old girl killed by another 6 year old) and worse, a racist of the worst caliber. Furthermore, Moore heads up to Canada to compare that country's low crime rates (despite its equally well-armed citizens) and how Canadians' can feel so secure (to the point that they leave the doors to their homes unlocked at all times). The film shows how the US media has focused on scaring the American public to the point that people are paranoid and distrustful of everyone else. The local and nationwide news focuses on violent crimes and thereby increases the public's fear and distrust. This is contrary to Canada, where the news is about social issues (health care, education...). The NRA further agitates the public by insisting that an armed society is the best defense against anarchy, yet ignores the very chaos and turmoil they've helped create.The film also points out that American society is no more violent than any other current society or past society. He uses the British Raj, Nazi Germany and World War II Japan as examples of societies that were much more misguided in their respective eras. The question lingers, why is the weapons-bearing American public so much more disturbed than the rest of the world? The question will haunt you long after the film's end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is how satire is to be done. This is how critic towards the Bush administration, the rising war, the capitalism and the violence is to be done. This is brilliant and a lesson for everyone who wants to make a documentary, regardless of the purpose.There are many things to be learned here about the nowaday marginalisation in American media of not selling groups like poor solo black mothers and people living normal lives on normal conditions. One of the themes of the film is the greedy need in American television of frightening people in different ways. Moore tells us about the black mother who has two jobs, travels three hours a day but still can't afford the rent. Her son shoots a six-year-old to death. Moore walks in South Central as an unattacked white man. The interview with Charlton Heston is incredible, making Heston look like a completely media incompetent and stupid leader of the NRA. Why are there 11.000 murders in USA, while they don't lock their doors in the big city of Toronto? But you are left without any explanations except for Moore's own. If you try to think for yourself, you maybe not always agree with him. But his humour, compassion and anger is really a highly potent loaded weapon here. Moore is a dangerous man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant, terrifying look at American gun culture...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine has been named the best documentary of all time. Personally I can see why. The subject matter is something that needs to be addressed and Michael Moore does it with panache and a tenderness that is rare in movies these days. Moore is a satirical genius and proves it here. I have talked to some of my American friends about this movie and most agree that this indeed a fine film and they don't mind that he takes potshots at American society, in fact, they welcome such lampooning. But still some others I talked to gave me a somewhat typical "American" response (no offense intended). They said, "if he doesn't like it in this country he should just get out" and I said to them, the whole point is, he does love his country and thats why he made this film, he wants to turn it back into what its supposed to be, a great free land of oppurtunity. While Moore is not naive enough to believe this fairy tale he still likes to think America is more than the butt of the world's jokes, which it has become. Moore also shows us that perhaps this vision of America never really existed in the first place. In the middle of the moive is a great little cartoon about the history of the United States, and it suggests that American society has always been based on fear, therefore, the love of the gun and protecting oneself.One of the most effective scenes in the whole movie, and there are many, is the one at Columbine High School. For five minutes we see security camera footage from the day of the shooting. All we hear in the on top of that is the haunting guitar score , and 911 calls from the school and from concerned parents. It is a brilliant scene. When I saw it in the theatre, I have never heard a theatre so quiet before, except for the sobs of a few. I myself was left with my jaw wide open in shock at what I saw and at what I heard. In the myriad of 911 calls that you hear, there are a few in which news anchors are calling into 911 requesting interviews and such. In one such call an operator recieves a call from Dateline and is heard to gush, "I love your show!" this call in particular disgusted me the most. I got very angry during this scene as well as taken aback by the lack of compassion these news people showed as well as some of the "professionals" at 911.I don't want to give anymore away to those who may not have seen it. If you have not seen it I suggest you do. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 and I hope that Oscar will take it thumb out its butt and make it this years winner. If they do, it may make up for the "Hoop Dreams" travesty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is perhaps one of the most pertinent and valuable films to reach our cinemas in the past few years. Especially now (or indeed because of what is happening now) the probing of Michael Moore into the American obsession with its right "to bear arms" (which was actually their right to bear arms against the british, but this latter piece of information seems to be ignored) raises a lot of significant questions and even answers a few, that the world, and the USA, should be asking itself.Bowling for collumbine is surprisingly rich with emotion and heart. It is at times relentlessly hilarious and at others chokingly horrifying. The highlights are the animated version of American history which attempts to find a reason for the readiness of the average American to reach for their gun, and the integration of video footage from various shootings, including the one at Collumbine, where America's liberties came back to bite them.An array of interesting and quite different people are interviewed, the best of which are the brother of one of the men responsible for the Oklahoma bombing (who comes off as a particularly stupid redneck), Charlton Heston (the president of the NRA - who Moore interviews at his home), and Marilyn Manson, who was blamed for promoting violence and hate through his music because the two boys at Collumbine had listened to his music. Of all those interviewed, it is Manson who perhaps comes off most level-headed and thoughtful. His insight into the "culture of fear and consumption" is enlightening.Overall this is a superbly structured documentary, and one which everyone should see. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although perceived as anti-gun movie, this is rather a very serious attempt to discuss what makes America so different. No one likes to discuss why his country might not be so superior to others. It is especially difficult in America: democratic country, extremely technologically advanced, and the richest nation in the world. Yet there are serious problems with the Land of Free: domestic violence, international conflicts, hatred towards Americans. What makes us suffer this? Why those terrible events happen to us? This move has no answers, but it puts the discussion in to context. We might never find out what made those people to pull the trigger, but we might look what were so different about those people. More important, what is so different about our society comparing to less `conflicting' nations?Of course, there is no proof that the issues in the movie are relevant to the problem. It might all be just a coincidence. But, then again, we have to talk about it, or we will never change. This move - talks. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear is a powerful emotion. Fear of being belittled, fear of being robbed, fear of being attacked in your home, fear of authority, fear of being raped, stabbed, shot, laid off work,fear of your body size, your grasp of English, or your skin colour, marking you out as being different. The list is endless. Fear is a breeding ground for suspicion, and ultimately, paranoia. There's a short cartoonsequence in Michael Moore's "Bowling For Columbine", that demonstratesgraphically, that fear has been an integral part of the American psyche since the time of the Pilgrims, and how, ever since, that fear has been exploited. To the hilt This goes a long way in explaining why many American citizens, when pushcomes to shove, use a gun to settle their grievances. There are two sequences in "Bowling For Columbine" that stuck in my mind. One, when Michael Moore,his camerman, and two of the victims of the Columbine massacre, front up atK-Mart headquarters, to return the bullets bought in their store, and are now lodged in the bodies of these two victims. The second, is Michael Moore'sinterview with NRA frontman, Charlton Heston, who, it appears, doesn't realise he's been sand-bagged by Mr. Moore, and if he had (but that's Alzheimer's for you), Moore would have never gotten past the front gate! More alarmingly, is the way the media feed on people's fear, whether it to watch out for snakes, or to stakeout the funeral home where the service for the little six year old girl killed by a little six year old boy. This fear is buttressed by people from the President down. Now, post Sept. 11, money that was promised to be spent on making life better for ordinaryAmericans, via welfare, is going to be spent on war! - it's estimated that any war on Iraq will cost at least a 100 billion dollars!! "Bowling For Columbine" is probably one movie George Bush and his cronies SHOULD see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong: this is very good. I have seen/read quite a bit by Michael Moore, and I am impressed. "Bowling..." is important. Not for most people who have any knowledge about what a gun really is, but for the unenlightened who buy guns for "protection."Here are some things that I already knew before I watched this movie:1. Guns are designed to KILL (!!!!) people. That is a FACT!2. Buying a gun of your own only adds to the collective fear. "Oh, but I have to have a gun, because he/she has one, and he/she may want to hurt me."3. Holding a gun gives you a feeling of power. An inflated sense of self-esteem. This feeling goes away the moment you understand that the thing in your hand is meant to kill your fellow man, which means that someone out there is carrying a gun that could, sooner or later, kill you, whether it is intended to or not. If you do not buy a gun, then someone else will not feel threatened by YOU!4. KIDS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO HAVE ACCESS TO GUNS!!!!!!5. What will ultimately destroy the U.S. is the fact that the inhabitants actually fear their countrymen.One thing that illustrates my fourth point is a comment by an elderly gent after, I think it was, the Jonesboro shooting: "But I have taught them to use a gun properly", he said in disbelief.This documentary is important, but if you know all of the points above (which most people outside the U.S. do) it merely confirms your knowledge. I don't care whether Moore is a communist, a liberal (which in fact is only a bad word in the U.S.), or an extremist right wing fanatic; What he says is TRUE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Michael Moore. He makes highly interesting cinema about things that need to be talked about. Even if you don't agree with him he certainly starts a debate which is exactly what needs to happen on topics such as gun culture and gun violence. In fact this film deserves a high ranking just for being made and distributed this widely. I'm amazed that permission was granted for some of the material in the film. I bet Charlton Heston hasn't got the poster for this film on his wall.This documentary is an interest-grabbing mission to find out what lies at the heart of the USA's love of all things gun shaped. Further, why does the USA have such a high rate of gun related fatalities compared to a lot of other countries. His search takes him through historical, racial, media, political and financial arguments. The focus is the tragedy at Columbine High School ("Home of the Rebels"). Why did those two kids do what they did? Why doesn't this happen in other countries? Ultimately no reason nor solution is offered. The closest Moore comes to attributing blame is on the culture of fear whipped up by the media in the States. Particularly he focuses on fear of the black community. In the case of Columbine he can offer no definite reason, preferring instead to say that you might as well suggest that they killed those children because they'd been bowling that morning.I think the weakness in this film is that it's very much preaching to converted. It's easy to see that Moore is often traditionally political (for instance his emphasis on the the welfare to work scheme in Michigan). Anyone who's got a built in left-wing detector is not going to buy much of what he says. Yes, a lot of people have seen this film but I bet that most of them will be receptive to his message before the trailers.It's also a shame that he doesn't offer any form of solution. It's important yet easy to criticize. It's vital yet hard to come up with solutions.The centrepiece is a short animation from the people who brought you South Park documenting in a really funny way, the culture of fear and armed response. It's a pity that a certain Mr. Bush isn't forced to watch this every morning.This film is a triumph both as film and as agitprop. I hope Michael Moore goes on to make loads more documentaries on a lot of other subjects. The world needs him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is one brave man. If you want to watch a movie that has the bravery to show up, tell the truth of the authors plain and simple, no cuts, no PGs, no let's tease the public, no certain political views, just plain simple truths from a simple but wide mind, watch this Documentary.If you are a political mind, it will shock you, straight and simple. Even if you knew the points of the movie already, it will still shock you for its originality and bravery to show up these points on international cinema.If you're a simple person of no certain political beliefs it will make you laugh and feel great. It will make you feel great that are still free people in this world, still free people in america, that can just say what they believe, without caring what politicians and large corporations are going to charge.Michael Moore is one brave man, and one man that his future is uncertain, no one knows what chain reactions this movie will bring to his life and crew from politicians and corporations.A great thanks to users of imdb.com that voted and overall of 9 over 10 on a movie that truly deserves it.One great thanks to Michael Moore for being brave and making me cry for his bravery and strength in acting as he wants.One great example of human creation, bravery and self/public consciousness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Satire!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gun violence plagues the United States all too often these days. In the past five years, there have been several school shootings throughout the United States. And who could forget the most recent stint of extreme gun violence in our country but that of the Washington DC area snipers. Michael Moore, the director of such documentaries/ mockumentary films such as Roger &amp; Me, has chosen to make a film exploring why is it that America has such a love for guns, and why in America gun violence has exceeded that of most other countries in the world. It's a truly amazing satire of American society and gives a lot of good ideas as to why gun violence has become such a problem in the United States. As the film's title explains, Bowling For Columbine, generally focuses on what was the worst school shooting in U.S. history, at Columbine High School in Columbine, Colorado. (It's a shame that we have to refer to it as the WORST school shooting in U.S. history.) Moore explains that the boys who committed the crime went bowling at 6a.m. before school and then decided to do the shooting. Although the film takes a hilarious aim at explaining America's love for guns, it also takes a very dark turn in showing the video surveillance tapes from Columbine High School the day of the shooting. Moore concludes that America is so prone to violent acts with guns because of fear. However, fear of what? In a short animated skit in the film, Moore shows the history of America starting with the pilgrims coming over to the New World to escape prejudice in their homelands. When they arrive, they seem terrified of the Natives who already inhabit the lands and shoot them. The cartoon shows American's as frightened and constantly shaking in fear of anyone or anything that is different. And the only way they solve anything in by eliminating the problem by the barrel of a gun. It proved to be an extremely funny animated short film that is a pretty good, if not far-fetched explanation for America's love for guns. Moore also shows interviews with famous celebrities, and archival footage of political leaders throughout the years. As for celebrities, Moore interviews Marilyn Manson, whose lyrics have been blamed for violence among his younger listeners for several years now. He actually provides some good explanations for America's infatuation with violence and the news. After all, doesn't the media seem to sensationalize everything in the news. But another point that Moore tries to make in this film is that you can't blame entertainment for violence in society. It's just entertainment. Everyone has fantasies and desires that border on mental breakdowns. Who doesn't want to be that hero who saves the day? And the classic symbol of that hero is that of the man with a gun. Entertainment simply shows what the people want, in film and music. If people are blaming the entertainment industry for promoting violence, and anything else for that matter, then why don't they blame the Bible? After all, the Bible has specific references of violence. Oh sure, it's to set an example of morality. But guess what, so sometimes do film and music. It's just a form of art and entertainment, not to be taken into reality. One point that Marilyn Manson makes in this film is that perhaps people should've tried to listen to the boys of Columbine High School who committed the act, rather than having teased or manipulated them, as did occur. Clearly the boys had serious issues to deal with, or they were mentally unbalanced. The best parts of this movie occurred towards the end. Moore does an interview Moses himself, Charlton Heston. After all, wouldn't it make sense to interview the president of the NRA about what his thoughts as to why gun violence occurs so much in the U.S? And why not find out why Heston chose to have NRA rallies in the cities affected by school shootings as soon as ten days after the shootings. Heston didn't feel that it was the least bit insensitive, even after such appalling events had taken place. Also, it's necessary to point out that during the interview Heston couldn't even explain why violence has plagued the U.S. He tried giving some vague explanation at one point, in which he concludes that gun violence is so high in the U.S. because of so many different ethnic groups living together. But it was recently disclosed that Heston suffers from Alzheimer's disease, although he is in the early stages of the disease. I wonder if perhaps he was being affected during the filming of this documentary. Honestly folks, he's admirable as an actor, but in reality he seems like a very shallow person. And wasn't this the guy in the original Planet Of The Apes who was slamming his fists in the sand on the beach looking at the destroyed Statue Of Liberty while yelling, `You maniacs! You blew it up. Damn you. Damn you all to hell!' I guess we can conclude that Heston is for guns, but against nukes. In conclusion, Bowling For Columbine is definitely one of the year's best films. Certainly worthy of viewing, and plan on laughing because there are moments in this film that are hilarious in it's explanation of America's love for guns. But as I stated above, there are also a few moments that seem disturbing to watch. It's important to point out that this film is really not totally against guns. It's not trying to challenge the second amendment, which reads: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. But it is important to point out that what existed in the late 1700's does not exist today in the U.S. It was a time where the average American hunted for food, and guns were necessary for protection because it was a time of our countries revolution. But in 2003, I don't think it's necessary, at least in some areas of the U.S. for the average person to have an automatic weapon or weapons used in combat situations. Moore has done a superb job in directing this film. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Response to Interesting but Biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank you very much for putting your comments up on the IMDB. I very much enjoyed your insight on this film and I would agree that looking back on the film Moore does seem biased at points. There are only a few comments I would like to address. First I would agree that many people who own guns are very sane, controlled individuals who use guns for hunting and recreation. I personally do not have a gun but I can understand that some people would like to have guns, no problems here- they do have that right. I think the reason that Moore focused on people with maybe a higher profile is because his movie was really a question needing answer. It seemed that he desired to show a reason such a high gun related homicide rate could exist in the US. I will say I very much agree with you point of view however I want to challenge you to keep thinking about this, I noticed you are from Canada but it seems from your review you are also concerned with issues raised by the film. Here is my last thought... I too think that Moore became the hero of the film but I am not sure he intended to. It seems that this film actually did a few things he didn't intend to. I think that the theme of 'American's running Scared' brought up by the middle section of the film (including the 'Brief History of America' cartoon) is a good theme. However I did think later that this film could be the next thing to be scared of and if a person watching it thinks afterward that all gun owners are crazed lunatics or fanatics then it turns the film instantly into a piece of propaganda. This film really seemed to take on a form of its own, which is good, but it could go against the film-maker's intention completely if not discussed and thought about. Thanks for your time and I hope that any of this will only further provide provoking thought. Please feel free of obligation to respond however I would enjoy any other insight you would like to share on these or any issues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfocused but entertaining mish-mash of a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to confess I came out of this film a little bit disoriented and confused. After thinking a bit more about it, I reckon that Michael Moore's "Bowling for Columbine" is more style than substance. The humour in the film deflects ones attention from the lack of coherent logic that the film as a whole suffers from. It just goes to show that once you have won over your audience through the sheer power of charisma and humour, you really can cover over any inconsistencies in your argument.For example, throughout the film we are intermittently reminded of the violence inherent in American foreign policy. I can only assume he is therefore linking this in some way with the shootings at Columbine and the violence in American society in general? But he then goes on to apparently reject this view during his interview with Charlton Heston where he tells us that other countries such as England and Germany have committed similar atrocities in their past but yet suffer from violent crime to a far lesser degree than the US. So is there a link between a nations foreign policy and the level of violent crime suffered and perpetrated by its citizens or not Mr. Moore?Furthermore, having apparently concluded (through his observations on Canada) that the number of guns available in the US is not the main source of the outrageously high number of shooting fatalities in the US, then why is the NRA and in particular its president, Mr. Heston subsequently demonised in the climax of the film? Heston and the NRA are undoubtedly guilty of gross insensitivity but does he personally deserve to be put forward in this film as public enemy number one? I also found the request for an apology for the death of a 6 year old girl from Mr. Heston a tad melodramatic on Michael Moore's part (though the apology may have been for the insensitivity shown in holding a gun rally so soon after this childs death, in which case I am mistaken).Despite these criticisms (and others unmentioned), I'd like to congratulate Moore on the making of an entertaining and thought-provoking documentary whose most valuable asset is that it will undoubtedly promote debate on the serious topic of violence in today's society ...</fullReview>

It really works.This film is great social commentary, and I was impressed by Moore's style of documentary. Did he edit this? Whoever did edit this was good.If you like this movie, and question certain things about America, I suggest seeing "The Iraq Campaign" which is a nicely edited 10-minute-or-so piece which I am sure Moore has seen.

		<shortDescription>Another sociological wakeup from Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moore follows his great work in "T.V. Nation" and "Roger and Me" with this topical examination of America's love affair with guns. While governmental and corporate spin specialists keep us fearful and distracted from our true best interests, almost 12,000 Americans die each year from attitudes concerning and availability of firearms. Though weapons in the home are perhaps forty times as likely to claim the life of a resident than an intruder, the NRA makes certain that the least stable among us have almost unlimited access to the deadliest firearms. The total gun violence and suicide victims in our country each year would almost fill Madison Square Garden, yet a year's firearms victims in Canada, Australia and Great Britain combined could easily be tucked away in any high school gym. While Moore's documentary asks "Why?" of the moviegoer, the facts as presented leave little room for doubt. One wishes that he had alsodealt with our foreign policy, since its roots grow from the same poisoned soil and it bears similar tragic fruit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some real questions raised, with some great answers materialising before your eyes. The juxtaposition of the humanity, humility, humour and stupidity makes this an unnerving, thought provoking and compelling movie. When a friend went to see this film at a local independent cinema, it was given a standing ovation by the crowd, which is a pretty impressive feat amongst us British :) Everyone should see this as it is a REAL documentary, well researched and presented- not without flaws, but with a lot of incredibly valid points that people really should take the time to consider. It is as interesting and educational for those living outside America as it is for those inside. The insight given by the responses gained from the people that Michael tackles is incredibly important- he manages to capture some of the essence of the problem in its rawest form. The film was already a success before it was screened because of the positive events that happen during the movie. I hope movies like this make a larger kind of positive change, and hope to see a lot more of this kind of thing. Cinema is one of the only mainstream channels left to send out relatively untainted messages such as this and these opportunities should be embraced by the public. Seeing `Bowling' certainly couldn't do any more harm than the subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that the real 'eye-opener' in Moore's film is that his focus is that America is being driven crazy by Media. Radio and television pound the drums that we are alone, defenseless, and under attack. And, if you would buy(consume)a weapon, you would be so much more secure. Just like your deodorant,toothpaste,and automobile makes you so much more attractive and, even more successful, a gun will give you a sense of security. These are dangerous times, and I wonder why America's organized religon is silent. I mean, clearly there is a need for a feeling of safety and a sense of well being and government has done nothing but aggravate this need. Moore shows us those guys in Michagan fumbling around in the wild with their semi-automatic weapons, but they come across as a bit dorky. But, in their defense, they are only trying to satisfy this sense of security. And, Marilyn Manson comes across as the only 'spokesperson' with any sense. Looking like a skinny, albino racoon, he deftly strikes the heart of the film with his white-hot intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping, as only Moore can be (or, Clark really is a DICK)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has done it again - with class, with absolute integrity for the people whose lives this tragic story affects, with a courage that comes through the screen in his relentless pursuit of the corporate and political giants who, unlike Moore, runaway when faced with a tough challenge and with a sincerity that belies the "There's no way to win this war," moral of the story.While he tends to go off on tangents to fill the 2 hours, it all does make sense on reflection. The big issue is why are we so violent and while it would be easy to say that it's just the second amendment and we need to repeal all gun laws, Moore (the NRA member himself) does NOT take the easy way out. He efficiently and skillfully disavows this argument and proves that the insidious beast just might be (shhh) the media. Not violence on TV or in video games or in movies or in music, not the 2nd amendment, not our brutal, violent past, but just maybe the media's "If it bleeds, it leads," mentality. The fact that he never specifically states this, I feel, is the quintessential, meaningful true moral of the story. He can't really say it or would they really let him release this movie nationwide? That's what I was left wondering.Kudos to Charlton Heston for actually granting Moore the interview (Would you expect anything different from Ben Hur?), but he could not handle the difficult questions regarding his inability to perceive how families traumatized by violence might just feel a little more victimized by his crass appearance at NRA rallies in those areas right after the senseless violence.Dick Clark's complete impassivity towards the suffering of the single mother who worked at his enterestaurant is appalling and noone who has a conscience should ever eat at the Dick Clark's Bandstand, watch his New Year's Eve krap show or allow him to invade their homes through their television for any reason ever. He's a piece of s*%@ and cares first, last and always about making a buck and nothing less. Simply put, he's a part of the problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one is a fan of Michael Moore's work than one might be a little surprised with this one. Moore is of course best known for such movies as ROGER &amp; ME, THE BIG ONE, and his TV-series THE AWFUL TRUTH. These were highlighted with complete irreverence and off the wall humor. Although there is still some of that here, it also becomes much more serious and dare I say powerful. This is probably what makes this documentary a standout and what may propel Moore from simple cult hero to a serious even important filmmaker. The film is a basic essay on guns and violence and how our society seems so much more violent prone than others. A critic may say this whole thing is simply liberal propaganda. Certainly Moore has a agenda and some of the information is selective. Yet the points they do raise are quite valid. Moore seems willing to explore the ugly complexities behind the issues without having to dress anything up. He gives you the stats, gives you the theories, backs up the theories, and even takes some good shots at such giants as the media and big time corporations. In a way his style of clothes is similar to the presentation. He's a blue jeans and T-shirt guy. He practically always has a scruffy old baseball cap on. The caps may change, but they are always scruffy and old. No matter where he goes or what type of 'important' person he meets, he is always dressed this way. His directing style is the same type of way. It's eclectic, but never flamboyant. It doesn't try to align itself with anything, nor does it talk down to you or preach. Instead he just tells it to you the way he sees it. By doing it this way he gets you to consider he's viewpoint without making you resent it.  The film also grabs you emotionally without having to push it. The frantic 911 recording by a school principal when a 6 year girl is shot by another child seems far more gripping and tragic here, with it all played out instead of having it just a 10 second sound bite on a news program. The grainy black and white images of the Columbine students hiding underneath tables at the schools library is truly chilling. Especially when the images of the attackers comes in and they all go running. This just seems very real and startling no matter how many horror movies or other violent scenes you may have seen. It may be to early to call this a classic, but it certainly does weave you through all the human emotions. Like every great documentary, it also has those completely unrehearsed, unexpected gems. One includes a talk with James Nichols, brother of accused Oklahoma City bomber accomplice Terry Nichols. The interview is already highly lucid throughout, but his final comment is just unbelievable. It also has a shot ( no pun intended) of Charlton Heston speaking to a group of National Rifle Association members, while surrounded by a pair of bullet proof shields. Chris Rock's routine on the "$5,000 bullets" is funny and way too short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling observation of a psychotic country</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is somewhat bemusing to see this movie portrayed as a comedy. True, there are humorous moments - but the humour is poignant, satirical and invariably derisive of America, specifically its capacity for self destruction and its fixation on violence. This is a movie every American should be compelled to watch, in the vain hope that as a society it will garner the communal courage necessary to rid themselves of the evil of weaponry, in the same way that England and Australia have responded to acts of evil committed by firearms - declare them illegal and remove them from their owners. But what Michael Moore clearly exposes, is that while real estate agents declare the failure to carry lethal firearms "unpatriotic" and misguided, pathetic actors become poster boys for racist gun glorifiers, such an eventuality is unforseeable. Can a whole culture be diagnosed as psychotic? Moore's evidence is compelling. Drawing a correlation between its global propensity to extreme violence, and its citizens' similar tendencies towards each other, his hypothesis would seem to be that US society suffers a serious and unique psychological malfunction. It is tragic that a country filled with kind, generous and caring people can collectively become a deranged and dangerous nation. The contrast is captured brilliantly in this movie - the chilling footage from the Columbine massacre on one hand, and the response from KMart to two victims of that horror on the other.

		<fullReview>With "Bowling for Columbine", director Michael Moore proves how closely real life can be positively affected by films and film makers. Not only does his own conscientiousness come out through his work, we also get to see how he is absolutely unstoppable in his mission to get the truth out. America is a gun crazy country, and has no reason to be so. It is up the "Crazy Creek", and knows only to shoot its way out! Wonder how this film would be received if it had been made by a non-American!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is the satirist of our time. Not only that, he is one of the few real heroes of our time. He is Chomsky for the people, a truly special individual in a time where there aren't many people making statements as powerful as this. The American present (2002) is a very gray period (very difficult to put a finger on what these times mean and where we're going), and Moore distills it down with ease. If every American saw this film, we would have a much better society. Now THAT'S a film of incredible stature. The brilliance of Moore's satire is that he uses real people to do it. He exposes their hypocrisy and makes it look easy. The structure of the film also moves gracefully, keeping you consistently attentive and curious. In an America obsessed with celebrity and consumed with fear, we need more films/books/albums in the counterculture light that Moore could lead. Will he? With a cause so honest at its core, it could be incredibly successful. In the next 10 years, there may be another enormous counter culture movement. 9/11 didn't set it off. I believe more films like this could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must See Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I really liked "Roger and Me" and "The Big One", I think that "Bowling for Columbine" is Michael Moore's most important film. It explores the topic of gun violence in the United States. But its not your typical boring documentary. It is both extremely funny and extremely sad. The main goal of the film is to figure out why the United States has so many more people die of gun shots each year compared to every other country. It raises many questions and encourages the viewer to rethink their views on guns and what causes people to shoot others.The film focuses on many different people including John Nichols (brother of Terry Nichols who blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City), rock star Marylin Manson, South Park creator Matt Stone, Chris Rock and NRA spokesman and famous actor Charlton Heston. Each person has his/her own take on the rights of people to have guns, why people shoot each other and how to stop violence. The movie goes beyond the quick and easy solutions the news media likes to give to this problem such as video games, rock music and violent movies. This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time and maybe the best film I have ever seen. It is really entertaining and takes on a very important topic. Everyone high school age and up should see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly great film - and so what if it's subjective?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plenty of people have praised this film already, and I can only add a "me too" in that I think this film is brilliant and should be shown to schoolchildren in America - of course it won't be, for all sorts of reasons. This film covered a LOT of ground. Its use of footage of the Columbine massacre was heartstopping and entirely justified; the footage of Charlton Heston intoning the words "from my cold dead hand" while brandishing a rifle was sickening and chilling, and I have no sympathy for him. Some people think he was stitched up by Moore, and/or that as he has Alzhemier's Disease he should be left alone. Well, if he'd stop holding gun rallies in places that have just witnessed carnage such as as Columbine, maybe there'd be a valid point there. Besides, he seems up for the interview and not obviously doolally. I don't suppose he will feel that he's lost out much from the film.The film is also extremely funny at times, prompting guffaws of disbelief in the audience at the cinema in London where I saw it - which also contained a lot of Americans, incidentally. My favourite bits are the incomprehension at Moore's question about Gandhi's peaceful methods; "thank you for not shooting me"; and the animated history of America.One point I'd like to add (and it may have been made earlier) is that documentaries do not have to be neutral. The charge of "bias" is meaningless here: this is clearly a polemic, and Michael Moore is perfectly within his rights to edit and shape the film any way he wants to, so that it best supports the thrust of his arguments. The interview with the former acquaintance of Timothy McVeigh was truly chilling, although I don't think any tricksy editing was required to achieve that effect - the man is clearly barking!I think Moore puts a most persuasive case as to what is behind the gun-fuelled malaise in the USA: poverty (exacerbated by politicians) and fear (stoked by the media) make for a pretty combustible combination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this one in the UK, but recently having visited the US, this was a thought-provoking study of what makes the US so notoriously fiream-reliant.A different experience to what I'm used to seeing in the cinema, this was the *reason* I wanted to see this. Something which wasn't afraid to go without a plot.It is, of course, a documentary, pure and simple, masterminded by the irrepressible Michael Moore, a man who's managed to show up so many political and social institutions in various ways, to the extent of convincing so many of his viewers that a ficus plant would actually do as good a job in congress/senate as a politician. And who would argue with him...In terms of this, he's gone for the jugular - this is obviously a man who is fiercely patriotic, to the extent he's made a career of attempting to right the wrongs - a one man morale crusader, if you like. And he's really done quite a good job with Bowling. I don't wish to 'spoil the story', so to speak, but it becomes clear that he's come very close to identifying the problems which face the US - pretty much all of which, it has to be said, are of their own doing.He doesn't oversensationalise at all, he seems to tell it like it is - common sensically.There are many moments where testimonials from interviewees make those interviewees look insane, and indeed, one might say that's the idea - to exploit these people into looking deranged, and clearly the problem. But the truth is they bring it on themselves, with a touch of editing, perhaps, but it's clear the influences on the American society which the movie explores have quite blatantly affected these people to an extent you don't see elsewhere in the world.Without giving any more away, I suggest you view this for yourself. It's a fine piece of current affairs, with the occasional hint of intended dark humour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent start, but hardly a conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was impressed by Bowling For Columbine, and particularly impressed by Michael Moore's trademark doggedness in pursuit of answers. The impressive rate of gun violence in America is almost impossible to understand, and thankfully Moore decided to treat it that way -- not as a problem of gun ownership, or history, or violence in all forms of entertainment. As he astutely points out, all of those things exist in other countries that still manage to log annual gun-related deaths in the double digits. Over 11,000 people on average are shot to death every year in this country, and nobody really understands why.Now, it would be impossible to expect Moore to actually answer that question in three hours or less -- and he doesn't. He makes some interesting points about culture-wide fear (leading Americans to regard everything from plane travel to bean-stuffed teddy bears with anxiety), and manages to get a very unilluminating interview with Charlton Heston, but in the end the movie left me disappointed. Not because I had expected an answer, but because Moore failed to maintain a consistent inquiry into the issues. One of the most glaring problems came in a segment in which Moore helps (or encourages?) two Columbine victims to take a stand against K-Mart, where the two Columbine shooters purchased their ammunition. Moore, an NRA member himself, has just spent at least 20 minutes discovering that rates of gun ownership (which usually means owning ammunition as well) really have nothing to do with the propensity for violence. He tells us that there are 7 million guns owned in Canada, where the rate of gun-related deaths is miniscule in comparison with our own. So, we've abandoned the hypothesis that legal ownership (hence, legal sales) is the problem. But now we take a moral stand against K-Mart? Yes, it's frightening (and hilarious) to watch the 16-year old K-Mart clerks drop live ammunition, but what point does it serve? If anything, it undercuts the complexity of Moore's exploration, reverting to a simple and overused explanation that simply hasn't proved either effective or true.The other truly grand-scale problem with the film was Moore's inability to overtly discuss important issues that he raised tangentially. Again comparing Canada to the United States, he briefly interviews Canadians regarding universal health care, the (non)existence of Canadian slums, poverty, and rampant unemployment. What he does not come out and do at any point is discuss the political structure that guarantees health insurance, safe neighborhoods, and welfare checks to Canadians -- socialism. The flip side of this problem is that he fails to properly address the socio-economic issues of the U.S. -- issues that are clearly relevant to our culture of violence. Moore shrugs off the issue of inner-city violence as little more than a myth, attributing the idea to white fear of black people. I am not convinced. From what I see in the news, African-Americans are involved in American violence -- in large part because of the untenable situation in which they live. How can you expect people to get well-paying jobs and own comfortable homes when they can't get a good education because the homes they own are in lousy neighborhoods with no property value to fund the schools? It's ridiculous, and without blaming the entire murder rate on the black community (yet another highly unfair general assumption), Moore does have to do something other than deny that a problem exists. His concentration is in the (mostly white) suburbs of America, where gun violence has certainly become a problem (if a much smaller problem than the media coverage would have us believe). Here is the crux of the movie's problem: 11,000+ people die every year in this country because of guns. Less than 1% of those deaths involved suburban school shootings. Moore has a great question with a slightly skewed focus. With a slightly broader scope, he could have had a great film on his hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary was the best thing I'd seen for a long time. It even won the first unanimous jury vote at the Cannes Film Festival. Michael Moore gathers gut-wrenching information that really affects anyone emotionally and then proves what our country has done through humor. If taken open-mindedly anyone can learn something. Bowling for Columbine may not appeal to some people -- heaven forbid, it makes you think. My mother saw it with me and it scared her. She said she was more paranoid than she was before. But I suppose that's just her opinion, I thought the movie was great. A must see. 5 stars two thumbs up and all that good stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A synthesis of what's wrong with America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before posting this message, I read through a lot of the comments for both this movie and "Roger &amp; Me." Moore's critics are generally of two stripes: 1) those who accuse him of distorting the facts and 2) people who call him "too liberal" and accuse anyone who dares like his movies of being too liberal as well.What I think people are missing, however, is that Moore, liberal though he may be, isn't telling his audiences what to think. He's presenting a picture of the United States that, though most people don't like to look at, is what many people see, particularly people who live outside of this country (at least people I've met and relatives of mine from outside the States).I don't think this movie is a "Guns are Bad" movie. What this movie is really about is the "culture of fear" that Moore talks about in the movie, of which a "culture of stupidity" is closely related. The genius of Michael Moore is that he never walks onscreen and says, "OK, this is what I want you to believe." The juxtaposition between the U.S. media (Killer Bees! Y2K!) and the Canadian media (Potholes) is humorous but telling at the same time.Even before 9/11, the masses in this country were already preconditioned to panic. His point isn't that "guns are bad." His point is that we don't have a society that's mature or evolved enough to handle guns properly. Is some form of Canadian socialism the answer? I personally don't think so (as a conservative myself), but giving corporations tax breaks and sh***ing on the poor isn't a solution either (or truly conservative).It's hard to summarize my feelings on this film. I don't agree with everything Moore says, and I do agree with people who say that you shouldn't take everything Moore says and gobble it down with a big fat spoon. But Moore would probably tell you the same thing, and I think that's the point of his work. His clip of Bush talking about the "general alert" was also dead on; there are too many people today unwilling to think about anything that's happening in our world. If his "liberal views" bother you that much, I feel sorry for you, because he represents such a small portion of the population that isn't threatening to the mainstream views in any way.See this movie. It will make you think, even if you don't agree with everything he says. I don't (I thought his Canada/U.S. analogy was off), but still enjoyed it tremendously. 9/10 rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant examination of the mentality of modern America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, so I'm British, and I don't really know what America is like. But if 1% of your population are as crazy as some of the guys here, I may just cancel that trip to New York.Michael Moore is one of the best left wing writers around at the moment. His most recent book 'Stupid White Men' is an examination of the 2000 presidential election and the general state of the US at the moment. It is both hysterically funny and utterly thought provoking. Much in the same way, 'Bowling for Columbine' is superficially a documentary about the constitutional right to bear arms, but Moore also manages to work in some more general material about US history.This being made by Michael Moore, it is no dull, passive or detached documentary. On the contrary, it is both funny and moving, and Michael Moore wears his colours so boldly so as to completely reinvent the concept of a documentary as being unbiased.There are several stand out passages. The film opens with Moore going to a bank which is claiming to give away free rifles every time a new account is opened. This gives Moore the films best line : 'Do you think it's a good idea to be handing out guns in a bank?'. There is the shocking montage of gun violence, showing, for example, a man blowing his brains out in slow motion. Shocking too is Moore's history of US foreign policy since WW2, an account of all the dirty interventions made overseas in the interest of 'national security', culminating in footage of the first plane hitting the WTC. Sensationalist perhaps, but effective. The animated history of the US is one of the funniest cartoons you will EVER see, showing the genesis of the US as being a bunch of paranoid, fundamentalist bigots, and outlining the reasons for class disparity in the US today.Moore travels the length of the country to try and find reasons for the national obsession with guns, going to Columbine (from which we see harrowing CCTV footage of the massacre there) and Flint, Moore's hometown, where a 5 year old boy shot dead a classmate. He also travels to Canada to see why there is no gun problem, and comes up with illuminating answers about their strong welfare state.But the piece de resistance comes in the form of an interview with arch enemy Charlton Heston, president of the NRA. Moore quizzes the frail man at length a to why he made visits to Columbine and Flint in the wake of the tragedies there, prompting Heston to walk out. In a final move that borders on being sanctimonious, Moore leaves a photo of the dead little girl in Heston's palatial home.Yet this is a minor qualm. No other documentary maker is as brave as Moore is, and anybody with even a passing interest in politics or current affairs should see this; you will find the film a powerful and enlightening experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Moore's film was very good, it made me think and laugh quite a bit and I did enjoy it. However, I have a few beefs with it. The first is how Moore manipulates the numbers. Fine, we here in Canada have fewer gun murders than the US (11 000 to 165 in the film), however, Moore fails to mention that the US has a population of 250 000 000 and that Canada has a population of 30 000 000. Thus, it is more important to look at the ratio of murders than the actual total number, because it is ludicrous to compare two countries' murder numbers, especially when one country has 220 000 000 more people than the other! This is a however a great propaganda movie for the left and you gotta love it when actors look like idiots, eh Hestin?? 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore bowls a strike with his latest documentary about gun-violence and the culture of fear and paranoia which grip the United States and it's citizenry everyday.Already becoming the highest-grossing documentary in history, a feat it accomplished in 4 weeks, it has now also added a National Review Board award for best documentary to go with the only Unanimous Jury award handed out at the Cannes' Film Festival in 55 years.Finding the film near you unfortunately is easier said than done since it is only playing in roughly 220 theaters throughout North America. In addition to the fact it has received very little attention from the major media outlets. Possibly, due to the fact he uses the film to point out their nature of reporting violent crimes more often even when crime was on a downturn.The movie has some off points including Moore's tendency to jump off topic at times. This film does not deal with the gun control or guns solely, but focuses on the more important issue at hand why do we use guns the way we do? and Why do we as Americans have so much fear of our fellow citizens?Moore never explains why he just points us in several directions he feels are noteworthy and could lead us to an answer. Overall, I give this film a 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The phrase "this is a must-see film" is so overused it barely bares any meaning anymore (One of my best friends told me "Spiderman" was a must-see film earlier this year...gag.)Michael Moore's "Bowling for Columbine" may be the first, true, without-a-doubt must-see film since "Schindler's List." It is so meaningful -- so subversive and so different from a lot of the ewonderfully entertaining but ultimately empty tripe on the screen nowadays -- I don't know how he got this movie so widely distributed.It is NOT a gun-control movie; I have some conservative friends who liked it simply because Moore makes a point to not make this a gun control movie (Moore is in the NRA, an accomplished marksman, and understands the complexities of gun culture). It does start as a gun control movie, but ends up in a completely different place. The whole point is that it can't be the guns, so what is it that makes Americans so violent?This is not as affecting as Moore's other masterpiece, "Roger and Me," but it is even more important. Whether you agree or disagree with Moore's questions, at least this film asks a vitally-important question. In times like these, we need more thought-provoking movies such as this. I do not always agree with Moore, but I was moved by the courageousness of this film.One of the great non-fiction films of all-time and easily one of the top three movies of 2002. 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely stunning movie, and a must see for anyone that really cares about being a decent global citizen, and that actually sees the truly good in America, even amid all the nonsense that this film so excellently exposes. Even though I gave it top marks, for which it rightly merits, I have one small comment. The fact is, you cannot buy ammunition in Canada nearly as easily as this film shows (remember the Canadian 'Wal-Mart' scene?). The truth is that you need a Canadian Federal Gun Ownership license (not that easy to get) to buy any ammunition up here, let alone guns. Also, their are a whole host of Federal gun laws that you have to follow once you get a permit. Michael must have edited out the scenes where the Wal-Mart clerks up here would have asked for the appropriate gun ownership papers and license. Finally, the vast majority of guns here in Canada are for hunting, and for the most part are in rural areas, not in cities. Handguns and 'Assault rifles' are thankfully quite rare. Having said all that, Canada can easily play the role of 'straight man' for the true 'punchline' in any movie, any time, if it is for a worthwhile cause. This is a great movie, and Moore richly deserves all the top honours for his brave efforts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never watched a documentary film before, but this one sounded so interesting that I felt I needed to see it. Luckily for me, a good friend of mine felt the same way, so off to the movies we went. I'll tell you, after seeing this movie, I now want to make the documentary my favorite film genre--I'm definitely going to the local Blockbuster to do some exploring. I think this pretty much sums up my reaction to BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE...it was FANTASTIC! This movie provided more entertainment than any 10 other movies I've seen this year. It does what I feel a good movie (or book, or any other entertainment form) should do...it elicited different responses. I laughed much more than I expected to and my jaw dropped on numerous occasions due to sheer surprise. I agree with some of the flaws critics have noted...sometimes Moore does target the wrong people (e.g., going after Dick Clark because a woman who worked at one of his theme restaurants for minimum wage is a mother of a little boy that accidentally shot and killed a classmate). However, this movie will inspire a lot of talk after you see it...I certainly have talked about it with my family, and I'm hoping I inspired them to go see the movie themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a great experience. This movie is outstanding, exceptional, unbelievable. I just saw this movie in a large cinema in Berlin, it was full, even if the movie was in original language (this is NOT normal for Berlin) and the entire cinema applauded heavily after the movie was over. Moore is a very brave guy. So much courage! This man has balls! Talking like this to the K-mart guys and Charlton Heston is just like attacking a dragon with a sword. Wow. I want most of all George W. Bush to see this movie. Maybe somebody needs to explain it to him... however. The movie is imho the best explanation of the "American phenomenon" -- 10,000 murdered people per year (!!!) compared to around 100 in other countries -- which exists so far. The USA managed to create a multinational billion dollar industry based on fear (!) and they willingly accept the "collateral damage" in their country for the sake of this profit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film the other day and it wasn't mind blowing or anything like that. I found it well made and informative. People who claim that it is mind blowing obviously came into the film ignorant before hand of the facts thrown at them during the film. Sadly, these people mainly happen to be from the one country that shouldn't be ignorant of these facts. In Ireland we have a press and media that have given us these facts before in discussions about the problems that the US are going through. This also happens in most European countries. These discussions obviously are not taking place to a sufficient degree in the US leaving the nation ignorant. Therefore, this documentary and any other piece that tells the people how it really is, is essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shootings at Columbine was a horrible incident, but "Bowling for Columbine" is a great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the few great movies that stands above them all. It's different, it's funny, and it's disturbing. Not only do I believe that this movie has earned every award it has received, but I also believe it should receive every upcoming award it is categorized in. This movie will give you a realistic look at gun violence in the U.S.A. and other foreign countries, and then satirize the hell out of it. This movie will have you laughing your head off. And then you'll stop and the movie will become serious. Then funny once again. Not only is the docu-comedy worth seeing, it's worth seeing twice.Have fun watching this great flick, but then realize what a twisted country we live in. What is wrong with us? Why are we so violent? Why do we always shoot first and ask questions later? Why is it that the government seems to be doing everything that it can to tone down the violence in our nation, but is getting no where? Look at your evening news or your newspaper headlines:"Murder." "Shooting." "Killing."Violence is all around our nation. When is it going to stop?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether you agree with Michael Moore's politics or not, you have to admire him for setting out a goal and accomplishing it. He takes no prisoners in this film, nor in any other film or T.V. ventures. From getting K-Mart to ban the sale on handgun ammo in one day to getting Charleton Heston to admit he's a racist, he takes the gun control argument and runs, all the way to Canada actually. And funny, the most intelligent comments made in the movie were from Marilyn Manson, who is portrayed as this evil, demonic icon actually has a lot of interesting things to say. At its worst I cried like a baby, and its best I laughed and applauded with the rest of the audience. Michael Moore succeeds in his biting commentary by not really making a comment at all. He asks many questions, gets many answers, and lets us figure out for ourselves what we see and believe. Some accuse him of being flippant and noncommital, but making an hour and a half documentary listening to him ramming his opinion down our throats could get a little boring. See this movie. Then go rent The Big One, Roger &amp; Me, and both seasons of The Awful Truth. Your head will be spinning at the end of the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film. Even though having read and heard quite a bit about this film, it was nevertheless a mind blowing experience. Ok I'm exaggerating a bit, yet this film is a masterpiece and should have been made quite some time ago.Moore is ruthless, bitter and dead funny in his film and thus successes brilliantly in showing how absurd and perverted the American gun craziness is. He shows a lot archive footage from TV networks, goes so far as to return the merchandise (bullets still in the bodies of two surviving victims of the Littleton High School massacre) to a supermarket chain, analyzes several theories why the death by gunshot rate in America is so high and interviews a lot of people (including Marilyn Manson, Charlton Heston and Timothy McVeigh's best pal). It is a film that makes you laugh, cry and angry at a time.This film is a serious kick in the ass for the Americans and George W. Bush should watch it closely. Instead of bombing around like a madman he should start by looking for causes for the terror act in his own country.It is a great film and leaves you thinking long after you've left the cinema. This documentary, the first documentary presented at Cannes in years, is an important film, a real must see. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that I was speechless after walking out of this movie. I have seen all of Moore's film, read his books, yet none of them affected me the way this one did. I think that everyone in America needs to see this movie. Although the main focus is of course on gun control, the message of this film resonates much further. We as Americans have come to be so arrogant, not only to the rest of the world, but towards our own problems. The reason that Columbine happened, the reason that a 6 year old was shot in Flint, is because this country has turned a blind eye to it's own people. Instead of helping those less fortunate than us, we ignore them. Hey, it doesn't affect us directly, so why should we care? The sniper attacks would have never gotten past one victim if it were for stricter gun laws. THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO WAKE UP AND REALIZE THE STATUS QUO IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH! We as Americans need to change our way of thinking towards the rest of the world, and most importantly towards each other. If we don't then the next Columbine or Flint is going to be right in our own towns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent movie that does not come off as a liberal anti-gun rant. What was amazing was that Moorer went beyond the usual "guns kill people" position. He explores the other causes that lead to the terrible gun violence problem that America seems to be cursed with. What he finds is a country of fear. As Moorer demonstrates, we fear everything, we respond to shows and leaders that we think will help us get over this fear. However, they are the ones that are selling the fear in the first place. Perhaps Moorer got a little sappy late and perhaps he was too hard on the broken down joke that is Charlton Heston, but this was a great and often amusing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gun Crazy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentaries offer an immediate response from viewers very different from scripted fictional films with actors. Because they purport to show the "truth" , documentary films offer a "you are there" feeling that is palpable. But just as fiction films are molded and shaped by their creators , so-called "real-life" movies are also a product of sleight of hand. The director , screenwriter , editor , cinematographer and music composer of a documentary can just as craftily manipulate audiences around their cinematic fingers as easily as any story film makers can. This is not to say that there aren't any documentaries out there with an honest point of view ; many fine, even great "non-fiction" films exist. It's just that the nature of the beast in nearly every case precludes a totally objective point of view.This is certainly true of Michael Moore's riveting and often disturbing new work, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. A relentless examination of America's fascination with guns and their connection to the alarming escalation of violence and death that plagues this country, Moore takes the viewer on a frightening tour to the heart of middle America's homes, schools, survivalist groups and discount retail stores. The picture that Moore persuasively paints is one of a country consumed with fear which is exacerbated by the constant barrage of television news that endlessly offer up alarming reports of domestic , street and blue collar crime. The Media is an easy target for Mr. Moore to skewer, and one of the most damning displays of television's shallowness is the scene where an on-location reporter changes moods between takes for a news story of a child's murder in a local school. On-the -air the young man is grimly serious ; when the tape stops rolling he seems to lose his temper at a co-worker , then jokes about his windblown hair which is in bad need of mousse. Hairstyling becomes the off-air topic , a sharp contrast to the event being reported.Director Moore makes much of the fact that the United States has the highest civilian casualty rate of deaths by firearms than any other country in the world. To expediently prove his point, he heads to Windsor , Ontario and other Canadian towns and cities and interviews everyone from the average man on the street to local police chiefs , asking why Canada's death- by -gun rate is so low in a country where guns are easily purchased and seemingly everywhere. The average Canadian interviewed by Moore seems mystified by the American attitude that one's family must be protected at all costs , when almost all Canadians keep their house doors unlocked! There are many hilarious moments in Moore's film. Some unfortunate individuals unwittingly become the butt of the joke when explaining their philosophy of life. A Michigan Survivalist group is mercilessly put under Moore's microscope, and the more questions asked, the more bizarre the answers.The most chilling moment of the film, aside from a fleeting home video shot of the planes smashing into the world Trade Center , is the video monitor tapes re-playing the actual black and white footage of the killing spree inside Columbine High School.Interviews with Littleton residents become surprisingly gut-wrenching when a person suddenly becomes too choked up to talk. Moore, thick -skinned and aggressive in his tactics when questioning proponents of gun use, shows a soft, compassionate side to people who have witnessed a school killing.As with ROGER AND ME , his 1989 film which dealt with his quest to meet the CEO of General Motors and confront the man on his decision to lay off 30,000 workers, Moore saves his best for last.But that last scene may leave many viewers with conflicting feelings. Earlier in the film news footage is shown of actor Charlton Heston , President of The NRA, speaking at rallies near locations where gun deaths have just recently taken place.Director Moore decides to make the trip to Beverly Hills for a confrontation with the famous Academy Award winner at his home.When Moore arrives at the fortress-like gates and talks into the speaker phone, Mr. Heston answers. Moore tells the actor that he is a card carrying member of the NRA (true) , that he's a director making a film and would like to speak with Heston on the "gun control " issue. Heston responds by saying he has guests but tells Moore to show up the next morning when he will have " a little time" to talk with him. That interview in Heston's home the next day is intended to be the film's big pay-off ; it's obvious that Moore's intention is to nail Heston. There is something very disturbing about this scene. Moore's painstaking efforts to make a point backfire here. Although Heston's beliefs may be reprehensible to many, the fact that the actor graciously invited Moore into his home and was so rudely treated in return is simply bad manners.All in all, this is an important film. Just be aware that not all the blanket statements made by Moore are necessarily accurate. For the most part one can't help but admire the man's tenacity. The fact that he got K MART to completely relinquish their stock of firearms and bullets in the presence of two surviving victims of the Columbine shootings is proof that good things can happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main quality of this movie is that it makes you think: it does not deliver a canned message, ready for thawing, but a series of observations and thoughts, respectful of the viewer's intellect. Not to mean that Moore doesn't have an opinion, or that he doesn't show it, but he does let you think for yourself, and I find this extremely valuable. The movie has fantastic rhythm, great ups (TV reporters recording their talk about some shooting event and talking about their hair style) and downs (footage from Columbine high school) which make it flow through the subject. The different tracks offered as food for thought are varied; I only wish the question of who benefits from weapons violence had been addressed more forcefully, more directly. Another negative point, which makes me give it a 9 instead of a 10, is the fact that Moore loves himself and puts himself in front of the camera all the time. I'm not sure it was indispensable, no matter how much I like him and what he does. Still, GO SEE IT, it's great.</fullReview>

Not necessarily ground-breaking, but putting all the images and facts together in one place is definitely disturbing and thought-provoking. I truly believe that making people think is what he does best. We seem to have forgotten how to think - perhaps that is what has lead to our obsession with guns and killing.

		<fullReview>I am a BIG fan of Mr. Moore's films but they are never perfect. Bowling included.Someday, he will produce a film that is tightly focused, not overstated, and presents another side without a sneer. Until then, we will have to settle for extremely funny diatribes that provoke thought but open themselves up for dismissal from those on the other side of the argument.The film is completely on point about the culture of fear. Any one watching the events in Washington D.C. over the past month can understand why the USA is in fear. But why is there wall to wall coverage of a psycho while Al Queda is attacking targets around the world? We are being to taught to be afraid of each other rather than legitimate evil. (This is not to say that the sniper wasn't a legitimate story, just over done.) Mr. Moore's coverage of the killing at Beulla Elementary makes an extremely tight case against the hair-dos that pass as reporters.I heartily recommend this movie, I just wish it didn't wander (welfare to work?) and picked on the right targets (Dick Clark?). Go see for yourself and be prepared for a long night discussing the film with friends.</fullReview>

As he is walking up the driveway to confront Chalton Heston, chairman of the NRA, we hear the theme song "It's a Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood" from the Mr. Rogers childrens show.

		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine is a terrific movie that deals with an issue that everyone should think about, and thus, everyone should watch this. Whilst the Constitution may say we have the right to bear arms, sometimes you have to think, 'Isn't it time for a change?' And this film isn't afraid to ask that question. Why, without change where would we be? But that's not what's being discussed.Michael Moore has done a bang up job with this debate, and I believe the polling reflects this. Interviews with George Bush, Charlton Heston and Marilyn Manson, to name a few, and the film really leaves you thinking, unlike a lot of other snooze and cruise documentaries that you just don't care about. That's where this one differs. It offers a lot more because it's something that's becoming less of an issue and more of a crisis.Watch this movie, it's sure to make some kind of an impact on you and your way of thinking. I got to rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bittingly satarical commentary ever American should see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can look at this film from many perspectives. Being born and raised in Canada and now living in the United States, I can see what Moore is trying to show America. It's his satirism of the subject that is the most appealing.Moore takes the viewer on a hilarious sometimes shocking ride of America's love of guns. Some particularly ironic moments involve a bank in Michigan that will give out a free rifle for every new customer who opens up an account. Another involves some interviews with some Canadiens in Sarnia and Toronto who tell him they are not afraid in their communities and don't lock their doors. So to test this theory, Moore heads to Toronto and starts finding he can walk in to just about any person's house!Jokes aside, there are some very contentious issues and images later shown and talked about. What seems to get to the heart of the matter is America's fascination with violence and flat out fear of everything and anything, which Moore pounds into the viewer relentlessly.In the end though, Moore has a tendency to get side tracked to a degree, throwing in everything from Bosnia, the middle East, to heading back to Flint and describing a violent incident in a school where a 6 year old girl was shot by another child of the same age.Other statements made are quite loaded, but the film succeeds because it will get people talking which is what America needs to do about this issue. One of the most enjoyable films of the year and a film every American should see love it or hate it.Rating 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning and Shocking, Deeply Necessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen many great movies, but Bowling for Columbine may be the first film I can honestly say I think everyone should see. To some members of any given audience, it will likely be life-changing.Moore takes on a difficult and controversial subject: America's love affair with the gun. He not only discusses (and shows with footage that would leave anyone shaken) tragic school shootings like the ones at Columbine High School, he examines why America is so unique in its shockingly high number of gun murders (over 11,000 per year). The reason he uncovers -- that it's not video games, TV, music, the breakdown of the family, poverty, unemployment, or even gun prevalence -- is ingenious and spot-on.Though the focus also includes other subjects, like America's history of violence with the rest of the world and the world's perception of Americans, the movie never feels like a sociology paper. Moore's humor is as provocative as ever, if not more than ever, and much of it is damn funny. Even some of the parts that are downright disturbing get laughs. For example, John Nichols (the brother of Terry Nichols and longtime friend of Timothy McVeigh) -- a man who was involved in the Oklahoma City bomb plot -- is funny even as he frightens us with his views on why guns are necessary; he sleeps with a loaded .44 Magnum under his pillow.The insights the film provides into the history of the NRA (of which Moore is a longtime member) are also eerie and enlightening. Quite noteworthy is Charlton Heston's explanation of why America suffers from so much more gun violence than Britain or Australia or Canada. The answer is simply too good for me to spoil here.See this movie. You'll laugh and quite likely cry as well (and you may feel the urge to vomit at times), but you'll go home far more educated and aware of the realities of one of the great social problems in American history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Chinatown, Michael Moore's evocative, brilliant, scathing, and deeply touching documentary attains what is called "Third Cinema" in moments of downright hilarity, brilliant investigative film-making, and sorrow. Meaning, he's documenting historically what our gun-culture has done to us- he's really galvanizing change.This film moved me to tears while simultaneously had me on the floor in stiches. Not many do that.*** SPOILERS ***Three things that I can't stop thinking about-1) When he was interviewing Canadians, and the one Canadian man said "When Americans lock their doors, they feel that they're locking people out. We feel in Canada that when you lock your door, what you are doing is imprisoning yourself. You're locking yourself in."2) The Charleton Heston interview, in which Moore brilliantly and achingly captures Heston's hypocrisy and ultimate pitifullness, culminating in leaving the picture of the six-year-old girl who was shot by a fellow first grader at Heston's estate (Heston had held an NRA gun rally at the exact same town wherein the girl was shot following her murder)3) The visit to the K-Mart Headquarters with the two Columbine survivors, one paralyzed from the waist down, after having bought out a local K-Mart of all their ammunition, brining it to the headquarters, MAKING the CEOs and directors take notice and actually make a statement recalling all ammunition from being sold in K-Mart stores within 90 days. Powerful stuff.This is one of the most important documentaries ever made. Everyone one, American or otherwise, should see this- it provokes thought, anger, action- it galvanizes you.

		<fullReview>I had been eagerly anticipating this movie since I had heard that Michael Moore had won an award for it at Cannes. Now, they don't hand out awards at Cannes for nothing, so I knew this movie was going to be exceptional. Rich in humor and insight, this movie sees Michael interviewing Marilyn Manson (the best!), Matt Stone (South Park), Charlton Heston, Dick Clark and a corporate suit at Lockheed Martin in Littleton, Colorado, to figure out why America is full of guns, fear and violence. Marilyn Manson's music was blamed for the Columbine massacre and yet Marilyn provides one of the most thoughtful and insightful comments in the movie. Michael points out that the media takes most of the responsibility for the fear in US society. I was expecting this movie to be pro-gun control and that is not the case. The NRA has nothing to fear from the release of this movie. In fact, Michael is a longtime member of the NRA and won marksmanship awards when he was younger. At the beginning, he is seen opening a bank account in order to receive a complimentary rifle. This movie is a definite must-see.</fullReview>

This is the first Michael Moore film I've watched and I was pleasantly surprised at how funny, sad, powerful, quirky and insightful both he AND his film are. It's primarily a documentary about guns in America but it's really about so much more than that. The film's recurring question is: Why does America have more gun-related deaths than any other country? There's a staggering moment in the movie where it compares the number of gun-related deaths in other countries with those of America: Canada has like 99 a year, France 150 a year, England 196 a year; but America has 11,120 a year! And Moore spends the movie trying to understand why. The film's closest answer is that America, more than any other country, has always been paranoid and afraid. There's an amusing but disturbingly accurate cartoon midway through the movie that depicts the evolution of America from the time of the Pilgrims to the present and how fear is the main underlying factor responsible for the violence and wars that shape America's legacy.Two major surprises in the film are Michael Moore's interviews with Marilyn Manson and Charlton Heston. In spite of Marilyn Manson's blatant weirdness, you have to admit that the guy had some valid, sensible things to say about the Columbine incident. And concerning Charlton Heston, I never thought he could be so chilling and misled (after all, this is Moses!).Regarding some comments here lambasting Michael Moore for his unorthodox approach to documentary-filmmaking: I think that this is his strength. He's an American original who's not content to just point his camera and roll film. In a world where you see more talk than action, it's touching and commendable to see Moore take a pro-active approach at the end of the film and get Kmart to stop selling bullets and firearms. Moore is like that naughty-eyed, restless kid in class who managed to get the teacher to hold class outside one particular afternoon or to not give homework over the weekend one Friday; your parents tell you he's no good and even the teacher doesn't like him, but you harbor a secret admiration for him: because he says the things you want to say but don't quite know how, and he does the things which you wish you could do but don't quite have the guts to.Put another way: Michael Moore is Robin Hood with a pot belly; maybe even Alexander the Great in jeans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore holds up a mirror to America....do you like what you see??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny to read some of the comments here that say Moore isjust another gun hater who is trying to deny Americans their right tobear arms. He never says this, nor does he imply that the high rateof gun ownership in the US is to blame for the high number of gunrelated deaths. Instead, he makes the case that Americans armthemselves and kill each other at such an alarming rate becauseof the climate of fear that they live in, one that is continually fed bya media and culture that promulgate a notion that we arethreatened by crime and vicious predators far beyond what the realstatistics show. Not surprisingly he also points out thatgovernment and corporate criminals are much more of a threatthan the bogeymen we are brainwashed into fearing. As for the laughs at the expense of some of his interviewees, Ithink it has always been one of Moore's favorite tactics to let hisinterview subjects hang themselves with their own ridiculouscomments. You just need to let some of these folks talk longenough before they eventually show what they really think..i.e.Charlton Hestons' comment that the amount of gun deaths in theU.S. is probably attributable to the mixed nationalities......blacks,hispanics, non-whites.... that make up the American population. Agreat film that couldn't have come at a better time what with thecurrent sniper business in the D.C area....is there any reasonanyone should be able to purchase a long-range sniper rifle?..along with the current anti-Iraq fear mongering by "President" Bushto distract us from the real problems we face at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible documentary filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to snag tickets to an advance screening of this film last night and it was simply incredible. I have been a fan of Michael Moore for some time now (for those of you who haven't seen Roger and Me or his show TV Nation, get on it). This is without a doubt his best piece of work to date. It has such an amazing mix of emotions that are brilliantly put forth. One minute you are laughing out loud and the next you're heart is broken. For those who belive that this film is just liberal hogwash about gun control, you are severely mistaken. I would say that this is his most unbiased work thus far. The movie is not about controlling guns, it is about why we use our constitutionally protected guns to kill so many people with levels drastically higher than every other country in the world. There are many wonderful moments in the film, some of the best being interview footage with shock rocker Marilyn Manson (who says some of the most intelligent things in the film) and Matt Stone (co-creator of South Park) who apparently grew up in Littleton Colorado. I would definitely rate this film with a 10 out of 10. If it does win best documentary at this years Oscar awards, the academy will have failed once again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, provocative, original film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Using his trademark mix of satire and provocative ideas, Michael Moore takes us along on his journey to understand America's shockingly high gun-induced death rate. His use of hand-held footage of everyday people in America interacting with guns and discussing violence is not only hilarious at times(and sad simultaneously), such as the bank that gives away guns, but cleverly demonstrates that for too many Americans, guns and shooting is as American as apple pie.Moore is able to mix the genuine tears of victims -- including survivors of the Columbine massacre and the Flint MI teacher who had one six year old student shoot another in her class -- with a satirical look at the roots of this violence in American culture and history. Juxtaposed, these stories demonstrate a culture out of control. His comparisons with Canada, which has a similar per capita gun ownership rate but a much lower gun-involved homicide rate, brilliantly supports his emerging thesis that fear is at the root of the American shooting spree.The most memorable and fascinating moment of the film is Moore's interview with heavy-metal rocker Marilyn Manson. He comes across by far as the most intelligent and person in the film, and as someone who generally cares about the victims of violence. Manson offers strikingly sharp observations and ideas about the role of the media, the president, and US foreign policy in supporting the American gun-based tragedy.Moore has advanced his craft many levels since Roger and Me. His staunch trade unionist stand in Roger, is largely absent from Bowling. This is a largely a-political film about the American tragedy (Clinton and Bush policies receive approximately equal criticism), and a film that everyone who lives, or has lived, in America should see.</fullReview>

It was incredibly sad and depressing, yet at the same time was so full of insight and wisdom about the complete deprivity of American culture, as far as our violent side is concerned. I checked it out at the movie festival in Portsmouth New Hampshire and was expecting a one-sided argument against the ownership of guns, what I got instead was a detailed analysis of the role of media in shaping our way of life, i.e. how the media instills fear into our daily lives, and makes us the most trigger happy developed country in the world. Can't wait to see it again. The emotions felt in the audience were incredible. So much clapping and sniffling, and laughing.

		<shortDescription>Everyone in America should see this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic documentary about gun violence in America. What I found fascinating is that the movie does not preach to the audience or try to tell you how to think. Moore presents facts, shows real life clips, and interviews a variety of people to dissect the subject matter. He doesn't provide any answers, and he allows the audience to come up with its own answers. For me, the movie strongly points out how the constant focus on violence during local newscasts causes Americans to think that the world is much more violent than it is, and much more dangerous, and for that reason Americans become more violent themselves.Some might say that this movie is distasteful, because it dares to take on such subjects as Columbine and 9/11, but Moore has a lot of compassion for the victims and is 100% on their side. This is America, an artist should be allowed to create a thoughtful piece on such important, tragic events to see why they happened and what it means about our country. Everyone in American should go see this thought-provoking film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore's Best yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Michael Moore's new film "Bowling for Columbine" at the Toronto International Film Festival. The movie is nothing short of amazing. All of Michael Moore's movies have been controversial, but none more so than this, about the US and it's obsession with guns. There were over 11 000 deaths due to gun violence in America, compared with less than 300 in Canada, and less than 100 in Japan. Why is the US a war zone? According to Moses himself, Charleton Heston, it may have to do with America's racial diversity... that's right, he says that right up on the screen. And that's only one of many revelations in this brilliant documentary. In the end it asks more questions than it answers, but it's a very illuminating trip. And for America, it will be a VERY bitter pill to swallow. He takes students wounded at Columbine High School to K-mart to return the bullets still lodged in their bodies. As a result, K-mart has removed all handgun and assaut rifle ammunition from their stores. He talks to gun nuts and relatives of victims of gun violence. he goes to NRA rallies and he tours Columbine and the town that became infamous as a result. And he suggests that maybe government sponsored acts of violence do not set a good example. If you believe that there are too many guns and something must be done about it - go see this movie. If you think all Americans should have the right to keep a loaded handgun or automatic rifle in their bedroom closet - GO SEE THIS MOVIE! If it changes some minds and makes the United States a little safer for innocent bystanders then all the better. Michael Moore has a unique sense of humor, and while this is certainly the most serious movie I've seen in a while, it was also one of the funniest! A VERY entertaining film, well worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a foreigner, I never understood Americans' widespread love relationship with guns. Hollywood literally wrote the book on how to create violent movies, where the guns are the stars, more than the actors.The NRA lobby talks much about "rights" but they do not seem to care about the rights of the victims product of this "free availability" of advanced firearms to civilians.This movie gave me some clues about why on earth people in a democratic, supposedly highly religious country like the U.S. must be armed to the teeth like they were going to start a civil war any minute: some americans are paranoid and subsconsciously "afraid" of every other country or different ethnic group around them. This is the group the NRA targets and the ones that believe in guns as their "new religion".Arms on the hands of civilians must be understandable on a country were the security and law enforcement officials are underpowered or are not serving their duties, but in the U.S., using the "defense" excuse is laughable, specially when it comes from gun nuts on heavily populated urban areas who use that as an excuse to arm themselves with semi-automatic weapons.Again, Michael Moore does an excellent job exposing the crazy world we live in.</fullReview>

This movie explores why, or what it is, that makes America have such a high mortality rate when it comes to deaths caused by guns. I am sure this is a question that many ask. It attempts to explore answers, but in the end I believe there are no firm conclusions. There is obviously a deep-sated cultural and social behaviour involved. I am just thankful I live in Australia where one cannot buy a gun from K-Mart. I don't think I will ever understand why it should be legal to do so.

		<fullReview>BFC's very success as a piece of art is its undoing as a piece of social commentary. Before I go on let me briefly sum up the film: MM attempts to discover what is wrong with America- specifically violence in America. The Columbine shootings in spring of 1999 are MM's starting point. MM tries to point out the dubious links posited by the media monster- brilliantly portrayed in a montage of 'scares' thrown out by the media- things from Halloween candy to weight loss products. This is an avenue worth pursuing, &amp; the 'scaring' of Americans into becoming consumers of anything that will substitute as a nipple is a great point. But it's made by shock rocker Marilyn Manson (a Columbine scapegoat), not MM, &amp; then immediately dropped. MM also is at his best when he details corporate America's need to portray black men as 'the problem' despite far more crime being perpetuated by white &amp; white-collared sorts. Instead, we get a whole bunch of amusing, but pointless red herrings- the Michigan Militia, the Nirvana of Canadian existence (aptly showing how good the Canadian health care system is, but woefully neglecting the severe curtailing of Canadian civil liberties- most notably free speech- in pursuit of this goal), workfare programs- which I agree are terrible because they perpetuate an underclass, yet do not let a bad single mother whose 6 year old son killed another 6 year old girl off the hook (as MM tries to imply), a nasty Dick Clark- who employed said bad single mother for slave wages in a mall restaurant, a doddering &amp; senile Charlton Heston- whom MM dishonestly snookered in to an attack interview, &amp; then- in the film's most pompous &amp; sickening moment- left the murdered 6 year old's photo on Heston's property, as if to imply that CH was responsible for her death- not the boy, nor the mother. I admire- &amp; LOVE- how MM uses the media's tools against them in such a screeding fashion. But he has become what he hates with this distortion. Nowhere does MM follow up on the public's &amp; media's appetite for sensationalism- instead he uses 2 dimwitted boys who survived being shot at Columbine to shame K-Mart in to removing bullets from their store's inventory. 1 can argue the rightness or wrongness of this act- I think they were within their rights to demand such, but it's ultimately a futile act. BUT the point is this was not done for any other reason than to bring MM's film to a climax. Instead of showing a problem, discussing its causes, &amp; effects, &amp; then proposing a solution- which a true documentary does, MM's film simply drops the ball at the end, settling for its own 2 hours of sensationalized splendor in MM's sun. The film is much more about Michael Moore's need to preen &amp; pat himself on the back, than in provoking any real debate. Behind us, at the theater, was a typical professorial type who Pavlovianly jeered at the right wingers, tsk-tsked at the appropriate moments of their stupidity, all the while, under his breath, mm-mming at the enlightened left wingers who, truthfully, to an objective viewer, came off being just as stupid as the Michigan Militia men- in their own predictably obtuse ways. Think long of Pogo's injunction about enemies while viewing this film.Still, the film would make Leni Riefenstahl proud. &amp; it would make 'true' Liberals proud, as well, were the film not so laced with ? truths &amp; such. MM has stated that he thinks only 10-20% of people who see his work will get it right away- therefore he has to distort with humor. Well, the same ratio might apply when it comes to the truth in MM's docs?.In short, Bowling for Columbine needed a lot more true depth, &amp; a lot less Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this documentary covered the so-called "facts" it did not take into consideration both sides of the story.As a Colorado resident, being 12 years old and remembering the day that Columbine happened like it was yesterday, not to mention living but minutes away from Columbine now, and knowing many of the kids that were involved directly in the this tragedy, I have found this video repulsive.The "facts" presented gave no explanation of where they were acquired, to what extent they were tested, etc. As far as I am concerned, most of what Michael Moore called "fact" was really a number pulled out of his rear. For example, the number of "Gun Deaths" in the U.S.A. Where did this come from? I study criminal justice, and am actively pursuing a career in law enforcement. Knowing what I know about gun deaths, he did not make it clear to what extent gun deaths were inclusive. Does it include suicides, accidental misfires, actual homicide, gun mishandling, etc.? The thing is that he wanted to say that there were that many homicides, and he could not do so based on facts, therefore he construed the truth.Please take caution if you choose to watch this movie.</fullReview>

Moore skillfully lays out arguments surrounding the issue and short-circuits them all, leaving one impossible question: why do Americans kill each other more often than people in any other democratic nation? Moore focuses his quest around the shootings at Columbine High School and the shooting of one 6-year-old by another near his own hometown of Flint, Michigan. By approaching the headquarters of K-Mart (where the Columbine shooters bought their ammo) and going to Charlton Heston's own home, Moore demands accountability from the forces that support unrestricted gun sales in the U.S. His arguments are conducted with the humor and empathy that have made Moore more than just a gadfly; he's become a genuine voice of reason in a world driven by fear and greed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most thought-provoking films in recent memory,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's scathing 2002 documentary attempts to find answers to the question why American culture is steeped in violence and fear, while the rest of the world seems to be less-affected by violence and crime than America. His interviews with a bank that gives away guns, a high school drop-out who's disappointed he only made number two on the towns bomb threat list, and South Park creator Matt Stone and controversial rock artist Marilyn Manson are baffling, hilarious, disturbing and revealing. Together with two Columbine High School Massacre survivors (a shooting that occurred in 1999 in a Colorado high school for those that don't know), Moore scores against K-Mart, and in one of Moore's trademark ambush interviews, Charlton Heston comes perilously close to unmasking himself as an uncaring racist. Moore digs stubbornly for answers and arrives at startling connections, for instance when visits Lockheed Martin, the world's largest weapons manufacturer, which just happens to be located in Littleton, Colorado -- the location of High School massacre.The mystery involving the overly violent nature of America lives on, and what Moore is capable of discovering is that there isn't a concrete conclusion to be possibly drawn. Why is it that any U.S. citizens can personally own handguns just as easily as hunting rifles? Nobody, it seems, can find a valid reason for their purpose aside from as a gateway to further violence.Bowling for Columbine is one of the most thought provoking films in recent memory. In years to come, the film should stand as a watermark for how powerful and riveting a documentary film has the ability of being. It is entertaining enough to grasp the viewer; and is a highly recommended accomplishment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an incredible film. Moore investigates, via incidents and natives from his home state of Michigan, the reasons for America's close and possibly dysfunctional relationship with weapons. The title of the movie comes from the fact that supposedly, although this does not seem to be confirmed definitively by any of Klebold and Harris' fellow students or administrators in their school, the perpetrators of the Columbine High massacres went bowling on the morning of the massacres in fulfillment of an elective class they were taking. Moore looks at the students' decision to go bowling on the morning of the massacre as a metaphor for the disjointed and directionless lives which Klebold and Harris perhaps led, and which may be symbolic of the hopelessness and uncertainty that plague many young people. Moore looks at the horrific accidental shooting of a six-year old by a six-year old in his hometown of Flint and investigates some of the forces which led up to this tragedy. He talks to local officials, co-workers, and casual acquaintances of the boy's mother, who was forced by the welfare to work bill passed by President Clinton, to take a bus 70 miles away in order to pay her bills, in fact working two jobs in suburban Auburn Hills, Michigan, forcing her to spend long hours away from her son who shot the young girl and also from her other child. Still, she could not make ends meet. A week before her son shot a classmate, she was evicted from her apartment and asked her brother if she could stay with him for a short time. Drugs may have been dealt at the house and it certainly was not the sort of environment which would have provided stability and which might have kept his young classmate alive. Moore addresses some of the factors which took his mother away from him for extended periods of time, the dearth of good jobs in Flint-indeed, a GM plant had been closed recently, in an adjoining town and there were other jobs which had been outsourced to other countries. He interviews people affected when Charlton Heston, in his role as President of the NRA, brought his organization to Flint just after this tragedy. He finally interviews Heston at the end of the film in an exchange which does not reflect well on Heston, suggesting he is being disingenuous when he claims that his visits, to Flint in the wake of the shooting of this young girl, and to Denver for an NRA event had been scheduled previously. It is a sad but fitting end to a movie in which Moore once again looks far behind the headlines and does the sort of reporting and investigation which is badly needed by the country at large. He looks at individual cases shaped by gun use in the country and looks for deeper explanations as to why America is afflicted with massively larger numbers of gun deaths than in other countries. He ties blame a great deal of blame to the media's tendency to sow fear among the citizenry and their desire to keep people fearful and supine. Moore recognizes that problems in the United States run deeper than most of the media is willing to acknowledge, and he tackles the seeming dream-state with which many Americans seem to regard the availability of guns, with his trademark casual determination. All Americans should see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filled with inaccuracies and mixed messages, but the main point is very valid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film Michael Moore, in the wake of the Columbine shootings examines American gun violence and tries to find the reason for it. It is a daunting task. America has over 10,000 acts of gun violence a year while all other free world countries like Canada, England and Japan have a few hundred a year Some people insist that it is the violence in the media, others scream that it is the availability of guns and still others think it is because of our history. Which is it? A big part of Bowling for Columbine is picking apart the above claims, disproving them and purporting his own by means of comparing interviews and data. According to Michael Moore, the reason, or at least the biggest factor in American gun violence is fear. He builds this on the fact that crime has decreased over 20% but media coverage of crime has increased over 600%. This statistic blew me away when I read it prior to viewing BFC. I couldn't believe it. He compares interviews with Canadians and Americans that feature questions like "do you own a gun?" or "do you lock your doors?" and the differences are surprising. The Americans seem to be the ones who are afraid.I love Moore's style of narration. How he uses irony, humor and sarcasm to prove his point. Unfortunately this is usually accompanied by not telling the other side of the story. In fact, I don't think he ever tells the other side of the story in this movie unless it makes the other side look silly. Though this will sometimes make you laugh, you also have to be careful about what you take in. There are also a few mixed messages. He spends a good portion of the movie pointing out that gun violence isn't because of the availability of weapons yet he condemns K Mart for carrying bullets in their store. One need only Google Michael Moore to find a host of sites exposing these inaccuracies and mixed messages so I will not go into them. But whether or not you love or hate Michael Moore he makes one point in this movie that you can neither disprove nor ignore and that is that there is way to much fear in American society. Our culture is so heavily steeped in fear and insecurity that it penetrates every aspect of our lives and we are used to it. It is an excellent and entertaining wake up call for America that every American should see. Just be careful what you hear from this guy. I am a big fan of Moore, but I learned a long time ago that, while he raises some fantastic points he can never be trusted to give a two-sided story.86%</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of Michael Moore, but really appreciate what he's done to breathe new life into the Documentary. For better or worse he has pulled a lot of people into docs who wouldn't typically watch them. This movie is a lot of people's first documentary.The film takes a look at fear in America and how it controls us. The film is loosely led by the events that happened in Colorado on April 20th. The parts taking place in Colorado and dealing with the tragedy there are very moving and touching...but it's mostly archival news footage. Too often though he kind of goes off on random tangents that should be separate documentaries of their own. It added some breaks and different things to think about, but also brought up issues that don't get the time and attention they need. So instead he quickly jumps to a conclusion and moves on.There's a lot of controversy around his documentaries. They aren't something to watch if one is expecting to have straight facts laid out in a clear manner. This movie has some very flawed assumptions, takes some interviews way out of place/context/sequence, but still raises some good points despite itself. I think MM could benefit strongly from relaxing a bit and letting the subject speak for itself instead of constantly and caustically trying to cram the revelation on us. Sometimes this film and all his films treat the audience a bit as if they don't know as much as him which can wear on you in a two hour documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I originally wrote this review on April 20th, 2005, which is quite ironic...the exact same day super columbine massacre RPG came out, and this documentary, was based on the same events portrayed in that RPG, only it strayed from the path of columbine, and more onto the topic of guns.Michael Moore goes to random places and interviews different people, and asks for their opinion on the columbine shooting and the topic of guns. he also interviews famous people such as Marilyn Manson, Charleton Heston, Trey parker, and Matt stone (The creators of South Park) Also, personally, i recommend you play the super columbine massacre RPG and watch Zero Hour: massacre at columbine, both that game and show contain a lot of information on the columbine shootings.Bottom line, it's an awesome documentary. I give it 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True enough, Bowling for Columbine is, as many reviews claim, uneven, subjective and manipulative. Sure. It's important to remember, watching it, that this is not a subjective documentary, but a film that makes a very deliberate and intentional point, just like Mike Moore's previous, smaller scale enterprises. But aside from tackling some incredibly important issues, and bringing to light some fascinating obscure information, Bowling for Columbine should be noted for being one of the finest, most powerful pieces of propaganda ever seen. That's what it is, after all - propaganda, though it supports very positive and respectable causes. Mr. Moore is a master filmmaker, who does a fantastic, wonderful work of making his point and making his viewers care about it. The music, the monologue, the animation sequences and the archive footage are all combined with the interviews (fascinating interviews with Marilyn Manson, Charlton Heston and Matt Stone, among others) to create a powerful and intense ninety minutes that would keep your eyes glued to the screen like few other documentaries could. Highly recommended, no matter what your politics are. It will either inspire you of infuriate you - it's fascinating either way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Classic -- 9 (excellent)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE slightly more than I did Fahrenheit 9/11 for a number of reasons. First, I think that Michael Moore's sarcasm and humor is better fit for local domestic issues like gun control than it is for sprawling world politics. Moore's style really shines when he focuses his camera on backwood America but seems a little annoying when he's in the face of the lobbyists and bureaucrats. It's as if the upper class already has tricks up their sleeves for avoiding the press whereas ordinary Americans are more forthcoming and entertaining.Second, I like documentaries that comment on the ills of modern America as a whole, and while BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is general in scope, Fahrenheit instead focuses its energy specifically on attacking the Bush administration. The whole Iraq War fiasco, while sparked by individuals in the White House, is mainly fueled by a blood-thirsty xenophobic public that eats up whatever evening news production dishes out. Don't get me wrong ? Fahrenheit is quality entertainment, but BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE scores big in diagnosing America's sickness as a whole and features Michael Moore at his best. Besides, you only have to turn on your TV during prime time to get the crap on George Bush and his cronies.Some critics may detract from this movie by questioning the veracity of the numbers and facts. All I'd say to those who come from that angle is, if Michael Moore tweaked the numbers a little, it doesn't matter. America is one screwed up country, and no amount of Moore's free-license can change the fact that blacks are treated unfairly by the media or that this country has been involved in many dubious wars and arms deals throughout history. (If you're not convinced please read A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn for the unfettered angle on Christopher Columbus and Thanksgiving.) Lastly, let me say that the last scene with Charleton Heston is golden and unforgettable. I've always been suspicious of Heston, as I have been of Jimmy Stewart, who in his uber-nationalistic days personally volunteered to fly nukes over Vietnam. There's always been something strange with these good old boy characters. The last scene in BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE encapsulates the American Dream so elegantly. The old vanguard of American conservatism that indoctrinated us Clockwork Orange style over the years with its own version of hatred and fear is passing by the minute. I'm sure it will use their last dying breath to tell us to preserve their America, a country whose foundations are fortified with the blood of slaves and the under privileged. I'd reply, screw you, man. You had your chance and flaunted it.JYJimboduck-dot-com</fullReview>

Warning tho, it may make you wonder why Gun Violence is such a common part of American Life, why our children are so prone to it, why parents turn their heads to it, why guns are still not locked in many homes, the answer isn't a simple one, it's an answer with a lot of layers, but I can tell you IT STARTS IN THE HOME.-Peace</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost too strong and amazing for the big screen! Brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have now seen all of Michael Moore's documentaries and films and i just have to say whether a lot of the things he says are lies or truthful i do not know but i do know that as a filmmaker, he is one of the truly greats! Next to 'Fahrenheit 9/11' and 'Tupac Resurretion' this is one of the best and most powerful documentaries i have seen. Moore has a real talent of being able to capture the tragic and cruel reality of America today and Bowling for Columbine does that better than any other documentary made today. It really is just so powerful and really shows us the tragedy of not just what happened at Columbine high school but about how and why America is swimming with violence and poverty.Some of my favourite scenes in this film are the trip to South central L.A, Marilyn Manson's interview and all the archive footage of America's stupidity towards wars and violence with Louie Armstrong playing ' What a wonderful world'The fact is America is going crazy today, especially when it comes to the subject of gun shooting and hunting, i know England is not exactly perfect but then again we're the ones who only have 68 gun murders a year as to the amount America has. I think Moore proves a good point by making this film and that is the big question.Why does America have such a violent reputation these days and past?, and the fact that it is so easy for a six ear old child to walk into a school and shoot another child of the same age, and all because he can pick it up at his uncle's house. Altogether with its strong points and power i think this film is Moores best and an easy ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A voice for the little man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I watched Bowling for columbine for the second time, and for the second time it struck me as an incredible piece of documentary making. Many people like to portray Moore as this angry man who stands atop soap boxes and yells to anyone who will listen, however to dismiss Moore as an angry young man is to miss his point. What occurred to me whilst watching columbine is that he is a voice for the little man, he picks up on stories that the rest of the media would ignore such as the aftermarth of Columbine or the plight of the working classes in his home town of Flint. He stands and reminds us of the people at the bottom of the chain, such as the mother of the little boy who kill a six year old girl, who had to work 70 hours a week and still couldn't pay rent. His films remind us of those sections of society that we would rather forget, in a way he follows in a great socialist (little 's') tradition, that of Orwell or Miller and that is his importance. Whilst his films can sometimes be biased and a little unfocused at times he should continue to make films that speak of injustice and poverty and more over don't let us forget those on the bottom.As for the film its self it is a masterful piece of documentary making, which is far better paced and more focused that his next film 9/11. It takes us through the causes of gun ownership and crime in the US, through harrowing accounts of the Columbine massacre and the shooting of a little girl at the primary school in Flint. This leads finally to the symbolic heart of gun culture in the US, the NRA and ultimately to him talking to Chalton Heston. The film concludes with the most moving of imagery in which Moore leaves a photo of the little girl shot in buelle elementary school in Heston's house. This is an excellent film that calls, no screams at us all to remember that injustice and poverty are a part of modern America and this mix can lead to tragic circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful and emotional portrayal of everything thats wrong with the USA.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have long admired Michael Moore. His books and documentaries have the perfect blend of seriousness, relevance, humour, wit and emotion. In Bowling for Columbine, he gives a personal and deeply emotional portrayal of the reckless gun culture that is such a threat to the USA and its people. Ultimately, he asks if guns make you 'safer', why are there so many killings and murder sprees taking place. Columbine was just one of them. He compared the US to other countries and the results are staggering - the US had about 11,000 gun-related deaths a year, compared to numbers in the hundreds for other countries. His findings in Canada were also staggering - 7 in 10 households have a gun, but there were less than fifty gun-related deaths there a year.The movie has its deeply poignant and emotional parts - The KMart sequence was especially so. As was Moore's meeting Charlton Heston where he left the photo of little Kayla Rolland, 6 years old, shot by a classmate.Its everything thats wrong with America. Ban all guns now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me his way of showing the bad side of the USA - in BFC - is good, because sometimes people must exaggerate a fact or a situation to wake up the audience of *sleeping*...But in my opinion it was also wrong and stupid to hide some important facts [ex. in BFC is the section at the bank, where Moore got a gun as a gift for opening a bank account], because to my mind there should be a *fair game*, so to say you can exaggerate a fact, but you have to tell all background facts no matter if they're bad or good, no matter if they're contradictory to what you usually wanted to say. If everybody would act like I wrote, there woudn't be so many missunderstandings...Our world is destroyed because of hiding facts all people need to know.

		<fullReview>I have read several comments and I have to say that they were rather good observations... However many have missed the point here....it's not about the rate of killing it's all about fear... It's true....everywhere in the world can happen something like Columbine or like 9/11(remember Spain?)...but between us europeans and the Americans there is one big difference: we are NOT afraid when walking down the street that someone might put a bullet in us.... And if someone says that Moore just talks and talks instead of proposing solutions my god they missed the whole point. The reasons are very clear : -the second amendment (legislation) -the fear instilled by media ( crime decreasing, yet gun sells are up) It's not about violent movies ( USA's ratings are a joke no offence but it ruins a movie), not about the music someone listens nor about "violent history"...boy if it would have been about violent history then us europeans should kill each other on daily basis... Bottom line:(Moore's points): change your way of thinking and you'll feel different...stop your government from interfering in other countries business and you'll see that no one will threaten you. And the message does not apply only to Americans it applies to all the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were the killers @ Columbine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just thought I would point out who the Columbine killers were. They were Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. To his credit, Michael Moore did defend Marilyn Manson, who some people tried to portray as being somehow responsible for Columbine. Did Michael Moore point out that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were the killers? I just watched Bowling for Columbine (BFC), and I think Michael Moore decided it wasn't Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold who should be held responsible. I think Michael Moore thinks it's evil corporate America that killed those kids. Let's also throw in America's militaristic foreign policy that killed those Columbine students. Don't forget to throw in Dick Clark and Charlton Heston! What a crock!When Bill Cosby's son Ennis Cosby was killed and robbed in 1997 on the side of the road by a wannabe gangster immigrant from the Ukraine, Bill's wife Camille publicly blamed America's cultural hatred of blacks for teaching the Ukrainian immigrant to kill black people. In other words, Michael Markhasev didn't kill her son, America killed her son. The reason I bring this story up is that it all strikes me as the same kind of logic that Michael Moore is using in BFC, which is to say that no one has personal responsibility for anything anymore, and if we really try, we can find corporate, cultural, and military institutions to be much better scapegoats than Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.Michael Moore cynically uses the Columbine horror for his own use. He doesn't bother with telling us the truth. He just uses those student's deaths to advance his own political agenda. If I murdered a bunch of people, and Michael Moore was my defense counsel, I can hear it now...."my defendant did not kill those people, SOCIETY killed those people. you cannot convict my client unless you convict our government, our culture, and our country!" This is exactly the kind of argument Michael Moore makes in BFC. I don't buy it, and I don't think anybody else really does either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is but one complaint about this film, and that is that Brooks Brown is in it and he has no right to be in anything to deal with Columbine. He is the lie in this film.Otherwise, this is a smart, witty, rightfully cynical view of America's obsession with guns. Michael Moore brings to the forefront the terrifying power of the gun lobby and the irresponsibilty of organizations who have the power to make this nation infinitely safer. Moore also makes a point about hatred and mental illness. He makes it clear that it is guns IN THE WRONG HANDS that are the biggest danger to our national security. However, it is way too easy for guns to fall into those hands.Moore is "in your face", he is cynical, he challenges beliefs and ideals. His job is to bring up questions, not to provide solutions. And he loves to be disagreed with, because that makes people think even harder. That is what makes this a fantastic film - it raises questions and forces the movie goer to use his or her own brain to come up with solutions.And, as someone who knows first hand, and who lost 3 of her best friends at Columbine, this film hits close to home. And it fits.</fullReview>

This film made so many points about American that I had always pondered but never spoke of. I really found it interesting that the director really got in depth and brought up things nobody else would. It spread light on Canadians for the fact that they don't lock their doors and don't fear everything like we Americans do so regularly. I was amused at the kind of guns people had in their homes just to "protect" themselves from the people and things they fear. I especially liked the interview with Marilyn Manson, because he said things I never expected him to say, and they really made me think about how brainwashed we really are, and yet we don't even know it. I respect him for that. I think everyone should see this movie, because it will open your eyes to the truth about the way we live and how we keep everyone moving.</fullReview>

Now don't take me wrong but I am an American and i feel that this movie shows us all one of the biggest faults with our country. A question that this movie poses is - "do we need guns anymore" - and seriously what is the point of some small town kid growing up with his dad having an AK-47 or a rifle or any kind of firearm in the house. Especially when all the movies today portray guns as awesome powerful cool things - I mean who doesn't think that after watching "The Matrix", this would make any kid want to experiment - why have that risk hanging around??? - i just feel this excellent movie with a powerful message that packs a stinging punch - 5 STARS - watch it - learn - change</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a film (documentary?) worth watching even if it's not quite clear what's the punt. Criticising the American politics mainly and suggesting that the American tendance towards hegemony in international relations is to blame for its problem with guns (for the US have a big problem with guns) is not always supported by well shaped arguments. But, all in all, Moore says something and it wouldn't be bad if to his documentary were given more attention than it actually receives. Notwithstanding its political bias, Moore's documentary is interesting to watch, because its position resembles more the European position as regards America and because it has the power to assert some facts that are very difficult to bear by the ordinary American. The American society has two important problems: no.1, the fact that even since the Cold War, it is a society living in constant, perpetual and absurd fear (and a society living in fear can't offer a model for international hegemony) and, no. 2, an undescribable arrogance, doubled by a strange form of nationalism. And these two problems are very well depicted in Moore's documentary.</fullReview>

The man (Moore) is genius and courageous in his subject matter but i truly feel that the bush bashing is going to get the best of him. If Bush is capable of such bullying why would he not resort to calling the CIA on Moore. am i a conspiracy nut or just nuts? anyone with this strong a voice, even in a democracy may be a victim of his own making.

		<fullReview>Brilliant and controversial, smart and full of risks, "Bowling for Columbine" was undoubtedly the winner of the Best Documentary Feature Academy Award in 2002 as film-maker Michael Moore points the finger at American society and many well-respected upper-crust people as culprits in a hidden war this country faces with Constitutional Rights, handgun laws, NRA views and governmental control. Many could take his views as wild, some could take all this as a grain of salt and some may just not care, but Moore's movie raises interesting facts and even more interesting questions about America over the last 50-plus years since the finale of World War II. The misconception here is for Moore's disdain of George W. Bush's administration. Sure Moore hates the leadership of the United States here at the start of the 21st Century, but no love is lost for any administration since Harry S. Truman's. The movie does not play favorites at all. Everyone is fair game (no pun intended). Even legends like Dick Clark and Charlton Heston are not immune to cinematic slaps in the face as Moore does not back down from big name Hollywood types. Everything from the Taliban to K-Mart is explored in an amazing network of international, national, urban and rural violence. "Bowling for Columbine" (Columbine representing the tragic high school shooting in Colorado back in 1999) is what "Traffic" would be if it was a documentary. This is a film that will make you laugh (through clenched teeth with its black comedy), make you think and could even make you cry with its tragically imperative points of view. "Bowling for Columbine" is not only one of the best documentaries of all time it is also one of the greatest movies of all time. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore really hit the nail on the head with this movie. Instead of taking a side, Moore shows both sides of the gun lobby. Instead of putting blame on any one camp, Moore simply asks questions. Why does America have so many gun deaths when Canada, who has a large amount of guns, has hardly any? Questions like these really make the viewer think. Whether you are pro-gun or anti-gun you will like this film although this movie gives ammo (pun not intended) to both groups. Columbine is of course looked at and Moore does interviews with kids who went to Columbine as well as with people who live in the area. It's not a film that you watch to entertain yourself but educate yourself. Bottom Line: A great documentary and one that doesn't make your brain into oatmeal. Asks some hard questions about American society and the American people and most importantly about the culture of fear that the media and the American government perpetuate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Michael Moore On His Oscar Win and Acceptance Speech" is a rich feature heading the second disc included in the "Bowling for Columbine" DVD set.Mr. Moore sits alone in front of a camera in a backyard "somewhere in the midwest" and relates personal reflections on his Academy Award winning experience.It's a remarkably riveting twelve minutes, as Moore first describes the circumstances surrounding the occasion, then relates his actual speech content (actual footage of which was denied by the Academy).Moore's sincerity and genuineness come across, and he's probably right on target when stating that the only reason he's been allowed to speak out like he does is "because of people like you." That is, folks that haven't a voice in the mass media who purchase Moore's books and discs, and attend his documentaries. In other words, Moore's saying that it's only because of the almighty dollar that allows him entry into the mainstream, not because he's saying things all really want to hear. I can only applaud Mr. Moore's tenacity, courage, and perseverance as he speaks out and continues to do his work to make this country and world a better place for all. Certainly "Bowling for Columbine" will occupy a historically significant place among the filmed documentaries of the century. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first film I've ever seen where the audience members (all twelve of them) gathered together afterwards to exchange thoughts and opinions. Eight people, 67%, said they lock their doors in contrast to the Toronto portrayed by Michael Moore where no one seems to have a problem with leaving their door unlocked. Yes, Toronto is a fairly clean and safe city but Moore went overboard portraying Canada as some sort of utopia!Overall, I felt this documentary was blatantly contradictory and biased, but it did such a great job of combining humour, horror, anecdotes, statistics and cultural comparisons that I greatly enjoyed the experience of watching it and thinking it over as I walked home. It was nice to see someone finally debunk the myths that are normally associated with gun violence. If children in other countries always play violent video games, watch violent cartoons, grow up in dysfunctional families, listen to violent music lyrics, etc. why do so few of them become violent when they reach adulthood? Those are great questions to ask. Of course, the overwhelming majority of Americans are friendly and non-violent (if you've never visited the U.S., don't let this movie fool you into thinking that the typical American is a paranoid gun-nut) - and yet, there is something unique about the U.S. that causes far higher per capita homicide rates than other countries. This movie is often quite fascinating as it explores these questions.If only the director hadn't been so intent on portraying himself as a hero the film wouldn't have appeared to be so contradictory and hypocritical. For example, Moore is an NRA member who repeatedly mentions that some countries have high rates of gun ownership, along with easy access to ammunition, without necessarily having a high rate of firearms deaths. He concludes that guns aren't the problem and there must be some other reasons for the high gun murder rates in the U.S.A. Why then did he demonise K-Mart for selling the bullets used in the Columbine shootings and try so hard to induce an apology from Charlton Heston for a little girl's death that neither Heston nor NRA had anything to do with.I did very much enjoy the interviews throughout the movie. There were some very funny moments mixed together along with thought provoking insights. Marilyn Manson deserved to have his say after he was widely singled out for contributing to the Columbine tragedy and he did provide a unique perspective on his "role" in the shootings. I also loved the interviews with James Nichols, Matt Stone and the blue-haired Ontario girl. I wish, however, that Moore had interviewed more intelligent gun owners rather than trying to them as mostly stupid fanatics. I've never ever touched a gun myself, but I still feel uncomfortable with that type of unfair distortion. Moore seems to underestimate his target audience in that regard: perhaps he didn't feel that his message would be as powerful if he had interviewed too many intelligent gun owners.From the statistics I've seen, Moore also missed the opportunity to compare cultures within the United States for clues and answers. For example, the homicide rate in the Southeastern USA is much, much higher than the homicide rate in New England. In fact, Minnesota and Massachusetts have lower overall violent crime rates than many Canadian provinces. Why then is Minnesota so laid-back and relatively crime-free if they are exposed to the same manipulative, fear-mongering media as the rest of the U.S.?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore presents complex questions in interesting ways. He usesmany provocative techniques to make his points. But when heinvites the audiences to laugh at simpletons, he continues on thebiased reporting he so skillfully skewers. This is not coercion by fear. This is coercion by fear of looking badand altering images to suit his argument. Now any filmmakerdoes this and it is not harmful in itself, but Moore should beashamed at some of the tricks he pulled and some of the facts heignored. Scotland had a very shocking outbreak of massive lethal schoolviolence very near the same time as Columbine. It was notreported in the US. I have been to Toronto, and their slums are notbright and gleaming. And a serious question that Moorecompletely avoids is inner city gangs (responsible for some violentshootings). Moore does not explore or even mention, say the lyricsof Snoop Doggy Dog that brag about having shot anyone whodisrespects him. Moore does not show up at Snoop Dogs mansion and publicly humiliate him, such as he did to CharltonHeston. Heston may or may not be a bigoted wealthy white guy,but he deserves the same respect (or convenient editing) thatMoore showed Matt Stone or Marilyn Manson, if he agrees to aninterview (besides he has Alzheimer's for god's sake - Moorecould have at least let him make his points before he disagreedwith them ).  Seperating out and targeting, so called, "white America" asbigots is simply too easy. There are serious problems in other firstworld nations. To interview a few looneys and then point the fingerat one specific thing... well, Moore has simply formed anotherstereotype... he's found another easy answer. Moore is unfairly finding an easy target for complex problems,however I congratulate him for tackling the problem at all. This is aserious issue, and Moore does make a provocative statementabout it. However such cheap shots as editing in a principal of aschool home to a tragic school shooting breaking down to cry andMoore hugging her, are pure emotional manipulation worthy of anabc program.See this movie, and see it with your mind on. Take Moore's pointsand weigh them. Do your own research. Don't call him a butter ballas some on this site have done. Don't call him the second comingof Christ as some on this site have done. Listen to Moore's pointsand then intelligently agree or disagree. All in all, my opinion isMoore has crafted a noble failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American hero's film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How on earth does a Micheal Moore documentary about hand guns in America rake in such incredible audiences and critical acclaim? I had to go to the cinema myself to find out. I did, I came, I saw, I was impressed. It starts rather offhandedly ("It was a normal day . . . the milkman delivered the milk, people went to work, and the President bombed another Asian country whose name he couldn't pronounce . . . ") but, as part of the backdrop to his investigation into guns and gun control, Michael Moore puts together an impressive array of facts about American involvement in world terror, its funding of characters and regimes it later attacks, its quick resort to violence internationally, and various other unpalatable facts that a quarter of the world (Europe) knows but tends to ignore and another sector of the world (Asia, Middle East, South and Central America) simmers with frustration over. They are facts that the average American is totally oblivious of or else attributes to malicious lies. That such a documentary should be made by an American, a very humble one it seems, is a testament to the goodness also inherent in American people. The facts and figures on guns, that suggest America easily outstrips all other countries for homicide by use of guns poses some interesting dilemmas - and ones which are portrayed better than they are answered. The film's initial theory is that the availability of handguns is the main cause - but then finds there are just as many guns in Canada but Canadians don't use them to shoot each other. It then looks briefly at the 'historical and cultural legacy of violence' (a theory favoured by a number of Americans interviewed) but in that America can hardly compete with Nazi Germany, the British Empire of Japan in various wars. It settles on a 'culture of fear' which it suggests (with some conviction) sets America apart from other similar developed countries. This part of the movie is somewhat less convincing - it doesn't, for instance, look at religious fundamentalism which sets America apart from most other developed countries but puts it into a similar category to some of its Middle East 'opponents'. But the suggestion that people who are 'so paranoid' should not be allowed ready access to guns appears to strike a note of truth. South Park poked political satire for those who understood the 'other' face of America - Michael Moore does it for real. Columbine, by the way, is the name of the school where a young kid went crazy with a gun, shooting his classmates. It is also near the site of the biggest factory of weapons of mass destruction in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore can make some well made propaganda, but that's all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is according to my Film and TV teacher a documentary to teach us FTV students the conventions of a documentary. The definition of a documentary movie is that it's supposed to present us with facts.The main problem with this is that the points raised in this movie are extremely one-sided. Any attempt to present another side other than Moore's gets butchered down to make it seem like either a) their points are wrong or b) they're complete bastards. A good example of B is the Charlton Heston interview. Watch the frame closely and you can see the edits he made to make it seem like he was a very insensitive prick who can't get his points straight. Maybe the context is exactly how it happened or maybe it wasn't (knowing what I hear about Moore - it's the latter) my point is that most of the things shown should NOT be taken down as fact, which is what people watching Documentaries do.Not only that but some of these "facts" can't really be taken seriously to begin with. Stuff like Moore walking all around Canada asking if they lock their doors at night (or ever for that matter). Apparently this movie would have you believe that no Canadian locks their doors at night... People lock their doors for precautionary measures. So that if worst comes to worst and somebody DOES break into their house or other crimes that it isn't as easy as opening their front door, You don't even have to be an adult to know that this exists everywhere. No matter what this man tells you.Aside from all that it is great at presenting an opinion and trying to get people to believe it. That really is all that it is. A 2 hour long "I've got an opinion on an American political issue and will try and lead you to come around to my way of thinking".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bowling for Columbine to Bowling for Virginia Tech</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie close to four years ago and I really appreciated its content and I thought it was very relevant for the time. Who would have thought that this same documentary would be just as relevant if not more relevant five years after its release. The killing spree at Columbine was the impetus behind the creation of this movie, and just days ago we had the "Virginia Tech Massacre" (as it is so emphatically called in the media). Very little has changed since the Columbine incident, and even though Bowling for Columbine should have opened many eyes (my eyes were opened) its impact upon laws and lawmakers seems to have been minimal. But of course, gun laws and the ease of which people are able to attain guns will be revisited in light of the latest occurrence. But if the laws are changed, the ink is definitely going to be the blood of the Virginia Tech victims, or maybe even others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie at the suggestion of two friends. They told me that it delivers the goods. I must say that they were NOT mistaken. This movie delivers goods. It is essentially a sad and pathetic slice of life from various sectors of the country and how much guns mean to certain people. I wonder what Michael Moore was doing with a NRA card? That perhaps was his way of getting in Chuck Heston's house. I admire Michael Moore for engaging in debate with Heston. However, he was speaking really fast and in a combative tone with Mr. Heston. Heston, who was in the early stages of Alzheimer's became confused and frustrated and stumbled off. That was the only part of the movie I DID NOT LIKE. Totally unfair of Moore. However, out of respect for the filmmaker in him, I applaud his courage to do that. It turned off a lot of folks. The rest was good. Just shows what I already knew though, that kids and fools have easy access to guns and that kids shoot each other. The documentaries style was good. Seeing Terry Nichol's brother was interesting. What a psycho though. Let's see, what else? It is up for debate whether or not all of the blurbs about how the US funded Osama etc and the number of deaths is accurate. Critics say he pulled all these facts out of thin air. As a movie goer, I will take neither side and just enjoy is as a documentaries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugley entertaining and emotionally superb, but this is slightly to biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore is one or either in the context of his character; you either love him or hate him.I personally, like him; he displays, particularly in this film, a huge drive to prove what is right. He is so emotionally driven to prove that something is right or wrong, his character is 100% correct. But the fact is, despite how much Moore wanted to prove he was right in this film, despite how many hours of long, devoted work went into it, one thing sticks out like a knife in the back; his downright bias.Now bias, in the right context, is fine; everybody is entitled to their views, no matter how twisted or wrong. But when this bias is so obvious, and pervasive, and, most of all, manipulative- it starts to become annoying. What Moore obviously didn't take into account when in the process of making this film was the audiences intelligence.Nevertheless, this movie has received many fabulous reviews. This film is good, well done, and infused with drive; but, like Memento, the obvious errors, no matter how small and maybe not taking away the entertainment value, really bring this down.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary... but is this really a documentary? I would argue that it is, sort of, although the filmmaker, Michael Moore (who wrote, directed, and helped produce), is the main on-camera character, and this is his opinion. There is also an extended cartoon sequence which I assume was made specifically for this film, which seems counter-documentary. So it's easy to argue that the film is more of a performance piece than it is a true documentary.You might think that the question would be one of gun control, but it's really not. Moore turns out to be an actual lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, and the film shows that gun ownership is high in some other countries (most notably Canada), but the rate of using guns to kill one another is much higher here in the United States. So the basic question is: why?Moore covers a lot of ground in trying to answer that question, including, of course, Columbine High School (the film's title comes from the fact the the killers at Columbine went to a bowling class the morning of the shooting, by the way). I won't give away any conclusions that may or may not be reached, but he does talk with Charlton Heston (head of the NRA), Dick Clark, and, in a surprisingly down-to-Earth segment, Marilyn Manson. There is also a very funny stand-up comedy segment by Chris Rock, and a moving segment when Moore takes some survivors of the Columbine shooting to K-Mart, which is the store that sold the ammunition to the killers.This film manages to be entertaining, disturbing, educational, and thought provoking. The only thing that kept it from reaching my top rating is Moore's tendency to try to milk a situation for everything possible. He sometimes asks questions that are the equivalent of "Have you stopped beating your wife?" And when people leave an interview early, Moore often keeps standing there, trying to look helpless and asking a final question to the air. This feels like pandering to the film's audience far more than it feels like true fact finding.This film was the first documentary in many years to be accepted into the competition for the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. It did not win that, but it was given a special 55th Anniversary Prize, unanimously. It has also won audience awards at many other film festivals.Seen on 11/9/2002 at the 2002 Hawaii International Film Festival, although it was already playing in normal theaters at the time. I definitely recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The name of the game is fear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost missed the free screening of Bolwing for Columbine at my school, being that the auditorium already exceeded it's maximum capacity with people crouched on any empty space on the floor. Michael Moore's previous documentaries and television spots (TV Nation) are mostly testimonies of the American workforce and employment practices (see The Big One and Roger &amp; Me). But, Bowling for Columbine is a movie that analyzes one theme: Why is America the highest among all industrialized nations in gun-related deaths? From the theme, it's obvious why Moore got a lot of flack from right wingers who protested the movie as they thought it conflicted with their 'right to bear arms' views. But, Bowling for Columbine only examines gun control as a secondary issue. That's because the question isn't why guns are involved in these deaths--but what is driving people to behave to violently in the first place? And the conclusion that Moore makes is that Americans are conditioned to irrationally fear so much.Bowling for Columbine is good as a comparative analysis, comparing the statistics of gun ownership versus the number of violent deaths. Then, in comparing things like information systems and cultural analyses, especially between America and Canada. For example, we see various clips of local news broadcasts from both countries. The American media always features something to stir up American's fear such as the "Killer Bees" and the Halloween Candy incident back in the 70s or the fact that the amount of violent crimes covered in the American media is statistically out of proportion with the reality of crime because actual crime rates are lower. Moore even provides illustration of how different prejudices (such as racial prejudice) operating to instill greater fear. Then, we see Canadian news and their perception of crime (Moore even notices how not too many residents in the area of Canada he was visiting even locked their door).With the mini cartoon documentary inserted in the film (this was the same animated trailer used to advertise movie), Moore similarly illustrates that America's fear has driven a history of violent crimes, going all the way back to the days the Europeans first settled in the country. As Moore suggests, their fears of the American Indian was responsible for near-genocide, as it would be too during Reconstruction and segregation and so forth. Until that even living in the peaceful suburbs never seemed safe enough. That is what this documentary is all about. Look at how scared everyone appears to be, and how such fears seemed relatively out of whack with the reality of things. Though the title recalls the Columbine shootings that occurred in Colorado a few years ago, the movie contains a lot of different contexts in which Moore makes this point. This isn't a movie about blaming administrations, and that's probably why people either don't take the opportunity to watch it or miss the point altogether, as they take it as a personal attack on their respective political affiliations. This isn't about that at all. Michael Moore, while his satirical presentation does drive a hard point, it does, however, also get somewhat preachy towards the end as he seems to try to get Chuckie Heston to change his stance about gun ownership by showing him the picture of the little girl that died.Some viewers wrote that this is a movie that politicians should watch. I doubt too many of them would address the issues seriously enough, as the goal is typically to try to please as many people possible with the right key words in a five minute soundbite. But, policymakers could take a few lessons from it. Likewise, so could the pathetic commercial media, especially that worthless institution known as the local news. Once again, Moore's documentary inspires a great deal of anger in myself as I think how many people have completely dismissed the film as simply nothing. Don't pass it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why, do American's live in fear?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why, do American's live in fear? While there are many answers to this question, director Michael Moore exposes several on them in his documentary Bowling for Columbine. The movie released in 2002 is center around the bloody massacre that took place at Columbine High School where one teacher and twelve students were killed. Throughout the documentary Michael Moore exposes fear as a theme to this movie.In the movie Michael Moore uses one on one, interviews with many different people to convey his messages to the viewer. The idea of theme is best expressed in an interview that Michael Moore has with James Nichols, the brother of Terry Nichols who was convicted in the Oklahoma City bombing along with Timothy McVey. In this candid interview James Nichols expresses the fact that when he was arrested for possibly being linked to the Oklahoma City bombings that law enforcement officials where afraid of him and what they might find on his property during their search for evidence. Other well known names that appear in this movie are Dick Clark and Charlton Heston. In an interview with Charlton Heston, Michael Moore exposes the fear that the president of the Nation Rifle Association has of answering basic questions that have to deal with gun violence in America. Through the use of many graphical and telling videos Michael Moore continues to use fear as a theme of this movie. For instance he uses live video footage and 911 calls from the morning of the Columbine High School shootings to express the fear that the students and faculty where going through on the morning of April 20th 1999. In the videos the audience can see the students and faculty hiding under tables and running in fear as shots are echoing through the halls and class rooms of Columbine High School. Michael Moore ties all the themes and information that is presented in the movie brilliantly by filming the movie through omniscient point of view. With himself as the all knowing narrator, Michael Moore uses voice over to tie the movies interviews and video clips together. Through this technique Michael Moore not only adds his thoughts on what the audience is watching but also induces questioning and thought provoking ideas to the audience. He wants the audience to question what it is that they fear and what are they going to do about it? Michael Moore's latest documentary master piece Fahrenheit 9/11 just reiterates what a brilliant director Michael Moore is. In these two movies he exposes issues that effect the American population and gives them something to think about and possibly take action on to improve what is wrong in America. In Bowling for Columbine Michael Moore exposes the fear that American's go through day by day.</fullReview>

He has an uncanny sense for pointing the finger always in the right direction.Never has the NRA people looked as silly and out of touch with their propaganda, as in this documentary. It's an act of callousness that they chose to show up in the town of Littleton right after the massacre at the high school.Charlton Heston looks like an idiot at the end. He has nothing to say. How can he convince us that the organization for whom he is the spokesman means to use those arms for peaceful acts? Which brings me to another point: almost all the second amendment advocates sing the same song as though they have been indoctrinated not to see that what happened more than 200 years ago has no bearing with today's reality?Mr. Moore's take on the mass media is right on target. We can't turn to a news program that will present things in a manner that it doesn't sensationalise the facts by creating a gloom and doom atmosphere. When are the networks going to get it thru' their heads that no one wants to hear all the gory details? When are they going to report honestly and truly?At the end of the film we see a Charlton Heston that is a shadow of his former self walking alone, stooped and perhaps defeated because he has been taken down a peg and put in his place by someone as despicable to him, perhaps, as Michael Moore.</fullReview>

His "documentaries" are cut and pasted to his liking - he only allows his subjects to interject sound bites of his approval. Bowling manages to argue the age old debate of gun control in the aftershock of Columbine. Moore stands against gun ownership, but misses the point of automatic weapons - something that a parent singles out in a highlighted protest. Moore jumps over semi auto's designed for nothing other than human targets to rifle owners and their right to protect themselves. Moore cruises to Canada and revels in their no gun society, but he again jumps over their own history of violence that has occurred there throughout the years. Watch Bowling if you like low budget films that only benefit the director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And if so why, while Americans put three locks on their doors? This is only one of the numerous questions this courageous documentary movie poses to us while trying to discover why USA is the country where more killings by guns occur. The questions are all there but the answers? Well that's for us viewers to find out since the movie is there to show the facts not the conclusions though some of them may be easily taken. And this movie is indeed all based on real facts and events shown with great honesty and no doubtful speculations though the parallel done between violence and gun killing inside USA and all the late military American interventions throughout the world may be illustrative not to mention the overthrow of democratically elected leaders and their replacement by dictators promoted by CIA. And against facts there are no arguments. The interview with Charlton Heston the boss of the NRA is self-explanatory: we kill with guns more than any other people because our history is based on violence unlike many other countries' history. But is this indeed the real explanation or the only explanation? What about poverty? OK maybe so but the two Columbine High School killer boys were not at all poor and just middle class. The almost free gun sales? But in Canada the rate of gun possession is not lower than in USA and the rate of killing with guns is much lower. Maybe the causes are multiple and converge to this appalling result. Well this movie among its numerous qualities will have also the merit of making you to think and try to find out the answers to the several questions it poses.</fullReview>

Although the artificial context created by Moore might be needed for an American audience, the fact that he doesn't always allow for the facts to speak by themselves may give the impression that Moore himself copies government strategies of giving the audience horse glasses. Moore brings the audience from tears to laughter and back again and doesn't miss the chance to force various people to face situations they are responsible for and responsibilities they try to runaway for. For me, this is the film's big merit, that it brings forward various people involved in the weapon business for a public trial in which they are invited to answer some common sense questions about the results of their occupation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bowling for Columbine," director Michael Moore's thought provoking look at gun violence, gun control, and violence overall in America shocks the audience with the audacity at the length at which Moore goes to get answers for his questions while still making it's point across of the problem with guns and violence in America.As seen by his infamous Oscar acceptance speech for this film, Michael Moore isn't afraid of going after the root of which he believes the problem he's investigating stems from. In his Oscar speech, he went after George Bush and the problems his administration has caused. In this he goes after the NRA, the US Government, and Charlton Heston and their laxity in gun control.Michael Moore's basis for "Bowling for Columbine" is the Columbine High School shooting tragedy, as the title says. From this, Moore explore the motives for boys who committed the shooting and how violence in America affected them and others who commit gun-related crimes.Moore attempts to debunk the myths of gun violence: African Americans are always the criminal; Marilyn Manson's music is to blame; among others. He debunks the African American myth by pointing out that a lie about a crime committed by a black man is believable if a white man who committed the crime says that happened even though the truth vice versa is unthinkable. Moore debunks the Manson myth by interviewing Manson and getting Manson's take on Columbine. Both of them agree Manson is blamed because people want to blame someone.One particularly memorable part is Moore's successful campaign to stop the K-Mart chain of stores from selling ammunition, even though they don't sell firearms. How Moore achieves this is incredible. Through non-violent, peaceful, but powerful actions involving victims of Columbine. The shooters of Columbine bought ammo from K-Mart, so Moore and the Columbine alums buy out all the ammunition from a K-Mart and present their buys to the K-Mart corporation.These are parts of Moore's memorable film. "Bowling for Columbine" is a thought provoking, meaningful take on an issue many are divided by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guns, violence, death, politics-Call Mr. Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine is a terrific installment on the predilection of gun violence throughout our nation. This is the second Michael Moore film I encountered on. Fahrenheit 9/11 was the first film of his that I saw and enjoyed the film with a great fixation on Michael Moore. Even though I really don't call him a great gay and I think he is just a little over the top on how he throws out his words, but in a way I respect the man. Fahrenheit 9/11 was a very good film but Bowling for Columbine is his best, in my opinion. It truly shows how us Americans need to stop our too much use of weapons by recollecting our pass of deaths in the world and end it at once. This in an excellent documentary that should be viewed by everyone.Hedeen's Outlook: 9.5/10 **** A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a must see film for anyone who is willing to except facts. It's very sad how many people already hated the film before seeing it but only a film like this can do that. You already know if you are going to hate it or love it. I have never believed giving guns to the public was a good idea and the film provides overwhelming proof of that. The key thing to remember is that someone who can clearly make films, as he one the Cannes film festival award for 9/11 and actually got documentaries in the Cannes film festival is trying to help not hinder. I truly believe he is a good man trying to change the bad things in society while many are willing to sit back and criticise and abuse him will reports, insults and lies. He is a very brave filmmaker who makes very good films. When he one the award he told Quentin.T. That if he had wanted to make lots of political statements he would had been a politician. Anyway 10 out of 10 for this, a funny, sad and interesting look at a nation that has more gun death rates then the whole of Europe, china, Japan and Australia have all together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I generally like films with a lot of archive footage--- there seems to be some form of truth to these old clips that surpasses the current raving of Moore. Don't get me wrong this guy has some good things to say and he pushes to get some forms of change---- and he generally seems like a nice guy, but he can be a bit 'too much'--- granted i think that this is necessary to get heard by a wider audience i suppose. I found that the train of thought moved the film through a few social-political problems that occur in the U.S. and that it spread out the topic into a few 'fringe' problems as well. I was hoping for more details and different points of view on the issue (even if they don't agree--- Moore needs to realize that people will make up their minds even when given more than 2 points of view) Nice to see that someone is saying something political---- i know that the politicians never seem to say anything!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>listen, don't ignore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, i just don't get it. I think Moore's film is a real benefit for the human kind, and especially for America. So what if he had done some mean tricks for his voice to be heard louder? It might not be nice, even ethical, but should we ignore the shout simply because we don't like the person screaming? Moore's message to the world is an important one. It stands out against the fear culture that rules modern society, the unsupervised (or at least not supervised well enough) guns in the USA, and all the things that cause things like Columbine. So yeah, he might neglect some of these factors, such as parental responsibility and social abuse, the specific factors. But Moore relates to the general issues. There is one scene in the movie that really amaze me- you can see news broadcasters announcing Marylin Manson, TV, video games and heavy metal culture are the ones to blame for that massacre. Do you seriously think those are to be blamed? How many of us watch TV? When was the last time you played video games? And, to be frank, Manson isn't that rare now days, either. Yet, we didn't shoot the school down, did we? You can say, but we all consume the same culture those kids did, the same culture Moore complains about. That's right. The combination of social and specific factors is probably what causes these cases. The question remains, what can i do to stop it? So answer me yourselves- what is easier to change- society or those ill-parents? What is more accessible to me? I think we can all make a difference. And that's what Moore is saying. He says, he yells, get up and do something. That is the message. Be shocked, be horrified, and then maybe it will get through. Maybe Moore did do some mistakes, maybe even ugly tricks. Perhaps the movie does only show one side of the story. But is this a good enough reason for us to ignore the film completely? I don't think so. Moore made us think and feel- and this is the first move to make a change. And if you want evidence of that- just look at the amount of responses to the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot can be said about Michael Moore - either you hate him or you love him. Personally I love him, and this comment might reflect that in many ways. Writing moment he just won the Cannor d'Or for his next film, but being an eager fan I just put on Bowling again to help pass time...and just like the first time I saw it, I loved it..I love the way he portray things - I know a lot of Americans claim he lies and distorts facts, but to me it seems that he merely presents facts like they are, and makes it up to the viewer to reflect on it themselves - obviously he has his own views, which is apparent otherwise he would never make movies like these - but he doesn't seem biased to my view...The most scary thing about this film is actually that the most sensible person who is interview is actually Marilyn Manson - I'm glad he for once got a chance to explain the boneheads around the world what he is really about instead of all those stupid rumours going on about him. Ignorance apparently lives well when people mention him, it's so easy to come up with lies, but in this film he sets the truth and shows that he is actually quite intelligent. OK, I AM a fan of the fan, admittingly, but still..The fact that so many people were killed in Chicago, and just across the river in Canada ONE person has been killed over the last years - and even then the killer came from Chicago - TERRIFYING thought... I know for fact that I'm NEVER moving to the states, and definitely not as long as W. is president..Eagerly awaiting Fahrenheist 9/11 - damn it, it won't premiere here in Denmark for at least two and a half month more, but on opening night, I'll be there in the seat at the local cinema...definitely!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sincere Motivation, Excessive Information, Absurd Intention, Manipulative Presentation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the director Michael Moore's motivation is undoubtedly sincere, the excessive amount of almost random information in Bowling for Columbine makes his intention look absurd. The documentary serves Moore as his tool to observe and develop his thought on the various sociopolitical issues in the US: the gun control, the foreign policies, and the race relations. At the same time, the film attempts to alter the Americans' collective belief on these issues in a manipulative way.The documentary mainly focuses on the two recent shocking gun incidents: Columbine and the Michigan case six-year-old boy shot six-year-old girl. The main argument ramifies into numerous subtopics: the militia in Michigan State, the US foreign policy since the 1960s (in a collage of historic footage), the crime rate comparison between the US and other countries (especially Canada), the White Americans' fear towards the Blacks presented in the US history (in a cartoon digest), the US landscape change since the 9/11, and so on. The information stream dazzles the viewers, flowing one after another without intervals to allow them to reflect each piece.Because the stimulation that Bowling for Columbine offers is instant, it may not deeply change the Americans' views anytime soon. If the film has a genuine power to make a difference, effects may emanate as new generations' values several years or even several decades later. This is a type of artwork that only time can give the final verdict.</fullReview>

There is no one willing to challenge what was said in Bowling for Columbine because everyone knows that it is all the truth... The interviews, the facts, the film itself can not be erased. Because it is one main source which tells the people what really happened and what is going on around them.

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a talented filmmaker and a very funny guy ? as he proved in `Roger and Me.' Unfortunately, though, he seems to be burdened with the uber-liberal attitude that America is always wrong. At least, that is the impression `Bowling for Columbine' left with me. Nevertheless, Moore states his dreary message in a captivating way. He juxtaposes entertaining interviews with men and women on the street with shockingly violent film clips from Columbine H.S. and other scenes of tragedy and violence, and with genuinely funny stuff from South Park and elsewhere. Moore blames violence in the United States on gun proliferation, media hysteria, and ? this is no kidding ? the welfare to work program. I give Moore a 10 for Humor and artistry and a 0 for political judgment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's admit it, a totally unbiased documentary would be so boring as to be unwatchable; these are the sort they made you watch in high school. Moore had a choice between making something no-one would want to see, or making something appealing which also manages to tackle serious issues. I think he made the right choice artistically, though others will have to debate how accurate he was with the facts.Still, BFC is a worthwhile effort, and Moore deserves praise for a bit of old-fashioned muckraking. Since people talk about traditional values, do they forget that Tradition also includes Upton Sinclair and Sinclair Lewis? They didn't get all their facts right, but what they said was true at the core.That being said, the best documentaries are those that dispense with narrative commentary, allowing the sequence of events to tell its own story - and Bowling for Columbine is not in that category. That's why I regard the greatest documentary as Gimme Shelter (1970), and I hope more people are inspired to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that all people from age 12 upwards should be forced to watch, especially conservatives and those in favour of the oppressive regimes of the world, uninformed and unaware of the effects of the media and spin.For me, this is Micheal Moore's best work yet. Many say it lacks the personal insight of his earlier Roger and Me and, here in Britain, many are more used to seeing Moore in comedic mode on shows such as TV Nation. But this is a far more far-reaching and globally important film than anything he has done, bar his book Stupid White Men.Firstly, let me address the nay-saying surrounding the film. In the press, on the internet and even on American Network TV, people have accused the film of being a lie about the state of gun culture and culture in general in America. For those people, I would direct them to his website (its easy enough to find), in particular the section titled "Wacko Attacko". That should clear up some things. Know going into this that it deals with some things that are hard to take, but which could not make it into a theatrically released (not to mention Academy award winning) film if they were not gathered from fact.The film: starting with the now famous scene of Moore procuring a gun from a bank - given to him for opening an account with them - it is a no-holds-barred attack on the state of American gun law and the state of mind that comes with the Constitutionally protected right to bear arms. The picture he paints is that that right, paired with the culture of fear onmipresent in commercially-led TV, leads to the notion that we NEED guns to protect ourselves from a savage culture which exists only because we are led to believe it does.Taking a look at the history of fear and xenophobia front and centre in America's past, right up to the shootings at Columbine school and in Michigan in recent news, Moore's case is extremely effective in convincing us that there is a deep-rooted cancer in society which needs to be addressed if we are to break out of the shackles that we are born into through decades of self-serving propaganda. Moore's brief history of the USA is both hilarious and terrifying. But the real meat is the controversial footage which has some up in arms, decrying him as a liar and cruel opportunist and manipulator.The footage taken from Columbine school on the day of the killings is absolutely petrifying - a pair of teens armed to the teeth, killing their colleagues and peers with ruthless efficiency - and simultaneously heartbreaking. I am not ashamed in saying that i shed a good few tears, watching the sequence. It is the essence of good documentary, letting the images speak for themselves, devoid of deliberate commentary, to serve the purpose of the film and make a point far better than any voiceover could.When KMart executives refuse to see the victims of the bullets their store sold, you feel anger and know that the tables have been turned, that the people looking to make a quick buck by selling ammunition in a convenience chain are afraid of the repercussions of their decision. The resultant sequence and the honesty of the boys involved is both powerful and just.And that is the reason that Moore's film was afforded such praise and awarded one of the highest honours for a documentary filmmaker - it exposes an issue we knew existed, but which had not been fully addressed. It does so in an informative, poignant and humorous manner, enlightening us to the sheer scope of the epidemic, pointing the finger and offering an alternative way of life. It opens our eyes to the system that controls and consumes, that relies on our obedience and our money. It is both surprising and encouraging that the Academy gave Moore the Best Documentary Feature award. It shows that while they award dirge like A Beautiful Mind and the dull Chicago over more inspiring and long-lasting art (who will be talking about those films in ten, twenty, heck even five years?), they recognise a genuinely important film when it arrives.Finally, it is important to address the backlash surrounding the Charlton Heston interview. It has been called inappropriate, cruel and fruitless. Watch it. Just watch them both in that interview. Moore is a gentleman and, as one previous reviewer pointed out, actually stops Heston from truly hanging himself. Then think about what we have seen. Heston walks out on the interview - IN HIS OWN HOME!! - because he cannot justify his actions in any way that will not come across as ridiculous. he is the Chairman and spokesperson in chief of the National Rifle Association. He believes that people not only have the right but the cause to own guns. "From his cold dead hands". Manipulation or not, those are his words. And he did say them shortly after the Columbine shootings. WATCH THE INTERVIEW. He does not defend or dispute that fact. So he's old. He's infirm. He's a respected actor. Tough luck. He deserves, as much as anyone responsible does, to have those questions put to him. I will never pay for a Charlton Heston film, I will never watch a Charlton Heston film and I will not miss him when he is gone. His position as a free-thinking adult is indefensible. Shame on him.I may sound angry, and that is the effect the film has. Not in a "I'm gonna get a gun" way, but in a "We as a people are better than this, and I will fight that system all the way for my freedom as a person" kind of way. Once you have seen it, if you are open-minded and fed up with being held responsible for the actions of your nation's leaders, you will look at almost everything in the street in a different light. We don't have to do things this way. That is the film's ultimate message. It is a prescient point, made extremely convincingly. If you are tired of political drivel and commercial or militant spin, I urge you to see this film and support its director. He just might be one of the real good guys.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary was rather good, though examples are very politically oriented (What about some goulag images from Russia or death penalty in China instead of these japanese people killing chinese, french soldiers during civil war in Algeria and nazis?). The answer to the main question, why are there so many murders with guns in the US, is barely given; there are just some hints, mildly supported by not that accurate examples and statistics. Also, some facts are just plain false, many dates for example.But what strikes me in this movie is something that I had already seen in "Mars attacks!" (which I hated). This movie is seen as very disturbing in the US, like "Mars attacks" was, though it only states the obvious, using statistics and news available to anybody reading a newspaper regularly; it was just the same in Mars attacks, in which there was no subtility at all in the critic of american society. The thesis defended by the author are not revolutionary either. So are you that bad informed in the US? Are you so manipulated by the media that this simple documentary stating public facts available to anybody disturbs you that much? How can it be that in a country with a very strong local political power (compared to France, the example I know best), you're so little interested in the life of your community that obvious facts like that are unseen? This question seems much more interesting to me than the debate about the freedom to have a gun: as a french man, who made his military service time, and used a weapon during that time, I can tell you that there's no question for me that weapons should be forbidden. The power you feel when using a weapon seems so dangerous to me, it seems so easy to be attracted by this "dark side", it's frightening. So please, even if Michael Moore has as many stupid ideas as he has good ones, don't forget to listen to the good ones, your society will only get better...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One problem with this kind of "documentary" is that people go see it assuming that it is "the truth", since there is no acting and it has no previous script. Obviously, the "truth" is never in the screen or a book; it is out there, in life. So the point is not if it "shows the truth" but how convincing it presents his point: that america is a country dominated by self-feeding paranoia. Does it succeed? I think it has lots of good moments: when he shows the stupid Charlton Heston with alzheimer giving racist interpretations for violence, when the brother of the bomber in Oklahoma says that "there are lots of wackos out there" (and himself is a wacko), the funny summary of american history in cartoons, the (camp) advertising videos with bikini girls with machine guns, the interview with the militia guys, etc. However, even in some of its best moments the movie is closer to propaganda than to a "documentary", in the Discovery Channel sense of the word. This might be entertaining and funny if you previously agree with the ideas of the director ( and I do totally agree). If you just want to see a smart movie, are willing to understand the gun-crazyness of america or don't understand how eazy guns are so bad it might be irritating and confusing, sometimes.</fullReview>

I believe that with all the wonderful animation and the interviews Moore has brought out a great point. This film is very touching and sad at times and it is hard to hold back tears as you watch. Sometimes it is necessary to show some of the violent scenes he did to get his point across. I don't know about anyone else who saw this but Dick Clark and Charleton Heston are both A-holes. What are they thinking? Did they not think about anyone but themselves? I guess it's true about some big stars, once famous you don't have to worry about the outside world and you can live in your own.

		<fullReview>I finally had to check out this movie to see what all the hype was about. I'd seen Michael Moore documentaries before and had agreed with a few of his opinions. The documentary he did on the economy of Flint, Michigan was shown to me in a speech class my freshman year of college and it stuck with me. Yes, Moore can be a paranoid fool at times, but he can make valid points on a few occasions.What struck me the most in Bowling for Columbine was the way many people either danced around the interviews or flat out refused to answer any questions. So many people avoided questions. I was especially shocked to see Charlton Heston agree to be interviewed. I think Mr. Heston is a great actor and have enjoyed many of his films, but I was very disappointed to see him walk away when the questioning became too hot for him to handle. Is this the man an organization like the NRA wants as a representative? The point of the NRA is to educate, but here their most visible member and spokesperson is refusing to finish interviews.I now see that Dick Clark is a total phony. I hadn't liked him to begin with, but now I see that he'd rather avoid questioning entirely rather than grant answers to the same public that made him wealthy and famous.I may not agree with all of Moore's views, but I admire his outright nerve to candidly interview people. He asks the questions that many of us would be afraid to ask. This is one of the best documentaries I have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore's latest really is a good film, and a good documentary (even though not all his facts are 100% right). The Columbine sequence is terrifying, chilling, the best part of the film. He asks lots of questions that he doesn't answer (not a bad thing - let your audience decide), but then he pounds relentlessly on the media, Kmart and Charlton Heston (not the gun lobby). Ultimately, the film is anti climatic, still it has strong points. As far as the DVD, the extras are totally unecessary and say nothing to further the film (with few execptions - Columbine students speak out). Much of it is an outlet for Moore to hear himself speak. I did find his "explanation" of his Oscar speech interesting, and agreed with him on many points. But honestly, if he believes what he is saying, why does he need to explain it, if not for DVD sales.</fullReview>

Bush and Tony Blair's war against Iraq (a name most Americans can't even pronounce correctly); Or was it destroy weapons of mass destruction; Or was it to liberate poor underprivileged Iraqis?I am convinced that neither Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair are sure anymore. The real terrorist has been the US government, first arming it's very own citizens, under the guise of "their constitutional right"; and then proceeding to also arm terrorist groups like the Taliban, Osama Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, and other Pakistani based groups - at a cost that can go easily in billions of dollars (US$). And then spending billions more to "invade" countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, and other South American countries.This movie raises the question as to why is it that the citizens of the most powerful country on Earth as well as the United Nations, are silent about the atrocities of their leaders and US government? If the US were not the most powerful nation in the world, wouldn't it be facing charges for crimes against humanity; killing it's own citizens; and war crimes?Very thought provoking and entertaining documentary. While over 425 people have commented on this movie, Messrs Bush and Blair continue on with their rhetoric and arguments that they are the whole and sole defenders and policemen of the world.How many deaths of soldiers and civilians is it going to take to stop this carnage?It is hoped that documentaries such as this will start a dialogue amongst our American brothers and sisters to sit up and take note of the dangers in trusting their political masters, who should be more focused on addressing burning issues such as gun-control; unemployment; racial discrimination and profiling; domestic violence; presidential impeachments, et al.Mr. Moore you deserve more than an Oscar for this fine piece of film-making. More power to you Sir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Asks a lot of questions, but offers few answers to the gun violence problems in America.. Wise, funny and true, the movie should serve as a good starter of discussion on the subject. Michael Moore has talent and guts to speak his mind on difficult issues. This is a movie that every American (as well as everybody else for that matter..) should definitely see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most important movies ever made considering recent developments in world politics. It should be considered a MUST-SEE film for everyone living in the US! I have studied US-history and I am still a great admirer for the US and its people. But this movie shows you, what has been going wrong and why. I wonder if George W. Bush or any one from his administration has seen it.... In addition I also recommend for everyone to read Michael Moore's book "Stupid White Men ... and Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sobering snapshot of American society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine is an outstanding documentary which forces us, as an American Society, to look ourselves in the mirror and re-evaluate how we treat ourselves and how we treat others. For so long, many have been quick to point the finger at the violence of music, drugs, video games, etc., without addressing the true situations and motivations surrounding gun violence. Michael Moore should be universally applauded for his in-depth look, not only on guns, but on how we as a society are so easily manipulated by the bombardment of media images all seemingly intended to control us with our own fears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch this film if you voted for Bush.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As 55 year old former resident of the U.S. I sat in a Fremantle theatre wiping tears from my eyes as the enormity of the pain and dysfunction of the United States swept over me as Moore cataloged the insurmountable problems in a country that should be so good for for all of its citizens. Rather Moore laid open the heart wrenching problems that are the everyday reality of many of the citizens of the most powerful country in the world-the country that plays the role of leader even for poor Australia living on the other side of the globe from its dumbness.Ostensibly, Moore's film was about gun control in America and the many problems that flow from the lack of any control on something that has become a murderous icon for those that have been frightened into a media servitude because of the manifest dangers that must be staved off through multi-locked doors, guard dogs, barred windows or leaving the coasts that vote liberal and moving to the interior that is Bush country.As I watched "...Columbine" I was pressed with the idea that Moore's thoughts about guns are really only the superficiality of what he fundamentally wanted to deal with and that was America's refusal to recognize, much less do anything about, the massive unequal distribution of the nation's wealth. It's not allowed to be recognized because the media which is just the propaganda arm of the business oligarchy doesn't want you/us to so it panders to the huge fear that Moore illuminates throughout his film-that fear is the motivation for the lunacy of banks giving a free gun to customers who open new accounts or Heston's refusal to be questioned about his organization's [the National Rifleman's Association] decision to hold a major meeting in the city where a six year old boy accidently shot a six year old classmate with a gun he'd found in his uncle's house and brought to school.The footage from Canada proved to me to be the most damning of the film: a guy in Toronto who didn't know what Moore meant when Moore wanted to see the poor section of the city but finally showed him a tree lined street of apartments, or the three high school kids who said they thought it was a governmental obligation to provide medical care and housing for its citizens. Those three high school kids who knew more than the conservative oligarchs who trashed Bill Clinton because he dared to think as clearly as them about America's health shambles.See this film: if you're conservative you can prove your intelligence by enumerating all the "mistakes" Moore made in it-if you're liberal you can have a drink and cry for your country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been wary of documentaries or any other film for that matter, be it the evening news or 20/20, where they surprise someone at their home and thrust a question in their face that they most assuredly do not want to answer, and then show that split second of film as proof that said person is obviously wrong or at fault. I mean, who would want to be confronted with any bad deed they did by a live feed to the world while you were eating Cheetos on the sofa? I sure as heck wouldn't.But then again, you do not want those you are asking the question to, to have the chance to prepare a bullcrap answer either.So I went into this movie wondering which side of the fence I was going to fall. I fell where I liked the movie.While not really answering the questions he posed as a main thesis for the movie (a point we have all learned to utilize well in essay in college and if you are in college here's a hint...pose tough questions your professors can't answer...A+), Moor does make it think while the hell we as Americans seem to be so damn violent. I still don't know and neither does this film tell us. But it is good food for thought and a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful Provocative and Blackly Comic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few films have the ability to make you think and care about the subject the film is about and who it affects. This is quite the opposite of 'Bowling for Columbine' which deals, in an adult way, about American's perception of guns. What makes this film above other documentaries is the sublimely black comedy used throughout making you chuckle at the stupidity of the American's. After the introduction the film holds no bars and subjects us to mind boggling figures about the gun toting USA. The compassion shown by writer/director Michael Moore is astonishing, the way he puts forward his opinions and backs up every point makes us feel more and more involved. Few people would have the skill to make such a controversial topic into a provocative and interesting film. Seeing Charlton Heston in this light - a pro-gun, unsympathetic monster - makes you see him as a totally different person from his days of chariot racing in Ben Hur. His attitude is shocking and distressing as his little regard for the Columbine shooting where he organized a pro-gun rally shortly after. A very watchable film and one of the first for a long while where the cinema was packed on my viewer of a film that wasn't with the mainstream order. It'll change your thinking about mindless violence on TV and blockbuster films from mindless fun to deep consideration that we live in a film that is full of terrors especially the threat of guns - in America of course.

		<shortDescription>Outstanding and poignant look at violence in America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a US Marine, I wanted to see this movie to find out what explorations of violence in America Michael Moore had done.I was blown away.This movie is an outstanding and poignant look at violence in America. Michael Moore holds himself to high standards as a documentarian, but also provides a wonderfully expressive and intelligent look at the roots of violence in America.He explores all topics and themes with a brazenly honest point of view, often allowing the topics present in the movie, as well as the viewpoints of others, to resolve themselves. He keeps a fair and objective view in most things, while remaining forward and attacking as a journalist.The interviews in the movie are incredible. Without really much prompting, he allows the intelligent to shine, and the unintelligent to show just how idiotic they can truly beThrough it all, Moore never attempts to present 'answers', but instead, allows the viewer to draw his own conclusion to reasons. He offers no solutions to the problems presented within, keeping away from a 'preachy' soapbox...but definitely leaves the viewer walking away from the movie with thoughts in his or her head.I /highly/ recommend this movie. It is possibly one of the best I've seen in a long, long time.</fullReview>

Not all Americans are mad, but sometimes you do wonder.And why do the critics have to cry about Heston. Just because you love "Ben Hur", doesn't mean a man shouldn't be shown for what he is. If he's going to speak for the NRA he should be accountable. Any film that forces Wal-Mart to stop selling bullets has a lot going for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many Questions, No Answers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Michael Moore is at his best when he stimulates thought and conversation from his audience. He rarely attempts to actually make a difference - although the whole KMart situation did have an impact, thanks to the idea of the Columbine victims he brought along. This movie shoots in many different directions, not unlike the semi-automatic weapons he examines. Moore questions everything from America's racism, ignorance of corporate corruption, news-making media, true NRA agenda and the overall fear factor in Americans. Many poignant moments occur: the interview with John Nichols (Terry Nichols' brother) who may be the most frightening bald headed farmer I have ever seen; Marilyn Manson articulately discussing the pains of being "different"; and an elderly Charlton Heston becoming somewhat confused at the twisting of words by Mr. Moore. The Flint, Michigan locals are definitely not playing with a full deck, when one states "everyone knows you come to my house for drugs, guns and alcohol." The other shows his disappointment in being only number 2 on his school's bomb threat list, even though he hardly ever uses his "Anarchist Cookbook". Too much truth in Moore's interview with the TV producer who claims no one will watch a show about a corporate executive stealing millions - unless he would remove his shirt and run from the cops. The Toronto session shows just how askew our lives are when Toronto citizens look skeptically at Moore when he questions there intelligence for leaving their doors unlocked. Yes many of are problems can be traced to urban decay and ridiculous welfare work programs that break homes and the lack of a decent healthcare program for all citizens. The films worst (weakest) moment was the staged scene at Heston's home when Moore "dramatizes" the display of a 6year old schoolgirls picture to the NRA leader who is walking away. Again, no real ideas or solutions offered by MR. Moore - only questions. The best solution offered in the movie was by Chris Rock who says, "Bullets should cost $5000 each". Now you're talking!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bowling for Columbine" has been billed as a film about gun control, but it really goes beyond that. Gun control is only a portion of the problem as Mr. Moore sees it. If anything, the film is an indictment of our culture's media which feeds anger, fear and racism in daily doses. Mr. Moore didn't need to coerce anyone into saying what he wanted them to say...the crazies talked crazy all on their own, and the "good guys", like Marilyn Manson, Matt Stone and a group of Canadian teens, said it better from their own perspectives than Mr. Moore ever could've said it for them. The filmmakers obviously did intense, extensive research and the final product is an editing masterpiece. This film was funny, horrifying, entertaining and, most of all, moving. In my opinion, it's hands down the best film of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thought-provoking film of paramount importance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore presents a film that looks at the issues of gun violence in America. It is done in an intelligent and passionate way, and no one should miss the opportunity to view it. Moore shows that gun violence is born out of America's fear and consumption mentality and that gun violence is encouraged by selfishness and a lack of tolerance. This is not just a damning view of the NRA's president, Charlton Heston, and his bigoted beliefs (who would have thought that the man who played Moses and Judah Ben-Hur is a self-serving racist?), but also the avarice, manipulation, and close-minded political party that controls the United States - the Republicans. How devastating it is to know that the very people that claim to be doing things to better the American population are the some ones who are protecting themselves and their exclusive societies where only pre-dominantly white, wealthy men are ultimately served? Various societal aspects are highlighted in the film including the contrast between gun violence in the US compared to other developed nations, and the tragic killings at Flint and Buell in Michigan. The most memorable moment for me is the comparison between gun violence in the US and Canada. In Canada there are over 7,000,000 licensed guns in households but there are less than 400 people who die in gun-related incidents; in the US, guns kill over 11,000 people. One Canadian youth made a very simple observation: in Canada foreign policy is made through negotiating, but in America it is solved by violence. This couldn't be closer to the truth as we have seen (even as recently as the aftermath of 09/11) that the powers-that-be of American foreign policy do not negotiate, they threaten. People tend to shy away from documentaries because they don't see them as being entertaining. It is a shame that people have to draw a line between what is educational and what is entertaining as it has been my experience that that these 2 terms often merge. Michael Moore's "Bowling For Columbine" is extremely heart-felt but not melodramatic, it is informative and constantly engaging. Gun violence has to be controlled and it has to start with every individual. Although we may not all have the time to make a piece like this film, I congratulate and thank Mike Moore for exposing the issues that surround gun violence. We all have the ability to make a difference, even if it is as simple as voting on who has control in government, and that we can arrange for constitutional propositions to protect us all (and not just the supposed higher echelons). Do not miss "Bowling for Columbine" because we can all learn and take from the tragedies and mistakes it highlights to propose a better society to live in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely no gutter balls here. (**a couple of spoilers**)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the BEST movie I've seen so far this year. This is the first Michael Moore film I've watched and I was pleasantly surprised at how funny, sad, powerful, quirky and insightful both he AND his film are. It's primarily a documentary about guns in America but it's really about so much more than that. The film's recurring question is: Why does America have more gun-related deaths than any other country? There's a staggering moment in the movie where it compares the number of gun-related deaths in other countries with those of America: Canada has like 99 a year, France 150 a year, England 196 a year; but America has 11,120 a year! And Moore spends the movie trying to understand why. The film's closest answer is that America, more than any other country, has always been paranoid and afraid. There's an amusing but disturbingly accurate cartoon midway through the movie that depicts the evolution of America from the time of the Pilgrims to the present and how fear is the main underlying factor responsible for the violence and wars that shape America's legacy.Two major surprises in the film are Michael Moore's interviews with Marilyn Manson and Charlton Heston. In spite of Marilyn Manson's blatant weirdness, you have to admit that the guy had some valid, sensible things to say about the Columbine incident. And concerning Charlton Heston, I never thought he could be so chilling and misled (after all, this is Moses!).Regarding some comments here lambasting Michael Moore for his unorthodox approach to documentary-filmmaking: I think that this is his strength. He's an American original who's not content to just point his camera and roll film. In a world where you see more talk than action, it's touching and commendable to see Moore take a pro-active approach at the end of the film and get Kmart to stop selling bullets and firearms. Moore is like that naughty-eyed, restless kid in class who managed to get the teacher to hold class outside one particular afternoon or to not give homework over the weekend one Friday; your parents tell you he's no good and even the teacher doesn't like him, but you harbor a secret admiration for him: because he says the things you want to say but don't quite know how, and he does the things which you wish you could do but don't quite have the guts to.Put another way: Michael Moore is Robin Hood with twinkies in his pocket; maybe even Alexander the Great with an untucked shirt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before giving credence to anti-Moore harangues like Steve's, please read this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival last month, one of the relatively few Americans in the audience. I had problems with Moore's approach and attitude in his signature piece, ROGER AND ME, and was braced for him to be taking a similarly simplistic black and white approach to the topic of guns in America.I was pleasantly surprised and impressed. Moore ? a member of the NRA since he was a teenager ? completely eschews preaching the gun control arguments that his more hidebound fellow members are poised to reflexively jump all over. In fact, he specifically supports the notion that fewer guns AREN'T the solution to America's sky-high homicide rates. He doesn't supply pat answers, as advocates on both sides of the gun control debate so readily do. Instead ? drawing heavily on comparisons to Canada, where gun ownership is nearly as widespread as it is in America and consumption of American culture is voracious ? he focuses on the mega question of what could explain why Americans are so astronomically more inclined to homicidally USE their guns than their neighbors to the north. Moore's documentary approach is scattershot at times, but there's no denying that he hits a huge number of satirical bulls-eyes along the way on his odyssey in search of the elusive answer. The film is an emotional roller coaster that keeps shifting between tragedy and absurdity in a thoughtful, tasteful way that often evokes `so that I might not cry' laughter. Whatever your feelings about Moore are, there's no denying that he has an eye for the absurd and a gift for catching interviewees off-guard with straightforward questions that they don't have a prepared response for. Particularly impressive is when he finally gets to interview `Moses' himself at his Beverly Hills mansion. Charlton Heston is so at a loss to explain the huge disparity between American and Canadian homicide rates that he inadvertently makes some racist slip-ups that shatter his long running `I marched with Martin Luther King' facade. You'll be seeing a lot of anti-Moore diatribes (similar to the one by stevetseitz@yahoo.com just below this one in the user comments section) as the film makes its way around the country. Be mindful of one thing: ANYONE WHO ACCUSES THIS MOVIE OF ADVOCATING GUN CONTROL OR `TRYING TO PORTRAY LEGAL GUN OWNERSHIP AS INSANE' HASN'T ACTUALLY SEEN THE MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Micheal Moore's take on gun culture in the US. The basic premise that Micheal asks is: Why are there so many more gun-related deaths in USA than any other Western country? The movie was very humourous and fun (although there WERE some disturbing scenes eg. 9/11 call and security camera footage showing what happenend in the Columbine High School massacre). I can't see any Canadian not liking this movie since it portrays Canadians in a positive light--a bit too postive IMO :) The film is very entertaining (any film that makes Marilyn Manson look smarter than anyone else is worth checking out).The film is a bit more ambiguous than Moore's typical works and doesn't really arrive at a solution (although Moore's final thought is that the culture is responsible for the problems).If you want something fun and different, check it out.. Unfortunately the largest theatre chain the US has boycotted this movie so I don't know how well it will do in theatres :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When one seeks to expose inconvenient truths about our society through honest dialog and fact-finding, they are to be commended; when one seeks to prove their point through shoddy journalism, half-truths and deceit, it's shameful. Michael Moore does mostly the latter in 2002's Bowling For Columbine, a documentary which is at times interesting and thought-provoking but ultimately completely disingenuous and misleading. Most alarming about BFC is that it illustrates just how powerful the media really are and how the public generally are willing to accept things at face value rather than research the issues. One can say ANYTHING in a film, and at least half the people will believe it, no matter how ridiculous or slanted it may be. Moore takes full advantage of this, presents a picture loaded with half-truths and inconsistencies and won himself an Oscar. That the left-leaning Hollywood Academy would reward such an effort should come as no surprise.Bowling For Columbine is not without merit. It deals with the terrible shooting tragedy at Columbine High School and its after effects throughout the United States. In trying to explain how something like this occurred, Moore delves into America's sometimes unsavory history; slavery, alliances with foreign dictators, war involvement etc, and examines society's seemingly insatiable love for guns. Government inadequacies, especially as related to health care and poverty are discussed, and parallels are drawn between these issues and disaffected individuals in our society. Unfortunately, amidst these very real issues, Moore plays fast and loose with the facts; the Columbine killers were NEVER in bowling class that day, Charlton Heston NEVER uttered the "from my cold dead hands" proclamation in Denver, the NRA convention was booked years before the Columbine tragedy and was prevented by law from being entirely cancelled, and on and on. Moore misrepresents numerous happenings- including the whole North County Bank gun for CD program- by cleverly splicing footage and conveniently leaving out important facts contrary to his position. Numerous legitimate journalists, most notably Dave Kopel, have written lucid, extensive pieces exposing Moore's often disingenuous approach to BFC. Trying to pigeon-hole Dick Clark and sandbagging Charlton Heston under false pretenses- as if these guys were responsible for the nation's tragedies- were particularly shameful and pandered to the liberal viewer anxious to see a conservative celebrity squirm.Bowling For Columbine presents very real issues for which much dialog and action is needed, but ultimately any meaningful message that Moore hoped to send is undone by his self-serving and fictitious "facts". In lambasting the government for creating and perpetuating this "culture of fear", with an over abundance of negative reporting, the hypocritical Moore does the exact same thing- for profit no less- in a feature documentary. So much for objectivity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love him or hate him, Michael Moore is America's ultimate cinematic muckraker, with a truckload of liberal political beliefs to boot, and there is nothing that anyone can do about it. And for all the ways that the far-right has done to smear his name all over creation, whether it's an attack on his books or his films, he hasn't chosen to fade away. The Oscar-winning 2002 film BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is a case in point, as he goes after what makes America the most gun-crazy society on the planet, as well as the #1 nation in the world when it comes to gun-related deaths and murders.The title, of course, refers to what Eric Harris and Dylan Kleibold were doing on the morning of April 20, 1999, only a few hours before they entered the grounds of Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, and turned the school into a scene of utter carnage with bombs and hi-tech weaponry. Twelve students and a teacher were killed in the rampage and dozens of others were injured, before Harris and Kleibold took their own lives.Using Columbine as a linchpin, through the use of the school's surveillance cameras and actual 911 calls from the massacre itself, Moore then takes a long hard look at why it is that Americans have an unhealthy love for guns and killing when other countries that have an equally proportionate amount of gun owners have far lower murder rates than us (combined, the total number of murders in Canada, Australia, England, France, Germany, and Japan add up to only about one-fifth the U.S. murder rate). Many factors are explored by Moore, in discussions with members of the Michigan Militia; James Nichols (brother of Terry Nichols, one of the Oklahoma City bombers); shock rocker Marilyn Manson (who was used as a convenient scapegoat for Columbine because the shooters were fans of his); actor and former National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston; and "South Park" creator Matt Stone (himself a former Columbine student). There are also explorations of our nation's violent past (through a clever and funny "South Park"-like cartoon), and how we export our love for guns and violence to the outside world (in various clips set to Louis Armstrong's "What A Wonderful World", culminating of course with the 9/11 attacks).Moore doesn't offer any easy answers as to why America has become so obsessed with guns and violence, because to try and pin it down to one root cause--be it poverty, racism, or the allegedly violent Hollywood sub-culture--would amount to being dishonest. But he does strongly indict both opportunistic politicians, religious demagogues (e.g., Jerry Falwell), and television shows like "Cops" and the fear-mongering, right-wing proclivities of the Fox News Channel for having instilled such fear of people who are "different" from the rest of us that the only thing we seem to want to do to protect ourselves is buy all the guns and ammo we can. And even though he himself is a gun owner and a longtime NRA member, Moore doesn't let the man who once played Moses and walked with Martin Luther King in the 1963 March on Washington off the hook. Heston, who in the minds of many Littleton and Denver metro area residents displayed a shocking insensitivity to their pain by holding an NRA convention in their town just ten days after Columbine, is grilled by Moore inside his own Coldwater Canyon estate for answers as to the high murder rate in America. Though many of Heston's answers to Moore are sound, they also indicate just how far to the political right he has drifted since the 1970s.BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE obviously stirred up a great deal of incendiary passion (as, of course, would FAHRENHEIT 9/11 just a year and a half later), but it also started a serious debate over this nation's seemingly endless love for guns and killing. Just for that reason alone, its win at the Oscars for Best Feature Length Documentary of 2002 was a well-earned and well-justified one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever watched a film that when you saw it, you hated yourself? I've only done this twice; Once with Enemy Mine, the other, This film. I'm not depressed, I just felt that watching this movie, I wished there was something I could have done to stop these moments in history from happening. This film is not just about Columbine, but about how America, good old America, is so controlled, not by Television or Movies, but by guns of any kind. While dealing with the history of violence and weaponry during the film, he interviews tons of celebrities, like Marilyn Manson, who seems very human more so than he could let on, "South Park" Creator Matt Stone, A running Dick Clark, The mayor of Canada, and Charlton Heston, The Prez of the NRA. This film is not for people who get upset easily, but for people who have no idea about war, or have never experienced it, and how tragic the world has gotten. I'm 15, and I almost couldn't stop the tears that were beginning to well up inside of me. This film is by far, one of the most hardest experiences to watch, EVER. Not hard as graphic, but hard, as realistic, as far as the topics they go through. From scenes of the cameras monitoring the incident from inside in the room, to taut and gripping 911 phone messages, that could probably bring down any strong emotional human to tears in seconds. This film hits all the right notes, it goes where no one has ever tried to go to before. Not only does this film deliver the strongest truth in every way possible, it also has a moment playing "What a wonderful world" during moments of violence acts, all in chronological order, with 9/11 at the end of it.My score: Higher than any normal award possible. 1000/ 1000A true Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good documentary, but maybe a new genre called docu-fiction respectively non-fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the morning of 20th April of 1999 the two teenagers Dylan and Eric went to the bowling-centre for bowling. That happened in the little village of Littleton, Colorado. Just a few hours after their bowling-match, they committed the massacre at Columbine High school. 12 students and teachers died during this dramatic massacre. He shows original tapes from the school-cameras. When you see this, you feel really sad, because you feel with the people. Moore shows how wickedly Americans think about guns and weapons. He cannot believe that you can buy guns and bullets in nearly every store. Michael Moore is very sarcastic and serious at the same time. That's a good mix to bring the gun-problem closer to the people. In the film he also talks to Marilyn Manson, because many people believe that Manson is the reason why a lot of teenagers are violent, but Manson does not think that way. He says that he needs music to be peaceful and not to be violent, because of all the rules. He also says that the President bombs some other countries, but nobody says that the President is guilty for massacres like that in the Columbine. He cancelled the last five days of his US-tour out of respect for those who lost their lives in Littleton, but what about Charlton Heston? After the massacre he traveled over to Littleton to have a big-pro-gun-rally. He said:" I have only five words for you: From my cold, dead hands!" That's not very respectful. Kids died, because of guns and a few days after the massacre he did commercial stuff for guns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I don't have to tell you that this documentary is really a very thought provoking and controversial movie. Even when you don't agree with the ideas behind it, which I can understand because not everybody hates guns, this should make you think about the use of weapons. It's all too obvious that someone who claims the opposite must have lived in some cave or on another planet for the past 5 years.Overall I liked what I saw in this documentary, but what has struck me most was perhaps the comparison between the USA and other countries. Did the fact that each year more than 11.000 people get killed by a gun in the US have something to do with violent movies, with the more violent or aggressive history, a larger rate of poverty, the easy availability of guns...? No, as this movie shows us, it has more to do with fear than with anything else. In my opinion that's the strongest message this documentary conveys.But next to this message, there were also a lot of other positive things. For instance the humor, which was sometimes absolutely great, although Moore didn't always have much to do to make it laughable. A good example of that humor is when he asks himself why no-one blamed bowling for the Columbine incident when they found out the boys had gone bowling before starting their raid on the school. Another funny topic is the bank that's also an arms dealer. Each customer that opens a certain account can choose a weapon from their catalog. Moore's question after he finds that out: 'Don't you think it's a little bit dangerous, handing out guns in the bank?' is hilarious and shocking at the same time. Shocking because you wonder if they never thought about that themselves, did all these smart people working for that bank really need a film maker to come up with that idea??? Something else that I really liked was the fact that he gave gun nuts as well as the victims the opportunity to say what they had to say about weapons. Some of these testimonies were more shocking than I could ever expect, certainly when some of them seemed to be proud of the fact that they carried all those weapons with them. And when he used the actual sound tape, made by the emergency services during an incoming phone call in which someone said that a six year old girl was shot by one of her class mates and that she was dying right there on the floor, was almost too much to handle, even for me and I'm used to a lot...If there is one point of criticism that I might have than it must be the fact that Michael Moore knew exactly where he wanted to go with this documentary. Normally this kind of documentary shows all pros and cons without judging, but Moore doesn't work that way. It's obvious that he doesn't like guns and he'll do anything to show it. Nevertheless this is still a movie with a very powerful message. A message that people with guns who are afraid, won't hesitate to kill, but that even when they don't pull the trigger themselves, weapons can be a dangerous thing to have... You know what I thought after seeing this documentary? I thought: I'm so glad not to live in America, perhaps it isn't all that bad over here after all... I give this documentary an 8.5/10</fullReview>

Like Moore is a liar, money-grabber, like he forgets all the American democracy goodies and stuff like this. Very hypocritical from you guys overseas and from those who approve today's (and not just today) America. It's about time that you (as well) face the truth and admit that US is THE dangerous country and that the rest of the world fears, or better, is terrified of what might become of that fact. Michael Moore is therefore no opportunist, he's truly brave and conscious. You shall honor him, 'cause when the going gets tough the tough get going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a very compelling piece of work. From the time it started you are riveted to your seat. At the end of the movie I was just shaking my head. Moore takes the viewer on a journey from Michigan to Columbine and beyond. He paints a frightening picture of the saturation of the United States by firearms. He shows the the pro-firearms side in a light that they may be uncomfortable with, but in what i consider is a fair light. The NRA is shown as a callous organisation, that cares nothing about the victims of gun crime. The interview with Charleton Heston is priceless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes Michael Moore tailored his movie to suit his political agenda, that's obvious from the first five minutes. What I believe Micheal truly wants is for people to not believe everything they are told as the gospel, he wants people to go out there and do some research, learn for yourselves, not have opinions disguised as facts be spoon fed to you by the media, whether it's a liberal or conservative media. Being a human being, Mr. Moore let his emotional leanings into the picture, for instance, when he was talking to a sheriff who thought the ride to work program was a horrible idea. Mr. Moore could have gone and found someone who thought it was a great program, but he didn't. Maybe if you disagree with that stance, you go find some info about the ride to work, and why it's a good program, and post it on one of the many web sites that deal with this issue. Screaming SEE HE'S WRONG because he did some creative editing is lazy. And saying every principal he broached should be thrown out because the movie wasn't a "true" documentary is worse than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies! Rarely am I so moved by a film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This ranks as one of my favorite films of all time, and for good reason. First of all, any movie that can make me laugh hysterically, cry and fill up with anger is something very special. "Bowling for Columbine" made me experience a rollercoaster of emotions, and it should be seen by everyone!I've loved Michael Moore ever since I saw "Roger and Me." When I was told, in my class, that I was about to watch a documentary about the closing of a GM plant in a Michigan town, I was prepared to be bored out of my mind. But Moore constructed the film in such a way that it was funny, entertaining and touching. He made the subject matter relatable to the average human being. In the case of "Columbine" I was already interested in the subject matter, and Moore's treatment of it heightened my interest. The movie explores all aspects of violence in this country, and how it compares to violence in other countries. It makes a great argument about violence in the media. Moore shows that in Canada young people play the same violent video games and watch the same violent movies, yet the country manages to be generally non-violent. So take that, all you dummies who attribute every violent crime in the U.S. to what we see on TV and in the movies. The Charlton Heston interview at the conclusion is one of the film's highlights. From now on, I will never be able to watch a Heston film the same way ever again. The guy is the Antichrist! The animated sequence is another great moment. It's a hilarious, yet truthful sequence that sums up the cycle of violence dating back to the very, very early days. The movie also touches on some other provocative subjects, like the portrayal of minorities in the media. Moore intercuts an interview with the creator of the show "Cops," with a comedy sketch that gives us an idea of what the show would be like if it fixated on white-collar crime. To sum it up, few films have moved me more than "Bowling for Columbine." People criticize Moore for being "manipulative." You can't be manipulated into something unless you at least somewhat believe in it. He's not a Fascist dictator. He's a simply working-class Joe who wants to express his views. If you don't agree with his views, that's fine. But don't stop the rest of us from appreciating his work. Because I believe he deserves every bit of recognition he gets. He truly is a genius!My score: 10 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore does an excellent job of presenting so many different things to think about during this movie it is hard to describe them all. Sure, it includes some hyperbole (like using raw numbers vs. per capita statistics to compare the number of homicides in different countries) and some moments that feel more plastic than dramatic (mostly Moore's pleas and comforting moments), but these don't make the movie less worthwhile. There is enough dark humor to go around (like Charleton Heston falling one slip of the tongue away from showing his true colors), so the movie is alluring enough to keep most people interested.

It's a good question to ask,and a good question to explore for answers for in a documentary film.I'm not sure I agree with everything Michael Moore has to say here,or with the way he goes after Charlton Heston and Dick Clark,but we do see eye to eye when it comes to violence concerns here at home.I found it worthy of rental on that issue alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Presents Misconceptions about Canadians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bowling for Columbine" had me alternately in stitches, and shaking my head. Americans certainly seem to love their guns! However, as Michael Moore points out, so do Canadians. Unfortunately, Mr. Moore didn't delve deeper into Canadian facts and statistics. Canada is much larger than the United States, but has only 1/10th the population. Yes, there's lots of guns here, and YES - they do get used to commit crimes.Canada even went so far as to legislate a national gun registry that's supposed to stop guns from getting into the wrong hands, but while the intentions may have been good to begin with, the implementation of this "registry" is out of control spending-wise. Criminals will continue to get guns no matter what legislation is passed to try to stop them.Mr. Moore also indicates that Toronto, Ontario has a low crime rate. This is simply untrue. The crime rate in Toronto has risen steadily over the past 25 years; gun-related murders included. Other than the misconception that Canadians are all peace-loving pacifists, "Bowling for Columbine" is an excellent movie that deservedly won the Oscar for Best Documentary.</fullReview>

Michael Moore does an excellent job, as he connects all the different events both social and political in American history, just to show everybody why things are the way they are over the Atlantic.He shows us how USA is the only country that transitioned from total barbarism to high technology, without going through the phases of civilization.The fear, the paranoia and the hate are all there for us to witness. This excellent documentary proves that there is indeed some intellectual thinking in the USA. And the fact that some American believe that he should not have received the Oscar, makes it even more obvious that fascism in disguise is the so intensely advertised US democracy.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Significant Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then a documentary comes along which transcends being merely informative to actually being thought provoking and challenging."Bowling for Columbine" is such a work. Michael Moore has done a superlative job of bringing together much factual material and presenting it in such a way that constantly engages the intellect as well as emotions. His challenge to us is to abandon the abject stupidity of fear consciousness: ceasing to be be duped by "fear-mongers" trying to profit from "fear-tactics." The documentary reveals how the news media flocked to a "sniper scene" in America which involved some dozen "victims," while only hours before, hundreds of our "foreign" brethren were being targeted by US bombs.As long as it doesn't happen here, we can blithely turn away our attention and concern--seems to be a message conveyed by this powerful film.All this results in a beefing up of "security," manifest by locking our doors, while cameras and other type of equipment is in force. This is in sharp contrast to our friendly neighbors to the north, who conversely consider such actions as actually locking themselves in, rather than keeping "intruders" out; they in turn not only keep doors unlocked, but actually place "Welcome Mats" on their front stoops. And why not? Isn't the later the way it should be? For what are "security" devices but the result of fear? Moore's documentary points out the violence of America's past, from early settlers through the past century's civic clashes. The result is a fragmented society of "we" and "them," of "inner city" vs. "suburban" dichotomies, and of movement toward a more de facto "class" than "homogenized" societal system. So we have communities in which citizens buy ammunition at local family stores, then use it to "down" their own neighbors. In dealing with the more bloody and shameful aspects of American history, Moore wisely shifts to cartoon depictions--yet this stylization somehow makes the horrors even more biting (as does his use of "smooth" pop songs underneath the graphic depictions of inhumanity).As a result, these images and messages tend to remain in the memory long after viewing the film. They tend to persist and won't easily go away. This is as it should be, for we have a good deal to account for in terms of our own pursuit of violence. It's long time that we reassess ourselves and become much more revisionary in our outlook and actions. The less we buy into violence, the more it will disappear. "Bowling for Columbine" is a major leap toward helping to achieve that objective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FUNNY, AND SERIOUSLY THOUGHT-PROVOKING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Possible Spoilers*Forget Michael Moore's biased views, forget how he conveniently keeps at bay, the 'other' point of view, and forget how he wants us to believe only his side of the truth. As a filmmaker, he is a genius. He has a fantastic sense of humor, and knows better than anyone else, the nitty-gritties of how to use satire as a weapon. In fact, he has mastered the delicate art of sarcasm.A film about violence, 'gun-violence' in particular, is not such a difficult thing to make these days, is it? It is not, but Moore's way of looking at violence and his somewhat cheeky way of presenting his views on it though, are anomalous, and Bowling For Columbine is one anomalous documentary.Bowling For Columbine completely redefines the concept of the 'Candid Camera' form of entertainment. Catching others unguarded in their gawkiest moments, and laughing at their expense, has always been a rather seedy form of entertainment. But, Moore's way of making fools of the 'wiseacres', or simply, the 'ill-doers', by making a big fool of himself before them, has found a more thoughtful and productive use for the trash that is affectionately known as 'Candid Camera'.In the movie, in addition to stating the facts from his sound research-work, Moore does plentiful of 'street-work', basically interviewing all kinds of people, from a school drop-out who felt insulted when his name was number-two on the 'threat-list' of his school, and not number one, right up to the Hollywood 'gun-possession advocating' legend, Charlton Heston, and getting all kinds of answers from them, some funny, some shocking, but all leading to the serious undertone of the movie.Moore's crazy animation byte on the 'History Of America', and his disturbing presentation (amid the paradoxical background of Louis Armstrong's 'What A Wonderful world') of why he thinks the country has always been unreasonably violent, are hilarious as well as acerbically provocative.Moore's facts may be 'doctored' or questionable. But, his presentation of the supposed facts does make those who support his views, as well as those who think he is a big fat fatuous pig, ponder, talk, and have opinions. If this is so, then his job is probably fulfilled. And, along with making us think, if he makes us laugh and cry, then he is indeed a genius, a well-deserving Oscar-winner. Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best slap someone can get to its face for awakening..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am no American, nor historian, nor interested in politics.. But I can confess that my ideas about the largest and most popular nation in this world were quite optimistic and sympathetic till Bush administration (but of course it is not my duty to comment about president of a country which I am no member of it,this is just my humble opinion) . Why? Because his actions are the reason for this movie, which reveals "awful truth" and confused everyone like me (the majority part) whether not to support USA or hate it. Moore definitely knows what to say and how to say it, how to make his audience accept and understand. Bowling for Columbine is one big and strong slap to the face of Americans who are sleeping, and whether one can thank to him for awaking because otherwise that one could be too late, or swear at him for waking one up from a beautiful dream. Furthermore it is a great "behind the scenes" documentary for non-Americans who only knew the good story. Still Moore did a one big mistake by calling his high priority audience (Americans, of course) "pussies". The cartoon segment in the middle was hilarious for me but then I thought "Wow if I was American I would be really offended". Also the film starts great, continues great but ending hangs in the air. No went in sight. Charlton Heston interview (well, attempt to it) was long, disturbing and unnecessary. Also blaming Dick Clark for the incident of mom not monitoring son, son getting unprotected gun of uncle, son going to school shoot a white girl was totally absurd. OK, the situation of that woman was mentionable but blaming the guy who lend his name for a restaurant was not. The bad thing for this movie is that it started the idea that Moore is against Americans -his native. This was totally childish and product of an idea that pops out for a second. How can Moore be un-American, the guy is pointing out bad things going in a country and citizens of that country respond saying "What the f*** are you saying you stupid fat liar!" Well, "some" citizens that prefer dream world. And those "some citizens" made non-US people around the world automatically stand against United States, those few "lost souls" made others to support Moore much more seriously. I mean, one say "Yeah Mooore is coool and I think he is telling the truth", but now that say "The guy is right, Americans are stealing and attacking and killing and murdering and..! Shame'em all!", another totally wrong point of view. Because of this "totally wrong point of view" Bowling of Columbine turned Cannes, last proper major movie award ceremony, to a political platform. Ruined it all. Well I don't care whether Cannes sink in the ocean but still it became a transmitter for people who understand Moore completely wrong.Moore is not against America, he is for America, but he is just pointing out a few adjustments.. A few? Means a few thousand.. Just like all other countries around the world, they also need a few, don't worry.To conclude, Bowling for Columbine is really remarkable, totally successful, extremely teaching and reminding, poking, and honest. It might be too strong for Americans and have a few "cons" yet it is not wrong nor lying. This is the awful truth, the choice not to accept is up to the audience.. But I wish people could choose more wisely..9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love him or hate him, Michael Moore knows how to make a movie **** out of 4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That was the comment popular film critic Richard Roeper said on The Tonight Show and now, I could not agree more. For the last two years I found Moore to be an obnoxious loud mouth and especially after listening to his acceptance speech at the Academy Awards in 2002.But have I been completely fair to Michael? The only movie I had ever seen from him was John Candy's last film, 'Canadian Bacon.' While the idea was original, the movie simply wasn't funny. But after seeing his latest film Fahrenheit 911 becoming the highest grossing documentary ever, ($117 million and counting) I thought may bey it was time to put our differences behind and see how talented he might be.My God, does he have talent. 'Bowling For Columbine' is a powerful piece of film making and Moore has pulled it off brilliantly to make this easily one of the best films of 2002. It centers on the horrific massacre at a high school in Columbine where 12 students and one teacher were gunned down by two kids (also students in the school) and further elaborates on the gun craze in America dating back to our forefathers and why we are the way we are in this country of ours.The movie opens with Moore walking into a bank that is offering a free rifle to all new customers that open an account. You watch with surprise while the teller in the bank confirms that its true. The vault is packed with weapons and Michaels only fair question is, "don't you find it odd to have guns in a bank?" Blame it on this and blame it on that is everyones response to Moore. While some of the arguments seem valid such as high unemployment, racial tensions, and poverty being the reason, Moore easily proves that wrong by giving the above statistics in Canada. While the unemployment rate in the United States averages 5.5 - 6%, Canada's average is 8 - 9%. And we see Japanese people, black people and the likes strolling through the streets of Canada everyday. And poverty? The government of Canada provides more than adequate living for those in need plus health insurance for everyone. (Ok sure, they have higher taxes to subsidize these programs but at least only 75 or so people were killed by guns in their country compared to America's 11,000)One disturbing (but well done) scene is the news team reporting on the murder of a six year old girl who was accidentally (perhaps) shot by a another six year old classmate. The reporter (who I was hoping would get shot) tells the audience what a sad moment it is and his deepest sympathy goes to the family who lost their little girl. But once the camera cuts, his only real concerns are what time lunch is and wishing he would have sprayed his hair before he left home. And remember "nice" guy Dick Clark from America's Bandstand? Lets just say his first name fits his true character perfectly.To no surprise, President of the NRA (National Rifle Association) actor Charlton Heston appears frequently in the film. Unlike Mr. Personality Dick Clark, Heston agrees to an interview with Moore but unfortunately, his replies to the gun violence in America are so unconvincing that I now understand why he has Alzheimer disease.So, does this movie make me hate America? Of course not. 'Bowling for Columbine' makes me feel sorry for it. As many politicians have said when running for office, "it's time for a change", my reply is simple; prove it, because Michael Moore sure as hell did...................</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny yet frightening documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is violence in America that is a known fact but writer, director and star of this documentary Michael Moore goes and shows just how violent. He takes viewers on a trip around the country, and a little stop in Canada, to talk about violence in the US. He goes to the schools where a shooting incident has occurred and talks to faculty, students, some who had been harmed and those who live in the community around the schools. These scenes are the most dramatic parts of the film, but there are lighter, funnier parts of the film yet they are just as important. He talks to Marilyn Manson and Matt Stone to discuss their views on the violence in schools and they are both very humorous segments but both Manson and Stone make important points. Moore takes us on a trip to Canada where he is amazed to find out that there are people there who do not lock their houses, he even walks into some houses to see if this is common in Canada, which as far as the film shows, it is. While in Canada the similarities between US and Canada are shown, both have kids who listen to hard rock, cut school, watch violent movies and play violent video games, both have many citizens who own guns. Because of these similarities the question of why is there so much violence in the US is brought up and no one can answer this, but this film gives us a lot of ideas. All in all this is a great film that will leave you wondering 'Are we a nation of gun nuts or are we just nuts?' (the films tagline). Only downside is it does not do too much to answer that but that may just be the point.</fullReview>

Moore's dogged determination to shame those who offer no insight to his quest only underscores just how wrong things have been in this country for some time and no matter what your political slant may be it's impossible to say that this is not an important film to see for yourself in what it means to be an agent provocateur.

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is probably one of the most ignorant people on the face of the earth. Yes the way he develops a movie and displays it is interesting, but this is not real documentary film work. First of all, he has to get his facts correct and give them in an ethical manner. Rather than giving facts ethically, he simply states things that cannot be corroborated or substantiated by anyone. By claiming UBL was trained by the CIA is completely absurd. Usama Bin Laden was never trained in any aspect of warfare; he was not actually a fighter. He wished to conduct jihad in Afghanistan so he went there. There has never been proof that he fired a round at the Soviet Army or was trained by anyone. His claims keep getting more grandiose as the movie continues. If you don't believe me just keep an open mind and do some freaking research</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most thought provoking movie I have ever seen!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore investigates why as a country is America so much more violent and Gun loving than any other major country in the world.This movie has been brilliantly researched and well worthy of the Oscar win. It asks why we as a race and not just Americans are so violent,why we must own a gun to feel safe,why is are first instinct to shoot rather than to investigate and why we cant all just live in harmony with one another with no guns or violence.The title of this movie is influenced by the 1999 Columbine high school shootings in which a dozen or so students were thoughtlessly murdered by too psychotic students who then in turn turned the guns on themselves.Michael Moore investigates what could've been the reason for such hatred and cold blooded murders like that of Columbine high school.This movie is without a doubt the most thought provoking movie i've ever seen.With Michael Moore's great view for making documentaries this movie will make you laugh and feel also very sad and angry.This is an excellent movie which i encourage anyone to take a look at. Bravo Michael Moore!!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine, directed by Michael Moore uses satire throughout the documentary/movie to emphasise his argument of gun culture in the USA. He proves to his audience by visiting a local bank and opening an account that supplies you with a free rifle. "What kind of bank gives away guns?" was a question that Moore asked one of the employees at the bank. What kind of bank gives away guns? That is the question. Are we so care free about the possession of guns that a bank has the ability to give away free guns to every applicant who applies? Not only do initial rifle stores sell them, but now BANKS do - the place that stores your money. It's rather peculiar for a bank to give away rifles don't ya think? It seems as though gun culture is a huge part of American society, whereby every citizen has to have a gun in order to feel protected and safe - but if this was the case then wouldn't America be the country with less murders? The Columbine massacre was a huge upset, knowing that two teenagers could go on a killing rampage at their own school and then commit suicide afterwards. It seems ironic that whilst the Columbine shootings were happening, President Bill Clinton was bombing his enemy due to his international affairs. Moore interviews many people, such as the neighbourhood of Littleton (where the killings took place) and celebrities such as Matt Stone (creator of South Park) who showed their feelings and sympathetic emotions towards such an atrocious crime. American citizens were interviewed and were asked why there was so much violence in American society. Music, Parents, Media, Toy Guns, South Park and Marilyn Manson were to blame. People immediately think of the media and its influence but aren't the politicians and government a part of society too? The question of what's the difference between America and other countries when they all have the same videos, movies, poverty, violent history, 'black' people and alienated youth. 11,127 people get killed every year in America by guns which is by far significantly larger than any other country. People then developed a fear of crime due to media coverage as it increased by 600% when 20% of actual crime had decreased. Charlton Heston, president of the National Rifle Association (NRA) believes that people own guns because its a comfort factor and after the tragedies of Littleton and Flint (a young 6 year old girl got shot by her fellow student), Heston still had the nerve to go to those neighbourhoods and promoted the use and safety of guns. Michael Moore has created an excellent documentary and has raised the issue of gun culture within America convincingly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bowling For Columbine is hands down the best documentary ever filmed, it beats Michael Moores other films by a mile most of which are decent but nothing special. Michael Moore has a powerful and disturbing idea and makes it that plus just plain terrifying. The story is less a plot than a question, and it is an amazing question and a very true one. The acting is is very good the few people who actually do it everyone else is actually telling the truth. The direction is amazing, Michael Moore is a great director even if he isn't great that is his best thing. The visual effects are great, but mostly real so I can't say there amazing Oscar worthy effect things. A great documentary film for everyone who can take the real life footage of the shooting at Columbine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining and Thoughtful Look at the Role of Guns in America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a Michael Moore fan since "Roger and Me," and particularly of his TV show. "Bowling for Columbine" shows that he's gotten shaggier, schlumpier and chunkier, but the documentary was more patient and less facile than his usual gonzo journalism.I was impressed by his organizing theme that connected the issue of guns, Columbine and foreign policy with his home town of Flint, Michigan.The video research comes up with some finds, while his sympathetic interview demeanor relaxes nuts who sound reasonable at first into revealing their true biases -- including Charlton Heston.I wasn't 100% convinced by his argument that TV news and reality programming are driving the violence boom in this country as I don't buy into "blame the media" whether fiction or non-fiction.The long documentary effectively ranges from comic to tragic, but you won't miss anything to wait to see it on video or cable.(originally written 11/23/2002)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is a genius documentary about the tragic accident that happened at Columbine school were two boys went nuts and killed several people. Michael Moore decided to make a documentary around this and the fact of weapon use in the everyday home of USA.Showing frightening truths, Michael Moore digs deep into the American everyday life and starts as always making up his own mind around the whole thing. Interviewing different people, both famous and regular people, they've all got very different point of views at the very same case, a very serious case that shows that in USA, every year there is over 11, 000 people getting killed by bullets. And the innocent people blames everything and everyone, either it's the theory about the violent history of USA or the Gothic, satanic rocker Marylin Manson having such a big influence on young people's life, nobody really knows except the criminals themselves.It's a bit of a shocking movie, because it makes very much sense of the sickness going around in the most influential country in the world, and probably the strongest too. And it's pretty sick watching while Moore sits getting his hair fixed while he's reloading a fully armed shotgun! Michael Moore do push the limits, and probably makes things he doesn't like, look a bit worse than they maybe really are - but anyway he's a very good movie maker! Going threw history of USA and a lot of everyday problems, the look into a American life is such a frightening thing really that this movie probably made the world open their eyes bit. Only the fact that in Canada 65 people are killed by gunshots every year, they're not even up in 100! And 100 would be 10 percent of 1000, that's 8 percent of the amount getting killed in the states! BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is terrific, and close to as good as a documentary can get without falling into uninteresting stuff or un-professional creations.</fullReview>

Even Moore later work, Fahrenheit 9/11, is far from the quality and unpolitical/independent view of this movie. Simply stunning.

		<shortDescription>The most thought-provoking documentary that I have ever seen. Michael Moore is a genius.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading all of the negative press that this film has received, I now feel that I must put in my two cents. Michael Moore asks a number of startling questions in his documentary "Bowling for Columbine," a film about America's fascination with gun culture.First of all, I had never heard of Michael Moore prior to "Bowling for Columbine."Second, I don't believe that the purpose of "BFC" was to convert the people that watch it into anti-gun lobbyists. Moore's purpose with "BFC" was to open people's eyes up to a very frightening crisis in our country, which is our fascination with guns. We seem to live in a very close-minded society and I think that "BFC" did reveal some things to the audience, at least to the people who were willing to open themselves up to the film's message that we're living in very troubling times and our greatest enemy of all may not be Osama Bin Laden, but ourselves.I don't think that the question is why does the United States have the highest murder rate in the world, but it's really more of a question of WHAT causes such disturbing statistics? Moore thinks that it's the media and our constant desire to be armed, but for what cause? I think that both are very interesting and may contribute heavily to the crisis, but I think the answer is more mental than anything else. I think it's more of a question of the psyche, that elements such as racism, terrorism, fear, and rage and to add to that already troubling equation, an unstable political climate, have ingrained themselves so deeply into the American way-of-thinking, that it's basically boiled down to a corrupted rationale.I cannot help but agree with the question that Moore asks the audience - Why do we feel the need to hurt someone else at the level that we do? You see, it's things like this that Moore struggles to understand with "BFC." Why violence and what is our fascination with it? Why do we stoop down to the violent levels that we do to resolve conflicts that could otherwise be calmly discussed?We also have a rather creepy interview with James Nichols (brother of Terry) who is also believed to have been in on the Oklahoma City Bombing of 1995, where 168 people were killed. James had to be released because there was not enough evidence to convict him of anything. Terry received life in prison while his partner Timothy McVeigh was executed in 2001. Both McVeigh and T. Nichols were said to have been attendees of meetings for the "Michigan Militia," a pro-gun group situated somewhere in rural Michigan, close to where Moore grew up.As the the film's title would have it, this also deals with the shooting at Columbine High School, which includes actual security footage of the massacre and interviews with several of the survivors including two kids who were actually wounded in the attack; Matt Stone, co-creator of the hit animated show "South Park" is also interviewed, as he has many fond memories of attending Columbine. This is one of the most affectionate things I have ever seen one man do on camera; totally unexpected from Moore. Just the lengths that Moore goes through to prove his points. One such example: Moore and the two wounded Columbine survivors bravely go into K-Mart headquarters where they go to return the ammunition that was legally purchased by the two Columbine killers (Eric Harris, Dylan Klebold).It also includes one interview with heavy metal singer Marilyn Manson. I have absolutely no respect for him as an artist, but he actually came off as quite an intelligent man in his interview with Moore. Because Manson was labeled as the primary source of the killer's desires to murder people, he flips the script by stating why wasn't the president at the time (Bill Clinton; nothing personal, Bill) labeled as a source of violence, since the same day that Columbine happened, more bombs were dropped on Kosovo than any other time during that conflict. Ironic says Manson.Right around the third act, things become personal for Moore, as he returns to his hometown to interview several individuals about a school shooting, in which a six-year old girl was killed by one of her classmates. It is this segment of the film that most likely earned Moore his Oscar for Best Documentary at 2002's Academy Awards ceremony.To conclude "BFC," Moore sets up an interview with National Rifle Association president and Oscar-winning actor, Charlton Heston. Heston gives some pathetic answers to some really hard-hitting questions asked by Moore. When asked about why he keeps so many guns in his house yet has never himself been a victim of crime, Heston replies, "Because the Second Amendment allows me to keep a loaded gun." The Second Amendment may or may not be the worst of the Bill of Rights, but in my sincere opinion, it is an amendment that is too easily abused by too many trigger happy people living here in the U.S. This scene concludes with Moore begging Heston to look at a picture of the six year-old girl who was murdered in his hometown, and Heston walking away. What's most powerful is what follows. As Moore prepares to leave, he sets the picture next to a brick pillar and the camera does a closeup of the photograph, and follows Moore as he exits off of Heston's estate.Praise Michael Moore.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was so good about this documentary was that it didn't try too much. Michael Moore presented many questions and in the end didn't give any questions... but this was a good thing. He made the viewers think. He asked why Americans are violent and in the end the answer was: I don't know.The best thing about Michael Moore is that unlike many others he knows that he doesn't know and that's why he can make a good documentary. Ok he does have a little bit subjective way of looking things in this film but what he's saying are facts. He wouldn't have won an oscar with a film based on lies now would he?People who claim that his film is punch of lies are usually Americans who can't face the truth, that not everything is perfect in their "perfect country". Well Michael Moore is an American who can face the truth and in this film he tells us how things really are on the other side of the Atlantic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this about an hour ago on DVD. I'm not going to go all into my opinion on what was presented in this film, I'll just say that I simply loved it. It raised so many questions, valid questions in my opinion, on humanity, particularly American society, that really made me think. And that's what I feel is the TRUE point of Bowling For Columbine. It's just made for you to think. With that said, the questions raised about the violence in American society was just riveting. I am an 'American' that disagrees with A LOT of its ways and actions, and the way the issues here were presented was done very well. Although I feel that Moore put a little too much of himself into the film at times, it was still a brilliant piece that engages the viewer and forces them to think. The images were very powerful, and I'm glad that Moore had the courage to say and do the things he said/did in the film. I commend him for not holding back and asking the tough questions and being a voice and standing for something. Bowling For Columbine is a wonderful film that I can't wait to own. Whether or not you agree with what's said is up to you....but this is definitely a must-see. **** out of **** stars.</fullReview>

Of course, Moore does offer his opinion and offer it alot, but he backs up any facts he presents. This movie was hilarious but sad to me. It`s sad that this kind of stuff is happening and that we don`t do anything to stop it. But first you have to believe that it`s actualy happening. Go to Moore`s website and read his letter to non-believers where he provides links, footage and visable proof of many disputed facts.

		<fullReview>Michael Moore wouldn't know a cogent argument if it bit him on the ass, which is becoming an increasingly large target. Or maybe I'm not giving him enough credit. Perhaps, he could recognize such an argument if he chose to, but chooses not to. Certainly there must be documentaries that offer more carefully constructed assessments of the US gun problem, but I'm sure they are not as entertaining or popular. Mr. Moore has much more in common with Ann Coulter and Howard Stern than he does with anti-gun people. He's got an ear, and an eye, for impact. Facts, and other objective criteria, are not a particular priority. I'm conflicted with this. On the one hand, I think it's great that this documentary apparently hit a nerve with the general populace about the gun problem in the US. I also tend to agree most of the time with the stance Michael Moore takes, but almost invariably find myself shaking my head at the logic (or lack thereof) he uses to get there. This film does make some good points. It's entertaining. But, it does need to be watched with a healthy dose of scepticism.</fullReview>

I feel that whenever anyone answers -- "It is my right to bear arms... that's why I have them." -- is just coping out from the truth.My good friend for instance. He says that it is his right to have guns. I feel it is a privilege to bear arms. He owns an M-16, a Glock, a Beretta, a shotgun...My friend also says he has to defend himself. He also likes to do war re-enactments (which I think is way cool). My question is: Defend himself from what exactly?I think the truth of the matter is just that my friend's fascinated with guns. He likes them. A lot. In fact, he loves them. The Michigan Militia in BFC looks like they are preparing for all out war. Not home invasion from a burglar trying to grab some jewelry.Comments, thoughts, remarks? And just so everyone knows, I have been victim to a home invasion and also fired a real gun. I still do not bear arms or sleep with a 9mm under my pillow. I live in L.A. and all the cops I have ever had to deal with were very nice and polite.

What it isn't is anti-gun, in spite of the publicity and the comments previously made. Mike Moore is great at what he does and he does it again in this film. I almost expected to see Crackers the Corporate Crime Fighting Chicken accosting someone at K-Mart for awhile there. But, although the movie is quite manipulative in many ways, I thought the juxtaposing of Canada's record against that of the USA was somewhat insightful. Coming from a Western country with superficially similar background to the USA (not unlike Canada) I came away from BFC with the impression that the real probelm is lack of social welfare - and that this problem is translated into gun deaths by dint of availability. This goes back to the question being asked by the Flint Sherriff (I think), is it false economy to take mothers out of homes from dawn til dark for minimum wage? Are the social costs outweighing the benefits? Many difficult questions, no clear answers. Sounds a lot like life. My vote 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all the good Michael Moore accomplishes with "Bowling for Columbine," it still rests on the lower rung of his trilogy of filmed documentaries (behind "Roger &amp; Me" and "The Big One"), basically because of the subject du jour (guns and violence in America and abroad), and how it is emphasized through emotional and political manipulation (reminiscent, in the opposite sense, of a certain band of pirates occupying the White House). In his previous works, Moore functioned as a fearless everyman standing up to the ignorance of corporate tyranny--in BFC, he maintains the role, but the subject relies too much on the tugging of the old heartstrings to sway viewers. The Bush Administration knows that, to keep the approval rating high, you must be able to keep the public's emotions (particularly their fear) under your thumb at all times; Moore knows this as well, which might explain why this film has garnered a lot of hype, praise, and financial success (even an Academy Award) while not necessarily being BETTER than his other films. Granted, it is well-assembled, quite strategic in the editing, and leaves you with much to think about; the montage of American-sponsored atrocities and actual security-camera footage from the Columbine massacre is quite harrowing, yet too often the film seems cut specificially to support Moore's viewpoint, and the subjects of his inquiry seem like stunts (with a heavy reliance on celebrity guest stars like Marilyn Manson and Charlton Heston). For a film that tackles a subject as controversial as gun violence, Moore's approach lacks the subtle ferocity that made his previous films so thought-provoking. Still, in spite of its flaws, even if BFC is the lesser of Moore's filmed works, it is still more engrossing than almost anything coming out of the mainstream Hollywood pipeline right now.7.5/10 (This rating pertains to the contents of the recent DVD release.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy is it tough to start this review. I finally watched this film after wanting to see it for quite some time, and I'm very glad I did ? it really provided food for thought for me, in more ways than one. Bowling for Columbine takes a look at gun violence in America among other issues, and is in Michael Moore's typical in your face style where the humor is extremely dry. Moore interviews, among others, Charlton Heston and Marilyn Manson in his quest to find out why there are so many gun related deaths in America. This is a documentary that is very one-sided, but? who cares? Moore had the moxie to discuss the white elephant in the room and made an excellent documentary about it ? had the extreme right made a documentary with as much talent then perhaps it would have done just as well. At this point, I have to say that I am an enormous fan of Michael Moore's work. I enjoyed his earlier work in Roger and Me and TV Nation, never missed The Awful Truth on Bravo and loved The Big One. I also enjoy his published works as well. Of course he has a left slant; he never hides that fact, and he takes a lot of beating for it. What endears me to him is that he handles himself in both a serious, yet darkly comical manner. It amazes me that those who deem him a `liberal wacko' and try to silence him are at times the same people who refer to the Constitution of the United States as a defense for owning guns. Apparently, they forget about the whole `free speech thing' that our nation is founded on.Having said that, I was a little disconcerted with a couple of items in Bowling for Columbine, namely the interview with Charlton Heston. I hated the fact that he filmed Heston walking away and then filmed the whole thing about the 6 year old girl who was shot afterward, making it look like he was still talking to Heston. I wasn't so disturbed because it was faulty journalism. I was disturbed because it only has added fuel to those who are trying to decry his entire documentary as fiction. However, that is one of the very few complaints I have about the film. Amazingly, one of the surprising highlights of the film was Moore's interview with Marilyn Manson. Like his music and image or not, he came across refreshingly well-spoken and extremely intelligent. There is absolutely no way one can contradict that, whether you agree with what he had to say or not. I also *really* enjoyed the `cartoon history lesson' ? it had me laughing, but again it was mostly fact.Bowling for Columbine was a hard film to swallow ? any film that closely examines the deaths of teenagers and children is ? but it is an extremely important film nonetheless. I highly recommend this film to anyone ? even if you are conservatively right wing, perhaps it will provide food for thought, and will create a dialogue in expressing why you disagree without simply calling Moore a `liberal wacko.' That term is a bit overused, and if one is educated, the very least thing they could do is come up with a new term for this Oscar winner. --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally: One American not out of touch with reality...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday evening I watched Bowling for Columbine about part of the "craziness" of the American population, as we see it from abroad: guncontrol and obsessive media. This morning I read stories about restarting the nuclear weapons production, with 10.000+ nuclear weapons already in possession!With this movie there is at last a tool to open up peoples eyes to sanity. I hope the message is not misunderstood, and that guncontrol isn't singled out, because -really- the (mighty powerful) obsessive media is the prominent factor here. That's where the root of the problem lies: the loss of touch with reality of the people of the United States.Cudos to mr. Moore for nailing it with such precision!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore's already legendary documentary gives the viewer a shocking view of gun and violence-crazy USA.The way that the American people are brainwashed with fear and violence is so shameful that it becomes almost funny,especially for a Dutch guy like me.The killer bees,Y2K,halloween etc. are all examples of messages of fear that make the American people not only scared but also paranoia,as this documentary shows.The best part of the movie to me is the sequence in which we see all the horrifying mistakes made by the US goverment underlined with the song "What a wonderful world" by Louis Armstrong.The Vietnam War,the support of Pinochet,of Saddam Hoessein(!!) and of Osama Bin Laden(!!!).Yes America,this all truly happened.Yes America,the CIA gave training and US Dollars to Bin Laden's Al Qaida network to fight the Communists in Afghanistan and with that money 20 years later the USA was attacked itself.Yes America,the US goverment supported Saddam and his Ba'ath party in the seventies to fight Iran,Rumsfeld(He says he is Saddam's worst enemy)even shook hands with his Iraqi "friend" in that period.Another great part of the movie is the cartoon of American history.Although it is shameful to see how the white people used to live it is absolutely hilarious!The most shocking part of the documentary was to see Charlton Heston,one of Hollywood most acclaimed actors,not minding human lives.Lives of children killed by his beloved guns!! Supporting the NRA is supporting mass-killing.There are still some issues not mentioned in Bowling for Columbine like the death penalty,but still it makes for one of the most shocking and interesting documentary ever made.Keep up the good work,Michael! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this short.1. Great points raised and excellent editing, but that's the baseline expectation from Moore. 2. Marilyn Manson's interview showed that he was well read and intelligent and that he was compassionate and understanding. I was impressed. 3. Even though I support gun ownership, I see no reason why we can't put better controls on ammunition purchases by using professional sales people. I support the unlikely and perhaps illogical conclusion that legal ownership should be more carefully controlled. 4. The movie does wander a bit and Moore does cater to the audience a bit, but I think Moore wanted to draw a crowd for this movie and he certainly accomplished that. 5. Good video rental for early evening...spend the rest of the night sorting out the world and see if you can sleep with your doors UNlocked as they do in Canada. 6. MEDIA...that should be the focus.

		<shortDescription>Terrible--like a Documentary version of Plan 9 From Outer Space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OVERRATED "ART FILM" ALERT: The following film is adored by sophisticated and "with it" film fans. The fact that the average person may find the whole thing unfunny and bland is due to their just not being smart enough to understand and appreciate this masterpiece.One reviewer wrote "minimalism isn't a crime". No it is not, though creating a horrible and pretentious film and labeling it "art" should be. This is a terrible movie and there's practically NOTHING positive I can say about the film. Yet, mysteriously it receives a lot of critical praise while the average viewer might find themselves dumbfounded by its banality--sort of like the old story of the Emperor's New Clothes! Like the little boy that yelled out "the Emperor is nekkid!", I am yelling "this film STINKS!" in the hope that it will prevent you from wasting your time watching it.As I said above, the movie reminded me of Plan 9--mostly because of the incredibly amateurish camera work, choppiness of the film and the $1.98 that was spent on sets and props! Some say this is because it is part of the "Documentary Cinema Movement". I might agree if that's another way of saying "bad films". For example, the computer that rules Colombine with an iron fist looks like an old space heater (and I really think it is) and the film looks like it was shot in 8mm! If this film was NOT by Moore and if it was not labeled "Documentary", it would have been seen as pretentious crap with no real reason to watch it (unless you want an unintentional laugh).The acting was generally on par with the average zombie film (though with less emotion) and talented people, such as Heston, were completely wasted. The music, at first seemed pretty good, though after a while its repetitiveness really annoyed me.Now this brings me to Moore. Although this director has an exceptional reputation, I just don't see why. When I saw his most famous work, 9/11, I was not particularly impressed--it's at best an average film about some nasty people who most viewers will care less about. However, since then I have seen a few other of his films and now realize this MIGHT just be his best film! Pretentious crap like Bowling for Columbine, are terrible films no matter how "artistic" they might be.On the Star Trek scale from "Spock's Brain" to "City on the Edge of Forever", this is a "Spock's Brain."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flint's Michael Moore began his documentary film career by digging his claws into the closing of General Motors in his beloved hometown of Flint, Michigan which has become a ghost town and looks more like Hurricane Katrina had struck it than the closing of it's largest employer. Economic and social depression has brought Flint into great despair. Michael MOore doesn't forget Flint in any of his films. I watched Bowling for Columbine on television and I was blown away. Michael Moore's editing skills and film techniques acts to show the effects of his message. In a country of guns, he shows the inner cities of Detroit, Los ANgeles, and New York CIty. He also shows us how the tragic events on that April day in 1999 at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado made us wake up even if only for a little while. I think it's poignant that Marilyn Manson said "I would just listen" regarding Erik Harris and Dylan Klebold. Maybe that's what we're not doing in a country where guns are more prolific than health care for individuals, our priorities appear insane. While some people I know might call Michael MOore as anti-American. He is doing these documentaries because he loves his country. SOmetimes constructive criticism helps us make better writers and we shouldn't dismay Moore's stance against the proliferation of guns. When Flint is hit with the youngest shooter killing a six year old girl, Kayla, Moore visits the school, comforts the principal, watches the local news coverage, and digs into the boy's background. His mother is on a welfare work force employed by Dick Clark at one of his themed restaurants in wealthy Auburn Hills, Michigan where she has to take a bus to and from. She and her children were evicted and living with her brother in the meantime where the six year old boy found his uncle's handgun and brought it to school for what show and tell. The mother was working two jobs because the welfare forced her too to pay back the government. Dick Clark pulls away from Moore's questioning. Oscar Winner and NRA spokesman Charlton Heston also walks away from Moore in the end when he wants an apology to the girl's family in Flint. Moore leaves a picture of her behind to remind him. The film is unforgettable and a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all remember the tragedy that was the Columbine High School Massacre. We all still feel the pain that was the Virginia Tech Massacre. Innocent lives were lost on both days and the sad thing is that numerous massacres have occurred in the United States at schools all across the country. Instead of examining the shooters involved in a certain school massacre, Bowling for Columbine examines the United States Constitution and asks the question, how are 11,000 Americans being murdered every year with fire arms and how are teens within this country becoming so violent?Film maker Michael Moore is the man behind the film. He travels across his home state of Michigan and across the continent seeking the answers he is looking for. He interviews numerous people from the NRA, Canada, members of the families who lost people in the Columbine massacre, and others. Some of the people we meet our truly frightening including the brother of Terry Nichols (a conspirator of Timothy McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing) who believes there is no problem having an automatic weapon in every home. At first the audience sees the behavior normal (if you're an American) then we see Canada which is practically the same country just with an aye at the end of the sentence. However, as Moore made clear, Canadians aren't killing each other with rifles or even killing each other as American's do.The film raises a lot of questions. How did Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris get a hold of a TEC-DC9 which is a type semi-automatic firearm which killed and injured numerous people in the massacre. Also how is it that stores such as Kmart are allowed to sell anyone as much ammunition as they please? Moore confronts every issue with skepticism and always has a question to ask when given an answer. So many facts are given yet we are capable to remember it all. We see that the United States may not be the perfect land it is made out to be. The scenes involving Canada make this quite clear. We are presented with both sides of the argument. Charlton Heston is interviewed but leaves halfway through the interview when asked about his antics after the school shooting of Kayla Rolland, a sixth year old in Michigan who was shot by a classmate when he got hold of his uncles pistol. We meet several people from the Michigan State Militia who I think give the best opinions on the matter. We also meet some people strongly opposed to firearm freedom and some people strongly in support of fire arm freedom. It hits all points of the matter on firearm legalization. Michael Moore has created his best work yet. He has created an important film on an important subject matter. Should semi-automatic weapons be allowed to be owned by everyday people like you and I? Should ammunition be available to be purchased from anyone so willing to do so? Should the 2nd Amendment of the US Constitution be revoked? Moore goes into things with skepticism and tries to find out as much as he can in the 2 hour documentary. It is a can't miss for anyone and raises a lot of questions. 4.5/5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining documentary (yes, it's possible)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTE: This comment is written by me, that is a Canadian citizen. But I swear that I tried to be as objective as possible.When the documentary "Bowling for Columbine" ended, I was almost crying. This movie really shocked me."Bowling for Columbine" is directed by Michael Moore, certainly the most famous documentarist in modern cinema, as well as one of the most controversial.I understand that the issues raised by Moore are uncomfortable and questionable for many Americans. But unquestionable is the fact that he sinks in his subject, without resting, until his questions are answered."Bowling for Columbine" talks about the infamous massacre in Columbine High School in 1999 but it quickly devolves on Americans' 'obsession' with guns and violence, even getting deeper and deeper, reaching themes such as media manipulation, U.S. foreign policy, American history, business and Canada vs. United States culture.If the subject reaches such far-away themes, it's mainly because of Moore's sharp intelligence and his inventive methods of documenting his subject. His 'script' is first rate and he never derails even if he often has to improvise.Many scenes are already considered as classic ones. The first one, where Moore wants to "open an account which gives a free gun" in a Michigan bank, the "What a Wonderful World" segment, the funny South Park-inspired cartoon about American history, the K-Mart campaign and the unforgettable interviews with James Nichols, South Park co-creator Matt Stone, Marilyn Manson and Charlton Heston."Bowling for Columbine" is perhaps the most effective Moore-made documentary, because it's the most original, the most striking and the one who gets the closest to the viewer.Many filmgoers will be surprised that a documentary can be so entertaining, so striking and so educational at the same time. It's because that Moore knows how to give popular value to his product. There's also the controversy factor that helps (or hurts) Moore, because this movie has been so much publicized, much more than "Roger &amp; Me", and his engaged speech at the Academy Award ceremony in 2003 gained him even more attention.Almost impossible to watch with a neutral mind, "Bowling for Columbine" is an educational must, should it be for its 'objective' look at modern America or for its potential to arouse controversy. Should you agree or not with the issues it raises, it's worth watching at least once, because you wouldn't believe how much it's pleasing to watch a documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really great view of the problems with gun ownership in the USA. Moore attacks the issues surrounding the problems that people have with guns from the perspective of someone who obviously advocates gun control. The movie is actually less about the high school shootings than it is about the bigger picture of the problem in the USA. The only reason that it did not get a higher rating is because of the ending: WARNING--HERE THERE BE SPOILERS: When he has Charlton Heston basically admitting his racist tendencies and ignorance of problems in mainstream America, it is ingenious. He should let Heston just hang himself right there. But instead, he persistently starts to harass the old man with a picture of a young girl who was shot and ends up over blowing his point. He could have just shown Heston the picture, explained his point of view, and when Heston walked away his point would have been made. Instead, he badgered him (big surprise!). All in all a great film, but with nuances of the pain in the rear end that Moore prides himself on being that just take you out of it.</fullReview>

The thing that bothered me the most in that film was at the end when he interviewed Charlton Heston. Moore made himself look like a jerk interviewing an elderly man who was a conservative.

		<fullReview>Documentary film makers necessarily bring a certain point of view with them: it is there in the material they have selected, in what they show and do not show, in how they work their bits of film together to make a cohesive statement. But while the vast majority of documentary film makers prefer to hide themselves behind the camera--and thus give the illusion of impartiality--Michael Moore does not. Not only director but also narrator, interviewer, and visible front man, he has no qualm in letting you know right out of the gate that the point of view is his own from start to finish.Most people will probably agree that it is a gutsy thing to do, but that is probably ALL they are likely to agree upon about BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. Ask ten people what the film is about and you are likely to get ten different answers. Ask the same ten whether they liked it or not and you will probably get two extremes: they either loved it or they hated it. Those who love it tend to champion it as a powerful statement in favor of gun control. Those who hate it tend to consider it an inaccurate attack on gun owners in general and the NRA in particular.But I think it is a mistake to see the film from either stance. It is true that Moore has a lot to say about easy access to and irresponsible handling of firearms; it is also true that the NRA (not to mention then-president Charleton Heston) comes in for a major beating at his hands. But when all is said and done, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is no more "about" gun control or the NRA than it is about the infamous Columbine High School incident. When you get right down to the marrow, Moore seems to be making a comment on how both politicians and corporations work to take advantage of the paranoia created in the citizenry by a mass media focused on what is sensational rather than upon what is actually important.There has been a lot of complaint that Moore has fiddled the facts to suit his agenda and that BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is riddled with inaccuracies. Indeed, there are entire websites (most of them little more than badly researched hysterical rants) devoted to the exposure of these flaws. But whether or not you buy into all or even most of Moore's data, it does seem to me that he has a valid overall point. To throw it out on the basis of surface errors--or still worse, the bizarre idea that documentaries should reside in some rarefied atmosphere of absolute impartiality--is an even greater error than any inaccuracy or bias that exists in the film itself.Whether you actually agree with the film or not, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is truly one film that will hold your attention to the bitter end: often laugh-out-loud funny, wildly satirical, bitterly ironic, opinionated, thought-provoking, and extremely disquieting, it makes a powerful statement.Gary F.

		<shortDescription>I don't respect Moore, but this is a well made documentary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentaries are probably the hardest types of film to review, primarily because it all comes down to whether or not you agree with the filmmaker or not. Style helps, but you can't recommend a documentary you disagree with, can you?To come out with the truth before I get too far into this review, I will say that I totally disagree with Michael Moore on almost all subjects. To call him a liberal is an understatement -- so from a Republican's standpoint, it's very hard to give his film a good rating."Bowling for Columbine," like most of Moore's films, is seriously flawed. He presents a lot of information as truth when it is clearly not so. As entertaining as the History of the US cartoon was, it was also quite incorrect in many ways, and guess what -- killer bees DID come to America through Texas, even though he states that they never did.He doesn't bash the Bush administration as much as I thought he would, or any real political issues. He basically bashes American culture for allowing guns to flow so freely into the grasps of criminals and children.Moore is a lifetime member of the NRA, but he thinks guns should be handled with more caution. America has the highest rate of weapon-related deaths in all the world, and as this documentary shows, Britain, Canada, and other closely related countries have the exact same films, videogames, weapons, and so on. Why is America's gun crime so high?The film is centered on the Columbine shooting a few years back, when two students walked into Columbine high school and shot students, killing and injuring a large number of innocents. It was a wake up call for most of America, and Moore's real point of the documentary is to explore the reason America is so obsessed with guns.From a critical standpoint, the documentary is well made, probably deserving of its Oscar. It's touching and funny, disturbing and outrageous. Sometimes it's a bit too politically correct -- the whole exploration of African-Americans getting arrested more than Caucasians on the television show "COPS" is not only incorrect but sort of a laughable attempt on Moore's part to gain the respect of black viewers. I've watched "COPS" before, and a lot of white guys get arrested -- I can think of many arrests off the top of my head. I don't think that it's a valid point at all. America's reported fear of blacks is not why there are more shootings. Two survivors of the Columbine massacre accompany Moore towards the end of the film when he visits the Wal-Mart headquarters and requests that they stop selling 30-cent weapon ammunition -- the same ammunition bought by the Columbine shooters. Wal-Mart agrees, which is why you will no longer see gun ammo in Wal-Marts across the country.When "Halloween" came out in 1978, the six-year-old killer, Michael Myers, seemed even more evil and scary because he murdered at such a young age. Nobody thought that there could be a child like that. But, in "Bowling for Columbine," we are informed that a six-year-old school kid shot another young girl of the same age in a school cafeteria one day -- by accident, or so they say. That's when the documentary starts to become a horror film as opposed to an informative film. And it's better for it, too.It is our right as Americans to decide whether or not we should carry guns. I think the restrictions on letting guns fall into the wrong hands could be a bit more strict, but the criminals on the street will achieve weapons irregardless of whether or not Wal-Mart stops selling hunting rifles. In that sense, Moore's documentary is almost pointless. By the end, he never reveals why America is infatuated with guns. But his unresolved insight into why our nature is so influenced by violence is the highlight, and the remaining image of the little girl shot to death by a six-year-old boy will stay with you for a long, long time.Another problem with documentaries is that they can be twisted around and edited into whatever the filmmaker wants -- such as Moore's interview with Charlton Heston at the end of the film, or Dick Clark's refusal to speak to Moore, and so on and so forth. We don't know the background story on these things and we don't know what else was said before Moore fiddled around with the footage and crafted it into what he wanted. Splice together images of Heston saying, "From my cold dead hands!" and anything can look bad."Bowling for Columbine" is a very good film, and though I do not respect Michael Moore in any way, even I have to admit that he's made a good -- if flawed -- documentary about violence in America. He handles the content with care -- the way it should be handled -- and it can be both hilarious and saddening at the same time. I don't agree with everything in this film, but some of the real facts are pretty haunting. It's definitely one to check out.4.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A certain Marxist (I won't mention his name) goes around posting the same exact text in his internet comments for all of Moore's movies. He is an accurate reflection of the kind of blindly loyal and fanatical audience Moore aims for. Every Moore, every Chavez, and every Hitler of this diseased world requires their own pack of pit-bull-terriers to do their dirty work, promoting their populist propaganda on a ground level, or - specifically in this case - Moore's Holy Red Word to the dupable masses.However, the real issue here isn't that user and his text-pasting spree, for he is but a mere drop in the ocean of easily brainwashed Moorearians. His views hold less relevance than the infinite plankton that surround and inhabit the ocean drop which he infests. This is about the "Giant Socialist Weasel".No wonder Moore was drawn toward teens who lash out at society with weapons and hand-grenades. He must have felt a kinship there. Something tells me that little Michael himself might have had vivid fantasies of "revenge". Michael Moore is a lonely, sexually frustrated middle-aged misfit who'd been unsuccessfully looking for a date throughout his teens and post-teens life. (Susan Boyle's male counterpart?) Can you imagine "waking up" at the start of puberty and finding yourself looking like THAT...? There is nothing worse than a narcissist with a heavily bruised ego.Add to that a solid dose of psychopathy (which is hereditary, not induced by upbringing), and you've got the more-or-less basic profile of nearly all the kids who have been in the news in recent years relating to school mayhem. There is no great mystery to the recent spate of teens going amok.Psychologists have taught us how essential extreme childhood traumas can be in becoming factors in our later lives as adults. A sexually-unfulfilled degenerate lashes out at the society and his own culture because he realizes that he cannot fit in - or at least not to the extent to which he can compete against the plethora of alpha and beta males that surround him. So the self-loathing ex-narcissist decides to shoot down a bunch of his school-mates and teachers in an egotistical rage. This is not a phenomena that can be linked either to a political or economic system, which is exactly what Moore wants you to believe.Some of those armed-and-ready sociopathic teens don't run amok, killing a bunch of innocent school kids and teachers. Some of them decide to become makers of hateful, fact-twisting, speculatory, unscientific/unhistorical propaganda films. Perhaps Moore would have become a disgruntled armed-and-ready postal worker had his career as a fallacy-disseminator not gotten off the ground? The fact that Moore chose the Extreme Left as opposed to the Extreme Right was as random as a coin-toss. He could have just as easily become a racist skinhead, screaming bloody murder at every black guy or Asian who passed by him. The two political extremes are almost the exact same thing, from a psychological standpoint. The two political extremes are merely different manifestations of the same phenomenon. Stupidity, insanity, and psychopathy are the basic ingredients that they feed on.Moore's hatred of "dumb white men" (such irony!) isn't political: it is rooted in his immense egotism (and envy due to his possible rampant sexual inadequacy). It's all about kicking the one above you: the one who has succeeded as opposed to yourself who has failed. Ironically, now Moore isn't a failure any more, in a sense. The idiotic times we live in have made sure of that. Frightening levels of dumbing-down in the West and the general cultural pollution have aided Moore toward achieving the kind of undeserved fame that he now has. This IS The Age Of Paris Hilton, after all...For my fairly extensive "Left-wing Propaganda In Cinema" list, email me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Look At America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Bowling FOr Colmbine a few months ago and loved it. Michael Moore shows us that there is a lot more violence in America than any other country. His two main reasons are that guns are so easy to get and that the media makes us afraid all of the time. He also shows the average number of gun murders in the US is 11,127 when Australias is only 65 and Japan's is 39. Moore visits Canada to show that there are very few murders there even in the large cities. It is shown that almost everything is the same except for the news and most people don't look their doors. Moore shows us many other things like the Michigan Militia, an interview with James Nicholas who was once a bomb suspect, talks to two kids in Oscoda, interviews South Park creator Matt Stone, Shock rocker Marliyn Manson, shows a cartoon of a brief history of America, and talks to actor and NRA spokesman Charleton Heston. If you want to see a movie about the Us go and rent this awesome documentary!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know Michael Moore has some facts that seem a little unreal and unresearched, but I believed what he had to say in this film. It is actually very true. Also it's very scary to believe. I mean, I think about other countries, and they are not as violent as we are. We don't hear about England high school massacres and the murders all around the world very rarely involve a gun. But the Americans, we have guns. We use them, and are very afraid. I was glad Michael brought up the news and how it's nothing but bad and frightening stories. "Escalators: Stairway to Hell!" or "You could die in your sleep!". It goes on and on. I know Michael shouldn't really complain about our beloved country, because there are a lot of great things in America he does not mention. But I think that this was a well made documentary that has it's right to explain the truth.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first thing I saw by Moore, and I have since seen The Big One, Fahrenheit 9/11 and, recently, Capitalism: A Love Story. I have not read any of his books, however. Still, I've realized, as one would hope most who catch any of these do, that his work is entirely one-sided and black and white. With that said, he does always have great points, that he makes tremendously well. It just costs him credibility when he resorts to cheap tricks and emotional porn, not to mention how he oversimplifies the complex problems that he explores(in order to make his view come off as the only humane and right choice) and blatantly ignores/leaves out facts that completely alter the quality of the case that he is making. This does have some compelling segments, and seeing how easy it is to get a firearm, for example, is chilling. The various clips in this were obviously carefully selected, and most have exactly the effect on the viewer that they're meant to. This has excellent editing, and even when you know that what you're hearing isn't the whole truth, he tends to come off as convincing. There are numerous violent images and infrequent strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone interested in the subject of arms in the US, and urge you to, of course, think about it for yourself and not take this at face value. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it does not have the magnitude of when JFK was assassinated or when the Challenger exploded on that cold winter day, but the day of the Columbine shootings is etched into the minds of millions of Americans. Being from a small Georgian town, I grew up in an area where guns were ever present. Even when I went to high school quite a number of the boys had two hunting rifles on the gun racks within their pickup trucks. It never crossed my mind that one day one of these guys would bring a gun to school and blow off the principal's head. Even after reading Stephen King's novella Rage and watching the opening sequence of Scott Kalvert's The Basketball Diaries, the likelihood of such an event never crossed my mind. However, on April 20, 1999 while my roommate and I smoked cigarettes in our nonsmoking dorm room at the University of Georgia, we were informed by our local news station that two boys had shot up their school and killed several of their classmates and injured many, many more.While it might not be directly related to the Columbine Shooting, I came to have a strong dislike of guns, especially handguns that, in my opinion, have no other use than to kill people. I came to possess a fear of firearms and hate the idea of even having one near me. Therefore, it seemed, that Bowling for Columbine was made for people like me.Written of by many as a polemic against firearms, Bowling for Columbine actually focuses more on America, popular media, and the neurotic fear that supposedly resonates within a large number of Americans. Moore, with his tongue-in-cheek interviews, talks to several individuals who seem to be a bit less than stable, such as James Nichols, brother of Terry Nichols, and members of the Michigan based militia that Timothy McVeigh once belonged to. To balance things out he also interviews such normal individuals as Marilyn Manson and Matt Stone of South Park fame. However, where Bowling for Columbine truly shines is its caustic critique of the U.S. media that is saturated with blood. Also the documentary focuses on the portrayal of blacks in the media and how easy it is for whites to put the blame on blacks for crimes.While a bit heavy handed, and also quite condescending at times, I think Bowling for Columbine is a decent film about violence and media in America. While many rightists will not look past Moore's overweight and scruffy appearance, Moore succeeds in showing that there is something wrong with America: a country in which a seventeen year old can easily get his hands on firearms and purchase bullets at a department store to rampage and nearly destroy a community.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth Hurts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just recently watched 'Bowling for Columbine', an interesting, truthful film, and I found out that America is a nation, where a gun is almost in every home and business as the film portrayed not so in the cities like New York, but in more suburban areas such as Columbine, where a weapons base is actually situated. Michael Moore was a great host to the movie, and found 'Bowling for Columbine' a very interesting film that gets a well deserved 6/10. As you just read I found 'Bowling for Coumbine' really truthful and interesting and tells America the truth, that it does have a problem with gun crime with more than 1,000 deaths compared to the United Kingdom with only 60 deaths by gun crime each year, and the government say it's bad over here, I don't think it's fair that the American nation get the blame for the gun crime, when George Bush is killing innocent Iraqi civilians.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As exemplary as Roger and Me, with a crucial overall topic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoiler warning)The genius of Michael Moore and how he handles the information he brings forth in his latest film Bowling for Columbine, is that it doesn't just focus on Columbine. It does that too, but it doesn't ponder on that one issue in America- it focuses on America itself, and our obsession with violence, the fear in which that produces, and how the media is always dishing out more even when the crime rate starts to slowly trickle down. The first scene is a oddly proud (if you can call it that) display of what the second amendment can produce in this country- Moore visits a bank to set up an account, and at such a particular bank, they give him a free gun. This just starts off the in-your-face, incendiary style that sometimes is amusing (like when a clip of Chris Rock's Bigger and Blacker is shown, and he explains his theory on making bullets cost $5000) and really emotionally whalloping. There is something is Moore's voice that is so straightforward it's sorrowful, as he views his hometown of Flynt, Michigan, where his first expose was centered, the youngest adolescent school shooting occur, in a first grade class. There are also interviews; two I'll mention here- one being Matt Stone, co-creator of South Park, who went to school in Littleton, Colorado, and he explains briefly about the basic bulls*** that's hammered into many already over-stressed teens. The other is one that becomes the conclusion to the film- Sir Charlton Heston, leader of the NRA, who went to Littleton and Flynt mere days after shootings to promote the NRA. Alzheimers or not, you can see how old Chuck wants people to think.Those who may think Moore only does finger pointing and doesn't solve problems are missing the point, and he makes note of this in the scene in animation where we see the history of the white man and their fears are always shown. As long as constant fear is pumped into the minds of Americans by News networks, and as long as Americans literally have guns under their pillows at night, there won't be any solutions. These points and much more are brilliantly weaved together my Moore, and it's not just thought provoking, it's thought arising- it's personal, stark, bravado documentary movie-making, and it is deserved of an Oscar.

		<fullReview>"Do you think it's kind of dangerous handing out guns at a bank? "It was Michael Moore's first question when he went to a bank in michigan where you usually get a handgun if you open an account - but the bank employee didn't answer.I think the movie was very interesting. It showed me how gun-fanatical a lot of Americans are. I've heard about that before but I didn't know that it is on such a big scale. For me it is very shocking to know that every American is able to get a gun just by opening an account. There's no connection between weapons and banks. Much more it is irresponsible.The fact is that michael moore is American himself - so the provoked documentation about America is justified.I've seen the movie three times and i really like the way michael moore uses irony and sarcasm because the topic is so ironic itself. That's what really clarified the earnestness of the movie.I also watched Fahrenheit 9/11 by Michael Moore and i really liked it too. It's just the way he makes his movies and includes himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)Did Charlton Heston get blind-sided by Michael Moore? Yes, but he's definitely old enough and savvy enough to know better. Did Moore gain entry to the Heston Hollywood mansion using false pretenses? No, he told the one-time celluloid god of the waters that he was a lifetime, paid-up member of the National Rifle Association, and once inside even showed his membership card. And, although the average guy in the street might be disarmed by Moore's folksy style and declasse dress code, Heston knew that Moore was a big time media guy (previous film: Roger and Me; book: Stupid White Men).But Heston never misses a chance to spread the Second Amendment gospel. He just thought he could handle the situation. There's no fool like an old fool, they say. To his credit, when he realized that he had fallen into a trap, he moseyed off, putting one gimpy leg carefully in front of the other as he carried a bent back and a 79-year-old frame off camera.Well, was this fair? Indeed, was the entire film fair? No, of course not. This is Michael Moore simultaneously making a buck, building a rep, and working a cause. The cause is something like 11,000 dead-by-gunshot Americans every year (a pretty good cause), and the target is indeed Charlton Heston, long-time spokesman not only for God, but more significantly, the NRA, and of course gun and ammo manufacturers and sellers. So at least we can say that Michael Moore was after big game.He mostly bagged them too (and made Dick Clark look heartless), but somehow I didn't gain much satisfaction. I don't care much for Charlton Heston, either as an actor or a proselytizer, but I am finding, after watching this and Fahrenheit 9/11, that I don't care much for Michael Moore either. I think all good, right-thinking liberals should continue to play fair even though the opposition might not. This film preached to the choir and a good time was had by all who agree with Moore's point of view. The cover on this DVD even quotes Time Magazine as saying the film is "hilarious." Somehow though I don't think those on the right thought it was all that funny. And I wonder if those in the middle were swayed one way or the other. It is indeed heartbreaking that kids in this country pick up guns and shoot each other, and the fact that they do it much more often per capita than any other country in the First World does indeed call for an explanation. Ironically, I think Heston actually had the answer. This is a violent country with a violent history relative to other industrial nations. Moore and Heston agreed that our history isn't more violent than, say, Germany's, but they got their ideas confused. In Germany the violence was by the state and its armies and its police. We have plenty of that as well of course, but in the US we also have a tradition of the handy six-shooter in the holster for a quick draw and a further tradition of celebrating the rugged individual who stands up against the state and anyone wanting to take his arms away.Personally I think there's a lot to be said and not said for both sides in this all too American debate. The Freudian implication that would-be macho guys need guns symbolically to feel like men is very real. It was no accident that Heston let slip the "multi-ethnic" rationale for explaining all those dead by firearms in the USA, a rationale that is usually interpreted to mean fear of a big black dude breaking into one's home. Or actually that is often a sort of "make my day" fantasy indulged in by some randy militia types as they sip a little Jack Daniels on the front porch swing as they fondle their weapon.Well, what's the answer? There is no answer. It is a gradual process from the jungle to civilization, and the US, in this gun-toting regard, is just a little behind the rest of the West. If Michael Moore wants to focus on some people who really adore their weapons, he should take a trip to Iraq or Afghanistan, or just watch the nightly news.Still this is worth seeing as a kind of Americana snapshot portfolio. Marilyn Manson proves a fine foil for Charlton Heston, and the Afro-American elementary school principal can be balanced against the poor little black kid who shot the little white girl, who can be contrasted with the members of the NRA who think the black kid should be tried as an adult, who can be contrasted with the kids at Columbine who were just there when it happened. And the mentality of Moore and his crew in imagining that they won a "victory" against K-Mart when it agreed to take the ammo off it shelves can be contrasted with the young dude who was disappointed that he wasn't named a number one collaborating suspect. (Actually the ammo sales are small potatoes to K-Mart which has big management and bottom-line problems.) But see this to study the techniques used by Moore. Oh, where, oh, where has the concept of objective journalism gone--or did it ever exist in the first place?</fullReview>

I really like that way he put it all together and the flaw of the story is just right making it somewhat enjoyable (sound weird i know, but it is). The cartooning and the explanation are simple and pretty educational and easy to understand. Also load of examples have also been given - like comparing US to Canada.Even though this is only Michael Moore point of view on particular subject, i would say that he have done a pretty good job on expressing it and so i like to recommend other people to watch too.My rating: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can agree with him or not but you'll have to admit that this documentary is well made.It's funny, all the people that hate and don't agree with this documentary and Michael Moore are still all debating and discussing with the people that do agree with certain points brought up in this documentary. So in a way this documentary serves its purpose to start up a debate worldwide, not just here or on the Internet in general but also in 'real life'. Therefor you can justly call "Bowling for Columbine" truly a successful documentary.I knew that America had an high firearm kill rate (but quite frankly I never ever wondered why) but it really surprised me that it was so incredibly much higher than in other countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom. This documentary explains why it in America is so much higher than in other countries, or at least it tries to...No, "Bowling for Columbine" is not always completely fair and some of the points brought up are not convincing enough. Also at times it contradicts itself, for instance Micheal Moore brings up the point that movies and TV shows are not to blame for the violence because the same movies and TV shows are also showed in other countries were the kill rates aren't as near as high. But yet moments later Michael Moore blames the TV show "Cops" for discriminating and stir up hate against Hispanic and Afro-American people in America. An huge contradiction if you ask me...But than again, the documentary has some strong moments and good and interesting points. It's also wonderful to see how much Michael Moore achieves in this documentary, such as the fact that they stop selling bullets at Walmart because Moore walks in with some kids that were seriously injured by bullets sold at Walmart. It by the way really shocked me and seemed amazing by me that they sold bullets at a store such as the Walmart that literally is at every corner of every town. But the thing that tops everything is the final interview with NRA President Charlton Heston, it was really 'wow' for me.Unlike other documentaries, this one isn't ever boring mainly because it also contains lot's of humor and is very straight to the point and contains some good interviews and points. More than enough stuff to make you think...8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With "Bowling for Columbine", Michael Moore created a troika of right-on political documentaries, since turned into a quartet with "Fahrenheit 9/11". This one of course looks at America's gun culture, and why we have so many gun-related deaths. Obviously, Bush's lackeys are going to do everything possible to try and discredit Moore, but they can't deny the facts that he presents. It's surprising that Charlton Heston agreed to meet with him.And his comment at the 2003 Oscars was just perfect. Remember, they awarded him - and the audience applauded - for a documentary that says that we buy guns, kill each other, attack the rest of the world, and even armed Saddam Hussein.I'm eager to see "Sicko" and the "Fahrenheit 9/11" sequel.</fullReview>

The fact that our politicians are in the pocket of the NRA is so obvious by the fact that the majority of Americans believe that we should control the proliferation of these weapons that are easily obtained. The real weapons of mass destruction can be bought at any of the numerous gun shows in this country and at the biggest gun dealer in the country - Wal-Mart.Michael Moore makes a documentary and the world takes notice. He is a master of using humor and satire to show us our foibles and the despicable love of money over life that pervades our government. He deserved ever award that he received for this film and it needs to be seen over and over to remind us of just how un-humane we are.This is not a feel-good movie, but a mirror in which each of us has to reflect on whether we are part of the problem or part of the solution. Until we get a control on guns in this country, it is ridiculous to have the State Department issue warning for American travelers going overseas.

It is a finger in the wound of the frightened American society. The courage of Michael Moore, exposing important contemporary persons of his society, is something very difficult to see in other films. This provocative and no conclusive documentary makes people think about and discuss violence in society, which is its greatest quality. I live in a violent society due to different reasons, and I know how important is to discuss this subject, to make people conscious of the problem and try to find solutions to improve the situation. Unfortunately he just mentioned Chile's dictatorship of Pinochet in South American, and forgot to make reference to others dictatorships sponsored by USA in the same period in other South American countries, such as Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. But indeed this is not the focus of this documentary. Why this film is not listed in IMDB Top 250? Isn't the User Rating of 8.6, with 23,174 votes enough to achieve a position in this ranking? My vote (no. 23,175) is ten.Title (Brazil): `Tiros em Columbine' (`Shots in Columbine')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary film is one of the most interesting ideas there has been, especially from director Michael Moore. He documents the story of guns and their use in the United States of America. He includes information about deaths in all countries by gun fire, what inspires people to do it, and how easy it is to get a gun and use it. But most of the main focus is about the brutal incident at Columbine school where two young boys killed many students, a teacher and then themselves. Michael Moore adds small bits of comedy to add interest, including a cartoon, and he picks good interviewees from public, press and politics to answer the questions. Starring Moore himself, Marilyn Manson, South Park co-creator Matt Stone (a former Columbine student), and NRA (National Rifle Association) president and Oscar winning actor, Charlton Heston. It won the Oscar for Best Documentary, Features, and it won the Cannes Film Festival 55th Anniversary Prize, and it was nominated the Golden Palm. It was number 3 on The 50 Greatest Documentaries.
