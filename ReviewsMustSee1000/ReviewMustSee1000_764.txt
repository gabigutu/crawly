		<shortDescription>Just A Super Nice Film....What Else Can You Say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's another one of those old-fashioned movies in which people are all nice: no villains. It's a refreshing change of pace, once in a while, at least for me. Sometimes it's relaxing just to just kick back with a story that just makes you feel good, doesn't upset you at any time. There are some touching scenes with some sadness in here, too, however, but the sincere story and great acting make you glad you watched it.Robert Donat, as Mr. Chippings, is a pleasure to watch, particularly when he plays the character in his declining years. Greer Garson gets equal if not top billing, but that's not right. Her role is not that big in this picture.Another nice feature you don't see much, at least in post-1960 films - all respectful kids in here, with manners. Nice adults, nice kids, nice story - probably too corny for most people of today in our cynical world. Too bad. Their loss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful, sentimental film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Wood's film "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is the story of Mr. Chipping (Robert Donat), an elderly schoolmaster at the prestigious Brookfield school in England. At the beginning of the current year's term, "Mr. Chips" is retired, but still living on campus and still interacting with the boys at the school. Suffering a cold, he retires to his living room in front of a fireplace and begins to reminisce about his long, 63 - year career at the school. Beginning as an idealistic teacher, he gains a reputation for stodginess, though his peers and students find that to be an almost endearing quality. Years later, he goes on holiday with a fellow teacher to Austria and meets the love of his life, Katherine (Greer Garson) who is an intelligent free spirit. After a whirlwind courtship, the two marry, and Chips (as she begins to call him) brings her to England with him in time for the next term. With her influence, Chips begins to open up more to his students and peers and quickly gains a very popular following among both. Throughout the years, Chips takes care of his students, and sees several generations of boys from the same families come under his care, personified by the Colley boys (all played by Terry Kilburn). Once WWI begins, most of the older students and schoolmasters enlist, so Chips is asked to come out of retirement to do the job that he has wanted to do his entire career at Brookfield ? become Headmaster, leading the next generation of students while being forced to deal with the losses of his former students from the war."Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is obviously the inspiration for films like "Mr. Holland's Opus" in that it is a sentimental story of a young and insecure teacher who carries through with his career not really knowing the influence he has had on his students. "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" did not have a big emotional crescendo at the end that similar films from the last two or three decades generally did (and do) but rather it had a quieter, more dignified emotional catch. Robert Donat is spectacular in this Oscar-winning role. It is amazing that he was able to play a man that was between 10-50 years older than he really was so convincingly. Greer Garson is wonderful as always in her role as "Mrs. Chips". The film itself was charming and sentimental without being overly sappy; I certainly had tears streaming down my cheeks at the end, but didn't feel foolish about it. I would recommend this one to anyone, but I think that it will certainly get a much better response from classic film lovers due to its purity and its unabashed sentimentality. 7/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mr Chips" is a celebration of the teaching profession. "Chips" finishes teachers' college in England and is almost run over by the students his first day teaching. But he learns how to balance good teaching with the right amount and kind of discipline in order for his students to be guided into a good education. However, he is somewhat shy and almost always in earnest."Chips" takes a vacation and meets a woman while doing some hiking. She is his perfect match and they fall in love and marry and she helps him to come out of his shell. He begins cracking jokes that have the students rolling on the desks with laughter. The couple become more than just educators; they begin to care for the children in many other ways.The film follows "Chips" throughout his growing old. He gives the children morale and courage during the horrors of the War. "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" shows the beauty and rewards of the teaching profession, though it can be very difficult at times. Robert Donat gives one of the greatest acting performances in history. Brilliant! (10 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodbye old values!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the top TEN films of all time, I want to believe that Mr Chips exists for all school-children, that his spirit still hovers around places of learning waiting to guide those who might follow his lead as to decency, strength of character, gentility of nature and spiritual purity. Alas, Mr Chips is not required in 2001!This film, the story of a gentle English teacher at a British Boarding school, is so timeless and emotionally involving, I find it hard to write about it without having to control my own feelings. Not a wuss by one hell of a long shot, and having last openly cried probably the last time I saw this film, I can only say that exposure to Robert Donat's performance here in the role which won him the most deserving of Academy Awards, is perhaps one of the greatest things can happen in your life. If you think I might be exaggerating, do me a favor - don't watch it! If you watch it and aren't moved, especially when his wife dies, then your life is meaningless!GOODBYE MR CHIPS is probably the most beautiful film of all time and is a reminder of what we are all really here for. It's not that new pair of trendy shoes, the Rolex, the yellow drop-top with twin exhaust, that sharp Armani suit, the Chanel parfum, the 50,000 shares you picked up for a song last week, your blonde-tipped rinse, Nike shoes or $100 tie.....its for what Mr Chips STOOD for in 1939...and I got news for you, he's still here with his text-book open at the next lesson!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>memorable story, human, engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film demonstrates that if a cinematic work obeys the rules of good, simple lucid storytelling, it can hold up for a very long time indeed.Here is my synopsis of this wonderful film--certainly an instance where a great book (by James Hilton, who also did "A High Wind in Jamaica" and "Lost Horizon", two novels which also benefited by excellent screenplays) translates well to the big screen. The character of Chipping is well worth exploration--one of cinema's most memorable figures. In this synopsis I want to mainly touch on the personality of Chipping--and why his story makes such an impression on the viewer. Its a case of a character being well-drawn enough to strike a spark of recognition in us--we all know someone like Chipping.First of all, Chipping is a person who doesnt think too much of himself. Outwardly, he is completely unremarkable. As a young man he has no prospects. He is wayward and drifting, and all on his own. He has no family to speak of. He seems to come from nowhere and also seems to be going nowhere. He is not a "mover or a shaker". He is a meek little mouse of a man that registers on no one. He is quiet and shy. He is on the reserved, traditional side, conservative in speech, dress, deportment, and character. He is also bookish and myopic--neither charismatic in looks nor athletic in limb (at odds in an age filled with charismatic, athletic specimens)."Chips" hardly is a type to "stand out in a crowd" and he knows it. This makes him not a "joiner". He has few associations, and his friendships are not very deep. Chips "keeps himself to himself". He loves frequently, for example, but the objects of his affection are never aware of it. He is one of those loner types, who feel the urge to try to fit in but find that they are not really suited to fit in anywhere. He is one of those people who have worlds inside of them that no one ever sees.Whatever noble qualities he has are all hidden and on the inside of the man, rather than on the outside. Chips is the epitome of the socially awkward, introspective, backward individual. When the story begins, we may surmise that, even though a young man in his early twenties, he has proably never yet been with a woman. Where would he have had the chance?In any case, Chips is taken on as an instructor at an English boarding school in the middle 19th century. The heyday of the English boarding school. This, the start of "his position" in life, is certainly one important aspect of his life and of this story.But the real "hook" of the narrative, the most important personal event in his existence, begins as an incident that happens shortly after he is settled into his teaching career. One holiday he accepts an invitation to go cycling in the Alps with a colleague. On a solitary hike into the mountains, he encounters a fellow English tourist--a woman--on her own.She is an extraordinary woman--an outgoing, experienced, cosmopolitan, charismatic, beautiful, graceful, clever, engaging --a truly marvellous woman. But she is a woman that is usually "already taken". A woman that, at her age, is usually found on the arm of a captain of industry, or an actor, or a politician. A woman of substance and import. A woman that can get any man she would want.Why is she single? Coincidentally, just as Chips is an oddity in his gender, she is an oddity to hers. She isnt empty-headed, for one thing, although she is very beautiful. She has standards. Although she has been courted incessantly by men from a very early age she is holding out until she meets a man that has inside him, the values and ideals that she prizes. And she happens to be wise enough and sharp-eyed enough and insightful enough to spy the admirable interior qualities of Chips. She sees that he is loyal and devoted and true of heart.So, from this chance meeting, a romance develops. Chips, of course, is truly astonished. But it becomes a fact. The two actually do marry. The woman does not want a politician, an actor, or a captain of industry--she wants him. She is the only other living being who comes close enough to see him at all--really see him. This is the very happiest time Chips ever has in his whole existence. He comes alive. He is out of his shell. From that point on, he does a lot of things that he would never have dreamed of doing previously. Its because he is no longer alone.The two have maybe two or three years of life together--until, one day, the woman takes ill from some reason or other and, unaccountably, dies at a young age. Chips has to spend the rest of his life in love with something that is no longer real. His memories are real, to him, but he never again lives in the way that he did when he enjoyed her company.He will remain at the school for a good many years--in fact, he will live his life there and die there. The remainder of the story, and the movie, is about how this meek soul actually manages to eke out a very passable life for himself, to obtain some measure of happiness despite his humble beginnings and the sadness of his early tragedy.Chips actually manages to have a life that despite all obstacles, exerts a positive effect on a great many other people. We see him able to live to a very great age, despite many years of loneliness, despite many hardships and trials. Over time, his inner qualities prove him to be seen by many people as a worthwhile person. Completely by accident.In fact, he winds up to be the most-loved member of the school's faculty. The satisfaction arising from this fact may be the only solace that Chips attains, but to him its enough. He never forgets the woman. But, the story seems to say, he seems to be able to find . . . compensation."Goodbye Mr. Chips" is a movie that deals surely and confidently with the most integral and basic, human-scale events: yearnings and disappointments, dreams, the play of randomness in life, the strength of memory, and the effect of time on the soul. To the hip, or the unimaginative "modern" viewer this work will surely seem dated, mawkish, and flat; its just not got the zing, pizazz, or hype that pervades more contemorary flicks. Instead, this film is here for the long haul. The way I feel about it is, if films cant encompass the above-mentioned topics without earning a sour smirk these days from a trendy hipster, then what should our films be about?I know, I know. You dont have to tell me. Car chases, breasts, and explosions. See you later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't add anything to what my fellow-reviewers have said except for the fact that this is my favorite movie of all time. I watch it whenever I am depressed about the depths to which humans are capable of going (which is all too often depicted in modern movies). This movie portrays the opposite.Chipping starts out as a teacher who, because of an introverted personality, has trouble communicating with the students in his charge and with his superiors. Before going on the trip on which he meets his beloved, he is passed over for a promotion as head of a residence hall, despite the fact that he has seniority. He is also made fun of by his students and finds he must revert to a strict form of discipline to keep them in line; he is not a popular teacher as a result. He is at a low ebb, starting to think that he is a failure in life.Then, on a vacation to continental Europe, he meets the character played by Greer Garson. They have a whirlwind romance, which, in itself, is so enjoyable to watch. He is so clumsy in his advances. And she is amused by him. The actors do a great job of showing the chemistry between the characters.They eventually get married, which gives "Chips" the confidence he had lacked. His wife makes some suggestions which helps him find the balance of discipline and fun with the students, and he soon comes to love his students as he would his own children, and, in the process, becomes one of the most popular teachers in the school.One of my favorite aspects of this movie is its idyllic view of marriage. It really shows what marriage "could" be (two people coming together to become stronger as a unit than they would have been separately--another movie of this vintage which portrays the same is "Stars and Stripes, Forever", the biopic of John Phillip Sousa).Robert Donat's performance, as the other reviewers have noted, is of the highest caliber--ever. And, Greer Garson's role was all too short. Also, of note are Chipping's friend who invites him to Europe and urges him ahead in his romance, and, of course, the various children who come into his life.Macho men must be careful with this one. If it doesn't make you cry, nothing will. It may be best to take your girlfriend with you so that she can see your sensitive side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Children of privilege</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The children attending the Brookfield school are no ordinary English boys; they are the the children of the upper classes of society, who for generations have learned from institutions such as the school represented here. They are molded at places like this fictional one to be leaders of their country. Mr. Chipping is a teacher who gives his life to Brookfield, only to be bypassed when promotions are handed out. His love for the profession and his dedication to the formation of these children are his reasons for living. Most of his own life is spent at the school. Only in times of crisis is Mr. Chipps recognized. Mr. Chipps knows happiness only too briefly. He is extremely lucky when he finds Katherine. One can see the rapport in her, although we never see it explicitly on Chipping's face, maybe because a stiff upper lip that doesn't let him express his true feelings to a woman who adored him from their first encounter. Mr. Chipps lives long enough to learn about the death of his beloved students in several world conflicts. As a father figure, his life is full because the love and admiration the young boys feel for him. The film made Robert Donat a favorite of the movie going public. Mr. Donat goes from being a taciturn person into a jolly old man living on his own because Katherine dies young. The film improves tremendously when Greer Garson appears. Her luminous presence changes the tone of the movie because of her incredible charm. Paul Henreid makes a short appearance as Staefel, the fellow teacher who invites Mr. Chipps to accompany on a vacation trip to Austria. Sam Wood direction pays a close look to detail. The film is a classic and will live forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies of Its Kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amongst those movies that aim to use straightforward human drama alone to tell a thoughtful story, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is one of the finest. Robert Donat's performance gives you not just one character to remember, but several, as he convincingly portrays Chipping's different personas at different stages of his life.Greer Garson is also excellent in her role, and Paul Henreid gets some good scenes as well. These relationships and others throughout the movie make for a believable and memorable portrayal of the title character, and also of the world in which he lived. The story is well-written, and it includes a very good variety of material, showing the characters dealing with everything from eager anticipation to grave concern, from blissful joy to great sorrow, and much in between.The panorama from generation to generation also works well, showing both change and stability as time passes. While only a handful of scenes contain weighty material, all of it is thoughtful, and much of it memorable. It keeps everything balanced and believable, and it's been a good while since any movie of its kind has worked so well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>triumph for MGM British</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third in the series of films MGM made in Britain was perhaps their greatest triumph, with a well-deserved Academy Award for Robert Donat, who played Mr Chips over a span of 60 years very convincingly. Always a great actor, Donat was perhaps at his best in this story covering the history of a schoolmaster from his first appearance at the school as a young idealist, through crusty middle age (and a change when he meets charming Greer Garson, in her first screen appearance, stranded up an Austrian mountain) and into his much loved dotage as a kind of human fixture and fittings of Brookfield School.James Hilton's book is developed here to give not only a view of the English public school system which probably never existed, but to cover issues such as the Great War with some power. The film is extremely touching in places - whether this is because of the acting or the excellent music I'm not quite sure. I do know that this version of the film is streets ahead of the misguided musical version which appeared three decades later with Peter O'Toole in the lead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, Oscar worthy performance by Robert Donat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Sam Woods (`Kitty Foyle: The Natural History of a Woman,' `King's Row,' `For Whom the Bell Tolls') 1939 film `Goodbye Mr. Chips' features a top-notch performance by Robert Donat as the somewhat stuffy English prep school teacher, Mr. Chippings. Chippings early career difficulties are overcome, as is his shyness after he meets Greer Garson (`Mrs. Miniver') in the Alps while on holiday. Garson is able to show the stodgy Chips how to live life and her effect on him lasts throughout the rest of his life, although Garson is not around for long.The film uses recurring patterns to show the passage of time, namely the showing of the boys arriving at the school each year in the autumn. These segments often contained little historical snippets between the boys, such as `we now have telephones, do you know how to use one?' and mention of Queen Victoria's death and the remark that `it is going to be strange to have a King.' Other historical comments occurred between the teachers such as the remark on a book by a new author, H.G. Wells and how he will never last because his writing is too fantastic. Sadly, Chip's historical error occurs when he comments to the boys that they will not have to go off to World War I as the war cannot possibly last more than a few weeks. So many of the teachers and students end up losing their lives in the Great War. Some other scenes from this film have been parodied through the years in comedies, most noticeably the scenes in the great hall when the headmasters are speaking to the boys is sent up hilariously by John Cleese in `Monty Python's the Meaning of Life' and the scene where Chips canes an insolent student (it is filmed as a shadow against the wall) is later parodied when a punisher is reprimanded for whipping the shadow, not the victim (my memory is failing me here, but I think this is in 1969s `Take the Money and Run' by Woody Allen, I could be wrong as a part of me also thinks that this could be in Mel Brooks' `Blazing Saddles.')Donat aptly handles the complex role of Chips through the years, from about his mid-20s until his 80s. This may be one of the earlier movies that so aptly chronicles the life and times of a person through such an expanse of years, Dustin Hoffman in `Little Big Man' also performs n this manner, as does Al Pacino in `The Godfather Trilogy,' albeit over the length of three long movies. Even more outstanding and interesting about Donat and his character is that he covers so much of a common man's existence; Chips is a teacher, not a King, general, messiah or Mafia chieftain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goodbye Mr Chips must be one of the best films ever made.The acting of boys, masters and other characters is superb, as is the capturing of the late Victorian/Edwardian period in England, the joy of 1914 on the declaration of war, followed by the sombre roll-calls of the dead in chapel during the war years.The character of Chips is an instruction in how someone's life can be transformed for the better by fortuitous events, in this case the meeting on the mountain between Chips and Katherine, which changed him from being a shy but well-meaning schoolmaster who found it difficult to establish a rapport with his pupils and colleagues into someone whose hidden depths and charisma were brought into view by a woman he loved.This gentle, decent and moving film illustrates, through both Chips and Katherine, the importance of giving of oneself to others who in their turn will benefit as human beings; concepts which might seem outdated in our modern world but remain valuable and timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A warm, pleasant and charming film about how a person changes throughout life, the people one gets to know, the friendships, and the inspiration that one can provide for many others. It is not so much a film that amazes, but rather one that is hard to flaw. The cast is good, but in particular Robert Donat is excellent, playing the title character from youth adulthood to older age. The film manages to capture both the spirit of youth (the schoolboys) and the experience of their teachers, making it a very well rounded film. Together with an excellent makeup job and a good selection of music to fit the film, the overall result is very praiseworthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy And Purpose Driven Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I noted that IMDb has told us that James Hilton in writing Goodbye Mr. Chips modeled the character out of a former teacher he had at a British public school who had a similar lengthy term of service. It's nice to know that there are people like Chipping actually teaching our future generations out there.Chips is the sort of role that fit Robert Donat and only Robert Donat. I cannot imagine any other actor playing the cerebral and shy schoolteacher. The film follows him for about sixty of the 83 years of his life. He arrives at Brookfield School around 1870, a young idealistic graduate certain of the vocation he has chosen. He doesn't mix well and his pedantic ways don't make him a school favorite. Donat certainly changes when on holiday in Europe with Paul Henreid, the German teacher at Brookfield School, he meets and eventually weds Greer Garson.Goodbye Mr. Chips was Greer Garson's first introduction to American audiences. When she emerges from that mist on the Alp both Donat and she are climbing, she was a star from then on. Her screen image was set as the wise, tactful, and patient wife who was normally partnered with Walter Pidgeon. But she and Donat have good chemistry also.Paul Henreid also got his first exposure to American audiences as well. Interesting that in 1939 a German would be played so sympathetically. My feelings are that they wanted to show that the Allies had nothing against the German people only the terrible ideology that at that time held them in sway. Long after Henreid has had his last scene it is reported that he is killed in World War I, fighting for his country and against the country that gave him a living for many years. Good people can fight for the enemy also.Chips is the kind of character that we admire because he's at a job he loves and does give the world that infinitesimal extra ounce of good in doing that job. He's not acclaimed, certainly his demise wouldn't rate banner headlines, but so few of us are lucky to be in jobs and professions we truly love and not do for just a paycheck.In that great year of Gone With the Wind sweeping the Oscars that year, Robert Donat managed to beat out Clark Gable for the Best Actor Award. He had some other good competition that year with James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Mickey Rooney in Babes in Arms, and Laurence Olivier in Wuthering Heights. The capstone of a great career.We should all hold and treasure teachers like Mr. Chipping of Brookfield School and the films made of their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest films ever made and easily surpasses later versions. Donat's progression from young inexperienced teacher to that of acting headmaster is quite brilliant, as is the overall portrayal of public school life down from Victorian times through to the verge of the Second World War. There were many Mr. Chips' of the period and there have been since, so much so that the phrase has become folklore in the English language. I don't mind admitting the ending brought tears to my eyes as this wonderful old man, who lost his wife and son during childbirth, reminisces about his lifetime in teaching and how he influenced all the hundreds of boys in his care, including those who did not survive the First World War. It is important for the modern generation to appreciate how their society was shaped and this film does it in abundance. It is founded on self sacrifice and service to the community at large and the public school system in particular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many of us remember that one teacher that made a difference in our lives...that cared just that little bit extra to inspire and motivate. This movie follows the fictional career of just such a teacher, Mr. Chipping of Brookfield school.Set in in a private English boy's school in the years prior to, and during World War One, it tells the story of a young, naive graduate teacher who grows from being a nervous, pedantic and generally disliked master to a cornerstone of education in his school, loved and respected by all, especially its students. The teacher is played brilliantly by the English actor, Robert Donat whose mannerisms and excellent attention to detail enable his character to transform over the course of the film from a young man in his early twenties to an elderly don in his eighties far more than any simple application of make-up.Although a little too sentimental and simplistic in the view of some, this wonderful and moving film should be compulsory viewing for prospective teachers everywhere.The DVD version is compiled from the best print available. One must remember that this is an old film (1939) and the original film stock has not travelled all that well over the years. There is some visual grain evident from time to time and there are some imperfections in the optical soundtrack. However, once immersed in this film I doubt that this will worry you all that much as you become engrossed in the travails of Mr. Chips.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by no means the greatest film ever made, especially in such a fruitful year as 1939. But as you should do with any film, one must first review it in the context of its time and then apply it to the relevant issues of today. "Goodbye Mr. Chips" is a good film because it works in both categories. In a time when teacher themed sitcoms and films were sinking into a lull, "Mr. Chips" came forth with a ferocious animosity that had not been seen and as of yet has not been rivaled. It is an intense dive into the underbelly of school corruption, chronicling the rise, fall, and redemption of the title character and his students. Mr. Chips is a good man that constantly walks the line of rigid disciplinarian, role-model, and self-destructive masochist. His students on the other hand are the pseudo- innocents that suddenly get thrown into a whirlpool of gendered warfare while fighting the standards their school has set for them. Yes, the heroine sequences are rather grotesque, and the sex-photography sequence may at first seem unnecessary, but the elements of redemption rely on this harsh imagery to come across as potent. Indeed, "Goodbye Mr. Chips" is not for the faint of heart, but for those who can look beyond the brutality and see the beauty, it is a very powerful journey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wonderful and heart-wrenching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is marvelous and for so many reasons. First, I am a big fan of the novels of James Hilton and this adaptation is more true to his books than most (such as RANDOM HARVEST). Second, the acting and writing is so good it is almost impossible to imagine them being better. Greer Garson and Robert Donat are so perfect together. In fact, Donat's performance was good enough to wrestle away the Oscar from Clark Gable from GONE WITH THE WIND (though I honestly think Gable probably deserved it a little more).This is a story about a confirmed bachelor who is a teacher at a boys prep school. "Mr. Chips" as they call him is very decent but dull--and he's been a fixture at the school for some time. However, quite unexpectedly he meets a woman who pulls him out of his shell and changes his life (Garson). Unfortunately, lovers of happy endings beware--this romance will rip out your heart. Even the most jaded will find themselves pulled into it emotionally.This is a great film through and through. All those associated with this film have done themselves proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An acting triumph for Donat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people were mystified that Clark Gable did not win the Oscar for "Gone With The Wind", but as good as he was, he had to play 2nd fiddle to Robert Donat for his amazing performance as Mr. Chipping in "Goodbye Mr. Chips". His was one of the really great acting achievements, and certainly the best he ever did. One has to wonder if ill-health had not shortened his life, just how many more Awards he would have got - but then not many roles like Mr. Chips came along. In what was one of her very early roles, Greer Garson made a lovely Mrs. Chipping - just right for this. Ably supporting was Paul Henreid and Terry Kilburn, but Donat shone like a beacon. The atmosphere of that gentle time in England was well captured by Sam Wood, and this truly is a film for film buffs to really enjoy. If you can get it on DVD or Tape, do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donat's greatest performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a classic film buff, I consider "Goodbye, Mr Chips" one of the best I have ever seen. In part, that is due to Robert Donat's incredible performance as,"Chips." He WAS Chips, and it was silly to try and remake a proven classic, though Peter O'Toole was not a bad choice in casting.Donat captured the essence of Chips' shy personna and his love for "his boys," in one of the most sensitive performances I've ever had the pleasure to watch. In a year that arguably produced some of the greatest movies in film in history, "Goodbye, Mr Chips" ranks in the top 5 of all time.I give it a 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The more I read on IMDB the more I realise that so many people interested in movies do not consider films more than 25 years or so old. I suspect that this is because most users of IMDB are aged 30 - 40 ish. Goodbye Mr Chips is exactly (on first sight) the type of movie that many of you would not even consider viewing. It has no special effects, cost peanuts to make, no clever camera work but it does have those three essentials - superb story, great script and staggeringly good acting from Donat. The movie is about life, relationships, about despair and decency and the power of love. What more could anybody ask for in a movie? If this film doesn't move and inspire you then truly nothing will.P.S. the Peter O'Toole version is pretty dire!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and Inspiring Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1870, Mr. Chipping (Robert Donat) arrives in the traditional Brookfield Boarding School to give history classes in the lower school. He has a rough first day with the indiscipline of the class, and the Headmaster Wetherby (Lyn Harding) advises him that he needs ability to exercise his authority, otherwise he would be fired. He gives a severe punishment to the class achieving the respect of the students. When Wetherby dies in 1888, the old-fashion senior Mr. Chipping expects to be the next headmaster, but he is not promoted. His German colleague and friend Max Staefel (Paul Von Hernried) invites him to travel on vacations with him to Austria, where he meets the progressive British Katherine (Greer Garson). The shy and lonely Mr. Chipping and Katherine fall in love for each other and sooner they get married. Back to Brookfield, the enchantment of Katherine makes Mr. Chips popular with his colleagues and students and he is promoted to housemaster. Katherine makes him believe that he could be the headmaster if he wanted, but she dies in the delivery with their baby. With the beginning of World War I, Mr. Chips is promoted to headmaster until his death after sixty-six years of service to Brookfield."Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is a beautiful movie with a pleasant story of a teacher that might have inspired the author of "To Sir With Love". Robert Donat gives a fantastic performance of a shy and old-fashionable man along sixty-six years of his life. Greer Garson shines in the role of a lovely woman ahead of time and it is wonderful to see her in this role. It is amazing the resemblance of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the Brookfield School when the students are reunited with the teachers, and the embarkation of students in the train station, and I dare to write that these locations in "Harry Potter" have been also inspired in the set decoration of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips". My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Adeus Mr. Chips" ("Goodbye Mr. Chips")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Was Transported Back in Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this wonderful film in late 2006, I was struck by how much simpler life was on many levels. Stepping out of line meant a good caning; falling in love did not have immediate sexual overtones; getting your baggage was virtually hassle-free; fear of terrorists was not foremost in the minds of international travelers; and, most delightfully, young boys were completely trusted in the company of men. Thoroughly enjoyable also is the view of history through the eyes of 1930's English historians. Racism and sexism are appropriate to the setting, but xenophobia, while evident in nearly every scene, is amusingly excoriated toward the end of the film.It is, in many ways, an anti-war movie. It shows well the contradiction of wanting for go to war in The Great War, merely for honor, only to come home to honored posthumously. Discipline and Boy Scout virtues are shown to be the backbone of society and it is implied that English society is the one that really matters. Still, forgiveness and a gentler touch are what eventually win the day.The film quality was not tremendous--the black and white graininess does compete well with contemporaries like "GWTW" and "The Wizard of Oz" and many corny visual devices, already trite by 1939, are used. However, these actually add to the charm of this movie. They reinforce the earnestness of the characters and the plot of GMC. (May I call it that?).This seems like the granddaddy of all prep school movies and is probably the inspiration for "Harry Potter", "Dead Poet's Society", "Chariots of Fire", and many others of this type (more of an ilk than a genre). This movie came out 11 years before I was born, but it made me wish I had attended Brookfield.Robert Donat shows restraint while showing great range, no mean feat. Greer Garson is delightful and the supporting cast is dutiful and appropriate. Paul Henried plays a caricature of himself to a degree that would be mocked in other settings, but feels just right here.No serious film buff's viewing portfolio is complete without this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faithful adaptation of a perfect book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read the book a dozen or so times I saw the film for the first time tonight. There's an inherent difficulty in translating a book like GMC to the screen: its episodic (the episodes sometimes more than a decade apart), and relies for much of its effect on a narrative voice that I'm not sure could be captured successfully outside of print. The occasional stream-of-consciousness internal monologues given to Chips (in the book there's a terribly moving one at the end) could be, and its probably a fault of the film that they weren't.I disliked the Martin Clunes adaptation. Primarily because it lumbered Chips with all sorts of attitudes (anti-fagging, anti-corporal punishment) that are completely alien to the book, and which it is inconceivable a conservative public school master of the Victorian / Edwardian era holding. Since this film was made in 1939 any attempts to modernise the character and his opinions are fortunately absent.It was terribly pleasing that the episode where Chips reads out the name of the German master who has been killed fighting on the Western Front as part of the roll of honour in Chapel has been included. One could have imagined it being cut because of rising anti-German feeling, but perhaps its inclusion represents a final victory for Chips' ideas of honour and decency.The scenes in the Chapel, the daily litany of names, are incredibly poignant (though they were even more so in the book). I'm not sure if it would be as affecting to someone who was not English and who hadn't been to a public school, but to those who are and who have, the Great War still casts a spectre (or at least it does to me). Every school chapel has its own memorial, with hundreds, sometimes thousands of names engraved on it; every Armistice Day the Last Post is played; my own school was still littered with photos of sports teams of whom half had died in the trenches or at sea. The Second World War doesn't seem to cast such a pall because it co clearly had a point. The Great War seems like nothing so much as a failure of diplomacy.Someone above wrote that they couldn't see the point of the film. "Man teaches for a long time, then dies", or words to that effect. Well, ignoring the adolescent idea that value and beauty can't exist within a story of the mundane, providing that story is well told, the film does actually have a point. Amongst others: the value and importance of honour; the satisfaction and necessity of dedicating one's life to a good greater than oneself and one's own material success; the affection that one can inspire and the significance that one can have by simply teaching and then dying.The film itself is simply but well shot. Donat's performance is excellent, while none of the others are any less than good. Those changes that have been made to the book do not corrupt its essential spirit and are trifling in importance. The only thing I didn't like: the young Collie who couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag and whose chubby, unattractive face fills the screen at the end.If you enjoyed the film then please read the book. It's small but almost literally perfect in form and conception. I'm actually moved to text the person to whom I've lent it and ask for it back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the films that I have seen, and there have been many, this film has the distinction of being the only one that makes me cry EVERY time I watch it.It is a tastefully understated tale, telling the story of Chips' life in episodic fashion. What makes this film so good however are the performances-- Robert Donat is magnificient through all the ages, Greer Garson's brief appearance makes the film and all the supporting cast are note perfect.A film like this could be accused of being sugary or over sentimental-- however, the wry humour and the very quietness of the movie prevent that from being true.This is a true classic-- not to be watched if you don't like b/w or stiff upper lip movies, but a must see for true film buffs.</fullReview>

Nice how they soften up to ol' teacher after Mrs. Chipping shows up and offers them nice compliments plus those excellent muffins. She added the feminine touch lacking in the school, IMO.I like how the Colley kid was played by the same actor for several succeeding generations. This was nice continuity.Greer's costuming was just ravishing. Again, this was a nice touch against the severity and seriousness of the males in the school.Donat shows well the friendship, love and care for his wife. To lose her so early was just tragic.Nice how Chipping had to lead the school when so many professors were in the Great War. It gave him a new purpose.15/10</fullReview>

As one reviewer points out, with the lack of comments for this film, it makes one wonder if people remember anything before colour? British cinema has had some glorious moments (maybe not enough) in the spotlight with stunning films such as Ghandi, The Hill, Kes, Trainspotting and others, but too infrequently and too short. i first saw this at the age of 10 and it has stayed with me throughout my life and is probably the only film i can recall without hesitation for many years. we are shown examples of films to be seen at Xmas, such as 'It's a wonderful life' but for those who still have families around for Xmas and prefer family values to the XBox generation, this film has it all. And if watching with your friends/family and they ask what is the matter, dry your eyes (guaranteed tissues required) and offer the Kleenex around. again..... FLAWLESS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Donat's performance in this is wonderful. A youngish man at the time, he plays about 50% of the movie as an octogenarian and you never think for one minute that he is not an elderly man, his gestures, language and walk are all that of an old man. ***warning minor spoilers*** I have always found Greer Garson to be a little stiff in her acting and here she does not disappoint. Perhaps "aloof" is a better word, you do not quite pick up on the passion she supposedly feels for her "Mr. Chips". And the death bed scene is dealt with so quickly that it lends a false note to an otherwise remarkable story set in a privileged England of wonderful boys' boarding schools where rampant sadism and perversions never existed. Robert carries the movie beautifully, this actor had an untimely early death, unfortunately for us movie lovers. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Necessary Profession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If somebody doesn't teach the children, our society and our culture dies out in one generation. That makes teaching THE necessary profession. Without teachers, we have nothing, we can do nothing, we are nothing. And there is no profession more thankless, more under-compensated, more maligned, and more difficult. Why would anyone do it? For the best answer available, watch this version of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips".First and foremost, a young (33 years old) plays a British boy's school master, from he first day at school, through decades of boys, through his retirement and his dotage. Donat brilliant captures Mr. Chippings' awkward beginning, his fumbling to find himself as a teacher, his growing comfort in his own skin, largely courtesy of Katherine, a lovely young woman whom he meets while lost in the mountains on a summer vacation hike; whom he marries, and loses to childbirth. Donat ages brilliantly and believably.Greer Garson plays Katherine, with all the loveliness and grace that characterized her life and career. Paul Henried is the German teacher, Staefel, who persuades Chipping to take the vacation where he meets his Kathie, who must leave Britain for his home in Germany when the two countries get embroiled in World War I, whom Chipping, to the consternation of many, memorializes when Staefel dies fighting for Germany in the war.But watch the boys. Little Terry Kilburn plays each of the Colley boys as little ones, with heart-breaking cuteness. Watch the boys grow, watch how they come to love Chipping, and how he loves them.Keep the Kleenex box handy, and end up envying Chips his life, though we pity him almost throughout. He is the most blessed of human beings. He is a teacher! God bless them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this original version five times myself, I watched the DVD with two friends, both younger, one half my age who, as well as being brought up in this modern digital age, went to the same grammar school as me.They too, melted in the nostalgia, the post Christmas goodwill spilled over as those glorious MGM production values mixed with England's finest virtues washed over them and their senses. Yes, it is wonderfully stagey and stilted but is never predictable and best of all, is not syrupy and "isn't everything wonderful".Blending the perfect ratio of pathos with sentimentality, Robert Donat is endearingly coy and awkward, as Chips. Greer Garson is the film's, as well as Mr Chipping's revelation, adding decency, balance and a touch of glamour. Their meeting and courtship in Austria, ably assisted by Paul Henreid, (later to star in Casablanca) is a welcomed break from the dusky schoolrooms. The schoolboys all love her, they in turn respect and admire her husband. There's a superb attention to detail that amply reveals that teachers are always too aware of the naughtiness or their charges and actually almost encourage it, it being a formative process for unconfident, rather frightened little boys and onto and into the young men that will fight - and die for - their beloved England.The sense of history is well handled, with casual remarks that mark out various historical occasions and Donat time-travels through 60 years of ageing, from 20 odd to 80+, at each stage he commands, in speech, body language and credibility. Wartime Brit favourite John Mills stars briefly as one of the older boys keen to see active service. There was a huge sense of satisfaction - and pride - from us all at the end of watching Goodbye Mr Chips. That it stole so many Oscars from Gone With the Wind is both reassuring and remarkable, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The central moral of the film is declared very early on: that, through the love of a good woman, Chips learns that the path to teaching success and fulfilment is to become the pupils' friend.Current teacher training policy, at least in England and Wales, is that the teacher should NEVER try to be the pupils' friend. You would almost certainly fail to qualify as a PGCE teacher if you did.That said, this is a touching movie, even if there are several mawkish moments. The school song has been deliberately composed to tug at the heart strings; the scene in which Chips insists on conducting a Latin class despite having just heard his wife and unborn baby have died is simply appalling. The dialogue designed to tell the story or illustrate the passage of the years is ridiculously unsubtle.But Greer Garson is gorgeous in this, and Donat is touching. If only school was still like this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sitting down to watch 'Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939),' I can't say that I was expecting anything but a pleasant time-waster, an inspirational but throwaway drama not unlike Peter Weir's 'Dead Poets Society (1989).' I certainly wasn't expecting a genuinely moving portrait of love, loneliness and lifelong fulfillment, especially not from Sam Wood, the director who also gave us two Marx Brothers comedies. On top of all that, having only seen him in Hitchcock's 'The 39 Steps (1935),' I'm afraid that I didn't consider Robert Donat all that much of a dramatic actor. Whether I was mistaken in all my assumptions, or the planets somehow aligned perfectly, I'm happy to say that 'Goodbye, Mr. Chips' is a brilliant drama, and one that I'm sure will stay with me for years. Donat, aged just 34 years at the time of the film's release, perfectly captures the melancholy of a man reaching his twilight years. He definitely deserved an Oscar for his portrayal, though whether he deserved to beat out Jimmy Stewart in 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)' is a different matter.In the late nineteenth century, a young Mr. Edward Chipping (Donat) arrives at the prestigious Brookfield boys school to begin his career as a teaching master. Though anxious to get along with his students, he is soon forced to adopt a stricter approach if his class is to be kept in order, the result being that he frequently produces budding Latin scholars without making any friends among them. After a fellow teacher (Paul Henreid) invites him on a walking tour of Austria, Mr. Chipping comes to meet an English woman named Katherine (Greer Garson), who sees through his shy exterior to find a warm, charming and lonely man. Following their impromptu marriage, Katherine returns with Mr. Chipping (now affectionately nicknamed "Chips") to Brookfield, where she encourages him to be more affable and open with his students, so that they see him as a friend and mentor, rather than an oppressor. Chips soon becomes the school's most cherished asset, and his dedication to his students serves the school valiantly through decades of hardship, including WWI.It's hard to quite pinpoint what works so effectively about Donat's doddering old man, Mr. Chips. With his cartoonish moustache and a ready supply of cringeworthy Latin puns, the character could easily have turned out merely comical. But there's an extraordinary warmth behind the portrayal, and a genuine affection towards the generations of students that pass him by so quickly. Being rather shy in social situations myself, I really connected with the middle-aged Mr. Chips, who dejectedly accepts his future as a lonely school master, only to be brought out of his shell by the new sights and smells of Austria. After he ostensibly "rescues" Katherine on the foggy cliff-side, the pair ponder the apparent power at their fingertips, as though they own the mountain on which they sit. This sentiment reflects upon the influence afforded Mr. Chips in his position as school master, and later headmaster: it is his responsibility to mould a strong and successful nation of dedicated Englishmen, especially in the most difficult times. That WWII was then just around the corner makes this notion all the more poignant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a time when school boys respected their teachers, learned their tables, could spell and even string two sentences together. There was a time when teachers spent many years in the profession rather than running off and joining the corporate sector or ending up with nervous backgrounds. Today teachers are threatened with ridiculous litigation laws and are at the mercy of the students they teach. If you want to see a better time watch Goodbye Mr Chips... sweet memories. Of course there are plenty of others opposing corporal punishment and the film keeps the debate going. I am not sure if we can go back to the cane or the strap however tempting it may be but one thing is for certain education was not in the mess then that it is now. Greer Garson as always looks lovely and who could not fall in love with her. She brings a style and grace to every movie this beautiful lady was in. She was a true star. This is a lovely performance and we will always need a box of tissues when she... well you know what happens. There are lovely performances in the movie and the actors never put a foot wrong. The way the story is put together looks a bit fast and bumpy by todays standards. One minute we meet a character and the next moment that character dies. I had not noticed the pace of the high points in the story when I saw it years ago. Towering above the whole film is Robert Donat. He is Mr Chips and it must be one of the greatest screen performances of all time. THere are moments that break your heart. The caning scene might upset a few people but this was a different time. Great to see the young John Mills, the actress playing Mill's wife is perhaps the only weak spot; terrible hammy. By the standards of the time Donat is incredibly understated. They don't make them like that any more. The ending is brilliant but be prepared to sob no matter how many times you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully spun story and significant, historical, period classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At age 50 and I've seen a lot of movies. I just got around to this one today (01/07). In ways, I'm glad I waited because of the perspective I have acquired over the years.Seeing for the first time in 2008, aside from thoroughly enjoying the story, I was fascinated to pick up on some influences this film has had in other films over several decades. 30 years ago I wouldn't have seen these similarities.The great hall at Brookfield school in this story greatly resembles those in subsequent films including the great hall at "Hogwarts" school in "Harry Potter". Also, verses in the Pink Floyd pop hit, "Brick in the Wall" sound like they were influenced by a song sung by the school boys in this story as they were let out of school for the summer. Also, in an early scene in the Alps, the music and scenery are remarkably similar to the opening montage in the film, "The Sound of Music". I don't know why, but those things just popped out at me as I was enjoying the movie.This is a beautifully told story of a shy man's life, marriage, and career as a teacher/mentor at a post Victorian era boys school. The settings, the acting, the history are absolutely priceless. The film is so old fashioned and formal, it wrote the book on what would now be called, "cheesy". However, understanding it's place and time as I do, it isn't hard to appreciate the artful sentimentality. In fact it is a rare treat when it is done so well.This is beautiful Greer Garson's first film. She turned down a role in a Marx Brothers film, "A Day at the Races", before taking this role. She didn't want to associate herself in that genre so early in her film career. She wisely waited for this role to be offered to make her bow.Paul Henreid is perfect in this as a fellow teacher and friend of Mr. Chipping. Henreid is notable for numerous other classics including "Now Voyager" (Bette Davis) and "Casablanca". The entire cast is outstanding.This story imparts a sense of hope and inspiration. It moves over a man's lifetime effortlessly. It has such beautiful imagery and nostalgia for an era I never knew. The star here, Robert Donat, received the Best Actor Oscar over Clark Gable (Gone With the Wind). I'm embarrassed to admit I hadn't heard of Donat until I finally saw this film. I'm going to check out a few of his other films. I highly recommend this film. I am planning to buy a copy for my collection. I could easily watch it again right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..again, like an old friend..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank you, TCM, for presenting "Goodbye, Mr. Chips". Although Mr. Chips' (Robert Donat) plain-but-strong character-role stayed with me after seeing it during its original release when I as VERY young,it was like seeing an old friend after a long time - you know, it's been years, but the conversation picks-up right where it left-off.I don't know if I have seen Robert Donat in any other role, but I knew he played "Chips". As all have written, his acting was stellar, more felt than seen. Some users doubt that British boarding-schools were like that; how could they: so many films have documented them. Some doubted that finding love in a very drab life can transfix one and bring-out the beauty in them. How foolish ! Some thought it was "dated"; how could it be, because it IS a "period-piece". I found every detail exhilarating.....pure acting with no special effects......"white cargo" gets deep into the characters and makes the whole movie much easier to understand....I guess today's people do not find too much to dedicate their lives to. They marry too young without really certain it's love, rather than sexual appeal, then are trapped into lives they might not have chosen for themselves. Mr. Chips' love came at the perfect time in his life; although it was short-lived, it made the man to be a hero to generations of boys in their formative years. "Teachers" were to be revered, not to be "buddies".Bravo! for Donat's Oscar. Greer Garson ("Mrs. Chips") was radiant in her short role, and Paul Henreid ("Staeful") began his American career with zeal. The "boys" were just that - boys. I don't even remember a score, and that's great - most intrude, because the composer must make his/her statement, too. If you haven't seen this masterpiece by Sam Wood (written by RC Sheriff), then you don't have a basis to judge really good films, with real acting. Get you to Blockbuster's and rent or buy. This is one of those 10-50 movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chips with everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warm-heartedly sentimental, to these slightly jaundiced eyes overly sentimental fictional biopic (if that's not an oxymoron!) of grand old man Mr Chips and his journey from young and easily cowed teacher at Brookfield School to venerable old age as headmaster. These days it's a little hard to swallow the old English public school accents as quoth by schoolboy after schoolboy, especially when they forcedly laugh at Chips' gentle witticisms but in the end it's impossible not to warm to Robert Donat's skillful portrayal of a man who devotes his life to his pupils and the upholding of traditional educational values in the face of "progress" and against the background of changing times culminating in the bathetic readings out of fallen pupils and masters cut down in the carnage of World War 1. His short-lived happy marital interlude is sensitively rendered, opposite an empathetic Greer Garson until her untimely demise in childbirth and Paul Heinreid plays Chips' German friend and touring companion with gusto. But of course the film is a tour-de-force for Donat, skilfully aging his voice and mannerisms down the years and faithfully staying in character from first to last. The deathbed scene and closing cavalcade of Chips' past pupils is obviously meant to leave not a dry eye in the house but seems somewhat forced from this distance. That said, the film is earnest and heart - warming, very much, no doubt, its director's intention. Be true to your school indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towering Performance celebrating a wonderful past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took some time for me to adapt from the Robert Donat i knew from "39 Steps" to the teacher in "Goodbye Mr. Chips". However, as much as i liked him as the role model for Cary Grant in "North to Northwest", his Mr. Chips stands far above that as a towering performance of a lifetime. This is one of the gems of the "American" British Film, in line with "How Green was my Valley". It reconstructs beautifully a wonderful past of the English school system, that probably never was like this. But, watching this movie, you would like to be it like this, families passing through over generations being molded into characters by the humor and affection of their teacher, who's personal life is overshadowed by his personal tragedy, loosing the love of his life early, but never loosing his love for teaching and the boys. Robert Donat took his chance on the role and scored wonderfully, going thru a span of almost 60 years of a teachers career. If you can grab the DVD, don't miss out on it. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When watching this one can't help but think that the days of cinematic innocence are long gone. Goodbye Mr Chips is a prime example of cinema at its finest. Robert Donat manages to absorb the viewer with every element of his charming character. The gaiety and glory of upper class England is reflected beautifully throughout the highly sentimental and touching story-line. All the performances are perfect and the balance between happiness and sorrow is exemplary. More of an emotional boat trip than roller-coaster ride, but delightful nevertheless. Robert Donat and Greer Garson are just a couple of the many actors that were stars in their own right. Performers of the golden age shine brighter and longer than any actors of the present, and this film proves exactly why. If you wish to watch a film that holds, rather than grabs you, choose Goodbye Mr Chips. It provides charm and sentimentality, unequaled in the majority of modern day motion pictures. Cinema is rarely such a loveable treat.</fullReview>

Saying that Robert Donat's performance as Mr. Chipping was great is an understatement and Greer Garson gave an equally moving performance in her screen debut. How anyone could give this movie anything lower than a 10, they need to have their head examined. Usually I don't care for drama's but "Goodbye Mr. Chips" is the kind of film that once you start watching you can't pull yourself away from, I was in tears the entire second half. Donat richly deserved his Academy Award and the film should have won Best Picture. Truely one of the greatest of all-time, a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chips With Everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a representative - and an Oscar-winner at that - from what has been described as the Greatest year in the Golden Age of film-making, 1939 so that anyone viewing it for the first time in the 21st century and cognizant of the reputation of 1939 is going to expect the very highest standards and on balance shouldn't be too disappointed. Sure, the process shots are glaringly obvious as is the Establishing shot but there's not too much wrong with the core, the human values, decency, moral certitude that make Atticus Finch and Edward Chipping brothers under the skin. It's chilling to hear Chips 'rebelling' against the lowering of educational standards almost one hundred years ago and risible that he was merely protesting at the 'new' pronunciation of Latin when today schoolchildren are lucky if they are taught to read and write by teaching staff who can just about manage one or the other themselves. There have been two outstanding Classics masters in English literature and both were translated from respectively the printed page and the stage with exceptional success, James Hilton's Mr Chips and Terence Rattigan's Andrew Crocker-Harris in The Browning Version; both were essentially colorless but only Chips benefited from marriage and what was the making of Chips was the undoing of Crocker-Harris. If Robert Donat wasn't quite the actor Michael Redgrave was he was a very worthy runner-up and if audiences today find it slightly inconceivable that a nebbish like this could win the love of ANY woman let alone a beautiful one like Greer Garson perhaps the public of fifty years ago were more in tune with real values. It's also slightly strange to note that two of the supporting players - one uncredited - would go on to appear in two more timeless classics within barely five years; Paul Henreid, slightly wooden as Staefel, the German teacher responsible for Chips meeting his future wife, went on to play Victor Laszlo in Casablanca, whilst the uncredited Cyril Raymond (one of the masters at Brookfield) went on to play Celia Johnson's husband in Noel Coward's Brief Encounter. Perhaps the gimmick of showing how constant education was in a pre-Blair England by having successive generations of Colly not only educated at Brookfield but played by the same boy is a little twee today but overall the film presses all the right buttons and is held together by a central performance to rival anything in Hollywood or Britain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly-Great Film; Poignant and Memorable; Well-Acted and Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The background to James Hilton's third great filmed story--the others are "Random Harvest" and "Lost Horizon", is the fact that England was the seat of the British Empire. All empires are evil, if they are run as empires; in the backwash of the subversion of human individuality, imagination, purpose and rights, there is the educational "Establishment" that feeds future victims into such an executive-infallibility obedient-enslavement system. Arthur Chipping is a man who does not deal with such matters; he teaches Latin, or tries to do so, to young boys in various "forms". At the outset of this film, he is not doing well., he is socially inept, painfully shy, unpopular, and unable to reach his students with his desire to open a window to the fresh wind that always blows over minds from the world of the ancients, the world where individualism began and the holy fire of secular purpose was kept alight to rekindle the Renaissance's minds with the idea that the world was quite enough and that governments served the individual. Chipping goes with a friend on a trip to the Alps; and extraordinarily, trying to save what he thought was someone in need of help at heights in a fog, he meets the love of his life, Katherine She does not see a dour, mustachioed emotionally-withdrawn Victorian at all; she sees the man willing to be her knight in shining armor at considerable risk. Somehow, they marry, and he takes her back to his school. There she charms everyone, and he blossoms into a still-youngish man with a delightful sense of humor and a true affection for his subject and his charges; they begin to come to tea at his quarters, and he rapidly becomes the most popular teacher there. Then she suddenly dies. But somehow, he finds the courage to go on; for many years, and as the school's head during wartime, he inspires generations of boys to face adversity, and open their minds to the wider world of possibility beyond the empire's limited and totalitarian horizons to a world of self-fulfillment. Of course he dies; but he sees as he does the faces of those he has helped to become men, as his last vision. As Chips, Robert Donat is very good, very understated. Greer Garson has little to do as his love, but I suggest she does it wonderfully. Others in the cast include Paul Henreid, Judith Furse, John Mills and a number of fine British actors. The leisurely but intelligent script was written by fine veteran R.D. Sheriff; along with Claudine West and Eric Maschwitz, and the film was directed by Sam Wood. Cinematography was by F.A. Young and the original music was contributed by Richard Addinsell. The entire film is told in flashback, as Chips entertains a frightened young boy who has come to the school and been found by him. The film is nearly a great one, and the character of "Chips" is interesting also. And both have been deservedly popular for the better part of a century, a curious and poignant footnote to the problem of how difficult it is for any man to achieve success in work and personal happiness under any former of constraint, tyranny or repression--Imperial British or otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodbye, Mr. Chips</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This looked like a nice, simple and charming black-and-white film, it is critical acclaimed, and Clark Gable in Gone with the Wind lost out the Academy Award for Best Actor to this film's leading star, I had to see it, from Oscar nominated director Sam Wood (A Night at the Opera, The Pride of the Yankees, For Whom the Bell Tolls). Basically Charles Edward Chipping, fondly referred to as Mr. Chips (Oscar winning Robert Donat), in 1933 is a retired schoolteacher and former headmaster at the traditional Brookfield Boarding School, one of the oldest and most respected boys schools in England, the film goes into flashback as he recalls his life and teaching career. Chipping first arrived at Brookfield aged 25 as a Latin teacher in 1870, he becomes the target for many practical jokes, he reacts by imposing strict discipline, he is respected but disliked, as time passes however his relationship with his pupil improves, and he becomes senior master. Chipping is disappointed not to receive an appointment as the house master, but his despair is lifted when the German teacher Max Staefel (Paul Henreid) invites him for a walking holiday to his native Austria, while mountain climbing he encounters feisty English suffragette Kathy Ellis (Oscar nominated Greer Garson). Charles and Kathy meet again in Vienna and dance a waltz, he uses the music to declare his love for her, Kathy is considerably younger and livelier than Charles, but she shares affection for him and they get married, they return to England, Kathy finds a home in the school and charms everyone with her warmth. The marriage is tragically short however as Kathy dies during childbirth, along with the baby, but she brings Mr. Chips out of his shell and shows him how to be a better teacher, as the years pass Chips has become a much-loved institution to the school, developing a rapport with generations of pupils, teaching the sons and grandsons of many of his earlier pupils. In 1909 Chips is pressured to retire for a more "modern" headmaster, the boys and the board of governors take his side and want him to stay until he is 100, he does finally retire in 1914 at age 69, only to be summoned back as an interim headmaster during the time of the First World War, due to a shortage of teachers, he insists the boys continue translating Latin, even during a bombing attack occurring. Many names of former boys and teachers that have died are read aloud in the school's Roll of Honour every Sunday as the war continues, Chips finds out Max Staefel has died fighting on the German side, he also reads out his name in the chapel. Mr. Chips permanently retires in 1918, he is on his deathbed in 1933 and overhears his friends remarking that he never had children, Chips responds "But you're wrong. I have! Thousands of them, thousands of them ? and all boys". Also starring Terry Kilburn as John Colley / Peter Colley I / Peter Colley II / Peter Colley III, John Mills as Peter Colley as a young man, Judith Furse as Flora, Lyn Harding as Dr. Wetherby, Milton Rosmer as Chatteris, Frederick Leister as Marsham and Louise Hampton as Mrs. Wickett. Donat, who I mainly knew for The 39 Steps, gives a superb performance as the kind-hearted Latin teacher and headmaster with a subtle and worldly-wise manner, and a large moustache, and Garson makes a great introductory performance as his beautiful love interest, there is a well-cast musical remake with Peter O'Toole, but this is indeed the definitive version, it is so simple, but so wonderfully moving, it proves that any nice man can be a great hero, a brilliant period drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Writing, Screenplay, Best Sound and Best Film Editing. Arthur Chipping was number 40 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, and the film was number 46 on 100 Greatest Tearjerkers. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goodbye Mr Chips might look sentimental nowadays and Robert Donat's nuanced performance might seem unremarkable but this film is still staggering.Donat is Mr Chippings, a new keen arrival at Brookfield prep school as the somewhat stuffy English prep school. His first day of teaching is unfortunate as the pupils misbehave and the headmaster takes control by thrashing all the boys in his class. Mr Chippings is determined to succeed and he those, teaching classics in a somewhat stuffy manner and administer discipline when he needs to. However despite all the years he has been at the school he has never inspired much love from the pupils or even much respect from his fellow teachers. He is passed over as house master.When a fellow teacher persuades him to go abroad to the Alps he meets Katherine (Greer Garson) and both quickly fall in love, well the river Danube certainly looked blue to them. They fall in love and marry.Once his wife arrives at school, things change with the stuffy Mr Chippings or Chip as his wife calls him. His fellow teachers are enchanted by her and he comes out of shell with the pupils, cracking jokes and inviting them over to tea parties.Sadly wedded bliss is short as Katherine dies in childbirth but Chips stays on at school through the decades from the late Victorian era and through the Great war, eventually promoted to headmaster and respected and loved by teachers and generations of pupils alike.This is still a cracking film, the director uses little tricks to mark the passage of time. I always think that this adaptation foresaw another conflict with the Germans in World War 2 with its depiction of the Great War years and its affect on the grown up pupils and their families. Mr Chips had to read out names of the fallen regularly, even the teacher who took him to the Alps who died fighting with the Germans.Although the film might nowadays look slightly cheesy, sentimental and light on plot. It still asks questions of the purpose of teaching which is relevant today, as the elder Mr Chips tells the governing body, the newfangled teaching methods introduced is all about results and getting the new captains of industry ready without any love for learning. This is a debate that has never grown old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful, heartwarming film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1934 novella of the same name by James Hilton, this is a wonderful, heartwarming film about a beloved schoolteacher and the manner in which he influenced and inspired generations of boys. This is one of my favourite childhood films. It is a great feel good of the kind that only the 1930s and 1940s could produce. Although it was released by MGM, it is British to its core. The film has an excellent script by R.C. Sheriff, Claudine West and Eric Maschwitz and the direction by Sam Wood is generally very good, although some of the shots in the early part of the film are a bit choppy.Robert Donat plays the title role to perfection over the course of 63 years and gives the best performance of his career. Famously beating Clark Gable in "Gone with the Wind", he won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance. We are introduced to Chips as a retired 83-year-old teacher in 1933 who was advised to remain in bed by the school doctor but refuses on the grounds that he has not missed a first day assembly in 58 years. He is a lovely, eccentric old man who is universally adored by boys and masters alike at Brookfield, all of whom find it difficult to imagine the school without him. Through flashback, we are then presented with Chips' first few days at Brookfield in 1870 and it was quite another matter. At 20 years old, he has never taught before and, as is the lot in life of new teachers, becomes the subject of the boys' numerous practical jokes when he has to supervise the lower school on his first day. This eventually turns into a near riot, which is only stopped by the timely arrival of the headmaster. In order to lay down his authority, he keeps the class inside, having forgotten that there is a cricket match against the school's arch-rivals Sedbury and the best player on the Brookfield team is in his class. After Brookfield loses, he is hated by the entire student body. 25 years later, he is a shy, withdrawn middle-aged man who is respected but disliked by the boys. Although he is first in line to become a house master as the senior master, he is passed over for the position and, reading between the lines, it is because he has no way with the boys. His best and only friend is the German master Max Staefel, played by the ever charismatic Paul Henreid.The source of the change is Chips' relationship with his beloved wife Catherine Ellis, who is played very well and with effortless charm by Greer Garson. The two of them meet on a mist covered mountain in Austria when he mistakenly believes that her calls of "hello" were cries of help. Although she is about 20 years his junior, they immediately hit it off. Over the course of two weeks, they fall madly in love and, after a short holiday, he returns to Brookfield a married man and a changed man. Cathy is in many ways Chips' opposite number and she gives him a new perspective on life as a schoolteacher and life in general. She loosens him up considerably. At her suggestion, they begin to have Sunday tea parties for his class and he becomes known as a bit of jokester, making numerous Latin puns. His popularity with the boys goes through the roof and we see the beginnings of his status as a school institution. However, tragedy strikes when Cathy dies in childbirth. It is not made clear how long they were married but I would guess that it was two or at most three years. While she was only in Chips' life for a relatively short time, Cathy was without a doubt the most crucial person in it as she helped him to come out of his shell. He never forgets the lessons that she taught him, which were far more important than any of the Latin lessons that he ever taught. Donat and Garson have excellent chemistry and he is so good at playing a middle-aged fuddy-duddy in their early scenes together that, had it not been for the scenes of him as a younger man, you would genuinely think that he is far older than her. In reality, she was nine months his senior.After a 44 year career at Brookfield, Chips retires in 1914, shortly before the start of the First World War, but still remains at the school. Like many people at the time, he confidently predicted that the war would last only a matter of weeks and life in Brookfield and Europe itself would soon return to normal. Sadly, he was mistaken and many Brookfield boys and masters are killed in France, Belgium and elsewhere as the war progresses. As more of the masters and even the headmaster sign up, Chips is recalled from retirement and becomes the head, as Cathy always knew he would. In a very moving scene, he includes Max's name on the Roll of Honour even though he was fighting on the opposing side. The film deals with the carnage of the First World War from the perspective of the home front very well.The film is most certainly dominated by Donat but it has a strong supporting cast such as the only surviving credited cast member Terry Kilburn as four generations of Colleys (which does seem one too many for 63 years), Lyn Harding as Chips' first of many headmasters Dr. Wetherby, Austin Trevor as one of his successors Dr. Ralston, Judith Furse as Flora and, in cameo appearances, John Mills as Peter Colley III (who is killed only five days before the Armistice) and Martita Hunt as an imperious Englishwoman holidaying in Austria.Overall, this is a fantastic feel good film which is just what the doctor ordered for Christmastime viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marvellous sentimental movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a documentary on the MGM film studio narrated by Patrick Stewart we learnt that when MGM opened up a studio in England one of the first movies to be released from its British studio was "Goodbye Mr. Chips". It was a hugely successful film on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean confirming studio head Louis B. Mayer's faith in his new British MGM studio. The narrator also said that Robert Donat, playing a retired schoolmaster looking back on his life, gave one of the most moving performances ever put on film. Anyone seeing this movie for the first time would have to agree because he gives probably the best acting performance of a young man playing a very old man you will ever see. He teaches at Brookfields an exclusive public school for boys. As a young man he takes a holiday in Austria where he meets the love of his life Cathy played by Greer Garson. After a whirlwind romance they marry &amp; his new wife accompanies him when he returns home to Brookfields. Before his marriage he was a rather shy &amp; stuffy schoolmaster unpopular with the schoolboys. His wife Cathy is very charming &amp; has the common touch which rubs off on her husband. Very soon Mr. Chips, with his wife's help, becomes a favourite with the schoolboys. Sadly, she dies during childbirth &amp; so does the baby. After retirement he is given a house close to the school. At the outbreak of WW1 there is a shortage of schoolmasters &amp; he is recalled to duty as temporary headmaster for the duration of the war. He reminisces that his late wife believed in him &amp; once told him he would one day become headmaster. Later when the war is over &amp; on his deathbed he overhears the new headmaster speaking to a colleague. He tells him, "I thought I heard you say that it was a pity I had no children. But you're wrong, I have. Thousands of them, thousands of them &amp; all of them boys". It is one of the most moving &amp; sentimental scenes in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional portrayal in a film with sentimental brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose there are those who see this film as silly sentimentalism. But if you were a retired school teacher and principal, as I am, the sentiments in this film are very real. As I watched this film...again...so many of the children I worked with in middle schools came back into my mind. So, sentimental, yes...and beautifully so.Frankly, I've never cared for Robert Donat in his other films, but this was, for him, a tour de force. Greer Garson's role is pivotal, of course, although she in only in the middle of film for a fairly short while...but what a breath of sunshine she was. It's also interesting to see Paul Henreid here as a fellow teacher. Terry Kilburn, who played several generations of boys from the Colley family was quite adorable...and...as of this writing...is still alive! Robert Donat died at age 53 of a brain tumor. His last spoken words in a film were prophetic, "We shall not see each other again. I think. Farewell" To which the acting world surely said, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips."</fullReview>

With romance I mean: the IDEA of all the generations of young people going through a school and out into the world, and the teachers' important work in both teaching them and moulding them, is very grand. Unfortunately, often one does not realize how important a teacher has been, until long afterwards - when it is too late to go back and tell him or her "thank you". Therefore, teaching might seem as an ungrateful job...The reality - and I know this, as I have dabbled in teaching as a sub - can be quite different though. And then it can be difficult to keep up that feeling of doing an important job for mankind. The job can seem repetitive, and also "flat" - there is not much of a career in it, and you can easily feel that you are stuck in a small world, and that your own development has come to an end. Because you are never going to be anything more than a stupid teacher in a stupid school... It is then you need these romantic school-stories! Children can also be very mean and unpleasant, both towards each other and towards adults. There is always a kind of battle going on between the class and the teacher. When you are new to the business it can be very difficult to know how to behave. Because you want the pupils to like you, not fear you or hate you - but on the other hand you cannot be too "kind" either, because then they take advantage of it. If you do not come to grips with this conflict and find your own way in dealing with the pupils, there is always the risk of total mayhem - exactly as it happened for Mr Chips the first time he stood in front of a class. That scene was very realistic.The short, tragic love-story is also very fine. One is so happy for the shy Mr Chips, when he gets to experience this with a nice and beautiful young woman - despite the bad odds!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you watch this expecting a kind of topical biography of a teacher at an English school for boys, a gentle and unspectacular story, with romance, a growing acceptance of one's fate, and a lot of sentiment, you'll get what you expect.They run these sort of movies out from time to time. "It's a Wonderful Life," "Mr. Holland's Opus," "The Long Grey Line." The narratives tend to span generations. I found this one rather interesting and it's not surprising that it received so much public acclaim that Michael Redgrave was able to do a loony impression of Robert Donat's Mr. Chips in "The Lady Vanishes." You can't help liking it.Donat begins his teaching career as a nervous wreck, uncertain and stiff. But then he runs into Greer Garson in an improbable setting. Their marriage brings him a bit of ego strength. Of course, Garson (and the baby she's been carrying) have to die in order to boost the ratio of sentiment to everything else.Donat has one funny moment -- aside from his awkwardness. The Headmaster wants him to switch from the received pronunciation of Latin, in which "c" is pronounced "see", to the new modified and older version in which "c" is pronounce like "k". By this time, the middle-aged Mr. Chips has become defiantly laggard, declares hotly that he will never bring himself to pronounce Cicero as Kikero, and storms out the door.Yet, it's far from a comic story. If you like love, romance, tragedy, small triumphs, you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodbye, Mr. Chips ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1939 was truly a phenomenal year for movie lovers with such distinguished masterpieces as "Gone With the Wind", "The Wizard of Oz", "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" to start with the most emblematic ones, and followed by the no less revered "Stagecoach", "Ninotchka" or "Young Mr. Lincoln" ?Yet, despite its lower recognition, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips", also Best Picture nominee, is still likely to grab the attention of a movie fan because it features the performance that won the Oscar for Best Actor, which is saying a lot in 1939. No, it was not James Stewart who won for his outstanding emotional role as Jefferson Smith, neither did Clark Gable as the iconic Rhett Butler or Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff, no ? fate decided that the prestigious award would go to a Robert Donat who played a shy and humble schoolmaster named Arthur Chipping aka 'Mr. Chips'. I admit that I was less eager to see the film than the performance that beat those stellar performances but the result was the same anyway. First, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is significant as a milestone for school movies. "Dead Poets Society", "To Sir, With Love", "Blackboard Jungle", they all owe something to "Goodbye, Mr. Chips", the inspirational story of a teacher who dedicated his whole life, 63 years, to his profession, to his boys. But don't expect the life-changing teacher, who'd open his pupils' eyes. Sam Wood's film is beyond the stereotypes it will later inspire. All we have is just a man who'll learn the most difficult job in the world and the noblest, something that demands courage, patience, understanding and a sincere enthusiasm. His authority is challenged in the beginning, making him question if he's fit to the job, but progressively, he'll try to learn to find the right balance. But it's only by meeting his future wife that his status in Brookfield will go from a good teacher to the living legend.Greer Garson, as Susan, was nominated for an Oscar in a leading role, and I can understand why it leaves some viewers perplexed. But I think she exemplifies the importance of a woman in man's life, and no man is shy enough to never find the true love, and certainly not a good man like Chips. Susan will lead the lead character, teaching him how to smile, how to overcome his own weaknesses, how to make a friend out of his kids, much more, she's the one who'll earn him his nickname. The film's second act entirely focuses on the relationship between Chips and Susan, their romantic waltz in Vienna, the Blue Danube music. And although it tragically ends with her precocious death by giving birth, we understand that she paved the way to Chips' popularity and helped him to become a living legend. I was also interested to see the film because Chips was listed in AFI's Top 50 Greatest heroes, and I wanted to know what was so inspiring about him. I think he's like Rocky Balboa, a sort of ideological hero who conveys positive values about life, about remaining true to a sort of a positive discipline. He's a man who faced war, the death of his wife, of colleagues, friend and of course pupils, and still he took the distance. Full of contradictions, he was capable of teaching during German bombings and yet delivers a eulogy to one of his German friends who taught at Brookfield. Chips valued life too much to get stuck in patriotic exaltations. He was a good man, eccentric, charismatic, funny, but a positive model.And if by no means, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is equal to "Gone With the Wind", in its own humbleness and simplicity, the film is capable to reach a superior emotionality that doesn't rely on epic moment or powerful dialog. It's just the sight of this humble man, going older and older, yet never letting his love toward his profession and pupils being altered by the passing of time. Robert Donat is magnificent as Mr. Chips, and I couldn't believe a 34-year old could play an old man in such a convincing way, in this cute way to stick his mouth to his mustache or to emphasizes the 'o'. Going from this mild-mannered playboy to a shy middle-aged man and then an old Einstein-looking elderly is indeed a performance that deserved an accolade. But Donat's performance and the impressive ways were not the only way to suggest the passing of time. When he comes in Brookfield to start as a teacher, kids talk about Prussians defeating the French, well the film demands a little knowledge, but we understand it's in 1870. Later, the year 1901 is indicated when a student comments about Queen Victoria's death and can't believe Britain will have a king. This summarizes what Chips incarnates: longevity. He's a 83 year old schoolmaster, a living legend, loved and admired, who's so old in his school that he taught three generations of boys, an element of his life cleverly highlighted by the three Colley's kids, all played by the same kid. Still, one of the most representative moments of the film is the many montages of pupils and students filing past and recalling their names. The flow of kids, of new faces, of children and young men, is like a metaphoric view of life as a river where it's never the same water that runs. And combined by with the ringing bells and the film's outstanding music in high volume, and Chips' deathbed words, it's impossible not to be touched by this film, and its lead character, a sympathetic character full of this same innocence that would be lost after 1939 and Hollywood would see the rise of more cynical and fatalistic genres, like the film-noir. Chips dies with his innocence, but his remembrance is eternal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive version and one of the most beautiful films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is the Peter O'Toole musical remake which I need to re-watch again despite not thinking much of it, and the Martin Clunes TV adaptation which was excellent, but I consider this 1939 Goodbye Mr Chips the definitive version. The film gives you a warm and cosy feeling just looking at it, and there is a sparkling score. The script has moments where it is droll, but mostly it is touching and very warm-hearted and human. The story still moves and charms me to this day, with the ending especially making me cry, the underrated Sam Wood's(director also of the brilliant A Night at the Opera) direction is immaculate and the characters are all compelling particularly the titular character. The acting helps to bring everything to life, as lovely as Greer Garson is, and a pleasure it was to spot Casablanca's Paul Henreid, Great Expectations' Martita Hunt(in an uncredited cameo) and a young John Mills, it is Robert Donat's film as he is a revelation in a very subtle and sincere performance. All in all, a beautiful film and the best Goodbye Mr Chips. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm talking about "Chips" from 1939, not any later version. To begin with, a tip of my hat to Turner Classics because every so often, they will bring to our TVs cinematic masterpieces and this particular film most definitely falls into that category. Thank you, Mr. Turner.I believe I read where viewers say that Robert Donat stole the Oscar from Clark Gable as Rhett Butler in "GWTW." Although I do admire Gable's work, Donat stole nothing. He EARNED IT with an unbelievable performance that was as every meaningful and touching as any actor who preceded and succeeded him. Did I say touching? Let's make that brilliantly touching.I choked up watching him, shed a tear or two and after "THE END', walked away from the TV just shaking my head in amazement over how fantastic was that performance.As usual,I'll be darned if I'll deeply go over the plot which is readily accessible on IMDb as well as in other sources but I will tell you that Latin Master Mr. Donat, in a boys' school,never needed a wristwatch to tell the time. He gauged everything by the succession of his students who first entered as kids and then became fathers and grandfathers. And those initial kid students were never forgotten by "Chips", no matter how many of their successors entered that school.Mr. Chipping was a shy and withdrawn teacher, easily tantalized by those whom he taught. Things began to change when, on an Austrian vacation, he came to meet his beloved, played by Greer Garson. She made him a man and a man he remained even after the worst possible tragedy befell him. If you don't well up at the end of this magnificent film, then you're made from stone. The warmth, tenderness, love and captivating brilliance of Mr. Donat are OVERWHELMING. Look at it this way. He won the Best Actor of the Year Oscar. Nominated for this film, but not winning, were Greer Garson for Best Actress in a Leading Role;Sam Wood for Best Director;Charles Frend for Best Film Editing; Best Picture of the Year; A.W. Watkins (Denham SSD)for Best Sound, Recording and Eric Maschwitz R.C. Sheriff and Claudine West for Best Writing, Screenplay. That rundown isn't exactly chopped liver, my fellow movie goers.My suggestion is to take in this film either on Turner or rent it. You will never regret spending close to 2 hours. It's simply a spellbinding 1939 B&amp;W film experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Open the dictionary, under the word charming it says-Goodbye Mr Chips.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Charles Chipping is a very shy young man, he starts teaching at Brookfield, an all boys English school. His early days at the school don't go very well at all, after coming close to losing his job he goes to far by way of discipline and costs the school dearly by way of a sporting tradition. It seems that all the school is against him, be it the children or his fellow teachers, Mr Chipping can't do right for doing wrong. Whilst taking a holiday in the Austrian Alps, Chipping meets Katherine Ellis, his life and general manner will from this point on change dramatically............for the better.Goodbye Mr Chips just oozes classic status, from every single frame you get a wonderful vibe that takes you back to a time when innocence was all we had. I think that Goodbye Mr Chips surely touches most people? Maybe some folk in their make up have no time for such sweet sentimentality? But just maybe? Those people could do far worse than letting Mr Chips into their lives. It has taken me nigh on 30 years to actually get around to watching this film in its entirety, and having sat thru it last night I feel rewarded beyond what I had originally hoped for. From the bumbling fear that Mr Chipping shows in the opening reel, to the closing scene that brings the whole damn film to its wonderful point, Goodbye Mr Chips is a truly beautiful, charming and joyous picture.Of all the Oscars that have been given over the years, Robert Donat's is one of the most deserved. It's a performance that fuses all the emotional traits required to outlay a character that's finding itself, be it shy and retiring, or a man driven by a willingness to succeed, Robert Donat layers this turn to such a point that it may well be a 30s standard. Greer Garson only has something like 20 minutes of screen time, but as 20 minute performances go.....well it leaves a long and special impression, there is a scene as Donat and Garson dance with carefree abandon, this alone makes the film worth watching. Still, a film is only as good as its ending, and it's here that Goodbye Mr Chips delivers the crown to its royal subject, an ending that ties up all the emotional strings that make for a wonderful film. So if you ain't got a warm glow come the final credit? Well there is no hope for you really.Thank you Mr Starkey and Mr Lowry, this film reminded me of your good teachings many years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Donat - an under-appreciated actor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>British actor Robert Donat shines in this wonderful film about a teacher. Of course, it is about so much more. Donat plays Mr. Chips, a lonely man who teaches young boys at a school. His start at the school is rocky, and the students do not take to him easily. Over many years, he earns their respect. Donat is a brilliant in this role - he ages from a young man to a man in his 80's, and you believe it. Greer Garson is in fine form here as well, as an unexpected love interest for him, and marries him. It is clear her outgoing and loving nature brings out the best in this kind and lonely man. Much discussion was made about Robert Donat winning the 1939 Oscar over Clark Gable in "Gone With the Wind" and Jimmy Stewart in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." You can forget that. With all due respect to Gable and Stewart, Donat's performance is superior to those. Besides, those actors would win their own Oscars, so they are hardly unappreciated. Donat, on the other hand, was an under-appreciated actor. Rumor had it Donat did not like Hollywood and usually made his films at the MGM studio in London. Regardless, we have the wonderful miracle of film, and we can enjoy his work in this film and the others he made!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The life story of a surprisingly ordinary British teacher. Robert Donat (as "Mr. Chips") is memorable, as he ages into the title role; he makes the most of the weak, stereotypical story material. A fluttering, doddering, and ineffectual classroom manager; Mr. Donat is rewarded, mid-life, with a sigh-inducing Greer Garson (as Katherine). Ms. Garson's supporting role serves more as an adornment than a performance; surprisingly, she was nominated for as "Best Actress" Oscar, alongside Bette Davis ("Dark Victory"), Irene Dunne ("Love Affair"), Greta Garbo ("Ninotchka"), and Vivien Leigh ("Gone with the Wind"). Garson recovered from the embarrassment, as subsequent nominations became more appropriate. Donat's celebrated performance is easier to understand; however, this is not his best characterization. Ultimately, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" celebrates dedication with sentimentality, albeit well-produced and directed.******* Goodbye, Mr. Chips (5/15/39) Sam Wood ~ Robert Donat, Greer Garson, Terry Kilburn, Paul Henreid</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outstanding film with Robert Donat in an Oscar winning performance as a beloved schoolteacher in England.Donat's Oscar win must have certainly been astonishing in a year where he vied for the award with Clark Gable,"Gone With the Wind," Laurence Olivier, "Wuthering Heights," Mickey Rooney, "Babes in Arms," and James Stewart, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." Though his Oscar was probably a surprise, it was well deserved because Mr. Donat captured the very essence of a well-liked teacher at the school for boys. He really represented the embodiment of what teaching is all about.Greer Garson played his stoic wife, who dies in childbirth. Though she received a best actress Oscar bid for this film as well, her performance was certainly no match for winner Vivien Leigh, "Gone With the Wind," or fellow nominee, Bette Davis, "Dark Victory,"Who can forget Donat's perseverance and dedication despite the loss of his wife? His spirit certainly depicted the stiff upper lip idea shown by Brits in times of emergency. With it all, Donat as Chips conveyed the idea of a brilliant, stern but compassionate educator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Donat plays the role to perfection. An instructor of young men. A man that in his youth seemed to be headed to just an ordinary career in Education. A quiet and almost timid man among his peers. A man that would probably spend his whole life alone, just doing his job with no personal life. That totally changes when Greer Garson enters the picture. An encounter in the mountains that is totally unpredictable. Not planned, yes, but a life changing encounter. End result for Mr. Chips - a wife and new life. The instructors at the school as while as the students cannot believe that this man is now with wife. A couple that grow with each other but also begin to establish a warm relationship with the students. Students develop as men because of the time with their instructor. This will prepare them for war. This film will put a sense of sadness as well as a true warmth of humanity. A must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Immensely moving drama, highlighted by the incomparable Robert Donat in a remarkable, career-defining performance. The film chronicles the life of devoted schoolmaster Charles Chipping (Donat), affectionately known as `Mr. Chips.' He is introduced as a reserved young man about to realize his dream of teaching at a school for boys. His teaching methods are at first strict and by the book, making him unpopular with his pupils. However, through the love and encouragement of his wife (Greer Garson), he gradually loosens up and throughout the course of the film becomes a beloved institution among students and teachers alike. As Chips' wife and most ardent supporter, Garson makes a strong impression, endowing her character with a simple tranquility that fits just right. However, the heart of the film is Donat's earnest performance, which spans some 58 years of Chips' life with absolute credibility. Donat, whose film career was unfortunately restricted by chronic asthma, won an Oscar for his work here (defeating the likes of Clark Gable in `Gone With the Wind' and Jimmy Stewart in `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'). Although the film is highly sentimental, it is nonetheless an enjoyable and extremely rewarding experience, and the final scene is unforgettable. A must-see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An endearing movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was raised in schools like Brookfield (1958-1964). And yes, that is exactly how they are; there is inevitably some old codger there... One may not like the school, one may not remember details, one may not remember class mates, other teachers--but one does remember that one teacher, that one almost larger than life personage--like Mr. Chips. (I still remember Father Macdonald and Brother Charles.) Call it the Stockholm Syndrome. A student is there because the parents thought this was a better option; or worse, the parents didn't want the child. (WInston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt both hated their boarding school experience.) So the movie is not about the kids; the movie is not about Brookfield; the movie is about Mr. Chipping (Robert Donat) who becomes affectionately transformed by his wife (Greer Carson) as Mr. Chips.It is a piece of sentimentality. It is epic in scale traversing the years of Queen Victoria's reign from 1870 to the ascension of Adolph Hitler in 1933. A span of some 63 years. It may be difficult to track the passing of years, but they are indicated when the students pass by to check in wearing different uniforms of the day; plus there are other contextual clues such as the commemoration of the death of a Headmaster in 1888, or Uniforms of the Great War, etc. It is, of course, Mr. Chips who is the stable element in an increasingly chaotic world where one set of tradition slowly fades only to be replaced by another set of traditions. The viewer is expected to know something about British history. When Queen Victoria died in 1901--England was fighting the Boer War in South Africa--hence students wear military great coats with black bands.The 1939 Academy Awards had been made on February 29, 1940. By then World War II was in its sixth month--clearly, this was going to be a war for the ages. And clearly, it would be a war that would transform the world, just as World War I--The Great War--transformed England and the rest of the world. So it's not surprising that the movie was honored as it was. And while James Stewart, Clark Gable, Mickey Rooney, Laurance Olivier gave stellar performances, Mr. Chips (Robert Donat--and by extension the movie "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" represented that equilibrium in the maelstrom that would be World War II just as he embodied equilibrium in a changing world around Brookfield.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult to say why it's so likable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... because this is also a deeply reactionary movie full of platitudes. Mr. "Chips" Chipping is an affable and somewhat scatter-brained Latin and Greek teacher at an elite English boarding school, and this movie shows his career over 60 years from young man and inept teacher during the Victorian age, until he's called back from retirement to finally serve as headmaster during the Great War (this movie came out just as a much greater war was immanent). In the process, the movie euphemizes corporal punishment, crass class differences (the aristocrats among the boys will become commanding officers upon graduation, the hoi polloi will go to the trenches) and the whole drudgery of boarding school education. That the movie still remains watchable today is due to a good script, excellent acting, and the fact that the placid story is beset by fairly realistic tragedy: Chips is a loner until his Fifties; when he eventually finds a wife who's young and radiant to boot, she dies during parturition. He never fully achieves his ambition of becoming headmaster, and sees waves of his students and friends die in the trenches of the First World War. This movie remains watchable because it never fully caves in to sentimentalism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood vs England</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donat's performance is/was spectacular as always and that alone would make this film worth the watch. Hollywood has always had a rough time depicting England. It all turns out to be so terribly, terribly English that it makes fun of the country and its inhabitants without actually intending to do harm. In other words "Ye Olde Englande" according to the American establishment all too often makes the culture look quite silly. Whether part of this is indeed planned or not, it doesn't help out the English cause at the outset of World War II by making the people and their society seem so miserably anachronistic. "Cuddly" isn't a word appropriate to a country soon to be besieged by war. Certainly Hollywood could have done better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jimmy was Robbed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This drama recounts the life and times of an English school teacher. Donat beat out James Stewart in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" for this performance. Jimmy was robbed! It's the type of performance the Academy loves, as Donat gets to age sixty years through the film and the makeup artists have done a fairly good job. However, it seems to be a performance without much depth, relying instead on mannerisms and a high-pitched delivery. The actor doesn't get much help from the script, which fails to show why Mr. Chips is such a beloved teacher. Garson makes a terrific screen debut and lends the film its best moments. A similar film that is far superior is "The Browning Version" with Michael Redgrave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr Chips - heart warming or simply bad for the heart?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Donat, the dashing sexy hero in Hitchcock's "The Thirty Nine Steps", here indulges a tendency to mawkishness in his portrayal of the dusty old schoolmaster which strays shaky foot by shaky foot into caricature. Popular American films of the period tended to emphasise, underline and signpost sentimentality and Donat gamely delivers. Perhaps it was all of a part with the sentimental popular music of the time - cosy and comforting. Hollywood though shortly afterwards produced "Arsenic and Old Lace" - a comedy of a blackness perhaps 30 years ahead of its time - a measure of its then openness and diversity.Michael Palin's "American Friends" (1991) tells a very similar story to "Chips" but with subtlety, intelligence, beauty and a perfect recreation of English university life (in the 1860's). Dusty English schoolmasters are much more intelligently observed and portrayed in "The Browning Version". Robert Donat was both a star and a fine actor (see for example "The Citadel"). There is simply too much schmaltz in Mr Chips.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Chips' students were invisible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I began watching "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" certain that I would like it. In fact, I love quiet movies about teachers and how they inspire their students to take chances, become ambitious, transform themselves academically, etc.I really, really wanted to love this movie, but I did not.The problem with this movie is that I know NOTHING about any of the individual students Mr. Chips taught. I don't know what their interests are, whether they are smart or dumb, what they are thinking etc. I just watched the movie and I'm not even sure I know any of their names.For a movie like this to work, there have to be some meaningful interactions between the teacher and his or her students. There were none. I see NO evidence that Mr. Chips inspired any individual student to do anything. And I don't know what the students did other than some of them fought in World War I.Contrast that with "Dead Poets Society" and "Mr. Holland's Opus," to name two, where five or six students stand out and are inspired by their teacher. I saw those movies several years ago and I still recall the students' stories.This movie conveys a general sense that Mr. Chips himself was transformed after meeting his wife. Before that, he was stodgy and unpopular. Frankly, he was an incompetent teacher for 20 years and should have been fired. After his midlife romance begins, though, the students as a whole liked and respected him a lot.But other than a couple of jokes told in front of a class of 30 students, there is nothing to justify why the students liked and respected him so much. I want to be SHOWN, not told, Mr. Chips is a great teacher. The movie also has a very timid plot and little conflict and character development.By the way, Jimmy Stewart deserved the Best Actor Oscar for "Mr. Smith," not Robert "Mr. Chips" Donat. I gave "Mr. Chips" a 5.ZWrite</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donat's overrated - get the O'Toole version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inexplicably, Donat portrays the octogenarian Chips as a doddering old happy-go-lucky sprite, completely inconsistent with the younger less approachable Chips. While Chips' transformation into a much beloved teacher is at the heart of the film, Donat's acting choice (or the director's) makes it seem less an evolution than an inorganic, completely unbelievable mid-life personality transplant. Greer Garson, on the other hand, does a fine job combining equal parts glamour, pluck and warmth.The Peter O'Toole/Petula Clark version, though flawed in its own ways, is more satisfying overall because O'Toole is, well, O'Toole. Clark is charming as well.And the most recent (2002?) remake (for the BBC?) does a very fine job as well. How curious that an Oscar-winning film should be re-made twice, with both re-makes outshining the original...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Sir with Blackboard Jungle Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of sentimental moments are seemingly the sole reason this movie was made. As when Greer Garson adds a welcome, gracious (if improbable) variable into Chips continual confusion. But as far as scripts go the rest of this is tissue held together very loosely. Half an hour into the movie Chips is already lined and wrinkled. What happened to his youth? His courtship takes eons and is just not interesting. He's like Marty in 'Marty,' and dates like that are unlikely to result in marriage to an exquisite, refined babe.The movie (and Chips) treasure the students as interchangeable perfunctory, relationships that make Chips feel good about himself, instead of as individuals who are the protagonists of their own lives. Wouldn't it have been nice if Chips could encounter them as humans, and teach them to love their living, critical minds, so that when a cynical war breaks out (they're all cynical) they could think independently, instead of transforming themselves into fodder? The biggest rebellion he can muster is over how to teach Latin. (?!)The establishment Britishness of this movie is outdated. The movie 'If...' better portrays the whole school system in all it's nastiness; not through the winking acceptance of old age, but in the angry rejection of youth; where one might best be encouraged to spend their energy productively before becoming prematurely old. But no educational system actually nurtures independence. All Chips ever does is uncritically feed the machine that consumes these kids.Later attempts do this whole thing are better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hammy and overly sentimental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe that this film rates as highly as it does - the acting is often second rate or incredibly hammy (or both). The story is over-sentimental clap-trap, very poorly paced and seems to have little point. A teacher teaches for a long time and then dies is hardly worthy of two hours of anyone's time. The subject matter that is touched upon is generally handled badly and the passing of time is unconvincing - from the cliched dropping of significant events into conversation to the poorly realised make-up.Greer Garson is the only saving grace, she does what she's pretty good at and does it well, but after her characters death the film just dies with her.</fullReview>
