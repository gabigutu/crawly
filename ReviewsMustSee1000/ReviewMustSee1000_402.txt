		<shortDescription>The critics must be crazy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've probably seen this film five or six times over the years, from its initial U.S. "art-house" run in the late 1980s (I can still vividly remember my experience seeing it in the Coconut Grove theater near where I was going to university) to last night. It's been one of my most consistent 10s. Although my ratings tend to fluctuate on multiple viewings for many films, I don't believe that I've ever thought The Gods Must be Crazy was lower than a 10.The film works so well because of its odd confluence of styles, which gradually merge. You could almost say the structure is Hegelian, with a thesis, two antitheses, and something of a synthesis at the end. The common thread throughout is a very tongue-in-cheek critique, in the mode of a parable, of both culture/society/civilization and views about culture/society/civilization, including politics, religion, mores, and so on.The film begins with the story of Xixo, or just "Xi" (N!xau, in one of the many spellings of this actor's name) and his fellow bushmen, who live in the Kalahari Desert. A narrator (Paddy O'Byrne) tells us about their lifestyle. Before long, this is contrasted with footage of life in the big city in Johannesburg. The narration continues with the same tone, as if we're unfamiliar with modern, western culture. We meet Kate Thompson (Sandra Prinsloo), who is getting fed up with her white-collar existence. We move back to the bushmen. A man in a passing small aircraft nonchalantly tosses a Coke bottle out the window. It lands close to Xi, who has never seen anything like it before. Eventually it causes all kinds of problems and Xi tries to get rid of it. We are also introduced to a thread about Sam Boga (Louw Verwey), who is leading rebels in Burundi. We see them try to assassinate the President. After this, they're pursued by the Burundian military. Meanwhile, Kate has decided to go to Botswana to be a teacher, and there she meets Andrew Styne (Marius Weyers). Eventually, all of these threads come together.The plot may sound like a mess, and it probably would be under lesser hands, but producer/writer/editor/director Jamie Uys keeps the disparate threads remarkably focused and coherent. His timing for each and for the transitions between threads is impeccable, and the way they move together is nothing short of ingenious.There has been no shortage of ink spilled in (often-negative) criticism of The Gods Must be Crazy. Unfortunately, a lot of the criticism is ridiculous and profoundly misconceived. Many see the film as racist. A lot of people who can't comprehend the fact/fiction distinction have criticized the film for inaccurate portrayals of bushmen and other characters. Uys' humor and social critiques are frequently misunderstood.It's significant that O'Byrne's narrative tone is very similar to Peter Jones' narrative tone for "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Whether this was a direct influence on Uys is not as important as the contextual clues it provides (the Hitchhiker's Guide mini-series featuring Jones was not completed until 1981, but the BBC radio show, which was the original format for Hitchhiker's Guide and which also featured Jones' narration, aired in 1978). The narration is extremely tongue-in-cheek and sarcastic. Uys is spoofing bushmen, civilization, and also some of the misconceptions about bushmen. The narration is also meant as a kind of distancing technique. Modern western civilization is explained to us as if we're aliens learning about this world.This is all in service of a much more serious, different kind of point. The bushmen are shown as they are to enable a Lord of the Flies (1963 &amp; 1990, based on William Golding's 1954 book)-like examination of civilization. The bushmen are the schoolboys of Lord of the Flies in their initial shipwrecked state. The Coke bottle symbolizes the entrance of civilization in that "virgin" culture, and we see the havoc the new concepts cause. The Johannesburg and Burundi material both exist in the film to give us a "flash forward" to what that introduction of civilization can lead to. In the case of Burundi, it's a direct extension of the fighting over possessions, including land. In the case of Johannesburg, it's a spiraling web of miserableness. It's not a coincidence that the bushmen learn both violence and unhappiness when civilization appears, and it's not an accident that we initially examine these things from an "alien" perspective. Uys wants us to look at where we stand as a civilization and reassess it--an especially poignant message coming from a South African in the late 1970s/early 1980s. Don't forget that Xi is a hero here--he's the most authentic character in the film, and he's the one who enables the resolution of the dilemma in the climax.The material in Botswana, especially as the threads merge, suggests a kind of solution, a kind of balance, although it's significant that the solution is far from perfect, and to an extent, parties go their separate ways again. Uys seems to be saying that even if there is a solution to civilization's woes, it's going to be complex and probably less than perfect.Easing up on the analysis for a minute, all you may need to know is that The Gods Must be Crazy is a very funny but poignant film. The humor ranges from subtle and intellectual to crazy slapstick (especially whenever Weyers is around--he's very gifted at slapstick). Uys delivers beautifully filmed exotic locations, a maybe surprising amount of violence in the Sam Boga segments (although somewhat cartoonish and funny violence--these segments often resemble Woody Allen's 1971 film, Bananas), a lot of adventure, a fair amount of suspense, and even a charming romance.Do not let the ridiculous, negative ideological criticism dissuade you. This is a classic--a masterpiece--that presents both surface entertainment and complex, "deep" themes and subtexts. If you haven't seen it yet you must.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A unique film with a brilliant combination of slapstick, subtle humour, wonderful music, brilliant wildlife and scenic shots, all beautifully woven into a piece in an almost "road-style" movie around the adventures of a bushman. Like any story, there are some aspects which are slightly unbelievable if you stop to think - but the skill of the film is that it is sufficiently convincing to suspend such unbelief whilst you watch.The message of the film is brilliantly presented, subtly challenging the belief that white civilization has all the answers, gently poking fun at many of our western assumptions (no idea why anyone thinks it's racist - it may be the opposite)! Some of the high points for me personally were the scenery, the wildlife, and the African huts, children and music. Having lived in Africa for 3 years it was absolutely true to life, and brought back fond memories. This is a classic that will bear watching time and time again, and so different from the run of the mill films generally churned out.A classic - 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a likable movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be put off by the talk of poor production values, bad dubbing, goofy Benny Hill-esque slapstick, and questionable acting. Once you get a look at the enormous smile on Xi's face, you'll forget all of that. This is one of the most gentle, pleasant, and likable movies I've seen in a long time (all of that in a good way).I'd always heard about it, but somehow managed to miss it over the years. Finally saw it this weekend, and it's a real gem. For you DVD viewers, there's a documentary with interview footage of Xi. The only problem--no subtitles! Some bozo obviously blew it on the transfer, making it possibly the most frustrating doc ever produced...Be warned!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfection of Simplicity, nothing more, nothing less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not a big budget action film, this movie is not an emotional soap opera, or a tearjerker, this is a simple little film about the simple things in life. This South African produced film has proven to be one of the best I have seen in quite a long time. N!xau, a native bushman plays a bushman in this movie. A coke bottle has destroyed his villages life as it has been proven to be an excellent tool, but everyone wants it. So the young Bushman is told by the village elders to throw the ?evil thing' off the ends of the earth.On his long and perilous journey he runs into all kinds of different people, some terrorists, a man studying animals, an uptight urban teacher, and some trouble along the way, obviously. The movie is just so funny, the film is told from the point of view of the bushman, and is poignant as well. The movie manages to be very different, and extremely unconventional, at least by American standards. I have to admit I am glad I got to see this movie. A lot of great foreign films do not make it over to America, and that is sad, but this movie is excellent, it is funny, sweet, and all around one of the best movies I have seen. The writing is congruent and sharp, the performances do not at all seemed forced and the ensemble here manage to come off appropriately hilarious without taking away from the plot.There are some political overtones here as well, as the movie takes a few shots at apartheid, when it was still around. Also in my mind the movie is extremely satirical of the instability that the region faces. The funniest part of the movie were the terrorists. They were so incredibly inept and silly I couldn't help laugh at them. If they weren't tripping over closing doors they were tripping over themselves.Marius Weyers as the biologist who is clumsy but well meaning also steals the show, and his assistant, played by Louw Verway is excellent, but the real star of the show is N!Xau, who makes such an excellent lead and does wonderful here. What amazes me about him was he was about forty when he did this film. There is no way for him to know when he was born, but the man looks so youthful, it is incredible, I thought he was a teenager! Shows you how much I know. Anyway see this incredible film, it is more than worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know that I've ever seen a movie that had such innocent joy - I'm not sure if any other movie I've seen had any innocent joy, for that matter.Perhaps what true joy I've seen in movies is civilized and therefore self-conscious.Anyway, you can look at the crazy civilized world through the eyes of these innocents and have joy about it instead of cynicism. Can ordinary pain relievers do that?The premise is how one empty Coke bottle in the garden of Eden could corrupt it. They do a totally believable job of it, too.Lots of laughs, kids loved it. I saw it in the theaters in the mid-80's and am glad I saw it again. You'll like it. It will lighten your heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a great movie but it uses the differences between the civilized white man against the uncivilized Bushman and with that simple tool it becomes hilarious. Civilized in the white man's eyes, I must add to that. This is one of those movies where every gag works, no matter how simple and silly it is. Most of the time the movie is slapstick comedy the way we see it in Chaplin- or Laurel &amp; Hardy-shorts. We even have the fast forward sequence where people are running away from something.The movie opens with a look on the Bushmen and a narrator (Paddy O'Byrne) tells us what kind of people they are; friendly and without any knowledge about the world not that far from their Kalahari desert. When they see a plane they think it is a strange bird or even a god. One day a pilot throws a glass bottle out of his airplane and the thing is found by the Bushmen. They have never seen anything that is a smooth and hard as this object and they find it very useful. They think it is a gift from the gods. The problem is that the gods have given only one object and for the first time they have to share something that is very hard to share. For the first time they feel emotions such as anger and jealousy. It is decided that the thing is an Evil Thing and must be thrown of the earth and Xixo (N!xau, a real Bushman) is the one to do that. These early scenes give a very funny view on how the civilized white man has become what he is today.In the meanwhile we have met Andrew Steyn (Marius Weyers) who does field research not far from the Bushman and Kate Thompson (Sandra Prinsloo) who was tired of her job and now wants to do something with children in Botswana. Steyn must pick up Kate and bring her to the village and this is where the slapstick begins. Steyn is a man who gets very nervous when is around women and with Kate he must be the most clumsy guy there is. We have also met Sam Boga (Louw Verwey) who wants to do a coup but fails and he is now running for the police. We know how all these stories will come together but that is not a bad thing. It only uses the story to show us differences between people, to show that the white man is not necessarily the civilized man and it does this with great comedy. ?The Gods Must Be Crazy' with its simple humor works a lot better then most of the modern comedies. The way the Bushmen talk is funny enough to like this movie. Fortunately there is so much more including a little message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What starts out as a simple tale of the bush turns into a wild adventure with a coke bottle, revolutionaries, a dis-enchanted office worker turned teacher, and a scientist who studies animal dung with no skills around women. Add a smart-tongued mechanic and a 4x4 called the antichrist, and you have one of the funniest movies ever to come out of South Africa. You laugh as much at the ludicrous nature of some of the situations as much as what they want you to laugh at. You may never look at Africa the same again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crazy! Goofy! Silly!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crazy, goofy, and silly are the three most operative words to describe "The Gods Must Be Crazy". But the movie is also very original. It's appropriate that the word crazy is in the title because this is the craziest movie I've ever seen. "The Gods Must Be Crazy" is a South African made comedy that was made back in the early 1980s but didn't get released until 3-4 years after shooting was completed. It became a surprise hit in the U.S. after it was released in 1984, and it did very well in other countries too. "The Gods Must Be Crazy" features three separate stories that get tied together towards the end. One story is about a bushman who goes on a journey to return a Coke bottle that he found to the Gods after the bottle starts causing harm to some of his family members. Another story revolves around a war that breaks out in Central Africa. And the other story centers around a clumsy scientist who tries to take a pretty South African woman to her new job as a schoolteacher in a small African village, and does everything wrong. This is my favorite part of the movie. The scientist is played by Marius Weyers, and he gives an inspired slapstick comedy performance. Some of the things that he does in the film had me exploding in laughter. The scenes with the jeep that he drives are priceless. Sandra Prinsloo is a good foil as the schoolteacher who unfortuneitly has no choice but to put up with his clumsiness. When Weyers and Prinsloo are on screen, "The Gods Must Be Crazy" is at its funniest. The other two stories are good, but not great. Nevertheless, there are some unusual scenes in these parts of the movie too. But the scenes involving the scientist and the schoolteacher are the best parts of "The Gods Must Be Crazy". It's too bad that they didn't turn up in the dull sequel. I think these parts of the movie alone is enough for me to recommend "The Gods Must Be Crazy". *** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest and also the most wonderful movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw it in San Francisco in 1984. At the end of the movie the entire audience stood and applauded. I was astonished, as I'd never experienced this in a movie theater. I was so delighted that I went to see it again the very next evening. Exactly the same thing happened: the audience - a completely different one, of course - again stood and cheered as the movie reached its unexpected conclusion. I was exhilarated, enchanted, and had tear-lined cheeks from laughing more than I have at any other movie I have ever seen before or since. Go to the ends of the earth to see this unique and hilarious commentary on human nature. After years of trying, I tracked down a used video to treasure; and may it someday be released on DVD.</fullReview>

Peaceful, happy, considerate; living a utopia. And can we say *funny*?! This film was hilarious!! I couldn't stop laughing at the slapstick performed by the lead actor(don't remember his name.), the bushman, and all the children. But best of all (and I'm not some 35-year-old mother), is that people of *any* age, boy or girl can watch this. It's a feel-good, funny, heartwarming story about love, friendship, and following your faith. See it when you can!!!-Sep</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie three times in the early 1980s and it ran for 18 months straight at a cinema to packed houses in Brisbane Australia. It's simplicity, lack of obscene language and violence make it unique. Young and old can roar with laughter and understand the moral of the story.This film was made for very little money - as many of the classic films were and still are - it's not sophisticated in camera technique but that doesn't matter. It's the spirit of the film, the actors and crew which shine out of the screen that count. A "must see" film film once in your lifetime to shake off the violence and crudities so prevalent in todays movies. I am not a wowser - I just feel that - frequently - simple and sincere is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant comedy, worthy of many viewings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife says "If you want a little lightness in your life, this one's a gem.' This South African film was written and directed by Jamie Uys, who also plays The Reverend. The film is in English with some Afrikaans and a little of the dialogue is in Xhosa, a language with many consonants which are different clicking sounds; it is an interesting experience just to hear it.In his travels, a bushman in the Kalahari desert, find a Coca-Cola bottle that was thrown from an airplane. Thinking it a gift from the gods, he takes it to his village where it becomes a very popular item but also creates grave problems (hence the title of the film). In his quest to get rid of the bottle by throwing it off the end of the world, he encounters civilization for the first time; we hear his puzzled thoughts through a narrator, and we are able to see ourselves through the eyes of an innocent. In a separate story, a beautiful schoolteacher, Kate (Sandra Prinsloo) is assigned to a remote village and has to deal with a shy scientist, Andrew Steyn (Marius Weyers), who becomes a total klutz in the presence of a pretty woman. These two hilarious stories converge with even more hilarious results. The sequel was no match for the original.This beautifully-crafted film contains subtle comedy, farce, romance, drama, action and believable slapstick (equal to Chaplin's best). The film played at the Capitol Theatre in Toronto for over a year, getting considerable repeat business: those who loved it would later bring their friends. You too will love these warm, wonderful characters and boo the villains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. It is one of terrific comedic timing. I believe the guy who is working on his doctorate is a riot. He is a contender for Charlie Chaplin as far as I'm concerned. This movie has great understanding of the bushman. I do not understand why there would have been riots claiming prejudice. I found myself laughing out loud so many times--and I usually do not guffaw myself through a movie.For someone who is watching this one for the first time, you think that you are in a documentary--but give this movie time. It will definitely grow on you. My 31 year old son even remembered it from the fist time he saw it in 1980 and remembered how hilarious it was back then.

		<fullReview>"The Gods Must Be Crazy" rivals "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" for playing out separate, winding threads, then tying them neatly together in the end with comic flair."The Gods Must Be Crazy" weaves three separate "fish out of water" stories together -- a bushman who encounters civilization on his quest to rid the earth of an evil Coke bottle, a stumblebum wildlife biologist more at home with a demonic Land Rover than a beautiful woman, and a weary office worker who flees the rat race to become a schoolteacher in a remote villate. Throw in a cynical mechanic, a band of terrorists, a herd of goats, and a dashing safari guide who tries to steal the girl, and watch it percolate.Others have compared this film to the work of Douglas Adams, and I think they're right on the money. The filmmakers share Adams' ability to see the absurdity of the things we take for granted every day."The Gods Must Be Crazy" will remain a classic long after trendy flics have been forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comedies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though most people might NOT agree with my first line, I certainly do. It is not only a documentary, but a great comedy and satire on "civilized" people in the world. Although filled with actors no one has ever heard of and being low budgeted, it's still one of the best films I've ever seen.The movie starts out in the bush of the Kalahari; a documentary on the bushmen of the desert. Suddenly, the main character Xixo is nearly hit by a gift from the gods (a Coke bottle thrown from a passing airplane). He brings it back to the community, where they use it for many things. But soon jealousy comes over members of the tribe, and they fight and bicker for this special tool. Xi soon disposes of it, only to have a hyena find it again. Children find it and fight over it again, and Xi soon decides to throw the "Evil Thing" off the edge of the world.Meanwhile, a slapstick biologist is trying to take a future teacher to her destination. He gets weak in the knees many a time, and screws up grandly. And at the same time, the terrorist Sam Boja attempts to assassinate the President, and runs out of options in the thick brush. And Xixo still treks for the ends of the earth.Our lives are revealed in this wonderful foreign film. The gods aren't crazy for letting this movie be finished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is landmark comedy. It is basic slapstick and simpleness, with a pittance for a budget, yet 'The Gods Must Be Crazy' has set a precedent for true funny films.Set in Africa, it tells the overwhelmingly amusing tale of a bushman, totally oblivious to the modern world, who finds an empty coke bottle while hunting one day. Tapping it with his stick, he has no idea what this 'thing' from the modern world (or 'gods' as he thinks) is! Taking it to his family, they find that over time this 'thing' only leads to selfishnes, fighting and jealousy in the tribe, feelings in which they have not experienced before. The Story then leads to the bushman taking a pilgrimage across Africa to throw this 'thing' off the end of the earth. His travels take him into the modern world, where he meets many halarious characters who take him into amusing situations.

		<shortDescription>great movie [ contains spoiler ]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are bushmen, who live in the Kalahari Desert. At first they tell us about their way of life. Later there is footage of life in the big city. The narrator keeps talking about modern life. We move back to the bushmen. A man in a passing airplane tosses a Coke bottle out the window. It lands close to the bushman, who has never seen anything like it before. Later it causes all kinds of problems and the bushman tries hide it. Later the leader of the rebels in Burundi trys to assassinate the President. Later they're chased by the military. I think this is a good movie. This is a good movie to watch, i have seen it two times in the last year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hilarious and whacky comedy ? it says a lot. This movie is a cult classic and belongs with "Harold and Maude" and "King of Hearts" in this category.In its own crazy way it tells us all kinds of things about people, simple and complicated, the way life might be, and, indeed, the way it is. Clearly Jamie Uys is a genius, to put such disparate material together in such a complex crazy plot, and have it all make sense.People looking for technical accuracy will not like this movie. It is not at all realistic in that sense. And while the movie is largely a series of clichés - it works. For example ? in the scene where (the clumsy) Steyn takes off to the schoolhouse to try to apologize to Ms. Thompson and (bring back her shoes) - His companion gives him this advice:"... You gotta smile, man, and tell her she looks good"Steyn: How come suddenly you're an expert on women?Companion: I got 7 wives - how many you got?Steyn: So what have you done with your 7 wives?Companion: I know how to marry them; nobody knows how to live with themSteyn: So why did you marry them?Companion: Shee Shee! Someday I have to tell you the facts of life"AND . . . the biggest cliché in the movie: "I don't want to talk about it."****"The Gods Must be Crazy" is a sweet, charming and hilarious movie ? it took me 20 years to get to see it, and am I glad I did. This is one I will add to my collection of the movies already mentioned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful, unique movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comedy contains 3 intertwined stories: first the quest of one Bushman of the Kalahari, a second is an almost romance between a schoolteacher and a woman-shy researcher, and the third involves a pursued flight by a small group of rebels.Eventually, all the threads interact, unite, and gain resolution. Along the way, there is some slapstick reminiscent to me of some of the Laurel &amp; Hardy sight gags (maybe with a touch of the 3 Stooges?).Of most interest to me is the view it gives us of the Bushmen (they're also known as the Dobe San, the Dobe !Kung, and/or the !Kung). This is a romantic, idealized, somewhat fairy tale view of these great people, more true probably in the first 2/3rds of the 20th century than later. No !Kung now live without contact with the outside world and few or none now live as was depicted. But, although it's a caricature, nevertheless it's still a useful, somewhat truthful one which captures much of this people's former beauty and essence.The "!" in the name !Kung comes because these people speak in a "click" dialect and the movie gives us many samples of its unusual sounds.The !Kung are a people who were driven into the Kalahari about 500 years ago by the encroachment of other tribes. Much like Pygmies, the !Kung are short in stature (but not quite as much) and rather than black, they're usually considered "Negrito" and somewhat yellowish skinned if I remember correctly.I'd seen this film years ago and enjoyed it particularly for its view of the !Kung. I recently rented it to loan to a couple of university students going to South Africa on a concert tour since they may get a glimpse of the Kalahari.Very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A light, delightful 'comedy' with yet serious undertones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie ca. 6 years ago on Belgian TV, and thought it was delightful, but with yet a serious undertone message. There really is no story to tell as such; an African, pagan, bushman, unknown to glass, finds a Coca-Cola bottle and tries to deal with it, within the limits of his environment and his known world. I think it does very well in making us realise the effect the developed world and its 'civilisation' has on the 'third' world, esp. if we are not really aware of the differences between 'our' world and 'their' world. It is not a film about violence, segregation, or prejudice, but a film that will make you understand why shipping fridges/trucks to any country without proper supply channels for electricity/fuel is pointless. If the so-called third world is now living in 'our' middle ages (Dark Ages for some), then we need to start to bring them up one century further, not 5 centuries. I recommend this film highly - you do need a sense of humour to enjoy it, though!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why this film is a MUST SEE (not necessarily in this order):First of all, it's educational. It's full of interesting tidbits (as far as I know are true..) such as how the Bushman live, how the children play, etc.Second, the MUSIC in it is wonderful. For example, when the people of the village greet the school teacher, they sing a beautiful song. I really grew to appreciate the music of Africa after seeing this movie.Third, the way the PLOT builds, is really clever. There about 4 different stores happening, (The bushman going on a journey to get rid of the "evil thing", the school teacher getting away and starting a new life, the microbiologist who's afraid of women, and the group of terrorists up to no good.) The personalities in the movie, and the different points of view at which the stories get told, are great! They're just classic. For example, the vein tour guide that makes the other guy look like a schmuck.Fourth, simply put, it's HILARIOUS!Lastly, the scenery in the movie is astonishing, especially at the end.This movie needs to be released on DVD.</fullReview>

And unlike many comedies, the comedic happenings in this movie are--in the main--possible.The actors do a superb job, and their humanity (nervousness, adaptation, incomprehension) shines through.

I can not totally discount the feelings some may have about it's racism, and finding comedy in anything related to war and death is always a gamble, but I don't relate to this film on those levels. For me it is a simple funny film, more of an homage to our classic American slapstick comedies of the 30's than anything else.See it for yourself, and I think you'll 'see' Chaplin, Keystone Kops, Keaton and enjoy it for what it is, a funny, make-you-chuckle-out-loud entertainer you can watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best fun independent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNINGI think this a masterpiece of comic storytelling on a low budget. A good example is the guy rescuing the lady from the truck in the river. Experienced movie-goers will know they have to fall in the water, but it's amazing just how much James Uys manages to play this scene to it's maximum potential. And the film is bursting with great comic set-ups like this.I have read a whole lot of serious critics who sniff and say this is an "arguably racist" film. All I can say is they obviously haven't seen the courtroom scene; which is the emotional heart of the film, and at it's most poignant. It hints at a whole heap of current issues about race relations with Australian Aborigines, North American Indians and so on. If it's racist it is so strongly in favor of the natives. This film almost has a sort of Margaret Mead-style anthropological view of the "noble savage" in the Utopian landscape who only has problems when the 'corrupt' western civilization interferes. It maybe a simplistic, naive view, but it shares with a lot of films in that way (just think WITNESS or THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS).In fact, I'm sure if you did a statistical analysis of this film, you'd probably find that the Caucasian characters actually suffer a lot more farcically embarrassing situations than the native Africans ever do. Especially Marius Weyer's character; who has to cope with a forever-runaway truck, problems in translation, trying to communicate with the opposite sex, and two great slapstick sequences in the schoolroom and the climactic picnic scene. In fact, the truth is that this movie is an inherently democratic comedy; everyone is made to look stupid (except perhaps the central Bushman, which is unusual in a comedy film).It is interesting trying to figure out just at what point can you tell this is all tongue-in-cheek, and not a straight documentary. The obvious place is the depiction of "standard" western lifestyle ruled by the clock, with its classic sped-up sequence. But I think a few more discerning viewers could probably notice a few hints in the narration just beforehand that indicates this is not all as straight-forward as it seems.I think the main problem is that some film critics seem totally prejudiced against broad slapstick comedy, and will make any wild accusation they can hoping something will stick. I think the implied suggestion by some commentators that native African actors should be banned from doing broad farcical comedy, even in obvious farcical comedy stories like this, is a far more inherently racist attitude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of slapstick's greatest triumphs in the last 20 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget Home Alone. Forget Dumb and Dumber. Forget There's Something About Mary. If you want really simple slapstick humor, The Gods Must be Crazy is one of the greatest triumphs in the last 20 years.The premise of the movie is a three-fold plot; Xixo is a bushman, whose family has found a coke bottle that some pilot dropped from a plane. It turns out to be magnificently useful, but everyone fights over it, so Xixo decides to go to the end of the earth and throw it off. Meanwhile, Andrew Steyn (Marius Weyers, your basic bumbling idiot) is a student studying, primarily, Elephant Dung. And he's asked by a friend to go pick up the new schoolteacher, Kate Thompson (Sanrda Prinsloo), and deliver her. Meanwhile, Sam Boga (Louw Verwey) and his band of terrorists are fleeing from justice into Botswana. All three elements meet up with each other in interesting ways. Between Steyn's ridiculously bad vehicle, Kate's overmodesty, Xixo's complete ignorance of culture, Sam Boga's seriousness and his inept band of people (including the two dopes who're always playing cards), there are dozens of clever plot twists and loads of brilliant comedic situations.Trust me, you'll laugh your baboons off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitive proof that high end cinematography and special effects do NOT make a movie good. So completely overlooked by the mainstream movie industry in our area that only one theatre played it, and they only held it for a week. But I seized it eagerly when it became available on video, and it remains one of my all time favorites to date.There has already been a good deal of commentary on the philosophy of culture clash, or the "evils of civilization" angle, but the one thing I could add is that this movie, in its off-beat, thoroughly endearing way, shows the evolution of mythology from reality. After having already laughed our way through the entire hysterical plot, the one final reward for our patient viewing is the finally seeing the disposition of "The Evil Thing" and the bushman-hero's triumphant return home, having achieved success in his curious quest. Okay, so it's too bizarre to have happened for real (or is it? Hmm... we do live in a fairly strange world...) but it shows how mythology might get started, and why it might live on.All done with minimal budget and no special effects worth speaking of. Bravo. Ingenious!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most unique comedies of all time. Pleasant respite from 80's fart humor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a movie in the 80's depicting Africans as primitive people without being racist or disrespectful. That alone was a huge challenge in those sensitive times and this movie did it. It is a mockery of civilization along with a silly "G" rated love story/comedy-basically two plots in one movie loosely tied together. I first "heard" this movie when I somehow got a TV signal on my radio. I was in Army barracks and I liked nature shows so I listened without visual for a while at this odd narrative coming through the speakers. For a while I thought it *was* a nature show but I had never heard one so silly. Later I found out how unpopular it was with critics and "cool" people so after buying it I put it in the closet with my old Carpenters album and Dr. Demento video cassette only to be taken out when I was alone and wanted a little guilty pleasure from something I truly enjoyed after sitting through numerous fart jokes and other stuff that strained a laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keystone Goofiness In The Kalahari</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "The Gods Must Be Crazy" is to see an artifact of American culture given new life in the Kalahari Desert of Botswana. It's not a Coke bottle I refer to, but silent comedy of the Hal Roach and Max Sennett variety, brought to second life by director-writer Jamie Uys.Uys pulls every Roachian trope he can think of, whether it be a terrorist slipping on a banana peel or the strains of "Rockabye Baby" with people falling asleep. Cars with a mind of their own drive in reverse while one poor fellow can't move five feet in without tripping or getting a face full of flour. Somehow it works, and "The Gods Must Be Crazy" winds up being a pretty good time.When a Coke bottle is thrown out of a passing airplane and lands amid a tribe of Ju/wasi (also known, apparently not as respectfully I've learned, as Bushmen), the strange object is found so useful that it stirs up jealousy and unrest. Thinking it a gift from the Gods, a most unwelcome one, a tribe member named Xi (N!xau, a real Ju/wasi) sets off to find "the end of the earth" so he can respectfully return it. On his way, he runs afoul of civilization's mad rules and finds himself in need of help from mechanic M'Pudi (Louw Verway) and biologist Andrew Steyn (Marius Weyers, the guy with the flour on his face). Steyn's got his own problems."When I meet women, my brain switches off," Steyn explains. "I turn into a complete idiot." When escorting the fair schoolteacher Kate (Sandra Prinsloo) to a Botswana village, he keeps falling on top of her trying to rescue her from wild animals only he (and the audience) sees. "You get these sudden urges and then you come up with warthogs and rhinoceroses," she sneers.There are those who see in "Gods" socio-political comment about the then state of South Africa, where the film was made, with blacks and whites adjusting to one another in chaotic fashion. Others may see a comic Koyaanisqatsi, of life's balance being restored by Xi, the only true-sighted man amid many who are confused. But the film plays so hard for laughs it feels chary to look past the slapstick surface for anything more than a funny story.In fact, I think it works against the film to attach too much thought to watching it. Clearly there's a bit of awkwardness to the notion of the Ju/wasi lifestyle being presented so idyllically, as if subsisting on rainwater residue really compensates for adequate refreshment. The sad fate of N!xau, who lived out his days a wretched shell from tuberculosis, suggests a more uncomfortable reality than presented here.But the film impresses me with its winning amiability and clever set-ups, the way Uys never lets a scene go more than a minute without finding some amusing payoff. Even a gang of terrorists shooting up the countryside, actually killing and being killed, feel more in tune with Laurel &amp; Hardy than "The Dogs Of War". Uys is merely updating the movie conventions to more modern sensibilities, without losing the mojo that made classic comedies so rich and lasting. Despite some atrocious dubbing, there is even some good wordplay to be had. I like especially the name of Steyn's romantic rival, "Jack Hind", as I realized it must be a play on the classic "Jack Ass".Okay, maybe the charm wears off a bit after the credits roll. You couldn't really make films like silent Hollywood did, not in 1980 and especially perhaps not in a part of the world as hard-bitten by life's realities as southern Africa. But "The Gods Must Be Crazy" comes pretty close, and when you add some of the most gorgeous scenery ever filmed, it makes for a more fulfilling entertainment than most of today's more "socially relevant" comedies while it runs its mad, inspired course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up in a small town in Southeastern Connecticut. We had a tiny movie theater there that showed some of the latest movies but it was the only place around where you could go see artsy or indie-type films. My sister worked at the theater when I was little, and when this movie came out I remember that they showed it for about 6 months straight. When they finally stopped showing it, there was such an uproar that they brought it back for another 3 months by popular demand.I remember going to see this movie several times when I was about 6 years old. My mother hated it, and my sisters loved it. I was confused, and I remember laughing because my sisters were laughing. I thought it was real, and I didn't "get" why the man hated the Coke bottle. Around this same time, I did get to see and appreciate Animals are Beautiful People (Same narrator and director) at school! I didn't see this movie again until I was about 12 or 13, and by then I understood it, and I thought it was awesome to like it simply because my mother hated it- but by then I was able to appreciate it. This movie is totally absurd, and that's what makes it so funny. It always makes me laugh no matter how terrible I'm feeling, and whenever I get sick with the flu I turn to this movie to help raise my spirits. It doesn't rely on any of the dumb gimmicks that so many comedy movies use, and it appeals to such a varied audience. I'll always appreciate this movie for it's power to make me smile and for the reactions of others when they get to see it for the first time!</fullReview>

The late Jamie Uys was reputed to have made this movie on a shoestring, directing, producing, editing it himself with the most primitive equipment using many tricks from the bygone age of early film making. The movie has a simple story, it is cleverly amusing and a masterpiece of ingenuity using extremely limited resources. Over many years it has traveled around the world purely on its own merit.

ABANDON YOUR TECHNOLOGY! ABANDON AGRICULTURE!! ok, well i'm not abandoning these things either; i've grown so attached to my cat, photography, reading, etc.The technical aspects of this film may at first bother you, when i first saw this film about 15 years ago, i knew then that the editing was a bit sloppy, or.. maybe not sloppy, but not seamless, how about.. but it doesn't matter - what matters foremost is that the idea, the communication GETS ACROSS.. it does. i may have "the message" of this film all wrong but that's ok, because it's up to me to have my own interpretation! it doesn't have to be the same as yours. what a wonderful life the bushmen have; they don't have to worry about being old, insurance, paperwork, jobs, bills, phones, electricity, car keys, etc. - granted, their life would NOT be for everyone but most people on this planet don't have it easy; in fact, few do, and i suspect that they are not "happy" or "fulfilled" and i don't care.. i'm not going to cry over the plight of any humans whose purpose for existing was/is largely an afterthought.. think about why, before you make more people.. think about the facts that they may never like you, that they may want to die at 16 years of age, that they might want to join an organization that harbors beliefs which conflict utterly with yours, that they might want to be an anti-humanity activist (contact me if the latter is the case with YOU, and i will tell you how you can help me with my propaganda)the bushmen are PART OF SOMETHING, they have a way of living that works for them, and that's something ALL "civilized" "societies" NEVER DEVELOPED, and now it's rapidly becoming too late - populations are swelling, "resources" are being taxed, some to the point of nonexistence (or soon anyway)..personally, i'd rather be in a situation like the bushmen. i don't feel any need to live to see 50, 60, 70 years of age.. why? what's the point? so one can procreate? and see their offspring procreate? on this planet? with what it's becoming, and the people that are responsible? no. no reason i can see to contribute to a population which is already way, way out of hand.right.. there is a story in The Gods Must Be Crazy, and i must really like it, too, as i can't count how many times i've seen the film.. it may be that some of the story was simply a device which would allow the filmmaker's preoccupations to be spread around, maybe not. again, this is my possible interpretation, which is neither right or wrong, necessarily. make your own conclusions; i urge you to see this film. if the technical aspects are too much for you to handle, then go watch some drivel like Pearl Harbor, i'm quite sure benafflekkk has the answer to all your little problems.in fact - this movie may have NO MESSAGE, but i think it has many. and this is something i like, is that there isn't ONE MESSAGE FORCED ON ME, which is the case with so, so, many excuses-for-films i've witnessed.. of course, a closing reminder that GOOD movies and BAD movies truly do not exist - rather, there are only films, and YOUR TAKE ON THEM. keep all that in mind</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie recently and I loved it! If you are a fan of Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide series you will love this. While not written by D.A. it does seem to be similar to his style of story-telling. I promise you will never look at a coke-bottle the same way again. I now see coke-bottle and think "evil thing." It's the type of comedy that appeals to those who like intellectual humor, a wonderful blend of wity naration, great dialogue and good sight gags. I love the rhino who's the self-appointed fire marshal in the jungle. It's a wonderfully light-hearted movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie must be seen to be believed. The most simple-minded plot (african native seeks to return heavenly gift which causes so much pain) ends up being one of the best situational comedies ever, as well as a great romance. The plodding simplicity of the major characters clashes with modern culture and political uprising to yeild a very enjoyable story. Watch this one if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie goes to show how a low-budget, low-tech, simple comedy can out-do a mega, multi-million dollar budget hollywood attempt at making something funny. Also goes to show you don't have to be completely obnoxious, sexual, and obscene to try to be funny, either. Of course, those who are into that kind of humor (which reflects about all of today's TV sitcoms, movies, and even cartoons), will not like this movie at all. But for those who appreciate genuine, simple comedy, this is a film to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gods Must Be Crazy is one of the most entertaining films ever. You'll love it!By American standards this film's production values are not above a "B" movie grade, BUT SO WHAT? The story is hilarious, it's nice, the lead actor is amazingly goofy, and the slapstick qualities of a lot of the humor are great.(I'll reveal one secret only....in the "dramatic" rebel raid scene, the rebels come zooming in hanging all over a couple of old jeeps. The driver of one of the jeeps slams on the brakes and a rebel absolutely FLIES off onto the sidewalk. Does filming stop? What, for one little extra, HELL NO! He picks himself up and runs after the others. I guess he reported to the infirmary later, if there was one!)You have to pick up the South African accents before you can catch everything, and there's a little muttering that might be hard to hear, but the narration is clear and you'll soon start getting it all.Racism? It doesn't exist here. This is a refreshing film, filled with perhaps unintentional insights into modern life in the African veldt. And there isn't one thing you'd be embarrassed to see with your kids.Be prepared to laugh your head off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to say why I enjoy this movie... I can think of many reasons why I wouldn't like this movie, all good reasons and all reasons why I have trashed other movies that had similar problems. The movie starts off looking and sounding like a nature documentary and then wildly shifts gears to an office and the plot is off and running. The portrayals of Black Africans really shows an apartheid white view of "those pesky natives", the story is totally implausible. But why is it that every time it's on TV I find my self caught like a "wait-a-bit" tree has stuck me to my seat. I know all the jokes and sight gags but I still laugh. I'm sure a large reason is this movies clever pacing, it never lets up and something is always happening. The little bushman is a lovable gentle man and it is pleasant to view the world through his eyes in various scenes in the film. The swearing automechanic is always funny and I am convinced he has taught a few children new ways to curse at life's difficulties. All in all, as I have said, I like this movie and recommend at least one viewing to see whether it is your cup of tea. You may also find yourself liking this and not having the foggiest idea why...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The bushmen are not, of course, meant to represent actual Kalahari bushmen - although here Uys seriously under-estimated how na?ve audiences could be; either that, or he knew full well how na?ve we could be, and had a private joke at our expense. I, for one, DID believe that the people of the Kalahari led the pure, utopian life depicted here. (I was very young, but so were many others in the audience.) I even believed the white lie about Africans who shook their heads in order to say `yes', and the one about rhinos who put out fires ... the latter may even be true, for all I have since learned to the contrary, but I'm sure it isn't.Anyway: IS the life of the bushmen so utopian? Do we really want to be like them? Of course not. Their unvarying level of soporific happiness makes my blood run cold; their bland, brittle, uncultured society reminds me of nothing so much as that of the Eloi from H.G. Wells's `The Time Machine'. If there's anyone in this film whose position is to be envied it's Andrew. He found out what he wanted from life, and he managed to get it. Many of the people from the city fall short of doing one or other of these two things. The bushmen - again I should stress that they're NOT the real bushmen, but a kind of fantasy vision out of Rousseau - are playing life for lower stakes, scarcely able to form desires or plans at all.The exception is Xixo, the first and the last member of his society to embark on a quest. He even manages to complete it. Then he returns to what we think we think is utopia.So there IS a serious comment here, about how we think we want to live in paradise. Sorry to go on about it at length, when Uys made the point so wittily and gracefully, albeit without many people realising he was making it, and perhaps without realising he was making it himself. But a comedy is never so funny as when it grows naturally out of a good story. `The Gods Must Be Crazy' may be the funniest film of its decade. (`The Life of Brian' is its only real rival.) Admittedly, I found that the tears-to-the-eyes hilarity more or less vanished after the first viewing, and I don't think I could stand to watch the film too often, but there are clearly those who feel differently. A cinema in Brisbane made its living by screening the film continuously for over a year. It may even have been two years. Either feat is impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This South African film was an unexpected worldwide hit in the early 1980s. It has a great opening 30 minutes, as it tells the story of the peaceful Bushmen, living happily as hunter gatherers in the Kalahari desert and oblivious to the modern world (even though the great modern cities of South Africa are located just a few hundred miles south of where they live). One day, a white pilot flying in a small airplane throws an empty Coke bottle into the desert. The Bushmen find it, and believing it to be a gift from the Gods, create many ingenious uses for it. However, since there is only one of it and is coveted by all the tribe, it creates all sort of bad feelings, like greed and jealousy. As the narrator implies, the Coke bottle has been an instrument through which the peaceful Bushmen has been contaminated by the modern world. So the elders of the tribe decide they should banish the bottle, and ask one of their hunters to go to the end of the world and throw it away. His trek begins, in which he will meet with many other, supposedly more civilized beings, including a white scientist, a female white journalist and some nasty African rebels. This part of the movie is not so great. It's heavy on slapstick, but is not really funny. Interestingly, this film was even accused of racism at the time for the way it portrayed the brutal African rebels (South Africa was then under apartheid and this was one of the rare films from that country released internationally).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A make-fun-of-everyone one-of-a-kind movie! :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie three times since it was first available in the US. The first time was when I was in my late teens; then, again in my twenties; and, now, at 49...and, it's funny every time!This movie isn't racist as so many people seem to believe! It makes fun of EVERYONE...especially the star with his Land Rover and socially-odd behavior around a beautiful woman. In fact, it makes the 'civilized' world fantasize about living 'simple' like the Bushmen in a seemingly-harmonious group without leaders; rules; misbehavior; crime; punishment; and, all the things that any 'civilized' society would be that-much-better without, if such a thing were possible. Who are really the 'civilized' people in this movie? Who are really the 'happy' people in this movie? Does anyone believe that a happy person living in the wilderness on his/her own terms really cares about what an unhappy person living in 'civilization' thinks about him/her? I believe that a person who sees racism everywhere they go and in everything they see is the 'real' racist.Another reason why I like this movie so much isn't even because it's a comedy...it's because of the wonderful scenery and wildlife of the Kalahari Desert. To me, this movie is much like a comedy version of the 1962 John Wayne movie "Hatari" which was made further north-east in Tanganyika (what is now Tanzania). Also...during the gun-fight with the two terrorists/rebels, the ricochets of the bullets sometimes make the 'same sound' as they do in Sergio Leone's spaghetti-westerns which I found somewhat funny, but, 'cool' at the same time. Being set in South Africa, I found this 'classic-comedy' very-much heartwarming as opposed to other great movies made in Africa; such as "Zulu(1964);" "Zulu Dawn(1979);" "Blood Diamond(2006);" "The Wilby Conspiracy(1975);" and, others...'ALL' great movies...but, not funny!With all of this said...this is a marvelous movie that pokes fun at anyone and everyone in it, even the animals (like the rhinoceros that puts out fires!?!?)...and, that's the way it should be. It's silly, stupid, and, exaggerated, but, those are the ingredients of a great comedy! If you can't laugh at yourself, then, 'you' just might be the one with the issues!?!?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gods Must Be Crazy. Very apt title for a movie which is a crazy mix of slapstick and subtle humor. There is whole array of sweet crazy characters put under crazy situations. Movie's first few minutes are classic, giving you a commentary on civilizations behavior. In fact, this running commentary is the most lovely part of the movie. Movie hops from satire to slapstick to subtle to cute and never misses to impress you. Shot into the heart of African wildlife, there are some exquisite shots of wild life creatures and their strange habits. This movie deserves to be watched because it is so unique, imaginative and full of purpose. All conversations are so delightful and delicious.

		<fullReview>The movie showcases the innocence of a Bushman in a selfish (modern world) add slapstick to it, both elements of comedy are done in a innocent way. One of the best foreign comedy movie I have seen. The stories have a beautiful connection among them. I particularly enjoyed the part of Bushman tribe and kept thinking how the director managed to shoot them while maintaining their natural essence. The second element I loved was the slapstick comedy, I cannot remember last time I saw slapstick done in such a funny way. There were parts when I burst into laughter.The dialogues really added a flavor to the movie, even though they were dubbed, except a few. And finally the characters. The Bushman might take the limelight but for me the scientist was the funniest of them all. Enjoy this apparently simply but extremely well thought out comedy.</fullReview>

After he accidentally drops her in the lake, they have to spend the night alone. Then to make matters worse, his jeep gets caught high up in a tree! No wonder the bushman thinks that "the gods must be crazy"!They eventually join forces unintentionally to save the school children from a terrorist and his gang. Then there's the two gang members and their non-stop game of cards! Don't take this movie seriously! And don't give up on it after the first 10 minutes either!

Xi starts out on a journey to find the end of the earth in order to throw the evil a Coca Cola bottle into the abyss. Xi wanders into civilization for the first time in his life and encounters warring factions and all other forms of modern day man.

		<shortDescription>Strange but really hilarious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this ain't no movie like any other. It's an African movie, shot with mostly natives and a South African director at the helm. This means that the movie in style is very different from similar type of movies made in the west.The movie has some of the most lame and simplistic comedy in it, that is often really old fashioned and almost slapstick like but it's simply irresistible and often makes the movie an hilarious one to watch. You of course shouldn't take this movie too seriously. A real goofy movie that is hard not to laugh at.There isn't much to the story really, though deep inside the movie still holds a message in it. The concept of a small desolated African tribe being confronted for the first time with the modern world through a coke bottle is a quite good and interesting one that held plenty of potential in it. It showed how their peaceful and simple style of living changed, due to the new found, strange, modern object, that turned out to be a quite useful tool for them for multiple uses. The movie is almost being documentary like with this approach but yet the movie decides to trow in many more different plot-lines. There are like 3 main plot lines, that eventually come together, featuring different characters, which can be seen as too many for any movie but this sort of suits the movie its goofiness. It's obviously a not too well made movie but considering its resources this movie is still truly one fine achievement, that also became a huge success overseas. It spawned many sequels, of which the first two got also directed by Jamie Uys.Besides natives, the movie also features lots of African wild life. Quite amazing how some of the wild life plays a role in this movie, as if it all got scripted and the animals were playing their parts.It's a real unique and hilarious surprise from South Africa.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bottle of 'Crazy'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Silly comedy with a really ticklish sense of humor. South-African director Jamie Uys had his Hollywood film debut in this low-budget, old-fashioned comedy which will make the likes of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. While dated at some spots, THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY is a funny screwball comedy packed with visual gags which, thanks to Uys' comedic talents, turn out to be funny. At the time where it seems too hard to make people laugh with clumsiness and slapsticks, Uys does so with promising gusto. Certainly done in a low budget which clearly shows by its weak dubbing and rather grainy photography, but it's low budget done at best intentions and results. The film is divided into three separate stories, all of which are really hilarious. The first involves one of the main center character, a bushman, who is chosen by his tribe to get rid of a coke bottle, which they believe is a curse bestowed upon them by the gods. The second involves a klutzy explorer (Marius Weyers) escorting a school teacher (Sandra Prinsloo) across the African wilderness, and an incredibly offbeat romance ensues. The third involves a band of foreign terrorists fleeing for their lives. While it mostly reeks with oldness, it's still quite funny and inspired. Worth seeing.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

This is portrayed a lot through slapstick but you have to have lived in Africa to know that your car really could get stuck and then winched up a tree by accident because you have to do it yourself as there's no one to help. Or knowing the local animals and that when a rhino's head comes up, leave immediately! He could charge in a few seconds. Oh, and you cannot outrun an ostrich. And that a country can appear stable one day and suddenly be in the middle of a coup the next. In the State Department, there's a saying that you either will love Africa or hate it. I loved it.

		<fullReview>This piece of work can be summarised, as many others have commented as simple, and quite different to your average mainstream movie. It tries to mix a bit of documentary style narration of our world, with an entertaining fictional story. Now while it is a comedy, I do agree with some people who commented negatively, that this is not the "funniest movie ever", ala Monty python, or naked gun, or...you name it. There are some very funny moments, and some not very funny stupid ones, but overall it is merely pleasant.The strength of it relies much more on its message, and its satirical comparison of the world viewed from the "civilized" man's perspective, and the bushman's perspective. Now don't get me wrong here, I only use "civilized" to get the message across in a common term. Not one second do I believe that these civilized men (i.e. most of us) are in any way morally superior to the bushmen. And, I think, this is also the portrayal the movie gives. The bushmen live their lives differently, no one can argue with that, and that is a mere evidence. Therefore they have a different view of the world. Now, beware spoiler, a bushman not knowing what a bottle of coke is, is in no way racist. Why would he know what it was, had he or his ancestors never experienced anything like it before. We have gone from treating some humans as slaves becauses of their differences, to treating anyone who mentions a difference in appearance or belief as a potential racist. This is just so representative of our inability to get a balance anywhere (e.g. between communism and cut-throat capitalism). The funniest thing of all is that we do in some cases do both at the same time in our supposedly civilised countries (i.e. badly discriminate people and put them to near-slavery, and accuse people of racism when they stress the differences in humorous ways). So please, this is definitely not a racist movie.In conclusion, it is a refreshing movie and although it is more than 20y old, it is certainly as timely now (probably more) as it was back then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY in the late 1980s during it's art-house theater run, in Sacramento California. As a fresh college graduate, I was amazed, impressed, and delighted. This was the funniest film I'd ever seen. And it remained so, for a long, long time. Even today I recall the breathlessness I felt at the final scene, which truly does deserve a huge, widescreen to appreciate. As the years passed, I saw it repeatedly--perhaps 20 or more times--introducing friends and family to the hilarity. Even my curmudgeonly grandmother thought it was wonderful--the only film she ever liked, to my knowledge. (I had no interest in the sequel, which I was assured was not as good, and which I never saw.) And then, after maybe 10 years of having not seen it, I rented The Gods Must Be Crazy, and sat, unmoved and unhumored, through the entire film. Not once did I smile or laugh. Yes, I knew exactly what was going to happen, just as I had dozens of times before, but THIS time it just wasn't funny. Maybe I'm older, maybe the film has become dated in its simplistic view of, as one reviewer here said, the "noble savage". Maybe I've become cynical, or maybe I wasn't in the mood for the odd combination of pathos and slapstick. I don't know. But while I am grateful for many shared laughs, I think I've finally had enough of The Gods Must Be Crazy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An African Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Gods Must Be Crazy is about a bushman played by a real life bushman from Africa. He comes across a Coke bottle which is something that he has never seen before. Paddy Byrne, a Briton or Irishman, narrates the background of the bush tribes in Africa. The story is set in Botswana where a young female teacher comes to teach in an African village. The story of her getting there is an adventure. She is greeted by a driver who is an African biologist and his translator has seven wives which is customary in some African societies. She doesn't believe about the rhino stomping out the fire. The casting is excellent especially that of the bushman who I can't remember his name but he steals the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood rarely releases a film made by foreigners unless their sure it is going to be a hit. (Mad Max anyone) Even if the film lacked some of the same quality of directing or even camera shots for 1980, it doesn't take away from this comedy at all. Supprisingly the best acting comes from a Bushman, while you cant understand what he is saying his facial expressions tell all. His ability to tell his side of the story without words is almost like Tom Hanks in "Cast Away". Some have said that this movie portrays the African characters in a racist way. I'm not going to say if that is fact or fiction, however lots of great comedy is based on some form of racism. Just ask Richord Pryor,Chris Rock, or George Carlin. The one thing that is true about this film is that if your looking for a good laugh and arn't the sensitive type you will love this film. The story is crude and the script is a bit dull but that is to be expected in "slap stick comedy". If anything watch it for the beautiful shots of the African outback, that alone is worth the 90 minutes it takes to watch this classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I like the movie, especially for a slightly older film. The movie was technically racist. However, despite the racism, the movie expressed it through many different views, and equally, seeming to make the racism in it okay simply because it was well rounded as if the director did it intentionally for satire. The comedy in the film also made the racism in the movie less serious, and rightfully so if the viewer is well informed.This film has its good points, and bad points, just like any other. However, I feel it's good points outweighed its bad points by far. The movie was technically racist. The director displayed the !Kung people as completely clueless, stupid, and unaware of the world around them. The white male was clueless and stupid as well, except he was aware of the world around him, which is worse. The woman was portrayed as the stereotypical female, that had to be catered to by males, but thought it was funny because she wasn't stupid and clueless but realized the stupidity of the males around her. It was also no surprise that the white main female character, white main male character, and lovable innocent !Kung character (Xi) ended up being the heroes. Everything about just about every character was in some way racist or stereotypical, but the director clearly pointed these things out, which made it hilarious.As a person in the "modern" world that wakes up at eight zero zero, I was not offended by the commentary. As a person who knows a little about Africa, I was not offended by the !Kung people being innocent and stupid simply because the director over did it so much so that a person almost cannot possibly think this is true of the world today. The only bizarre thing about the movie was the National Geographic style voice-over. However, I actually liked this simply because I hate subtitles because it gives me less time to notice the scene and actions of the characters.I recommend this movie for people with a sense of humor that actually do know about Africa. Having taking the Survey of World Literature course explicitly discussing Africa for 10 weeks, you learn a lot about it, so I knew when the director was being expressing stereotypes made towards Africa when I saw it. Those who are unaware of what really goes on in Africa will only let their ignorance be reinforced by false ideas. People who are aware of Africa and see the stereotypes, but have no sense of humor, will be easily angered. This is definitely a movie where a person needs to approach it with a laid-back attitude and those who don't will be told by those who do to "lighten up".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must See!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bushmen, the !Kung people and Xixo are not easily understood. In fact, many civilized Africans do not even understand these people who live in the desert. Furthermore, they can't even speak their language. In The Gods Must be Crazy, the movie depicts the bush people as uncivilized, hunters and gatherers, but as very friendly people. The movie does a very good job of showing the wide differences between the !Kung and the other natives, along with the white settlers. The main character of the !Kung is Xixo, who is able to help the white man to save the school children. In fact, Xixo is a main character in the movie, which is a rarity in African cinema. In addition, he helps Steyn, a white man who works with the testing of the game in the area, to save Ms. Thompson, the schoolteacher. The sole fact that a "hunter and gatherer" is able to be a sub-main character in the movie is quite an achievement to the African cinema. Furthermore, this gives the Africans something to be proud of when watching a movie about them. One issue in the movie I did not like was how the white man was displayed in "nation geographic" way. For example, how the city scene was showed in the movie. What I mean is that the narrator uses his voice to explain what is going on. Furthermore, the narrator uses his voice to explain what the !Kung people are saying. In addition, it is easy to tell that this movie was made for the white man to view. For example, it is a very stereotypical movie about Africa. However, the movie is not derogative in any way towards the African people. Another thing the director could have done was added subtitles to the African language to help the audience know what they are saying. However, the narrator does a good job in depicting what is said. In sum, this is a very good film, in which I enjoyed. It is not a racist film and most of the main characters are Africans. I believe that everyone should see this movie to see the real Africa in the 1980's!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A profound movie presented in an original and humorous manner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very entertaining movie presenting the primitive culture of the Bushman in the Kalahari dessert and contrasting it to modern civilization in much of Africa during the 1980s. It also has implications on the origination of evil and crime in society and relates it to increasing technology and inequality.The performances are excellent and the movie moves along at good pace. Although the subject matter is quite serious it is always presented in a humorous fashion. I think everyone will find it interesting, especially the beginning that focuses on the bushman culture and the Kalahari environment. For example they describe the bushman culture as having no laws, no penalties, no punishment, and no concept of personal ownership.The introduction of a Coca Cola bottle, which was thrown from a small plane, creates problems and social chaos in their society. It causes nothing but misery and the tribe determines that the Gods must have been crazy to give it to them. First they try to bury the bottle, but through a strange set of coincidences it is found again. Next they determine that the only way to solve the problem is to walk to the end of the world and throw the bottle off the Earth. Thus begins the adventure of one of the Bushmen into communities in Africa touched by modern society. This is in contrast to the character Miss Kate Thompson who is fleeing a large city of the modern world and desires the peace of a less advanced society. But the chaos of surrounding political upheavals provides the setting whereby the solution to their problems comes not from advanced civilization but from the bushman.In the end the bushman returns to his world of peace and tranquility which might provide a metaphor for our civilization without sustainable technology and resource use.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If people make painting, music and movies as a way approaching the truth, this movie simply did it, in a simplest way. It gave us a good question, does civilization bring us closer to the true meaning of the world? I have no answer to give but a nice guess that we are along a circle around the truth. Different people look into the world at different angles, their own civilization or culture. No one can prove the others wrong or in-advanced. They just coexist. And the movie has also brought something really beautiful out of the modern civilization. It's love.I won't describe the movie as a masterpiece, blah-blah. It simply makes me laugh and think and moved by the beauty across different people. Hail to the uncivilized Africa!p.s. From rapidly advancing China :)p.p.s. Worth watching</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a multi million dollar movie and simple in format and storyline but the most enjoyable movie I've ever had the pleasure to watch. At times I almost wet myself laughing. I lost the original tape but have now rediscovered it and will no doubt watch it several more times in the near future. Simple and perfectly believable with humour, greed, envy and a sense of community spirit wrapped around the most unlikely of objects. The sudden and inexplicable appearance of a coke bottle amongst the Kalari Tribesmen, which to the outside world is nothing more than worthless trash, sets neighbour against neighbour. After a series of events that are alien to the ways of the tribesmen everyone takes time to step back and consider what the consequences of this acceptance of the gift from the Gods really means and it's decided upon to rid themselves of it. Sit back, relax and hold onto your sides.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I began watching The Gods Must Be Crazy thinking it would be a hilarious goof ball comedy but as I got into it I found it was less funny than I thought it would be, but still very interesting. The comedy in this movie is mainly slapstick which is pretty funny but does get a little bit boring as does some of the romance in the story. The main reason I like this movie is because of all the information it gives on different people from parts of Africa. The Kalahari bushmen are an amazing people and I enjoyed learning about them as well as the other groups in that region. There are a few different stories in this movie which all come together quite neatly which is well done. It's sad to see that the writer and director Jamie Uys passed away ten years ago, he has put together here a fun and interesting movie that is definitely one to check out.</fullReview>

It is a look at the life of the Bushman/Actor called N!xau after the International success of the movie.This is a fabulous documentary which gives us a look at success that is completely astounding, yet haunting and fascinating compared with any Hollywood fair. When N!xau explains the film to children at a local school, the results are heart warming. The lack of English subtitles (All other languages are covered) did not hinder as Spanish was available.I cannot recommend it enough. Long Live N!xau!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is hilarious and I highly recommend it to all who love a good comedy. The story is that of a Bushman who one day comes across a Coke bottle thrown from a plane and thinks it to be a gift from the gods. And so, believing this, he takes it back to the village where he lives. In no time, the villagers make use of it for all purposes. With that, it eventually causes problems. The film itself is a sterling representation of how some people are quick to believe whatever is thrown at them and how even more people are simply just ignorant of the truths beyond the motives of others. All things considered, this film is wonderful for all people of all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some films deserve to be in the top 250, some don't: take Spiderman out and put this in! It's qualities range from it's critique of "civilized man" through simple narration to the bundle of laughs that are brought thanks to simple slapstick. It can thus please a wide audience. Slapstick for all ages, and the fine wit conceived around the clash of the bushmen's culture and that of the "civilized" man.It is a truly hilarious film! -slaptsick involving a clumsy, yet inventive man -different points of view, namely that of the bushman in opposition with the rest of the world yet also that of a primary school teacher who encounters for the first time nature and the wilds(Do not read unless you have seen it!This may spoil the fun.) Short analysis of one main theme A criticism of "civilized" man Searching a little further, one can notice a criticism of modern man involving the thoughts of the bushman and the voice of the narrator. Moreover, it also brings out the shortsightedness of modern man: whereas we can make planes, and computers, as far as we are concerned, a bottle is a bottle and has no further use. However the bushmen believe the coke bottle to be a gift from the gods and find many uses for it: brilliant to tan skins, it can also be used to crush food, break wood and serves as a "musical device". Furthermore, once the bottle has disturbed the peace in the family, rather than become homicidal maniacs, the bushmen resolve to cast the object from their lives, whereas modern man, once again, resorts to violence: this can be seen as one of the aims of the implicit aims of the "coup d'état" storyline early on in the film when the banana plantation is destroyed and the theme of control is brought up. Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and so the bushmen cast seek to exclude any sense of ownership or envy from their lives by ridding themselves of the bottle. Later in the film, the bushman is imprisoned. Through the scene in court, the director clearly shows modern man's willingness not to understand a strange culture: as far as the bushman is concerned, animals are free and to be eaten, however he does not understand he has broken the law when he shot a farmer's lamb. As in most cases in the past, the court sentences him immediately, without trying to comprehend his notions of communing with nature. This is brought to light at the very beginning through the narrator's voice: "modern man, however, has spent most of his time adapting his surroundings to him".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful movie. It is gentle, romantic, and humorous. It is very dated by todays standards, but this does not detract from the glorious wildlife, or the storytelling.As the movie starts, one feels that this is another a wildlife documentary, and the cut-scenes of the Big City seem to be very disconnected, however you soon find yourself becoming drawn in... Essentially, the film is three stories intertwined: Xixo returning the gift of the gods, Andrew Steyn's attempt at romancing Kate Thompson, and the revolutionist Sam Boga...The film is also much beloved by Land Rover aficionados around the world for The Anti-Christ: the land rover of the hapless Andrew Steyn.</fullReview>

Wandering to the edge of the earth, in order to return this gift, he (and we) see the beauty of the landscape, the animals, the people of Africa. The photography shows us how awesome Africa must be.This film has excitement, adventure and a love story that is both funny and refreshing.

		<shortDescription>an interesting perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Gods Must Be Crazy" is basically two stories that end up colliding. On the one hand, Kalahari Bushman Xixo (N!xau) brings a Coke bottle to his village, and its presence proceeds to wreak havoc. On the other hand, South African reporter Kate Thompson (Sandra Prinsloo) goes to Botswana as a teacher, to account for the teacher shortage there; little does she know that a revolution is brewing. While Xixo is taking the Coke bottle to the "edge of the world", his world will eventually cross paths with Kate's.Obviously, it now sort of eats at us that they refer to white people as "civilized man". But overall, the movie does a good job showing what can happen when Western culture is introduced to an indigenous society. I guess that the bad luck often befalling Andrew Steyn (Marius Weyers) was just sort of thrown in for comic relief, but you can't not like it.</fullReview>

There are dashes of humorous moments, but the thing that makes this movie clever is the 3 plots that are ongoing bring themselves together at the end of the movie. The editing of the movie has it's odd moments. There are parts that are intentionally sped up which give it a vaudeville feel and then there are random skips in the film that leave you wondering if it was done on purpose or if someone just doesn't know how to edit films!

		<fullReview>And when the number 8:27 comes up it's time to write a movie review...Many critics seemed to see the basic premise of the film as a conflict between the "good" natural state of the bushman and the "bad" civilized state of the city dwellers and revolutionaries.To me, it's more of a comment (and a pretty badly dubbed comment at that!) on the inherent comedy of culture conflict that proceeds from the completely arbitrary nature of ALL cultures. It's no funnier (or just as funny, depending on how you look at it) that a bushman doesn't "get" the nature of a car, than it is that a city dweller doesn't "get" the nature of a fire-stomping rhino or a wait-a-bit bush.And you can play with the nature of god, if you like. Perhaps that ten commandments thing was just a "coke bottle of the gods" something wrapped around something that actually was important - at least to the gods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great satire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1980, The Gods Must Be Crazy is apparently a classic. I watched the movie because it was supposed to be one of the best satirical creations ever made. For me, the movie didn't live up to its billing, but then maybe my expectations were a tad too high.Set in Africa, The Gods Must Be Crazy is the story of a bushman, a scientist, a schoolteacher and a gang of guerillas. The bushman's family ? devoid of any knowledge about the existence of a world outside theirs ? discovers a bottle of Coca-Cola. The bottle comes in handy while performing a number of their tasks and they end up fighting over it. Proclaiming that the bottle is evil, the bushman decides to go to the corner of the earth and throw it away. Meanwhile, a schoolteacher comes to work in Botswana, South-Central Africa. Her paths cross with a scientist who is preparing a thesis on the animals in Africa but is woefully cumbersome around women. The scientist instantly falls in love with the schoolteacher, who takes him to be a clumsy idiot out to take advantage of her. Adding to the mix is a gang of insurgents (two of whom want to do nothing else but play cards) running away from the police. The movie tracks their advancement towards the culmination, where they all end up facing each other. The Gods Must Be Crazy does have its bit of humour and satire, but only in sporadic bursts. The story begins very well, with a comparison between the nomad's life and life in a city. In fact, the start is so good that I was almost grinning and rubbing my hands in anticipation for more. Sadly, the middle part got a bit boring. And the end a bit obvious.That said, there were a few scenes and sequences that did crack me up. The scientist's clumsiness at different times was hilarious. So were the actions scenes involving the guerillas. And the interactions between the bushman and other civilized people. I definitely recommend it as a Sunday evening watch at home.

		<fullReview>This movie certainly has some unique comical situations, like that jeep suspended high up in a tree, and of course we all know why and how it got there. I enjoyed the beginning of the story as much as anyone else when I first saw it. However, there were moments when I felt most uncomfortable and could see no humor whatever in the handful of very violent shooting scenes, not to mention when a victim was almost tossed out of a helicopter; very little to laugh about when people are killed or threatened, so that was a sensitive point for me. And the burly bearded leader looked to me for all the world to be a carbon copy of Terreblanche, a real life Afrikaans rebel who years later was jailed.I tend to agree with N!xau who in later years said he was disappointed that after the film created much success for some, very little was done for bettering the lives of his people. It seems they were just made use of for the entertainment of others, which is rather sad, I feel.Although the romantic attraction of Andrew (Marius Weyers) and Kate (Sandra Prinsloo) got off to a rocky start (a rock included, under the jeep tire at their first meeting! no brakes unfortunately), eventually when Kate is in plenty of trouble Andrew is there to rescue her, with a lot of assistance from Xixo who knows just what to do.It's a very amusing movie, highly original too, but rather lacking in social conscience in a few instances. Having said all that, I still like to watch it when I can.</fullReview>

The theme simply is how a simple thing from modern life, changes the life of these tribe people dramatically, and what they think about modern life and people. The movie shows the simple life of these tribe people and makes us think is the civilization we leave in, is really better than theirs? The movie starts with explaining our day to day life as can be seen from the creatures from another planet. Then it shows the life of these African tribe people, their thinking about the god, the world, and the things which are new for them. Then the stories of people from different part of the world begins, and these stories are mixed with each other. The main characters are the tribesman who is on extra-ordinary voyage to the end of the world, a forest officer who is in love with the school teacher, an young lady who is frustrated with her daily work in modern civilization and is now a teacher in a remote village, and a terrorist who wants to cross the border. Their stories gets mixed in natural and most hilarious ways. This is the must watch movie, for all. This movie according to me must get a rating above 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gods Must Be Crazy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I first saw this in South Africa years ago, and tried up until 2001 to get a copy. We managed to obtain a VHS copy of both of them and loved watching them many times. My Brother in law came over for a visit last year, and gave us both movies as a present on DVD. watching them both brings back so many happy times of growing up in the Velt. Jamie Uys portrays the movie in a way for the whole family to watch, and putting the goofs aside, we enjoyed seeing the movie again and again. The National Geographic channel showed them in 2004 and Sky have them on their on demand package online. Watch these movies and maybe gain an incite to the Bushmans life and lets now hope we don't make the same mistake as we did in America and Austrailia with their proud populations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has it all: It has its funny and clumsy moments (comedy), it's a love story (love), There are thugs committing murder and , kidnapping (drama), (and best of all ) it's even a social commentary. It makes us think "Are we better off with all our modern technologies". And of course we are! Keep in mind that the star of the film DIED from tuberculosis of all things, which of course could be easily treated with modern medicines. But thats OK too.We have lived on earth for over four and a half million years and we have done OK , right? Although sometimes we wish we could just forget about life and work for awhile and keep things simple and basic! This movie has it all my friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innocence meets Benny Hill-esquire slapstick in a very sweet film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedy is an art that can take many forms, and can be seen more places than more or less any other. Almost anywhere you search, you may find it by looking closely. Many would argue that slapstick reminiscent of the late Benny Hill isn't the greatest expression of the comedic arts, but it's difficult to dispute that it's one that anyone understands(if not everyone will find it funny). Here, that type of humor is meshed(and with quite good results) with the innocence of Bushmen who have never seen modern society. There are three story lines; following Xixo, a Bushman who has technology thrust upon him in the form of an object common in civilization, Andrew Steyn, a young man who works in Botswana(where the whole film is set) and a malevolent man fighting the government. These story lines run parallel each other very well, and the overall plot is rather good, for the production. The pacing is relatively even, and the movie neither moves too fast nor too slowly. The comedy is almost all in the form of the slapstick, and there is occasional cleverness in the dialog. It all goes together well, and makes for a very funny movie. The innocence and the general tone of the film makes it very sweet(without being sappy), and though few will make the claim that it is an unpredictable piece, it's a nice little film, one to take your mind off bad things and just relax(in-between the laughing). An inexpensive movie that doesn't look cheap. The humor is very well balanced; it never tries too hard, and it is almost invariably successful at getting the laughs. Seeing Xixo be introduced to modern conveniences, and respond with the naiveté(which is perfectly accentuated by the narrator) is heartening, and watching how he adapts to it is a testament to human ingenuity. A simple film, but one that can be watched by just about anyone at any time. The slapstick does get a little violent at times, but it's cartoon-y violence(think Tom and Jerry). It shows little actual consequence of violent actions... for better or for worse. I recommend this to any fan of slapstick and physical comedy. Very good for what it is. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's not the funniest movie ever, and i can understand why some people got disappointed having expected a good comedy, but it's sweet, thoughtful, with a clean kind of humour. I don't find it really very funny, but it's touching and unusual. I got carried away by the atmosphere of Africa, and was utterly surprised to see money handed to the bushman. money seemed so strange and unnecessary, so in contrast with the natural simplicity of bushmen lives, the beautiful landscapes, the calmness and deep truthfulness of living so close to nature, in love and agreement, without racing for money and power. For me the movie emphasizes the following - we live once, nobody has yet proved there will be another life, why hunger for money or power, why try to get much more than you need, why kill other human beings in search for power - look at the bushman. watch him smiling and relax :) May we all have a bottle of coke the worst thing in our lives - no war, no murders, no unhappiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gods Must Have Gone Crazy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly I thought that "The Gods Must Have Gone Crazy" was actually a good movie. When I first started watching this movie I didn't have high expectations for it. I thought that it was just going to be one of those low budget independent documentaries that my English teacher was going to make me watch that wasn't very entertaining. But I was pleasantly surprised. Even though the beginning of the movie started out a little slow and was a little confusing because of the multiple stories going on. I over all thought that this movie was laugh out loud hilarious. It showed a comical exaggerated representation of how people view different customs and cultures.During this movie there are three different stories taking place all at the same time where in the end they all collide together. First there is a bushman from the Kalahari Desert whose tribe that had never had any conflict with each other, until they came upon a glass coke bottle that had fell out of the sky. In which they believe was a gift from God. They found many uses for the bottle. But there was only one so sharing brought many arguments and disagreements. Finally one of the bushman named Xixo decided that he was going to throw the bottle off the edge of the Earth. So he began a journey to the edge of the earth. While at the same time Andrew Steyn, a scientist studying elephant feces is picking up the new school teacher, Kate Thompson from a bus stop as a favor to a friend. Meanwhile a group of terrorist is on the loose, running from the government officials while shooting and bombing helicopters. Ultimately all three of these diverse stories collide together even when you thought that they never could be related to each other. Nevertheless you'll just have to watch this movie to find out how they all fit together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the Fence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Gods Must Be Crazy is a slapstick-style comedy making fun of basically every type of race involved in the film. The film depicts a fantasy-like picture of life for the !Kung people in Africa. To most, the film may be nothing but a comedy. For other, educated viewers, the movie may seem slightly offensive. Included in the DVD package of the film is a small documentary about the actor playing the part of the main character, Xixu. After watching the film, and then viewing the documentary, I didn't find the movie to be quite as funny. In fact, I now am rather on the fence about the picture the movie paints for the uneducated audience which more than likely makes up the majority of movie-goers in the United States. It is this gross misrepresentation that can sometimes cause more harm than just providing a good laugh. Comedy is used as an outlet in our Western societies; however, it can sometimes go too far and lead people into believing that, for example, the life of the !Kung people in Africa is carefree and full of ignorance concerning "civilized" life. Although the movie was enjoyable and did bring me to laugh at times, I still find it to be dangerous for encouraging the wrong ideas of how life in Africa really is for the !Kung people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gods Must be Crazy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great South African comedy. I enjoyed the plot line of the bushman's journey to take the bottle back to the Gods at the end of the Earth. This film poked fun at every group it portrayed but it was very mild. The portrayal of the bushman Xi, was artistically done but there were differences in the reality of the life of the San people. This film used narration to translate the language of the San. This had great comedy value but subtitles may have been a better avenue in order to hear the very foreign dialect of the Kung peoples. I found this film mildly biased towards the more "civilized" characters but I felt it was neither malicious nor intended. The film portrayed Xi as simple yet he was a moral man who was doing what was right for his family and along the way learned had great comic encounters with the "Gods". I'll give this film 6 of 10 stars. I really enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this film, the only word that comes to mind is "entertaining". Throughout the whole film I found myself laughing at the slapstick situation and the mocking the lack of coordination between Western culture and traditional African culture. I felt that the documentary style commentary was a highlight. I didn't see it as an offensive slam against the !Kung culture, but instead a highlight on the satire of how the West views Africans, like uncivilized people. Through out the film, the !Kung people were portrayed as naive and primitive and some aspects of the film didn't add up to the reality of how the !Kung people live, which took away from the overall credibility. The huts and lack of social interactions, for instance, were inconsistent compared to reality.Overall I didn't find this movie to be extremely racist. Although it pokes fun at both Whites and Africans, it does it in a manner that is light hearted and playful. The true !Kung language is used and the people are able to sustain themselves throughout the film. On the other hand, the Western whites are seen as goofy and uptight. The language of the !Kung people, although was not subtitled, was still an authentic language, not just clicks and noise, which added to my thinking it was not a racist movie. I think that both of the "downfalls" of each society of overplayed and emphasized for comedic sake. Because of it's goofy and slapstick humor, this film is accessible to almost anyone, whether or not they are familiar with African culture or not. It would be helpful, however, to be aware of what was going on in the world during this time period. Understanding the time period would be key in explaining why the terrorist was a Russian. Overall, I was enjoyed this film and would suggest it to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gods Must Be Crazy is a very interesting film showing the adventures of Xi, a member of the Kalahari !Kung tribe, through various points of view. By showing the events through different perceptions, director Jamie Uys creates what seems to be unintentional humor by using stereotypes. The stereotypes that make this slapstick humor creates a great way for Uys to show the cultural differences between the Kalahari !Kung and Europeans.The premise of this movie is following of Xi in his adventure to rid his people of the "evil thing" (a coke bottle). Throughout his journey, Xi runs into the characters of the other sub-stories, a clumsy scientist, a school teacher, and a terrorist. Jamie Uys shows several different stereotypes using these characters and their interactions. These stereotypes included the damsel in distress, the unsuspecting hero, and the failing bad guy. Seeing Xi's reactions to different scenarios is absolutely hilarious. His reactions to seeing the school teacher dressing, and his first encounter with a car a great example of the stereotypes that Uys uses to show these cultural differences.The events that Jamie Uys has Xi go through seem to be ridiculous if not ignorant. Since most Europeans don't know much about Africa and its culture, one can only assume what this movie portrays is accurate. Uys adds to these stereotypes be having an Englishman voice over the !Kung language rather than subtitles giving a feel that !Kung are less superior than Europeans. I don't find this movie to be racist at all but rather an accurate portrayal of different cultures interactions with each other through different points of view. Jamie Uys does a great job of using this slapstick humor to show the stereotypes. Overall this was a very good movie. It did an accurate job showing typical stereotypes through the eyes of different cultures without being racist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie if you don't think too much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Gods Must be Crazy" is a film about a member of the !Kung, Xi, and his experiences with technology. The movie is not very factual and would not be good for someone looking to get an accurate interpretation of !Kung life. Xi's life is portrayed as easy and carefree, when in reality the !Kung have to struggle everyday just to keep from starving. The !Kung are also seen as reluctant to accept new technology and the movie shows how even the slightest technological advance, like a coke bottle, corrupts and ruins !Kung life. This could not be further from the truth. At the end of the film there is a special feature called "Journey to Nyae Nyae" that shows how eager the !Kung are to experience and play with this new technology.The movie is not meant to be a documentary, only a simple comedy. The actors were chosen very well for their parts. It is a very charming movie and you fall in love with some of the characters easily. There are the traditional dim-witted man, the damsel in distress, the strong, handsome man, the "magical" natives, and the Russian terrorist. These are not meant to be offensive stereotypes, only humorous ones. So if you like slapstick comedy and can sit down and watch a movie without thinking about how accurately it portrays everything, I definitely recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gods Must Be Crazy is a movie which I had never heard much of, before watching it, and still have not heard much about it since viewing the film. That being said I didn't have the highest expectations for the film. I had heard things about how it was very funny and that even Comedy Central had aired it before, but the latter wasn't as impressive to me, since they do show some movies that aren't hilarious but are comedic. I viewed this film with these preconceived notions, which can make it hard sometimes to find the film enjoyable, but even with those factors working against me when viewing the film, I thoroughly enjoyed it and actually audibly laughed at most of the comedic parts.The film has three different stories going on at the same time. One is of the !Kung Native or "Bushman" who has to get rid of a Coca-Cola Bottle because it has only brought trouble to his village. One story is of an academic, who is studying animals in the African wilderness. He develops a crush on a woman who is coming to teach the school children in the village that he lives in. And the third, and most absurd story, is of the terrorists who are attempting to overthrow the government.For most of the film these three stories are told side by side and there isn't much intertwining of the three different tales. This all changes near the end of the film. The three stories become one and all the different plot lines come together. That being said you can see some very good character development throughout the film. Xi, the Bushman, becomes a very simple and un-paradoxical person. You know what his true purpose is and he doesn't have any motives other than ones that are stated by the white voice-over. Mr. Steyn, the Academic is a more complicated person, he has his duty to be honorable to the woman, he is in love with, but he seems to screw everything up when he is around her. Even with all of his book smarts he still doesn't know the first thing about women. And the Russian Terrorist is the villain of the whole film but he is also the comic relief of the film.I had quite a bit of trouble identifying a hero, when looking at all the characters but the villain, and it seems to me that depending on how you look at this film will determine who you believe is the hero. If you look at the film as that Xi is the hero of his village because he gets rid of the evil Coca-Cola Bottle then he is the hero but if you look at Mr. Steyn as the hero because he saves the day from the terrorists and he gets the girl, then you can consider him as the hero.Regardless of some of the complicated nature of the Character structures you can see very common characters throughout the film. Xi is the typical character that has a connection with the earth or some sort of magical power and can help other main characters with his abilities. Mr. Steyn is the typical smart guy who can't seem to get the girl. And the Russian Terrorist is the typical villain even sharing the same traits as most villains do by being fat, mean, and lazy. The actions of the characters seem to be very similar to the actions of characters you can see in almost every other story. This being said, this universal medium of the same character types makes this film that much easier to associate with and results in a very enjoyable viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Gods Must Be Crazy", written and directed by Jamie Uys, is a delightful comedy that documents the journey of Xi, a member of the Kalahari !Kung tribe, and the various people that he encounters on his journey to the end of the world. "The Gods Must Be Crazy" is unique in the fact that it dances along the line of racism, but manages not to overtly offend by incorporating splashes of slapstick comedy, reminiscent of the Three Stooges, and by poking equal fun at all of the people groups portrayed in this tale of the intersection of cultures."The Gods Must Be Crazy" brings to light the drastic culture differences, all be it somewhat inaccurately, of the !Kung of Botswana, and their city-bound South African counterparts. Uys', tale crosses into the camp of subtle racism when he chooses to portray the !Kung as animal-like by using a National Geographic style narration to interpret their words and actions. This choice not only kept the viewer from more readily enjoying the beautiful rhythm of the !Kung language, but it also had a somewhat dehumanizing impact on the viewer's impression of the !Kung. Despite over-simplifications of the !Kung way of life, Uys' film is generally appreciable for bringing to light some of the problems that cultures face when they do not take the time to understand one another. Uys depicts these problems somewhat lightheartedly by poking fun at the political unrest in Botswana and neighboring nations; and in a more serious manner when Xi is sent to jail for killing a farmer's goat by a court that does not have the time to understand the cultural gap that keeps Xi from understanding the error of his ways."The Gods Must Be Crazy" has a little something for everyone, as it incorporates the universal themes of love between a man and a woman, faithfulness toward a cause and a people, a dash of adventure, and physical, slapstick comedy to remind each of us to take this tale as just that, a piece of fiction. Despite a few lapses into a somewhat racist point of view, "The Gods Must Be Crazy" is to be recommended to all audiences as a comedy that humorously brings to light the strange nature of all of ways, !Kung, South African, and North American alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not produced and advertised like a world renowned film, it was about cultural differences and the encounters they had along the way. It could be considered an action film, but for the most part human interaction and the trouble that follows it. The movie begins with a Coke bottle and ends with a Coke bottle. The main character, Xi a native to South Africa, and leader of the Bush Tribe, has the task of throwing an evil Coke bottle off the end of the Earth.The movie continues as Xi makes his journey to the end of the earth, he encounters many people. The story is told from Xi by a narrator, in such a funny way that the American people just aren't used to. Another character that Xi comes across is a biologist that is extremely clumsy, the way the two men interact is great, considering there cultural differences. The film is not made in the American fashion, but it is a good different, many scenes are so funny you can't help but laugh, while not taking anything away from the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gods Must be Crazy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jamie Uys' The Gods Must be Crazy is a wonderful film from the 80's about Western influence in Africa and the many ways it affects the Ju/oa'nsi or "harmless people" as their name translates. It begins with a documentary feel but quickly transitions into action filled events. It shows how the West has impacted other areas of Africa thanks to modernization and influence.The movie has three different stories. The first and most important is about Xi, who finds a Coke bottle that dropped from the sky. It causes serious problems for his people so they decide it must be taken to the end of the earth. Xi starts on his trip to get rid of the bottle and he meets other characters along the way. There is the bumbling, shy, male scientist who has to take a pretty, female, city reporter to her new job as a teacher in a small village. The scientist's assistant is one of my favorite characters, and he supplies the hugely important task of translation. The third story involves terrorists and their inept behaviors.The film has silly slapstick humor with typical stereotypes. The scenes showing the civilized city were hilarious. This is a good, enjoyable movie that endears the viewer to Xi. He is a simple, good, and honest Ju/oa'nsi with a wonderful smile. The scenery is magnificent, and learning about Xi's people was one of my favorite parts. I loved hearing the beautiful !Kung language, but I would have liked a little more translation.The life of the Ju/oa'nsi is portrayed as simple and easy. The people, in reality, struggle to survive from day to day. The movie also states that the Ju/oa'nsi have no contact with other groups, but they do meet with others regularly. Most of the other portrayals of Xi's people are accurate. They do eat roots and use poison arrows. The quality of film work is not the best, but no matter; the movie is wonderful.I recommend this to anyone not only for entertainment and pleasure, but to take a look at some of the smaller impacts the West has had on Africa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it was an older movie, I really enjoyed "The Gods must be Crazy" when I recently watched it. I think the movie would probably fall in the comedy genre and I found myself laughing and I didn't know why. The movie used people from Africa who spoke in their language and I think that was a plus for this film. As a result I believed what was happening in the film, I knew the movie wasn't just a bunch of struggling actors in a studio. This movie was done in Africa by the people of Africa. One thing I did not think worked for the movie was the conflict with the terrorists. I thought this might just be something to laugh about and move on but they kept coming up in the movie. The conflict with the terrorists was approached as a comical poke at African politics but I didn't understand why the director kept going back to the terrorist conflict with no intent to resolve it. However, it is possible this may be resolved in "The Gods Must be Crazy 2".If had I seen this movie prior to taking my African literature class I would have l found no problems with this movie. I felt the movie promoted stereotypes of African San people. The movie showed them as naive individuals that don't' know anything about the world. The narrator of the movie states the San live in one place their whole lives and will probably never meet anyone outside of their group, both statements of which are false. The movie's European narrator made me feel like I was watching a special on National Geographic. Knowing what I know about the San people I felt the movie didn't portray accurately the San of the Kalahari. It seemed apparent that this wasn't important to the minds behind this movie because the story of the San was eventually overshadowed by the "boy meets girl" story line. Someone who has knowledge of African politics and/or African culture would like this movie. Although if you are not well versed in the events of Africa you would still enjoy this movie. I think this movie is timeless and I would definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Three Stooges, Benny Hill, slapstick humor at its best. Writer/Director Jamie Uys must have been a fan. He put a South African spin on the genre that makes it his own. The story follows three plot lines that come together in the end producing a hilarious trot through the African wilderness.The story begins with the bushman of the Kalahari Desert (the !Kung) where we meet our first unlikely hero named Xi. His people discover a mysterious object from the gods (a coke bottle dropped from an airplane) that causes mischief throughout the band. Xi leaves on a quest to return the object to the gods before it can cause anymore trouble.The next of our heroes is the bumbling academic Mr. Styne who studies the animals in the wilderness by collecting and analyzing dung. And in the presence of women, our poor hero not only has trouble speaking, he has trouble with just about everything else as well.Enter the fair maiden of the film, Ms. Thompson, a reporter turn teacher who ends up the object of Mr. Styne's desire. With any maiden, she will end up needing to be rescued from a villain. The villain in this case is a Russian and his gang being pursued for trying to assassinate the President.Writer/Director Jamie Uys does a good job in intertwining the three plot lines taking us on a fun journey. For me, I kept wanting to see more of Xi and his journey with the coke bottle. Some people have suggested that this movie is racist. I don't see it as over-the-top racism. If there is any racism it would have to be subtle, such as the "National Geographic" style narration used in scenes with the !Kung peoples normally reserved for exotic wildlife. Subtitles of their language would have been nice as well. But it is hard to tell if Uys was using that style to prove a point, just to be different, or actually saw the !Kung in that light.Overall, I really like this movie. I still remember when it was shown all the time on Showtime in the 80's but haven't watched it in nearly 20 years. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of slapstick humor. This film may not be liked to much by the younger generation due to lack of special effects and hot babes, but I loved it?again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remembered renting this movie from our local video store with my mom when I was a little kid and when I first watched it with my parents, I laughed so hard I've found myself rolling on the ground, prompting my mom to tell me to contain myself.In this South African film, things start off interesting when an African bushman named Xi (N!xau) in the Kalahari desert discovers a discarded Coke bottle, which fell from the sky, thinking it was from the Gods. It was interesting to see how these primitive people utilize their new modern find as Xi takes it back to his village, where they use it for many tasks. The intrigue starts when the villagers begin fighting over it, prompting Xi to set off on a journey with the bottle to find an appropriate place to dispose of it. Along the way, he bumps into traveling school teacher Kate Thompson (Sandra Prinsloo) and bumbling biologist Marius Weyers (Andrew Steyn), and stumbles upon a plot by a despotic revolutionary.The three leading actors gave off a lot of physical comedy, from Xi's surprised and confused expressions as he spots and try to learn how to utilize new modern things like driving a car, to the awkward chemistry between Kate Thompson and Marius Weyers. Them getting themselves entangled in the revolutionary plot became a good guy vs. bad guy subplot and provided a lot of exciting adventure and action that will sure captivate an audience.Jamie Uys did a great job in writing and directing this movie. He carefully assimilated the primitive village with the modern world, and what resulted is non-stop fun, laughter and entertainment.Grade A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable film, but is it that funny?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I received this film on DVD I became very excited about watching it. "The Gods Must Be Crazy," is described as a hilarious comedy, very cheerful and making fun of us civilized humans (compared to Bushmen living very simply out in the African bush). However, I was just that very slight bit disappointed. Yes, there were funny bits in it, but it was not really a "funny film". It was very upsetting, it has a great deal of violence and shooting (from the war in south Africa around the time of the film being made). There are very disturbing scenes here which may upset certain viewers. The humour consists of a great deal of un-funny slapstick, or at least slapstick which I did not find funny. However, there is some very good verbal humour in this film, the acting is excellent (especially of N!xau) and the location is amazing. The whole idea of the film is incredibly clever as well and very original (at least for the time anyway)."The Gods Must Be Crazy" starts with a narrator introducing us to a tribe of bushmen. He tells us how the bushmen live, how they survive blady blah (with clips of bushmen). Then he goes on to tell us about modern man and the way their lives are so complicated and weird compared to the bushmens' (with clips of Johannesberg). Then a plot emerges in the film, which begins with a bottle of cola and what the bushmen do with it...I recommend this to people who like a mixture of slapstick and satire humour and to people who can stand violence in a film as long as comedy is intertwined. Enjoy "The Gods Must Be Crazy"! :-) 7 and a half out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All and all I thought this movie was a rather good flick. It starts out with the narrator talking about the "people of the bush", or the !Kung people. These people live in South Africa, and live of the land. This also is where the movie is filmed. The Kung are rather simple people as the movie puts it. After finding a coke bottle that was dumped by a pilot of a plane, The Kung seemed to become possessive of it, and felt the feeling of greed. The leaders of the Kung decided it would be best to get rid of the bottle by throwing it off of the end of the earth. This is how the storyline starts.In this film there is also 2 other main stories going along with the bushman's journey. There is the story of the crazy wildlife/field journalist, and the story of the crazy terrorist. Every person in this movie plays his or her part to the complete extreme, and this is where the comedy comes in. It is a rather funny story, but you must be able to get over a sense of racism that is shown towards the Kung. By not subtitling their conversations we are basically left to think that they are wild people with no purpose in life.This film had a very unique storyline and plot, and this creativeness paid off. We can tell this because it became a fairly popular film in the US. The characters in the movie were surprisingly funny if you can deal with slapstick comedy constantly. Like I stated earlier, the actors seemed to take each of their roles to the extreme with personally I think made this movie. After viewing this movie I would give it a 6 out of 10. Its worth seeing if you have the itch for older funny movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY is a South African movie, filmed in Botswana, charting the misadventures of a scientist and a bushman as they are forced to team up to fight the fight against some evil revolutionary types. The film is notable for featuring a naturalistic performance from N!xau, who is the real deal and who appeared in a further four movies after his new-found fame here.This is a slapstick comedy for the most part and for the most part it works very well. It is slapdash and unfocused in places, but in terms of location authenticity you can't get much better than this. N!xau only has a supporting role but he possesses a kind of natural charisma so you can see why he won the acclaim, even though he speaks in his unsubtitled language throughout.Most of the comedy comes from the shenanigans of Marius Weyers, playing the scientist type. A lot of the humour is dumb and lowbrow, but it's also very funny, like the bit in the schoolroom or all the scenes involving the long-suffering jeep. The action set-piece climax is very well achieved and rounds off what is a completely unique and inventive production. I look forward to seeing the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tonight, On a Very Special Comedy about Coke?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, The Gods Must Be Crazy (TGMBC) isn't just about (a) Coke (bottle.) But, it certainly pushed things into place.The very first time, and only other time, I've seen this before last night, was in first run theatres, which had to be in 1984 when I was 10. My father took me to see this, and even though a lot of it went over my head, what stuck with me was his deep laughter throughout the entire feature. And it was contagious; I was laughing hard, because he was. I was having a great time, like he was.Fast forward, nearly 30-years later, to my follow-up viewing. Wow. This was hard to get through. Now, that said, it is funny, and purely innocent ? it's almost 100% slapstick comedy and basically G, if not for the native nudity. Also, despite the incredibly low budget, it was inventive and obscenely original.I say it was a chore to watch again ? and I probably will never see this another time, due to the pacing and age. The movie was made on/around 1980 and definitely did it broadcast that year. TGMBC took so long to get through and was not a short movie as it probably could've been.Well, TGMBC did insert many story lines that VERY nicely came together. Even with small resources, the many stories and characters did intrigue me. It was so 1930s screwball comedy, but with a non-typical setting (Africa) and unknown actors.TGMBC tells the tale(s) of a 100% isolated African Bushman who must rid his tribe of a Coke® bottle that the Bushmen wrongfully thought was a gift from their gods when it was merely thrown out of a passing plane. He takes it upon himself to take the eventually labeled: "evil" object to the edge of the Earth and drop it off. Which, I guess, means they still believe the Earth's flat?Meanwhile, renegades invade the land and a poop-specialist, a school teacher and the government gets involved to take down said rebels. I literally summed up an almost two-hour comedy, but it's more fun to watch how all these stories intersect and pan out.Only?the core of the screenplay, that faithful, "bad" Coke® bottle's own story kinda gets the rush treatment in the end. Perhaps, because they ran out of what little funds they had??Obviously, it's not to be taken seriously ? it is slapstick comedy all-around, after all. But, it is interesting enough with the Out-of-America setting and multiple story lines that were very well crafted. In addition, the narrator, which I loved by the way, tells many interesting stories and thoroughly educates me on the land, culture and animals I am unfamiliar with.And finally, the lead Bushman, Xi, or Xixo depending on who you trust, was awesome in this. A perfect performance, and stand by that.I would recommend The Gods Must Be Crazy with the recommendation that you know what you're getting yourself into.</fullReview>

Jamie Uys paid N!xau a few hundred dollars for his role that made this movie. N!xau did get better pay in the sequels, but died of multiple-drug-resistant tuberculosis. I guess he was not a SAG member. Truly a disgrace this man was not treated better. To make several successful movies and not get medical care? With all the causes Hollywood pushes with their star power I do not understand why this man was left in the conditions he lived.

		<fullReview>Years ago I caught this film on cable television, and watched about twenty minutes of it before switching off. I thought it was the biggest pile of rubbish that I'd ever seen, what with speeded up Keystone Cops slapstick in just about every scene, and a guy in a Rhino suit pretending to be the real thing. Add to that the documentary style narrative and you have, for me at the time, one of the worst films ever. But I've watched it just now and must say I was well wrong. I must have been in a bad mood or something, because the Gods Must Be Crazy is wonderful.A pilot flying over Botswana throws and empty coke bottle out of his window, and it ends up landing in a village of bushmen. Not knowing what it is, their leader, played by a real Bushman called N!Xau, finds many uses for it before it's usefullness inspires jealousy and envy. Now seeing it as an Evil Thing, he tries throwing it back to the Gods, whereupon of course gravity takes hold and it bounces off of his son's head. N!Xau then decides to head off to the edge of the world and throw it away.Meanwhile a Communist leader attempts a coup but fails, and the authorities chase him and his men into Botswana.Also meanwhile a South African gentleman and his mechanic are asked to pick up a white woman who wants to teach people in a nearby village. The things is, this guy (Mr Stane, I think his name was) gets very nervous in the company of women, and his jeep, dubbed the anti-Christ by the mechanic, doesn't help matters.All these elements come together, of course. N!Xau is arrested for killing a goat (he has no concept of ownership) and is only helped out by Mr Stane and the mechanic (who can speak N!Xau's language). While out in the wilderness working away, they spot, using a telescope, that the teacher and her pupils have been kidnapped by the Communist leader, who hopes he can make it out of the country while using them as hostages. Here, N!Xau knowledge of stalking comes into play.This movie is very odd, but also very entertaining and sometimes touching. You've got to envy N!Xau's simple life, and the bemused look on his face at the idiotic things people in the developed world do is a wonder to behold. So is his language, a series of clicks mixed with spoken words. You get used to the speeded up sequences (Keystone cops rocket launcher attack?) and it becomes clear that there is some genuine humour behind all the slapstick. The scene at the end when N!Xau throws the bottle away in silent contemplation is a cracker (yes - he does find the end of the world, sort of). He must be the least neurotic film character I've ever seen.Highly daft and slightly cheesy, with great cinematography (which was probably missing all those years before DVD), you come away from this film feeling a lot better, which doesn't happen often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While flying over a desert in Africa a careless pilot throws out a Coke bottle. It's found by a tribe of happy innocent Bushmen (they think it's a gift from the gods)...but starts causing them trouble. One of the tribe called Xi (N!hau) takes the bottle away to throw it off the end of the world. Also white microbiologist Steyn (Marius Weyers) tries to court a beautiful schoolteacher (Sandra Prinsloo)...but he's unbelievably clumsy. Then there's the evil thief and his gang...This was unreleased in the U.S. until 1984 and became a BIG cult movie and a sizable hit. It's far from perfect however. It's badly directed, has horrendous dubbing (I've seen Godzilla movies with better!) and has some bad jokes. But the story moves quick, there is some truly funny slapstick involving the characters and the movie has an innocent feeling to it. I can't quite explain it but it makes you FEEL good! It's also perfect for the whole family. There is some casual nudity and minor violence but nothing that will bother anyone. It's a light, charming, very sweet and (again) innocent movie. Yeah, it has its debits but it's still worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cute little story that is easy to like despite its many flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering how much money this movie made internationally, you would expect it to be a lot better than it is. Now I am not saying it's a bad film--but to have earned as much as it did, you'd expect a brilliant film and "The Gods Must Be Crazy" is not brilliant. At times, it is very clever. However, many other times the film is a bit limp. Fortunately, the good well outweighs the bad.The film begins with the bushmen of the Kalihari enjoying their peaceful nomadic lives. However, when a coke bottle inadvertently tossed out of a passing airplane lands among them, it causes all kinds of serious problems. As these simple people know nothing of the outside world, they think the airplane if from the gods--and the bottle must be a gift from them. But, when the people all begin to fight over this gift because they ALL wish to possess it (in a tribe where all possessions had previously been communal), Xi decides he must walk to the edge of the world to toss it back to the gods. And so, this simple man begins a long trek which brings him into the middle of some dopey South Africans and some revolutionaries.The film's plot certainly is unique and the narration is clever in this early portion of the film. The problem is that when the film does not focus on the bushmen, it bogs down. The portion with the revolutionaries is rather irrelevant and, oddly, slapstick. And the South African man and woman generally play everything for laughs--which means even more very broad slapstick. And, when I say broad, I am talking too obvious and lacking subtlety. Much of the time, it looks a lot like a Three Stooges film. Fortunately, when Xi and his folks are on camera, the humor is MUCH more gentle and clever. I just wish more of the film had centered on them.In some ways I could see people interpreting the film as very paternalistic in the way it portrays the black people in the film. While I can see this and know the film was made in South Africa during apartheid, I could also see someone looking past this as EVERYONE in the film is shown to be a bit stupid. In fact, while Xi and his people are ignorant of the world, if you see the film, you also see that they seem to have an innate wisdom even the white folks in the film lack. Charming but very flawed.By the way, is the rhino in the film real?! It didn't look it and I can't see how the film could have been made with a real one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This absurdly popular South African comedy offers little more than a gentle slapstick poke at civilization, following a chance encounter by an innocent Kalahari bushman with an empty Coca Cola bottle tossed from an airplane window. Believing it to be property of the Gods, he decides to walk "to the edge of the world" and throw the mystic talisman off, encountering along the way enough subplots to fill three separate films. Director Jamie Uys isn't above getting laughs by having his characters slip on banana peels, but elsewhere he shows a fertile comic imagination, even if his ideas are occasionally spoiled by crippling miscalculations: silly, speeded up photography; poor dubbing; a TV sit-com music score; and irrelevant voice-over narration, constantly belaboring the obvious. But it's a difficult film to dislike: the jokes are too good-natured, and the large cast of characters all too well equipped with human frailties.</fullReview>

Just shut your hole and let me enjoy what movies I like!Having said that, I really tried to like this movie. I have seen this movie more than I've seen some movies that I really liked. The first time I saw it, my friend's told me that it was by far, "the funniest movie since 'The Holy Grail'." That's a bold statement, considering the fact that I think 'The Holy Grail' is one of the funniest movies ever made...people just quote it too much. But that's not my point. I sat at "The God's Must Be Crazy" and didn't laugh once. Meanwhile the rest of the theater was roaring with laughter. I guess I was not in the mood for that type of humor that night.Fast forward five years. I'm at a video party and the movie they decide to watch is "The God's Must Be Crazy". I think to myself, "I really didn't like that movie, but maybe I will like it this time around." Sad to say, I didn't like it that time either.After seeing the movie for the fifth time, I finally decided that I would never understand this movie no matter how many times I see it.I really wanted to like this movie. I feel like I have one of the better sense of humors out there. I even laughed at Carrot Top once. I just don't get why I didn't find this movie even remotely funny, and yet the majority of the reviews state that this is the funniest movie ever made.Don't take my advice for it. I'm a minority here. I just want someone to explain the humor that I missed from this "masterpiece".I will shut my hole now and let you go on liking this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A tribe of bushmen in the Kalahari desert live in isolation from the modern world. The hardest tools they use is bone or wood. They don't even have rock. One day a flying plane dropped an empty Coke bottle on the community. At first it is a God send, but then infighting and possessiveness in this communal living. The leader Xi (N!xau) tries to throw it back up to God, only to have it come back down. So he decides to walk to the edge of the world to cast off the evil object.I rewatch it recently after first watched it 2 decades ago. I'm surprised at how awkward, how unfunny, how unlikeable the movie is especially when Xi isn't on screen. The rebels and government forces are like keystone cops. The fact that they're almost all black just makes it so uncomfortable. Are we laughing at incompetent black people? I remember the guy opening and closing the gate being much funnier. Their comedy seems like weak slapsticks now.The best part of the movie is absolutely N!xau. When I first saw it, I found the whole Bushmen eye opening and so realistic. Today I realize that it was impossible for these people to be so isolated at that time. The whole idea that they don't even have rocks is just ridiculous. But N!xau is still the most compelling actor in this movie. The movie is 2 points better whenever he's on the screen.</fullReview>

He was also responsible for a couple sequels. So, if you love this film, Uys is the guy to give credit to (although he's dead now). As for me, I don't know, it seems over-hyped.The scenes with Xi the Bushman are well done, but there's a big focus on the explorer and his attraction to the teacher... which leads to the film's primary source of humor: a runaway truck and the man who keeps falling over, often in fast forward. Once or twice it might be funny, but it happens over and over again, and that's too much...You can check this film out if you want to see a satire about how silly the modern world might seem to a Bushman. But beyond that, it's a bit long and doesn't hold my interest as well as it should.</fullReview>

Of course, this being a comedy film I didn't learn much, but it was still an interesting movie.After seeing it, I can say that this is one of those films that may have been great for their time (in this case, the early 80's), but simply doesn't stand up to the modern films of today. Much of the humor is bland and unrealistically silly (intended for little kids), but other parts, such as the "evil Coca-Cola bottle" sequences are hilarious. Like, laugh-out-loud hilarious.Overall, this is movie is no Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but it manages to be pretty funny anyway. It may be worth the watch, depending on your comedic taste.</fullReview>

But for those of you with a few developed brain cells I would counsel against wasting an evening on this well intentioned but ultimately weak effort. However the film is in no way offensive or racist as some reviewers have suggested. In fact the characterization is extremely even handed with both black and white villains and heroes. The Bushmen tribe come out particularly well and we can but envy their simple and pure way of life that is beautifully captured in the film. Indeed not only is their way of life so beautiful but the very people are undoubtedly the most beautiful in the film and their inclusion brings a sparkle to what otherwise would be a mundane farce.</fullReview>

The filmmaker seems to imply that the Bushmen are ape-like in their primitive nature.Granted, in my youth I found this movie to be highly entertaining and amusing film to watch with my family, but in my old age I have come to the realization that there is more to this movie than meets the eye.That's all I have to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's get the preliminaries out of the way: The Gods Must Be Crazy is a funny movie. Taken as cinematic fluff, it's certainly enjoyable. The problem, however, is that it cannot be easily divorced of its problematic origins.To be blunt, it is a powerfully racist film, albeit not necessarily in the way you might expect. It uncritically embraces the idea of the "noble savage." While arguably better than the "bloodthirsty savage," it's still a condescending, patronizing stereotype. Intentionally or not, it reinforces the politics of apartheid by making the perverse argument that racial discrimination protects the discriminated group by removing them from the corrupting influence of civilization.Is it an enjoyable film? Does it succeed on technical merits alone? Yes on both counts. It's a well directed and well acted film. But it should not be embraced uncritically: it's an ideologically loaded and racially charged film. And we ignore that at our own peril.</fullReview>
