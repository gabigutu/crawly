		<shortDescription>O'Toole's Still Got It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I strongly suspect that Peter O'Toole, in his new film "Venus," plays a character not far removed from himself. This may prevent his performance from joining the ranks of some of his greatest cinematic achievements, since it probably didn't provide as much of a challenge to him, but that's not to say that he isn't marvelous in this film, and shouldn't be commended for taking on this brave and unflattering role so late in his career.In "Venus," O'Toole plays Maurice, a famous stage and screen actor pushing 90, who's struggling mightily to prevent his days from slipping into the routine loneliness of old age. He's on friendly terms with his wife (Vanessa Redgrave, who has a couple of wonderful moments in this film), who he walked out on years ago, but never sees his children, who haven't forgiven their father for deserting them. The time he doesn't spend at doctors' offices or willing himself to get out of bed every morning he spends with his cantankerous best friend, a fellow actor, reminiscing about their best roles.When the friend takes in his niece's sullen daughter as a live-in assistant, O'Toole immediately finds himself in love with her, or at least in love with the idea of her, and the two strike up an awkward, and at times most uncomfortable relationship of sorts.What distinguishes "Venus" from other stories like it is the nature of the central relationship. This is no sweet, chaste friendship a la "Lost in Translation." For one, the age difference here is much greater. But beyond that, the relationship between Maurice and his Venus is distinctly sexual. It's clear that Maurice would go as far as Venus will allow, which isn't far, but is far enough to have made me squirm a bit in my seat at moments. For her part, Venus uses her beauty, and her knowledge of Maurice's desire for her, to her advantage, receiving gifts in return for her "favors." The film establishes both Maurice and Venus as somewhat unsympathetic characters, which prevents the film from becoming too maudlin. But there's also a great reserve of kindness in both of them, and each enables that to come out in the other. In the end, each of these characters is a bit better off for having known the other."Venus" is slow moving, and it's not a profound film. But it is refreshingly free of pretense, and it provides one with the chance to see Peter O'Toole, one of my favorite actors, showing the world that he's still got it after all these years.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting Sans Botox</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that grows on you once the credits are done. Quickly paced, sharply written and deftly acted, Venus is a movie that unfolds so quickly that one is immersed in the action from the very start. The background is actors living off small pensions and acting jobs in working class London. The cinematography catches the dullness of the surroundings and one is easily transported into this world of sameness, peppered by occasional wonderful lapses back into the magic of acting and well written lines. Their world, and also the girl's world is turned upside down by meeting one another.O'Toole is wonderful as Maurice, the ex-raconteur who proves that love, lust, flirtation and marvel are attributes that never go away with age. It's a delight to see these feelings rekindled in the old man, and O'Toole is the master of bringing zest and poignancy to the screen. Just going to see him quote Shakespeare is worth it alone. The setting in which he does it is unexpected and moving.Jodie Whitaker is indeed a fresh new face. Without airs, this actress expertly matches wits with O'Toole. She conveys the right amount of grittiness, insecurity and bravado as a teenage girl thrust into the big city without a concrete plan would. The growth in her character takes place when an event that she has caused takes place, and she must either own up to what she has done, or forever be stuck in the life as a yob's girlfriend. Vanessa Redgrave and all the others round out an honest cast that isn't afraid to let "Hollywood" see their age. This is acting "sans botox," and what a delight it is to see. This is smart writing, good thinking, and gutsy in a day when actors are expected to look a certain way even in old age. It's a delight, and trounces all stereotypes about aging. There are lines here which are utterly breathtaking in their insight and playfulness. The writer is to be applauded for not falling back on the "senior citizen" stereotype. O'Toole's character swoons, he drinks in the quixotic experience of remembering the beauty of a naked body, of kissing a woman's neck, of the entire and total experience of falling in love, of pleasure, and of jealousy and of heartbreak as well. Young screenwriters should take note: write against type and delve into the real human experience, the one that everyone else tries to conveniently box away.Why an 8, and not a 10? There were some choppy bits of editing. I would have liked to see even more growth and recognition in Maurice. Just a bit more from the writers would've brought it all the way home with the same aplomb given by O'Toole. But overall, a movie worth seeing, a performance worth rewarding. Bravo! Well done. Applause for Mr. O'Toole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter O'Toole falls in love with 20 year old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter O'Toole, as a great actor, has a certain transcendent charisma that has not diminished with age. It is well worth it to see this movie just for him. The life affirming message implicit in his brilliance preserved in old age goes well with the main theme of the film itself, which is the perseverance of vitality in the elderly.The movie is a black comedy, and achieves both the blackness and the comedy perfectly. A scene where O'Toole accidentally barges into a room where his young love interest is modeling nude (while trying to spy on her)is especially hilarious. And his attempts to deal with catheter troubles are darkly hilarious. The movie is a poignant portrait of old age and an uplifting story of young love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not What You'd Expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like most people, thought twice about spending a good few hours of my life watching an old man fall in love with a teenager, but my respect for O'Toole and a free ticket voucher at the Denver Film Festival were more than enough to motivate me to see the film. Had I not gone, I would have made a serious mistake. O'Toole's performance is as good as anything he's done, and the whispers about Oscars might just have something behind them. Somehow, Roger Michell directed this film so beautifully that nothing that occurred between Maurie and Jessie seemed morally ambiguous whatsoever. Maybe it was the pairing of scenes with poppy Corinne Bailey Rae music that made it seem so natural, but I strongly suspect otherwise. O'Toole, paired with a beautiful performance by virtual unknown Jodie Whittaker, takes us into a world that disregards social boundaries and replaces them with raw human emotion and understanding. Though O'Toole's performance captivates the Oscar attention of anyone who sees the film, the supporting role played by Leslie Phillips was essential to the film's success. The relationship between Phillips and O'Toole's character had the entire theater laughing just seconds into the film. Overall, a cast of entirely endearing characters and knockout performances by O'Toole, Phillips, and Whittaker make Venus one of the best films I've seen in 2006.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O'Toole is poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is poetry to Peter O'Toole's performance in "Venus"; it is so effortless, so seamless, so beyond "acting" that it tempts the rest of us to give up and hand in our union cards. No actor in memory has so finely embraced with voice Shakespeare's "Shall I compare thee to a summers day...". This is as fine a vintage as you'll ever find! Perfection. Roger Michell delivers a superb cast all around. Jodie Whitaker hands in a lovely nuanced performance, especially for a newcomer. Together with O'Toole, Leslie Phillips and Richard Griffiths present a marvelous portrait of aging actors. Michell deftly makes us laugh at some things simply because it hurts too much to weep. This is such a beautifully layered and rich film one may want to revisit it time and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Oscar for O'Toole? Beautiful, yet tragic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More Mother than Notting Hill. Peter O'Toole is brilliant -- creepy, lovable, objectionable and yet so vulnerable as the aging, forgotten actor in this "kind of makes you squirm in your seat" love/obsession story. I viewed it at the closing night of the Chicago International Film Festival. The tone and feel of the film places you squarely in Maurice's (O'Toole) gloomy, last chapter of life journey as well as Jesse's (Jodie Whittiker) bratty, just getting her own life started journey. Outstanding cinematography, score and music. Wonderfully haunting! V. Redgrave is terrific and beautiful. Oscar's all around for this funny, sometimes creepy, real look at two people finding each other at the most unexpected time in their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My "Sideways" of 2006</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Peter O'Toole's mesmerizing, fearless, and endearing performance was the only positive aspect of Venus, it would still be well worth seeing.I was pleasantly surprised that the sharp wit and general delightfulness promised by the theatrical trailer for this film delivered the goods.Like the critically acclaimed and popular film from 2004, Sideways, this well-written bittersweet comedy celebrates what is means to be fully human by presenting us with complex, flawed characters who don't always behave the way they should- and our hearts end up bleeding for them as much when they're bad as when they're good.With the simple story line about an aging British stage actor who develops an "interest" in his best friend's great niece, Venus artfully widens into a realistic exploration of how different relationships in our lives fulfill some needs, but not all, and how aging threatens aspects of our identity, but leaves other core pieces intact.The scenes with "Maurice" and his actor friends are absolutely delightful and perfectly executed. The two wonderful scenes between "Maurice" and his estranged wife (a marvel of a performance by Vanessa Redgrave) are both heartwarming and heartbreaking.The core of the story- the not-so-kosher, yet not-nearly-as-revolting as-you-might-think relationship between "Maurice" and "Jessie" (an impressive Jodie Whitaker) avoids all clichés and predictability found in Hollywood movies, and presents the viewers with a believable, engrossing slice of life, and fully invests them with an emotional stake in these characters' outcomes.Venus is an expertly acted, beautifully written little gem that hopefully will not get lost among the more hyped (and over-blown) late year offerings. If The Academy decides to reward Mr. O'Toole with an Oscar for this performance, it will be one that is well deserved and won't be dismissed as "the sentimental choice." Treat yourself to the best adult comedy of 2006, and one of the best performances of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last an Oscar or O'Toole?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A feel good movie that still leaves you feeling like you need a shower. Some uncomfortable scenes and a few directorial flaws (a speedy montage during a trip to the shore is particularly out of place) don't detract from solid acting from the cast as a whole and a brilliant performance by Peter O'Toole in particular. This strange take on the Pygmalion story is well supported by Jodie Wittaker as the title character and Leslie Phillips as the friend that everyone needs to either accompany you or drive you to the grave. But it is O'Toole's performance that makes this movie worth the price of a ticket. If he doesn't finally win an Oscar for this I might have to start fund-raising to buy him one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter O'Toole and Vanessa Redgrave still got it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter O'Toole is one of my favorite actors and it's always been sad for me to think of him dying off without an Oscar. He's given great performances and my favorite is The Lion in Winter (for which he SHOULD have won). However, Venus has proved to be what is possibly his last chance at getting an Oscar. He is just wonderful in all his scenes. The film is very lovely, sweet, charming and funny. Jodie Whittaker is just lovely and a very talented upstart. However, if any other character deserved an Oscar, or a nomination, it is the great Vanessa Redgrave who has stood firm in being a great talent and hasn't even started to fade away like O'Toole almost did. Her scenes aren't that big but she leaves a lasting impression. She still looks beautiful at 69 and she still shows the same display of emotion as she did in her star making breakout role as Rosalind in "As You Like It" to her recent released film "The White Countess". She and O'Toole play off each other very well. This is a wonderful first film for them. See the movie, I know you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter O'Toole's best role since THE MANOR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter O'Toole is considered by many to be the "best actor in the world". And he has been for many decades. Those aren't my words but the words of Anthony Hopkins. Russell Crowe and Martin Scorsese agree. And he is fantastic in this small country independent film. I have seen all of his films and this one along with The Manor ranks among the best. In both, he exhibits the phenomenal wit and timing of a master and knows more about delivering a punchline than anyone I have ever seen. And just listening to his booming voice always keeps everyone honest. In both this film and THE MANOR in which he plays Greta Scacchi's husband, he is a magnet for your attention and your eyes. He totally dominates.WoolyMonkey</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved everything about this movie. Everything. I expected it to be like one of those creaky Jack Lemmon "actory" movies from the 70's when I read the rave reviews for Peter O'Toole. This movie is so much more than O'Toole's towering performance. And yes, he is towering. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie about people north of 70 which seemed truthful. I believed every one of these characters. The screenplay is the reason, of course. And the directing. And the acting. The scene in which Peter O'Toole kisses Vanessa Redgrave is the most heartrending scene in movies today. Two of the most gloriously beautiful actors allow themselves to truthfully appear as decrepit and yet lovely human beings. Bravo a thousand times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A master class in acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though Roger Mitchell directed the easy 1999 celebrity comedy Notting Hill, with Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, he has done increasingly interesting things since. Three years ago he collaborated with writer Hanif Kuraishi, of My Beautiful Laundrette and Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, for a film that enters the same fearless territory as this new film, Venus: the land of age disparities in sex, of the bitter realities of decaying bodies and continuing desire. This was The Mother (2003), in which May (Anne Reed), a woman in her sixties, has a brief reviving affair with a thirty-something builder called Darren (Daniel Craig). The Mother's title points to the fact that May has grown children, and the film deals with the complexities of family and relationships.Kuraishi brings the same fierce honesty about age and sexuality to Venus. This Kuraishi-Mitchell collaboration is destined for greater fame than the last, because happily it chooses to wrap itself around a great star, that same Peter O'Toole who 44 years ago became the unforgettable and luminous hero of David Lean's Laurence of Arabia.At 74 O'Toole is Maurice, an actor living alone well past his prime, the ravages of age compounded in him by too much alcohol and too many cigarettes and the inward marking of a slow decline in roles. Maurice gave up long ago being anybody's husband or father. He lives alone. He and Ian (Leslie Phillips) and Donald (Richard Griffith) meet in a cheap restaurant where the older Ian, who's having short-term memory problems and beginning to have more trouble coping for himself, announces he's to have some relatives' young daughter, a girl from the provinces, coming up to London to live with him and serve as an un-uniformed nurse.Perhaps Ian is Gielgud, only less successful and less elegant. Ian is lordly, a prima donna, whose delicate sensibilities can't abide an untutored member of the younger generations ? and who therefore can't stand young Jessie (Jodie Whittaker) when she arrives.Maurice can. She's ill-dressed and bad-mannered but she's fetching. Maurice sees that. He socializes with her, relates with her as a person; then as a man; then as an aging suitor. For a while, they have something to give each other. It ends unpleasantly. Then, for a moment, it revives and has one last beautiful moment. And it's over. Kuraishi tells this story as much as possible without sugar coating. Some moments are embarrassing and hard to watch. When sweetness comes, it's earned and surprises and touches.Maurice hasn't got much of life to live. But he grabs what he can while he can. And he gives pleasure. That's all he ever wanted.Maurice gets Jessie a job as an art class nude model ? she wanted to do "modeling." Then he spies on her nakedness in the studio and falls in a doorway and knocks over an easel.She likes him ? he's nice to her ? but she also re buffs him at times. She's a rude girl with low tastes but, when speaking of and to her, he recites Shakespeare's sonnet, "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?/Thou art more lovely and more temperate?." She listens. When he sees her beautiful body, her skin, her eyes, her youth, her sex, and speaks of that, he makes her happy.Maurice enters another theater ? the operating kind ? and has his prostate removed. He is impotent and wears a catheter. He can't perform any more. But he can touch and admire. He can desire. He has a small part in a costume film and hires a big limo to go to the shoot with Jessie ? he calls her "Venus" now, comparing her to a painting ? and he almost faints during the shoot. She gets him to pay for a snake tattoo on her hand and has a scrawny boyfriend (Bronson Webb) and they use Maurice's flat to have sex. He gets angry and kicks them out. There's a scuffle and he's knocked down and the kids run off. Later she comes back, find him, and calls 911. He's incapacitated. Out of shame, she volunteers to care for him. Sick as he is, he goes to the beach with her, where he grew up, and this is his last idyll.There is bravery and intelligence in Kurashi's writing and O'Toole's acting, but the richness of this surprisingly complex little film is in the details, gestures, intonations that must be seen to be appreciated. Maurice has a wife (a wonderfully disheveled Vanessa Redgrave). He abandoned her long ago but their relationship is rueful and sweet. In their accomplished ease Redgrave's scenes with O'Toole are a master class in acting. It's had to imagine how two performers could be any better together than this. But it's the scenes between O'Toole and his Venus (Whittaker) that matter, with their honesty and awkward affection, without prettiness, without fakeness. Kuraishi may seem to try too hard to be raw, playing on the shock value of oldster's using four-letter-words, but this is a film, like The Mother, with the painful feel of real experience, expanded to the level of a great, sad open soul by the remarkable O'Toole.The film ends with Ian and Donald in the cheap restaurant looking at Maurice's obituary. It's a good one ? many columns, with a big picture of O'Toole when he was young. The waitress comes up and looks at the picture and says, "But he was gorgeous!" and Ian says, "Yes, he was gorgeous!" -- two of the most profoundly resonant lines in film this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There really isn't anything else"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And so reflects 70-something Maurice (Peter O'Toole) about the importance of beauty and searching for love as the only significant goals as life races by him. VENUS is a small miracle of a film written by Hanif Kureishi ('My Beautiful Laundrette') about the isolation and inner devastation of growing old in today's society. What could have been a morose, whining diatribe about the cruelties of advancing age and the manner in which we treat the elderly becomes a window into the psyche of older characters whose lives have meant something - if to no one else but themselves.Three old thespian friends and colleagues (Maurice, Ian - Leslie Phillips and Donald - Richard Griffiths) spend there days reading obits, sharing pills and recalling the days of their acting glory. Maurice has not given up as he still performs as old characters in films and continues his lifelong libidinous longing for beautiful females. Ian fears death from hypertension and agrees to have his niece's daughter Jessie (Jodie Whittaker) move in to care for him. But the coarse, crude, and rude Jessie drives Ian to distraction and Ian seeks Maurice's aid in diverting Jessie's time to activity away from her home care service. The story thus opens the way to examine the needs and desires of both Maurice and the very young Jessie, each finding a sense of solace, friendship and a new kind of love despite their extreme age differences. Maurice continues to visit his ex-wife Valerie (Vanessa Redgrave) whenever he needs a connection to reality: these encounters speak more about the continuity of love once splintered than in almost any prior film.In a story that could have focused on aged lechery and youthful opportunism this film, as directed by Roger Michell, instead elects to find the path toward beauty that underlines the needs of disparate people. The performance by O'Toole is staggeringly superb and the remainder of this small cast (Redgrave, Griffiths, Phillips - all long admired, seasoned pros - and Whittaker, a very promising new face) is top notch. The writing and directing and acting in this film is at the peak of excellence - there really isn't anything else. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent attempt, but could have used more polishing before shooting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story, subject matter and broad structure were admirable, but I felt strongly that the script could have used another revision or too... plus perhaps some guidance in a few spots.The Shakespearean quotes were pretty cheesy - I mean "To be or not to be" and "Is this a dagger I see before me..." Please. "Can I compare thee to a summers day...." Okay that was well delivered, and not too bad. But otherwise it had a bit of a high-school writer feel with the other bits. Either an unsophisticated perspective on the part of the writer, or trying to pander to a viewer who wouldn't be part of the demographic for this story.Other elements that were weak are the two scenes I expected from the first 30 seconds of getting the plot direction: the brash young punk in the old guy's apartment, and the death scene. I thought from the start - oh, please don't do those two, so predictable. A minor quibble with O'tooles apartment up against the subway track. That seemed so implausible as well, for the successful, life-long actor in his twilight years, living up a few flights of stairs against the train tracks. Right.Finally the slapstick fall down, stumble into the art studio bit was a sad TV "Three's Company" bit.Given the ham-fisted writing, and several spots where the writing didn't seem in character for our young Venus, there were other elements that worked well. The actors were first rate, and held together an otherwise weak script. Redgrave and O'Toole were strong, as was Venus (Whittaker). The latter was well cast, as were the aging stars.I thought the symbolism of the scenery was strong - we see the workings of the city: trains, infrastructure, wires, roads in parallel to the workings of an aging body. In the apartments, we see clutter, cramped awkward spaces. Again, the baggage of many years, and the discomfort of aging bodies.It was good to see a handling of the subject matter. People age on the outside much faster than they age on the inside. A woman is the most beautiful thing a man will ever see, says Maurice. "For a woman?" asks Jessie - "A baby," he says.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michell tells an unconventional story of an aged actor who's fallen for a very young lady. What makes this story different from other old v/s young love stories is that the relationship is very sexual in nature. Maurice clearly sees Jessie as a very sexual being and he would definitely go far enough if she had allowed it. Yet, Jessie herself isn't completely innocent. She is completely aware of his feelings and takes advantage of it. While this part of their relationship is uncomfortable to watch, there is another side to it. Maurice clearly is infatuated with this girl but he never forces himself on her. On the one hand his despair is understandable as he's a man in the last stage of his life. He's maintained a friendly relationship with his estranged wife but his children won't have anything to do with him. He chats with his friends at a café. The only roles offered to him are those of corpses. While he struggles getting up from bed to live his miserably lonely life, it is the entrance of Jessie that changes that. She's young. She's attractive. She's vibrant (though a little tempered). The young Jessie isn't evil either. She too enjoys Maurice's company. Perhaps her feelings towards him were part sympathy part affection. Though both characters are initially portrayed in an unsympathetic way, they manage to build a bridge that connects to the viewer.Hanif Kureishi is known for telling stories about unconventional relationships and here too he does a good job. It is well paced. Some might find it slow but I think it works for this kind of film. The dialogues are solid, both funny, poetic and get you to say 'hmm!'. Also the comedic situations are well executed like the one where Maurice and Jessie go shopping and Maurice only offers to pay 20. The cinematography and score do a good job of demonstrating the loneliness, dullness and somewhat carelessness of London. Meanwhile Corinne Bailey Rae's soothing voice highlight the gentle songs.Peter O'Toole delivers a marvelous performance. I'm glad to see that actors like him and Vanessa Redgrave do not shy away from playing such roles of elderly people. He is charming, kind, passionate (with Venus), somewhat appalling and sympathetic. Redgrave has two scenes of which she does nothing short of greatness. Confidant newcomer Jodie Whitaker more than just holding her own to veteran O'Toole. She adds a freshness and displays Jessie's growth with great confidence. Leslie Phillips too does a fine job as Maurice's friend. He's particularly funny in the scenes where he expresses his dislike for Jessie.'Venus' is a refreshing, sincere little film sans pretense. It's got wonderful performances, intriguing characters, solid dialogue and an unusual story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent acting, unconvincing plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to this film with high expectations, having been led to believe that it dealt bravely and honestly with sexuality amongst old people. I found the acting excellent. However, the behaviour of the people in the film was frequently tawdry and exploitative. If a younger man had been shown behaving as did the character played by Peter O'Toole he would, I believe, have been recognised as the moral incompetent that he is. To expect us to sympathise with this, simply because he is old is a form of inverse ageism. The same applied to the responses of the so-called "friends" who, when he needed assistance when he was ill, were noticeable for their unwillingness to help. Again, these responses are not rendered acceptable because of the age of the characters concerned. If, on the other hand, we were supposed to find them all uncongenial - why bother at all? The transformation of the young women I found completely implausible on the evidence we were given. Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seldom have a finished watching a movie with such a feeling of sadness mingled with joy. This film really connects with its subject matter in a way few films do. Superlative acting, a great script, and a touching story. Peter O'Toole acts better with just his voice then most actors can with the entire screen to work with. Jodie Whittaker was incredible in this her first big part, captivating the screen with both her youth and beauty, as well as her fragile and vulnerable ego. All in all, this was one of the finest and bravest films I have viewed in a very long time.The story, filmed in parts of London that I have never seen on screen, was wonderfully filmed. The cast of veteran actors including Leslie Phillips, Richard Griffiths and Vanessa Redgrave, work together like the natural lifelong friends. It is the chemistry between O'Toole and Whittaker, however, that really sets this film apart. The veteran and the young fledgling really light up the screen with such a tenderness and hunger, both wanting what they other has to offer, and giving what they can to see that happen. Treat yourself to this movie, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

The story is about a young woman who meets an old man who still finds women interesting and attractive, even though there is nothing he can do about it. At least, there is nothing he can do about it physically. He can be charming and entertaining. He can introduce her to a larger world. He can make her understand that there is much more about life than she ever dreamed there could be. The phrase "celebration of life" is a tiresome cliché but there is no other way to categorize this film. Well, maybe is shouldn't be categorized, just as life itself should not be categorized. It should just be experienced, and you take out of it whatever you can get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film, even if you watch with some discomfort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this I avoided reading reviews and had seen one trailer, which gave a flavour of what the film would be like. But - I am a great fan of Peter O'Toole, and of course did not want to miss what has been mooted as the best role of his twilight years, and certainly his first leading role in a film since 'My Favorite Year'.Here O'Toole plays Maurice Russell, an ageing actor who has had past successes (we see his wife watching an old movie of his on TV) but is now playing corpses in hospital dramas or ageing roués in costume drama (O'Toole himself played the old Casanova on TV recently). Maurice is on his last legs, impotent and incontinent after a prostrate op, but finds some solace in the great-niece of his fellow thespian, Ian (played with aplomb by Leslie Phillips). Jodie Whittaker plays this girl, Jessie, Maurice's 'Venus', with some skill - it cannot have been an easy role and I believe she is something of a newcomer.The best moments however for me were not the relationship between Maurice and Jessie - that, because of the huge age gap, was funny at times, poignant at others, and plain distasteful at some points (I felt his attraction to her could have been treated with more sensitivity, although audience sympathy does go with him and not with her) - but rather his scenes with Ian, and with his estranged wife (Vanessa Redgrave, excellent as ever). Here there are scenes of friendship, of life affirmation, of tenderness, that cannot even be approached in the slightly seedy 'theroretical' interest Maurice has in Jessie.Does O'Toole deserve his recent Oscar nomination for this role? Absolutely. He dominates the film with ease and, even frail, elderly, and ravaged, there are flashes of the vibrant blue-eyed heart-throb who wowed the screens in the likes of 'Laurence of Arabia'. Interestingly, once Maurice has died (as we know he must), his friends peer over his Guardian obit, jealously noting the number of columns he's got, and show an old photo to the café waitress - not the best vintage O'Toole photo they could have got, but enough to show that Maurice had a life before old age got him. And whether Maurice is frustrated with his age 'Come on, old man!' he chides himself, or regretful with the passing of time and his libido (either with his wife or with Jessie), dancing with Ian in the actor's church, or having his last paddle in the freezing sea, O'Toole is never anything less than mesmerising, and that is the mark of a true actor.I imagine this film will grow with repeated viewings. The script has a few profanities (it was amusing hearing Leslie Phillips utter the f word) but is largely literate as you would expect from Hanif Kureshi, who last wrote 'The Mother' for the screen (where Anne Reid and Daniel Craig had a rather more physical relationship - which would have been totally wrong in every respect for 'Venus'). The music is perfectly suited to the film and works extremely well.In all, a good effort. And in places extremely funny - but it is the two old men dancing which you will remember, and this was rightly the image carried by the film festivals which first presented this charming and unusual film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Venus has a nostalgic perspective and shows old ages successfully.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Venus in Istanbul Film Festival. Venus is not the funniest or the most impressive movie about old age, I've ever seen. However, I think the director's intention is not that. Obviously Venus has a nostalgic perspective and shows old ages successfully; however, Venus joins old and new. When Maurice meets Jessie, Maurice again finds beauty in the goddess Venus. After that Maurice is rejuvenated. At the same time, Maurice feels the breath of death on him. Perhaps, he had a great wish for being immortal, he realizes that it's impossible. This scene is the one of the most tragic scenes of the movie. Mostly the humour is effective, although we always feel melancholy. The places which the director chose and the dark colours that he used in the film stand out. In addition, Peter O'Toole's (Maurice) acting is marvelous. As a result, if you haven't great expectations Venus, you can experience different feelings about this movie.BuRnOut_TR</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Igonore those reviewers who criticize this script and/or directing. They are obviously too foolish to recognize a strong dialogue driven story. This script offers some of the most clever dialogue and story development I have seen in years. As for those who think the film is perverse or creepy for showing an old man with a romantic interest in a young girl, listen up: Jessie represents a beautiful, young, inspiring woman. Something Maurice once had but gave up by his own foolishness. When his wife said to Jessie, "So you are the one", she wasn't, it was in fact, her (his wife) he was thinking of. Jessie was simply the metaphor for her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mawkish, bleak and unpleasant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd give this unpleasant film a miss.It is extraordinary how such a good combination of ingredients - excellent actors, filmed in English, in England - can produce such a nasty result.The plot doesn't hang together well. Various ideas are brought up in a scene only to be discarded completely, with no particular relevance to anything.The film is maninly an attack on old age and it aims as many humiliations at the elderly as it possibly can. The gratuitous nastiness extends to all sorts of situations - there's an impossibly callous and cruel surgeon, an unconvincingly brutal boy friend and many others.Peter O'Toole acts brilliantly, of course, but it is all such a waste. The film is maudlin and mawkish at the same time as being nasty - an unusual combination, I suppose, but that's no reason to waste time seeing this.The girl acts fairly well too, but, again, to little point. Here character isn't well developed, and certainly not pleasant enough to warrant any attention from an old man. She is unconvincing on many levels. I'm sure, that with a decent script, and an interesting plot, she could be a reasonably good actress, but this would be thin material for even a top flight actress.There are some feeble attempts at humour. Probably the best example is; 'You know what they say about blind prostitutes?' 'You've got to hand it to them'. Brilliant wit, eh? And that's about as good as it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overburdened with obscenity and without a trace of authenticity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the several sad things about the so-called comedy-drama "Venus" is that Peter O'Toole (as Maurice, a cadaverous and pedophiliac dirty old actor) gives the world a definitive portrait of a character to whom the description "looks like death chewin' on a cracker" might be applied ? albeit while chewing on the appendages of a young laddette of ill-defined character played by Jodie Whittaker.While the broad intended themes of "Venus" seem to be May-December romantic attraction; the Pygmalion-like uplifting of a downhearted young woman by a caring mentor; the nature of mature love; the healing effects of time; and the eternal nature of eros ? the finished work seems disjointed and populated by poorly developed characters behaving oddly.A horrid and distasteful mish-mash of bad intentions gone worse, the script is the product of Hanif Kureishi, the Anglo-Pakistani boomer (born in 1954) and "cult-novelist" whose oeuvre - largely characterized by a broad spectrum of explicit sexual activity - runs the gamut from interracial gay love story (My Beautiful Laundrette) through the reportedly autobiographical tale of a man who leaves his wife and children (Intimacy) in favor of an anonymous fellatrice (live, on camera!), to more recent work exploring trans-generational sexual attraction (The Mother ? between a woman in her 70s and her thirty-something lover ? and Venus ? thankfully avoiding any explicit sex between a 70-something man who is near death's door and the rather ill-defined young woman in her 20s in whom he takes a prurient interest.) As one in the eighth decade of his life, I can assure others that Mr Kureishi offers no meaningful insight into the nature of aging, the aged, or their sensuality. The actors do a workmanlike job of trying to breathe life into an abysmal script (act, Peter, act!) ? but the lighting is Stygian, the screenplay improbable, the continuity irregular and the dialog ? other than the gratuitous obscenities - forgettable.In sum, Venus is an abysmal melange wherein "Lost in Translation" meets "My Fair Lady", with a heavy dose of Mr. Chips as played by Claire Quilty.If you're looking for fascinating insight into the nature of love, sexuality and redemption as written by a brilliant British author go see Edward Norton in the current production of the "The Painted Veil", adapted from Somerset Maugham's story.For an overblown exercise in geriatric farce ? overburdened with obscenity and without a trace of authenticity ? see "Venus".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good performance doesn't make a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very sad, harsh, depressing movie. Not a great one, unfortunately. Since it was labeled as "comedy", I wonder what it is exactly that we are supposed to laugh at. The pain and humiliations of old age? Being so sick that you have to pee through a catheter? Geriatric rectal exams? Prostitution and abuse? Really funny, all of it. To whom this could sound amusing, I don't know. The store scene and the confrontation with the snotty "boyfriend", which I found revolting, were both unbearable. While both Peter O'Toole and Whittaker do their best, good performance is not enough to make a good movie. The script lacks subtlety and consistency in character development, pretty much ruining everything. On the cover of the DVD, the tagline reads "You'll love her". Who are we supposed to love? This Jesse is a dumb, illiterate, mean-spirited, abusive, vicious and vulgar bitch who prostitutes herself. The sight of her constantly trying to hit O'Toole was sickening and outrageous. Few attempts to make her look human are just an example of bad writing. It is intended for us to believe that she ends up genuinely caring for the man, but that's completely implausible, inconsistent with her character. While his feelings for her are real, I'm not buying that she suddenly turned affectionate. Jesse is meant to give Maurice some sort of revelation, but she lacks the complexity to elicit anything more than raw physical attraction. As for the man played by O'Toole, the only thing you can accuse him of is poor taste in women. I mean, he falls in love/lust (whatever) with this sorry excuse for a woman, and calls her "Venus". Yeah, I guess love is blind. He's just a victim, nothing more, and he plays it masochistically, to the viewer's great discomfort. To those calling him a "perv", here's a legitimate question: why would an older man have to apologize for feeling love/attraction? It's not like he was forcing or "corrupting" her, obviously. The intimate scenes between them are uncomfortable not because he's older, but because she's using him in the most despicable ways. Peter O'Toole still has that splendid, distinctive voice, and sometimes you can catch glimpses of the gorgeous man that he was. O'Toole gives depth and warmth to his character solely by his personal charm, something that only he could pull off so elegantly. His acting is marvelous as always, although this is a painful performance to watch, given the subject matter and its misguided handling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter O'Toole gives a tasteless script a brilliant performance, as well as the film's entire merit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema has had a number of stains and gems regarding the taboo of old-meets-young in sexual relationships. Unfortunately, Peter O'Toole's quirkily misplaced majestic performance seems to have been wasted on this skid mark, devoid of any genuine justification for the risqué exploits of a perverted old man desperate to swap fluids with his twenty-year-old crush. Now, this following romance movie attribute is accepted, and expected: when boy meets girl, there is initial disdain from at least one party, resulting in a rough start to the inevitable love story, reinforcing the old convention, "The more they hate each other, the more likely they'll fall in love by the end of the movie." Here you'll find the most unbelievable and ridiculous presentation of this story element that reinforces nothing of value.Famed dramatic actor Maurice Russell, in the twilight of his seventies, meets his friend's grandniece and new nurse, Jessie. He is immediately smitten by her, and just as soon brings out the alcohol in hopes she will submit. The rest of the film is plagued with sequences of lowbrow ribaldry, with some occasional heartfelt moments on the side that are overpowered by the former, if only just.After several borderline hilarious establishing scenes showing old British men with filthy mouths exchanging medications like junkies and discussing obituaries as if in a Monty Python sketch, the film takes a turn for the painfully awkward.With Venus, this awkwardness simply does not stop. Maurice charms Jessie with the gentlemanly charisma only O'Toole can convey; Jessie is treated like a princess; the princess is then groped; she retreats, tells Maurice she never wants to see him again, and he rustles out the ideal gravelling laugh of an old pervert. Repeat. Again. And again, only more rude.The intermittent scenes of Maurice with his friends, visits with his estranged old flame, and solitary moments with his thoughts seem to have heart, but we don't feel the beat. Stanley Kubrick handled this taboo sub-genre perfectly with Lolita, not exploiting a single element, and capturing our sympathy for an older man who discovers his lust and love may be confused. Venus takes the opposite route, exploiting the taboo to the point where Jessie is a character we love to hate, and Maurice turns out to be nothing more than a shameless, horny old man.All things considered, there are only two things that nearly saved it for me. One is, of course, Peter O'Toole's performance, which beautifies his character with a surprising occasional elegance. The other is an important plot element that sadly confuses the film: Maurice, after prostate surgery, is impotent. Does this mean that his licentious erotic tendencies are the result of true love? Probably not. This was, perhaps, a simple plot device inserted only for the purpose of gaining understanding for his character, and some consideration that he is more that just a horny geezer.There are many who hail this film as a near-perfect romantic comedy, as touching as it is funny, etc. This pablum is unjustified because any substance or underlying meaning to this "love story" can only be described as ludicrous. How could it not? This certainty speaks for itself, namely when Jessie touches herself and allows Maurice to smell her fluids, yet tries to slap him when he tries to lick her fingers. I am not making this up. If this does not disturb or confuse you, by all means, enjoy the movie.I hate to describe a Peter O'Toole film as trash, but I have to say Venus is a horribly miscalculated and vain excuse for a seldom-attempted type of love story. As I anticipated, it is worthy of a single viewing only for him, proving that he is among the greatest actors of his generation, and the last hope for modern theatres to be graced with silver screens once again. That being said, I just wish this film hadn't been given the same inventive value of a watered-down dime novel dragged through a muddy gutter. Putting it delicately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly an Actor's Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Venus is what can truly be called an actor's film. In the hands of another director, it could have been more, but the way it is in the hands of Roger Michell, were it not for Peter O'Toole, it would hardly be much. Leslie Phillips and Richard Griffiths provide terrific background performances, not to mention that of the very promising and persuasive young actress Jodie Whittaker. There is even the graceful presence of Vanessa Redgrave's walk-on role, but the lasting impression of the film is unremarkable. That does not, however, detract from how interesting and real the story is itself.Harif Kureishi's script concerns O'Toole, who plays a revered English actor whose work and cherished social life have been weather-beaten since he is now geriatric. However he finds himself more and more attracted to his long-time friend's great-niece, while at the same time finding himself in failing health because of prostate cancer. His friend describes Whittaker's punkish, self-seeking teenager as a trouble maker and a pain, but O'Toole finds that she rather endears to him when he starts interacting with her. He takes her to see his favorite painting, Velázquez's Venus. She alludes to an interest in modeling, growing into a funny initial scene in which he initially misunderstands her and thinks she is interested in yodeling. He sets her up to model nude for an art class. Because of her posing for the art class, and informed by his favorite painting, he gives her the nickname Venus. The two flesh out a passive-aggressive relationship throughout the film. He is too romantically bold while she sporadically panders to his urges to a restricted point, for instance touching her hand and smelling her neck, but sharply withdraws her lenience when she feels that he has gone too far.The movie follows the developing connection between the two characters. This seems to be the last crack at something akin to a love life, as his prostate operation has left him impotent. It is less apparent what Whittaker sees in O'Toole. Throughout, we see her do everything from trying to get him to buy her presents, trying to use his apartment to have sex with a sleazy boy, take care of him, flirt with him, reject him sexually and connect with him as a friend. At one point, we find that she has been rejected by her mother and great- uncle for her promiscuous standard of living. Essentially, it's about the unfortunate gap and great room for discomfort between someone who is harshly judged by so many and someone who would never think to judge her, too old and too wise and too far into his last legs to care about what is and is not socially acceptable.This is not a badly made film. I admired the clashing of worlds of O'Toole and Whittaker, mainly through the use of music. There just isn't a lot of impact. I wanted to want to think about this movie afterward, but Venus just didn't radiate. Nevertheless, it is definitely worth a viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of film in which the actors make the movie. The script shifts without ease from comedy to drama to teen angst, and the movie has a few moments of quirkiness that just scream "cute, topical indie dramedy, guys!". But the incredible cast spins gold out of this nonetheless. O' Toole is fabulous in the role of Maurice, an aging actor who strikes up a relationship with a troubled teen (Jodie Whitaker, a revelation), while trying to hold together his bonds with friends (Leslie Phillips and Richard Griffiths give a pair of brassy, funny performances that deserved awards season attention) and his ex-wife (Vanessa Redgrave, in a brilliant, understated performance). If you like to watch great actors do a great job acting, this is your movie. But no matter how great the talent is in front of the camera, it can't reach its full potential without equal talent behind it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter O'Toole looked 90 here, even though he was only 74. He is Maurice, somewhat well-known actor, who still works here and there, always demanding his pay in cash. We can tell that he has always been attracted to pretty girls, and that will never change, even after surgery that renders him impotent.New face Jodie Whittaker, 24, is Jessie, the new girl in the neighborhood, sent to London get work, and to live with her very old uncle. Maurice takes a liking to her immediately, and begins to take her places and show her some kindness. He calls her his "Venus." But Jessie is no wilting, charmed young girl. When Maurice gets fresh with her, without her prior consent, she gives him a swift kick in places that could hurt very much.There is a very good 13 minute DVD extra which explains that Maurice and Jessie are similar in that they want something, but on their own terms. They end up finding things about life together. Both actors are superb in their roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that "Venus" was very good. I enjoyed it a lot. It starts off as broad comedy (think Old Men Behaving Badly) and becomes something much deeper and richer as it progresses.Peter O'Toole plays a version of himself that never became a famous and lauded actor. He's an old man, in ill health, scraping a living playing minor parts on TV. He banters with old friends Leslie Phillips (who is brilliant) and Richard Griffiths. O'Toole is lively, caustic and still interested in the opposite sex, even if they are not interested in him. He is alive! Into his life comes a teenage girl, played by Jodie Whittaker. She is the Niece of the Leslie Phillips character. Withdrawn, childlike, selfish, coarse and (hey!) vile. O'Toole falls in lust with her and pursues her - slowly. He's an old man. She doesn't want to know, but they become friends.Things happen...I am not at all surprised that Peter O'Toole snagged an Oscar nomination for "Venus". Shame he didn't win.I must say a word or two about Jodie Whittaker, who has hardly been mentioned in any of the reviews. She is good. She grows and changes and matures as the film goes on. By the end she is a different person. It's a really great performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Return of Vladimir Nabokov</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1955, Russian author Vladimir Nabokov stood the world on its ears with a devastatingly sexy novel called "Lolita," the story of a middle aged man sexually obsessed with a pre-pubescent twelve-year old girl. Some literary experts classify it as one of the most important novels of the 20th century because finally, the wraps had been removed off public dissemination of something called sexual repression. Until that book became known worldwide, sex in movies was only hinted at, never explored. Here we are, more than fifty years after the shocker hit the bookshelves followed by the motion picture and Lord knows how many spinoffs can be attributed to that theme, give or take ages, circumstances etc."Venus" is just one more example of the impact of Nabokov's masterpiece and in this case we have a way over-the-hill 74 year old English Shakespearean actor played by Peter O'Toole obsessed with a teen girl who is the daughter of the niece of his best friend, also an aged actor. The girl was sent to care for O'Toole's friend who can't stand her which conveniently allows O'Toole's lust to blossom."Venus" is by no means a "dirty movie." It's suggestive, trite, very slow moving but still allows O'Toole's mastery at acting to come through strongly enough to have given him a nomination for Best Actor of 2006. Although his performance is excellent, I feel it doesn't warrant the Oscar so if he does win one, it'll be based on sentimentality rather than merit. Keep in mind although he has been nominated for seven Oscars:MY FAVORITE YEAR (1982) THE STUNT MAN (1980) THE RULING CLASS (1972) GOODBYE, MR. CHIPS (1969) THE LION IN WINTER (1968) BECKET (1964) LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (1962)he's won none except for a special honorary award statue in 2002.

		<shortDescription>A ludicrous geriatric fantasy with nice laughs and good direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Roger Mitchell's film, Peter O'Toole plays an ageing bit-part actor called Maurice, who senses death might be just round the corner. His best pal, played wonderfully by Leslie Phillips, is the archetypal moany-old-git forever begrudging the world for its fortune. Whilst they swear and drink their way to their deathbeds, along comes a chavved-up "helper nurse" Jessie (Whitaker) to aid his day-to-day activities around the house. The leery-eyed Maurice appears to be enchanted (or infatuated) by this mini-skirt wearing layabout ? even going as far as trying to chat her up. For reasons of allowing the script to tell this relatively unrealistic geriatric fantasy, Maurice and Jessie become good friends, him taking her her to the theatre whilst she takes him on late night binge-drink sessions. Not for a moment's rest does Maurice let up his perverted attraction to Jessie ? whilst she, inexplicably, seems to encourage some of it. And this, in turn, sums up what is wrong with the film. We do not know what the relationship between the two characters is meant to be. Does she pity him? Is her lack of resistance towards his crude ways art-related or does she get a kick out of the old codger? Where the film excels is the chemistry between all the combatants. Leslie Phillips, Richard Griffiths and Peter O'Toole are all great together, and perhaps I could have seen more of them. And despite the ludicrousness of Jessie's friendship-cum-romance with Maurice, there is a tenderness that unmistakably marks you, whether you feel comfortable or not with what O'Toole's character is doing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't a film that I probably would have ever watched, but since SAG sent me the DVD for free I thought what the hell. I went into it thinking, "Oh great, another old man is hot for a young woman movie..." but this film is much more than that. It's more a story about getting old and the difficulties and humor that come with it. This is probably the best movie I have seen - that deals with aging - since On Golden Pond. And like OGP, it wouldn't have been as great without an outstanding ensemble of actors. Sure, O'Toole (Maurice) is getting all the accolades and AA nom (and rightfully so, he's brilliant in this, the best acting by him I've ever seen) but the film wouldn't have been nearly as good if he didn't have the outstanding supporting cast: Redgrave as his ex-wife, the young woman who plays his Lolita-Venus and probably the best of the bunch, the also aging best friend of Maurice, who made me cry, which I don't do often. Whoever this actor was, (my apologies, but his pic isn't listed next to the cast list and I can't remember the character's name) he is deserving of a supporting actor nom, but because he's not a big name, he won't. (One of things I dislike about the AAs) Anyway, this is an outstanding movie that I would recommend to anyone. Like On Golden Pond, it made me laugh and cry. And if you can do that to me, you get a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can see as lecherous grey porn for the wrinkling erectile dysfunction set but Roger Mitchel's tale of ageing actor O'Toole in the last flush of feelings with the wanton Jodie Whittiker is a sometimes uncomfortable but emotionally convincing meditation on old age and its ability to ruin the body while leaving the spirit frustrated but youthfully intact.The pleasure here is watching veterans like the aforementioned O' Toole and Leslie Philips is such blistering, devil may care form. They're double act is the best reason to see Venus, brimming as it does with the sort of easy going confidence borne of a 100 plus screen performances and a lifetime in front of the camera. Whittikar as the object of the veteran thesps' dirty old eye is quite sweet and her discomfort at the wrinklies sexual interest acts as a neat surrogate for the rest of us, meaning we can watch the relationship unfold without vomiting uncontrollably.The scenes in which O'Toole contemplates the end of his life and his glory days carry genuine pathos, not least because the man is no spring chicken himself and he, like his character, may not have too many more spells in the spotlight left. With that in mind you should definitely seek out this performance but be aware that some of the sexual overtures made to the fair Whittikar who both writer and director can't resist leering at themselves, may make you squirm in your seat as much as laugh. Incidentally O'Toole's humour is still dry as dust and he's lost none of his exquisite timing - I hope the image of him feeling up an 18 year old isn't one of the last things I get to see him doing. No, really.</fullReview>

Whereas Stanley Kubrick (Lolita (1962)) and Hal Ashby (Harold and Maude (1971)) each directed exceptional black comedies with unique characters involved in extreme May-December romances which still hold up today, Venus (2006) is too rude, crude and socially unacceptable for almost anyone's sensibilities (unless you enjoy hearing geezers drop f-bombs). Director Roger Mitchell's love story is so distasteful that his target audience must have been as narrow as pop singer Michael Jackson's apologists. While Peter O'Toole's lecherous character is believable, it's only because he's playing a dying actor (in more than one sense of the word) that his self-centered quest for pleasure has any basis in reality. The role Leslie Phillips plays temporarily holds O'Toole's debauchery up to a mirror but, in the end, even he is able to excuse his friend's actions as if it were an eccentricity. Though similar in age to Sue Lyon and Bud Cort (respectively), actress Jodie Whittaker is perhaps too inexperienced to provide much to her characterization of the girl who's taken advantage of, when compared to the previously mentioned (cult) classics. Vanessa Redgrave isn't really given enough to do - her character barely provides a historical perspective of O'Toole's character - and even she appears to be tolerant of her husband's last obsession when she meets Jessie aka Venus (Whittaker) at the film's conclusion. Of course, one has to credit O'Toole for his sympathetic portrayal of a truly loathsome dirty old man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and shallow with a side of heart...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This immature slice of geriatric epiphany was largely overrated when it came out, mainly due to the lead being film legend Peter O'Toole. Critics, and even the Academy awards, must have mistook this manipulative and silly little tale for something entirely greater. While Venus does have some potent themes which deal in lust and mortality, Hanif Kureishi's script is just too showy for any real effect to take hold. His plot revolves around O'Toole's late-life inspiration, as he sleazily attempts to win over a young nurse (newcomer Jodie Wittaker, doing little more then filling out a pair of jeans nicely). This was no Lolita, and the under-explored dynamics of their relationship does little to illuminate anything, opting to artfully exploit the premise instead. Many have praised the script's handling of this potentially scummy plot line, insisting Venus has far more class and substance then it's raunchy foreground would suggest, but I saw very little indication of that.Rather, the film serves to highlight one dirty old man in all of his crusty glory as we watch, unbelievably, as this young young lady begins to offer more of herself to him. While not plagued with the indecency that would have felt more pronounced had the project belonged to more sinister minds, Venus is little more then the vapid glorification of an old horn-dog having one final hurrah. What is particularly annoying is how O'Toole and his on-screen elderly buddy continuously mug the camera with an awkward "rawness" that I suppose was instilled for comedic value and also for appealing to a younger demographic but only came across as unrealistic and laughably off. It is as if director Roger Michell, fearing the small box-office turn around, had his lead utter ridiculously foul-mouthed phrases in order to catch some tiny spark of edginess. Instead, these lines come off as painfully self-aware and completely counter-productive in proving to us that these old men are still hip.Venus may have enough appeal to lure a certain crowd, as it had certainly pulled a fast one over many of our respected film critics, but the majority of this film felt like a tedious chore. Rare moments of cinematic sincerity occur, and when they do one will only realize what potential the film could have had if calibrated with a little more finesse. Rather, Venus let's the venerated O'Toole celebrate 50 years in the biz by having him gently chew the scenery, with dentures. His much touted performance, masterfully intuitive yet still somehow stale and predictable, was overstated from stature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vile, sad film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After over 50 years of watching films this offering represents a low point in film 'entertainment.' This film has been hyped as a feel good comedy but the positive ending to the film is that the leading lady has learned how to cook fish and that she is now happy to pose in the nude at an art class. Hurray! Those messages will warm me through any problems life throws at me.The script is dreadful. Imagine a class of 15 year old doing a drama project at school. 'Can we use swearing, Miss?' 'Of course, if it is essential and you all promise not to tell anyone outside the classroom.' There follows as many 'f**ks' and 'c**ts' as possible. This contrasts with O'Toole reciting lines from the Bard while he sits outside the bathroom door. The scene where Venus 'does something nice' for O'Toole and allows him to sniff her finger is degrading and sad to see from Peter O'Toole.The theatre had around a dozen in the audience and three of them walked out before the end. I had taken my wife, my sister and my niece and was devastated to have subjected them to this effort.Our previous film was Pan's Labyrynth. Light years away.At least Nacho Libre knows what it is.</fullReview>

She expects to be a model while eating nothing but junk food. Ian is frustrated and Maurice is entranced.There is only one Peter O'Toole and he gives us one great final curtain call. He shows the world that he still has it. He is the only one who can play a dirty old man and do it with playfulness. It's also done with a bit of edge. It's fun. It's poignant.

		<fullReview>It's heartbreaking to see Peter O'Toole. He remains a truly great actor, but I can still remember seeing him on the big screen in "Lawrence of Arabia" and being mesmerized by his beauty. It was so mesmerizing, in fact, that Noel Coward warned him people were going to call him "Florence of Arabia." In "Venus," a 2006 film, O'Toole plays an actor, Maurice, who's not aging very gracefully but still has his wits about him. He and his good friend. another actor, Ian (Leslie Phillips) spend a lot of time together. Ian has a lot of aches and pains but now has some help - a great-niece, Jessie (Jodie Whittaker). He is rather excited about her coming to live with him, even going so far as to get her a pink towel. The next day, Ian tells Maurice that his great-niece is a horror. When Maurice meets her, though, he has a different impression. So different that he names her "Venus" after his favorite painting.Jessie in fact is a somewhat slovenly, sullen, overly made up young woman with good legs. She wants to model, so Maurice gets her a job modeling nude for an art class. Over time, a relationship develops. It's not really sexual, as Maurice is dealing with prostate cancer, and surgery has rendered him impotent, but he obviously fantasizes.As much as Jessie protests, she likes the attention. She occasionally lets him smell her neck or touch her hand, but that's it. Maurice is reliving the years when he was a true ladies' man. He left his wife (Vanessa Redgrave) with three children under the age of six for another woman, and one assumes the other woman was just a stopgap until the next one.Jessie's feelings towards Maurice evolve into something like caring, but along the way, she uses him to buy her nice things, and at one point asks him to leave his flat so she and her boyfriend can have sex. She also talks with him like a friend and seems to enjoy spending time with him. The big thing about Maurice is that he cares for her unreservedly, which is not something her parents did."Venus" is a lovely story with a great soundtrack, but the film is O'Toole's as he plays a faded actor dealing with old age and facing death. He has one last gasp at feeling young, flirting, and doing the things that young men do. And he makes us realize the saddest thing about old age. Inside you're still twenty-something. It's your body that lets you down.I've never seen Jodie Whittaker in anything else. She was so perfect in the role, I have no idea if she was acting or not. I suspect given her other credits that she was, and she did a masterful job playing a complicated young woman who hasn't quite figured out who she is yet.Leslie Phillips is also wonderful as Ian, a fussy old man for whom the very presence of his great-niece is offensive. The scene in their hangout, a coffee shop, is hilarious. He is so incensed that Maurice has her posing for art students that the two get into a fight, causing Maurice to utter my subject line. It's only one line in a script with fabulous dialogue. Vanessa Redgrave has a very small role but registers well. When doesn't she? A poignant, bittersweet film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited to see this film for along time. Tricky subject -- older actor falling for young girl. It could be quite ugly.We have Peter O'Toole as Maurice the greatly celebrated actor-- we have Leslie Phillips playing Ian one of his contemporaries and Jodie Whitaker as young relation of Ian's. Peter 'lifeforce' O'Toole gives once again one of those performances that cuts through the potential trickiness with great power. Jodie Whitaker realises he is famous and uses him for what she can get - then slowly and gradually begins to warm to and appreciate him. This is hugely touching film with strong performances from great British actors and Jodie Whitaker isn't phased by any of it-- she is very impressive. There is also a lovely musical score with beautiful songs by Corinne Bailey Rae which definitely soften the subject. Clever direction too from Roger Michell.</fullReview>

They strike up a peculiar relationship and Maurice, the old man, falls head over heels for this woman who he thinks is just the most beautiful thing on earth. This film is full of laughs and the older characters are just full of spirit and vigor. This film also has a lot of Corinne Bailey Rae if your any fan of her music. The acting is quite superb all around. I don't really like the ending because it has the feeling of a slow release more than anything else. But that's just how it goes, can't blame the story line it's just not my cup of tea. There is a cool fight scene if you watch it in which there's a cool judo move preformed. It's definitely a great film to watch if you don't mind a film about old people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A special and unique movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie just yesterday on DVD, and I didn't know what to expect. All I knew was that the film depicted an unusual love story between an old man (O'Toole) and a young girl.This is no Notes on a Scandal; the film is not about pedophilia. It's about what may make you uncomfortable--the fact that you, too, may become so old you are unrecognizable, almost repulsive and scary to younger people. It's about the life of an old person, the unglamorous part of it, the sick part of it--pills, poverty, loneliness, leg bags. Our destiny if we live that long.But more important it's a reminder that valuable people are everywhere, if we're just open to them. And that while we age on the outside, we don't on the inside. We don't have to.Peter O'Toole's character, Maurice Russell, was quite a ladies man in his youth. He'd still be one if women would let him. He meets, Jessie, the niece and newly recruited caretaker of his best friend, Ian, and we can see in his eyes that the ladies man has reawakened in him. Trouble is, he's ancient, he looks it and often physically feels it. A prostate operation makes him impotent and incontinent. But that doesn't mean he can't have a little fun in some compensatory ways. He simply loves women and decides to enjoy Jessie, whom he renames Venus, as he can and as she'll allow. Kiss her neck, buy her earrings, paw her on occasion. But with sex not much of a distraction anymore, he's able to give her a gift that no man or woman has ever given her. He gives her his time, friendship, support. He broadens her world by taking her on set and to theater. She grows up as a result.The movie has a lot of funny moments--a fight scene between two old guys prompts a friend to break it up saying--"what is this, catheters at dawn?" Vanessa Redgrave is her expected reliable acting self. My favorite scene? Jess and O'Toole in the limo--both euphoric.I watch this movie twice. You'll love the end and Corinne Bailey's music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps not O'Toole's swan song, but functions well as such</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an understating and sensitive portrait of an aging man this is, never dwelling on emotional poignancy, but letting the cleverly written script and lead actor speak volumes. For me this is something of the epitome of a Brit-flick (however negatively-connoted the term has become): noble, talkative, subtle and funny. Peter O'Toole lends his remarkably frail charisma to the role of Maurice, a veteran actor with a prostate condition who becomes smitten with his friend's 20-year-old niece, whom he affectionately nicknames Venus one day in an art gallery. She becomes something of an ethereal goddess to him, capable of filling the last days of his life with beauty and purpose simply by allowing him to touch her hand, smell her hair and watch her from afar. Their relationship, however kinky or difficult in nature, is one of the most tragically portrayed bonds you will see in film this year. Every scene they have together resonates tenderness on O'Toole's part, and is positively drenched in comic schoolgirl Lolita undertones.For all its poetic and prose allusions in O'Toole's monologues and wisdoms as he stares into the distance, "Venus" never alludes to Lolita. It simply does not have to, for watching it is like opening a candy box of taboo notions, not to mention Jessie (Jodie Whittaker) is undeniably a lot like the titular character in Nabokov's novel: unlikeable, self-indulgent and spoiled, even if she eventually grows on you considerably. For all her brass teenage nature, O'Toole makes up for it with the same unique quality he brings to all of his characters, namely an intense emotional frailty embedded in his baby blue eyes. It breaks my heart to watch him in even remotely tragic situations now more than ever with an aging veneer and saggy parts, but even back in his Lawrence of Arabia days his emotional transparency never failed to touch me immensely.That is not to say I crown O'Toole the best actor in the Academy category solely on sentimental grounds. Forest Whitaker, too, was excellent, but O'Toole gives the most nobly natural performance of the year (tied with Winslet perhaps). Although I enjoyed all supporting performances and technicalities of the film, "Venus" is something of a custom-tailored vehicle for Peter O'Toole, which is prime meat for the Academy and a rich source of enjoyment for me.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this poignant story about the acceptance of old-age the lead character, Maurice, is enigmatically portrayed by Peter O'Toole. A once famous actor he now lives alone in London and survives by playing bit parts in films. His best friend Ian (played by Leslie Phillips) is in a similar situation but their lives change when Ian's great niece comes to stay... The friendship that develops between Maurice and Ian's great niece, 'Venus' is both heart-warming and, at times, unsettling as each struggles to gain some sort of emotional power over the other. This is a beautiful film. Each of the central actors give strong performances but it is certainly worth watching for Peter O'Toole's alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O'Toole is the outstanding actor in Venus, which is why he is the central character of course, but the film is worth examining for other reasons. For instance, it cost ?3m, which is a tiny amount compared with films that get vast amounts of publicity. Venus is literate, moving, funny, engaging and, in its quiet way, something of a masterpiece. Which is more than can be said for another film beginning with V, Valkyrie, which to me was overblown, deeply flawed, and risible. A little test for anyone watching Venus; O'Toole recites a Shakespeare sonnet, number 18, and if you don't feel a swelling in your heart and catch in your breath then I guess this film is not for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maurice and Ian, two old thespians in London, have been friends forever, or so it seems. Since both don't get much acting calls, they love to visit the old actors' church, St. Paul's in Covent Garden, where they go to see all those famous names displayed on the walls. Soon, too, they will be gone, but alas, their names will probably not grace the church at all.Ian, who is getting frail, gets a visit from a great-niece, Jessie, who is sent to help out in his messy household. To Ian, the arrival changes everything. Worse sin for him is the vulgarity which the girl displays; she is not refined, or has been exposed to the same things as Ian. On the other hand, the appearance of the girl inspires a different feeling in Maurice; he sees the young woman as something he could never aspire to be linked, romantically, or otherwise.Roger Michell, the director of "Venus", makes another incursion in the lives of older people, something he seems to have an affinity for, as shown in his previous effort, "The Mother". Again, his usual collaborator, Hanif Kureishi is at hand to help Mr. Michell achieve another excellent film.Peter O'Toole shows a keen insight for playing this old actor who is at the end of his life. He certainly can show a thing, or two, to other actors. He is wonderful; his performance is nuanced by the intelligence he displays on the screen. Equally marvelous is Leslie Phillips, one of the best comedians of many generations who shows great rapport with his co-star. Newcomer Jodie Whittaker, who is seen as Jessie, appears to be a natural. Also seen in minor roles, Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Griffiths, two of the most accomplished actors in the English stage, and cinema.Highly recommended for fans of Mr. O'Toole and Mr. Phillips and the great direction of Mr. Michell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice idea but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was interested in seeing Venus mainly due to the glowing reviews I had read about the performance of Peter O'Toole. I knew little about the storyline other than it dealt with an elderly man's infatuation with his friend's niece. I feel I was perhaps slightly unprepared for the level of infatuation that this film displayed because it was much more of a sexual nature. Whilst I didn't find the sexual theme to be troubling, I felt very flat at what I saw on screen. In short I found the film uninspiring and very uncomfortable to watch at times.I am passionate and open minded about film and I am always keen to watch films which challenge my thinking and encourage me to explore my thoughts and feelings. I cannot deny that Venus is a film in which I found the themes challenging, but that alone was not enough to make the film enjoyable. My main issue is that, although the central characters were believable in their own way, I didn't really connect with them - or even like them. I can then add to that my disappointment with the unfolding of the story itself. Although the storyline promises much, I really felt it was handled in such a way that the result was very unsatisfactory.Peter O'Toole plays an ageing man - who has lived a life of hedonism - with much conviction, but my lack of connection to his character detracted greatly from my enjoyment of his performance. In fact all of the actors in the film performed solidly and can't be faulted but I didn't find myself gripped or intrigued by the characterisations that any of them brought to the screen.For much of the film I am not sure what was supposed to be so enjoyable to watch. I am not particularly amused by the sight of people bleating out expletives about any old nonsense, such as toenails. I have no issue whatsoever with bad language in film, but it seemed as though the scriptwriters believed it would be wonderful to throw in the odd "F" word just to make us laugh (as if we would say how witty to show that the elderly can swear just like the youth ? never mind if it is mindless and unnecessary). When I was 10 I might well have chuckled at the sight of elderly gentlemen saying the F word but I have since come to a point where I seek more depth in a film.I move on to some of the scenes in which Maurice is either propositioning or approaching Jessie. I don't mind that they made me feel awkward; but although the acting was believable, I detected a subversive undertone which didn't appeal to me in this context. I understand that the filmmakers intended to challenge the viewer, and perhaps make us squirm a bit, but there was no deeper plot to flesh out the basic premise of an old man sexually desiring his friend's niece. One scene which sums up the foolishness on the writers part is Maurice telling Jessie that he had been thinking about her "c*nt", I don't mind it being vulgar or over the top, but it makes Maurice seem one dimensionally sex obsessed and not a character I wanted to observe in depth. In fact, I have enjoyed many films which delve into the more challenging and undesirable aspects of sexual behaviour - but those films were ones in which we can understand the characters and their actions. Maurice is what he is, but I wanted to understand him more and the story didn't give me that chance.There were some nice scenes with Maurice and his wife, played admirably by Vanessa Redgrave, and a few other examples of good chemistry between the protagonists. Some of the film was in fact quite humorous and reasonably enjoyable to watch. However, the glimpses of beauty within each character seemed too distant, and certainly too infrequent. The closing scenes hint at a possible change in Jessie and Maurice (before his demise), but it is not very pronounced and neither is it clear that either has really reflected on their less considerate behaviour. I can see what the film was trying to achieve, however for my taste it was off the mark.At the end of the film I was dissatisfied with the message that the film leaves to linger in our memory. If the story took us somewhere that suggests greater depth of character in Maurice or Jessie then I would have been satisfied, but essentially the film suggests hedonism with no thought of others can be acceptable (and funny). Are we supposed to believe that as we grow older it is wise to chase after the same pursuits as we did in our more foolish youth? Such rationale would also suggest that growing old can bring no pleasure of its own, or that it is not possible for us to mature in to new and deeper ways. I felt sorry that Maurice was so shallow that he hadn't found any deeper meaning to life in more than 70 years on earth.Having read many glowing reviews of this film I can see that I am seemingly in the minority. Nevertheless this wasn't one for me. If we had seen more insight in to Maurice's mind and found a depth within him (perhaps a few more redeeming qualities or a more fundamental core of the goodness of humanity) then I would have enjoyed the film immensely. There is nothing wrong to study the struggles of man in film, I just feel Venus hones in on the less interesting and shallower facets of the subject matter. I tried to enjoy Venus and I have considered it carefully but overall I remain very disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best performance of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter O'toole is one of the greatest actors of the world, the best of the best working today. In his latest popular venture, he shines through so immaculately without an effort that many reviewers of the film might just be proved right on their exacting judications about his 'self' appearing constantly in the tricky world of Maurice. And that could just be one of the reasons behind his performance being not provided with the accreditation of that of the most spectacular of the year( it certainly is the most moving ), the one that rightfully deserves the symbol of such vaulting glory- the academy award. That apart from facts as hefty as that his acting in 'Lawrence of Arabia' being declared the best ever committed to the silver screen, his seven futile nominations where some of the most genuine injustices in Oscar history have befallen him. Peter O'toole turns in the most solemnly riveting performance of many years and the most lush, with the huge expanse of emotions. The role brought him an eighth nominal invitation to the ceremony and though as expected of him, he veneered a veil of casualness on his face when it is only but the most heart-felt of emotions that even Maurice couldn't have known more about, that of disappointment. I can not blame him for having appointed for such a late night displeasure of working on live television moments after his historic loss, for eight nominations as the best leading actor are a deluge of screaming talent that when goes unrewarded does become outrageous. Only and only Peter O'toole can embrace defeat with such loving charm and dignity.Watch 'Venus' because Peter O'toole quite gives the best performance of the year; how it overlaps tragedy and comedy with excellent acting; to cry along that wonderful coastal scene; to know what makes Peter O'toole the superlative actor who has surpassed almost everyone among his peers and contemporaries; watch it for Vanessa Redgrave; embrace it for love, life, death and beauty; watch it for Peter O'toole, Peter O'toole, o'toole.... the possibility of this being his last truly great performance. God bless the Academy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderfully Human Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Venus is shining gem of a film. In the tradition of small British films, it rewards the viewer out of all proportion to what the viewer may have expected. At times I laughed so hard there were tears rolling down my cheeks, and at other times my cheeks were slightly damp for another reason. Returning home in the car I was still laughing out loud as I recalled some of the lines from the film.What made this film especially memorable was the ensemble work, the obviously brilliant collaboration among the actors, the director, the screenwriter, the cinematographer, and the music composers. Their mutual efforts gave the film a subdued intensity. This is true teamwork.O'Toole is fully deserving of a "best actor" Oscar, whether he gets one or not. The angry young man's soul still blazes from O'Toole's old-man's eyes. Leslie Phillips would most certainly qualify as "best supporting actor." His fantastic delivery of the writer's lines had me in stitches; a brilliant job. Jodie Whittaker's performance was also perfectly nuanced and spot-on in depicting the wonder of a self-absorbed provincial girl discovering and exploiting the big city.The film is not only the story of an old man's feelings for a very young woman, but almost unnoticed in the background it describes the financial and social hardships associated with aging: cash is short, your friends are dead, your health is fading, love is gone. Sounds pretty bleak until you see this truly charming movie, and then you realize that it's all worth it. This wonderful film is positively life-affirming. Go see it, and enjoy the beauty of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So good to see Peter O'Toole again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Speaking from my own life experience, I have no trouble understanding the movie and the character of Maurice. Best of all, was to see the elegant Mr. Peter O'Toole once again make another magnificent movie. The movie is not only realistic in exposing the trials of old age, it is also realistic in showing that love does not end with age or infirmity and in every situation among every sort of person there is a need for it and where it is needed, it thankfully will blossom, if one allows it to. In this movie, Mr. O'Toole shows himself to be a character, Maurice, who is open to love and to matters of the heart. He also shows himself to be a man who by his very nature must carry on with his life and be with the things and people he loves, rather than shut himself inside his house, oblivious to the world around him. I suspect, Peter O'Toole, is in fact, just the very sort of man, he portrays in the movie. A thoroughly attractive fellow and a kindly man with a lust and love for life and people that does not end with age, as so many people think. God bless him and his entire actors' troupe for sharing that simple truth with us through the lens of this movie. It's a very important message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A swansong not unworthy of O'Toole himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LIKE a director whose output seems almost impossibly varied. Take Karel Reisz, for instance. Who could imagine after watching his Saturday Night, Sunday Morning, raw, smoke-stacked testament to Northern realism, that the same man also made The French Lieutenant's Woman, charming, intelligent in its way but entirely unlike its predecessor? In 1999 Roger Michell made Notting Hill, the shallow, tedious tale of a film star and sexual stirrings in London town. Michell's new release is another movie about a film star and sexual stirrings in the Big City. But what a difference! Venus has all the depth and integrity Notting Hill lacked. Leading man Peter O'Toole is up for a well-deserved Oscar ? eighth time lucky? Sadly, the film itself, its director and its writer, Hanif Kureishi, have not been nominated for Academy awards. As the name suggests, Venus is a love story. For a society like ours, daily tortured by the images of sexual abuse of the young, a synopsis of the plot might at first suggest it treads on slightly dangerous ground. But it's written and directed so deftly, so naturally, so wittily that that thought will, I hope, pass you by. Laced with swearing, booze and nudity, this is a very English feel-good movie. O'Toole, old rake and faded thespian, plays old rake and faded thespian Maurice Russell and does it, as you would expect, with great style. No less accomplished are Leslie Phillips and Vanessa Redgrave as, respectively, his lifelong friend and sparring partner Ian and Maurice's ex-wife. No surprises there, perhaps. But the film's real stunner is 24-year-old newcomer, Jodie Whittaker, who plays fussy Ian's hostile great-niece, Jessie, who has come to live with him. Jessie, like Jodie, a Northern girl awed, if reluctant to show it, by the Big City, becomes the 19-year-old object of Maurice's affections. In his dotage and ailing, the once "gorgeous" actor, still known to his friends as "Professor of pussy", sees in Jessie both the youth and beauty he has lost and some of the fire and spirit he still has. He takes her off Ian's hands, dubs her Venus after the Velasquez painting, gets her some work as an artist's model, yields to her charms whenever she lets him (which is very little), endures her brush-offs, suffers for his lust ? and is finally rewarded with a swansong O'Toole, now 74, might think not unworthy even of his own magnificent career. I used to hope I'd die before I get old. Not any more. Not after this performance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On The Half-Shell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever anyone should have accompanied Michael Douglas and sought therapy for Sex Addition it is surely Hanif Kureishi, who is never happier than when filling TV and movie screens with deviant sex. Not content with with writing about a 70 plus woman enjoying sex with a much younger man he now completes the Daily Double with an account of a 70 something Peter O'Toole lusting after a girl in her early twenties. The opening shot is the sea shore which is there for no apparent reason at that stage (at the death, literally, we journey to the sea shore at Whitstable) other than to 'suggest' the birth of Venus as depicted by Botticelli. Kureishi attempts half-heartedly to divert attention from the 'dirty old man' aspects of O'Toole's lechery by portraying him as something of a 'mentor' to Jodie Whittaker's eponymous Venus, opening her eyes to culture, something ripped off from Educating Rita but Willy Russell is in no position to sue having himself ripped off Pygmalion. What we are left with is an undoubtedly outstanding performance by O'Toole which is light years above the material plus some equally fine support primarily from the luminescent Vanessa Redgrave closely followed by Leslie Phillips and Richard Griffiths. Kureishi is, of course, a darling of the pseuds so it is more or less superfluous to refer yet again to Burns Mantle's query in his review of the Original Broadway production of Pal Joey in 1949 'can you draw sweet water from a foul well'. I know what I think but then I'm not a pseud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can hardly believe the number of comments opining that this was a well-directed and well-written movie. It is completely under-written, then punched up so young people could relate to the profanity. As for the direction, snails-paced and meandering are the best things I can say about it. Some thought this to be exploitative, but I felt that it wanted to be exploitative but was never on-point enough to achieve it. This is a pity. Add to this the fact that Jodie Whittaker is given no direction to go with her feckless and underwritten character, then has no screen chemistry with O'Toole, thus giving us no clue to the old man's obsession with her -- other than her being young, but that is belied by his reaction in other scenes when he interacts with young women. O'Toole does well in his scenes alone with Phillips and some of the other old-timers. And, Vanessa Redgrave adds the film's only touch of class which serves more as an incongruity than an enhancement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter O'Toole Turns Lecher --- Sad Ending to His Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films about older men with much, much younger women can be good. For example, Nick Nolte in The Good Thief or Michael Caine in The Quiet American. Better still, in real life no man ever ought miss having a relationship with a girl 35 or 40 years younger; nor should a young girl ever miss the experience of involvement with an older man.In the case of the Nick Nolte and Michael Caine films, each man remained a truly interesting person whose matured character would be like a magnet to a beautiful young woman regardless of whether she's tired of the immature airheads her own age. Not so with Peter O'Toole in VENUS.Herein O'Toole has evolved into a bored-with-himself doddering old geezer who's more apt to drool half his meal down his shirt than find a believable way of charming a 20 year old. Picture Uncle Junior on The Sopranos chasing after Lindsey Lohan and you get the idea. While O'Toole is shrewd enough to play-the-sympathy of the young woman, his taking another guy's toenail clipping out of his pocket in a public place and waving it around is not the makings of a sly fox. Ugh! Many scenes are alleged to be charming and insightful in VENUS, and therein is the self-delusion of the filmmaker. VENUS is a disgusting movie. The waste can is the place for it.</fullReview>

Overall, the film has a touch of Pygmalion to it, and that is a nice, if tired, theme. However, watching Peter O'Toole kiss such a young neck made me ill. He is actually impotent by this point in the movie, but it detracts little from the gross-out factor. Expect latent themes of elder-passion, both gay and straight. I wish the film had a less skeevy feel to it, because it had the potential to be very special indeed. Instead, I felt like I had spent two hours with someone's lecherous grandfather.

		<fullReview>It is sad when such a great actor as Peter O'Toole seemingly will end his days in such terrible trash as this mess of a picture. The film suffers from a lousy script filled with enough filth to keep the vulgar minded happy! We suffer through vulgar scenes such as a doctor preparing his gloved hand for a rectal examine and O'Toole's legs twinging as he proceeds with the examination, making me wonder whether the director actually enjoys his rectal examines since he filmed the scene with such detail and precision.This film is a jewel as an example of what is wrong with the culture of today. If it is watched as an expose on what our society has fallen to, it is bad enough. If on the other hand it is watched for enjoyment worse still.O'Toole does a great job, as usual, bringing the dirty old man character to life but little else makes this film worth watching. One has to wonder why O'Toole would lower himself to such films. Perhaps it is true that film roles for older people are lacking but it would have been much better if he retired gracefully from the screen then to be seen in such miserable fare as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Venus is a dreadful piece of trash that strips Peter O' Toole of any remaining dignity except for going out as an old age porno star -- if there is any dignity implied in that -- and there just may be with the postmodern directorial sentiments of urban schlock and shock value writ large across the screen. From the sublime to the ridiculous, from Shakespeare to foul mouth swearing, from Venus -- love of the mind, not the eye -- to the total fixation on the body, from prostitution to more prostitution, this movie does not let up. In the end, old age delivers on bad taste.The movie is about a shallow old lech of an actor who is taken up by the physical beauty of a young woman. He is a hedonist who can quote Shakespeare but not understand the lines he recites. Peter O'Toole plays the dirty old man who has nothing to say to the soul of a young woman: a superficial narcissist who has dumped his wife, swears a lot and is left with nothing but a young woman who prostitutes herself to him. Touching and that is what he is allowed to do to her. Peter O' Toole will go out in a pathetic splendor if Hollywood gives him an Oscar for this crap.The most disturbing aspect of this movie is allowing a 14-year old to watch it. It was rated 14a and there are many disturbing scenes that are not fit for minors.</fullReview>

Adding to the creep factor is O'Toole's behavior.

He's not a likable person and neither is Whittaker as the young woman who uses him for material gain.

		<fullReview>Firstly, regarding the comments from "brocksilvey", they are very good except for the part that O'Toole should get an Oscar before he dies. It is important to note that O'Toole has won an Oscar. In 962 he won for Lawrence of Arabia, which is probably one of the best films ever made and he certainly gave a great performance. I also agree that he was magnificent in "The Lion in Winter". Now regarding "Venus". I did not like this movie subject matter, (a bit too dark for me). Nonetheless, I certainly appreciate the performances of both young and seasoned actors. It gets across the sense of loss that people who have lived in the limelight experience when they are no longer the center of attention. Also it exposes the general abandonment that many older people suffer as their friends and family of like-age begin to die. However, this movie does it without the usual over-the-top melodrama usually associated with "golden" age movies. Nor does it astray into unrealistic "old people can do anything" nonsense.Well balanced and very well performed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recap: Maurice, once a great actor, is living out his last days long from the spotlight. His days consists of bit parts in series and chatting away with his friends at their local café, mostly complaining about their old age. Into this comes young Jessie, niece of Maurice's friend Ian. Ian and Jessie don't get along at all, but Maurice is all too eager to get to know her. Over time an odd relationship develop.Comments: A rather odd story actually. At first sight it is about growing old, as the main focus is on Maurice. This is true, but only in part. It is also about two people desperately seeking attention. They are a world apart in their situations, young and old, but oddly enough they can help each other. It isn't easy to tentatively develop such a relationship, a complex mix of friendship, adoration and sexual desire, but this is also what gives the story life. Not always very nice to watch, but one might say interesting.The story is mainly focused about Maurice, so the pace is a little slower, as Maurice against his own will is forced to slow down his life, despite trying to living it large for Jessie. It also give Peter O'Toole the chance to shine with a complex and difficult character. And he does, his nomination for an Oscar was well earned, and without the stiff competition he might have won it. Actually, O'Toole's acting and Maurice's dark humor is far and away the best with this movie. It is really what makes this move worthwhile. And it is well worth the time.Jodie Whittaker, almost giving her screen debut as Jessie is not given an easy task either. But she gives an impressive performance. If Maurice and O'Toole is a waning star, Whittaker seems like a rising one.Not really my kind of movie, a little slow and the genre is not my favorite. However the acting and Maurice's almost charming sarcastic humor made me like it, even if it won't get top rating from me.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Venus (2006) ** 1/2 (out of 4) A veteran actor (Peter O'Toole) finds himself feeling young again when he meets a wilder twenty-something woman (Jodie Whittiker) and the two become friends. I really, really wanted to enjoy this film more than I did because there are some very good moments but in the end it's really nothing we haven't seen countless times before. The screenplay didn't seem to know if it wanted to be a comedy about being old or a drama about being old and in the end the film felt really uneven to me. The one saving grace is of course Peter O'Toole who delivers another wonderful performance. His comic timing during the comedy was well done but he really shined during some of the more dramatic moments. The dinner scene with him and his wife (Vanessa Redgrave) was beautifully done. Newcomer Whittiker also did a very good job as did the supporting cast. This film is worth seeing for O'Toole but it's just a shame he didn't have a better screenplay to work with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie only gets stars because of its stars and their performances. They took a totally incomprehensible piece of crap plot and screenplay and pulled as much real feeling and humanism out of it as they possibly could.I was excited to see this movie if only for the reason that Peter O'Toole is in it. His performance is well-acted and realistic as far as the character is portrayed, and he holds nothing back, as usual. The supporting cast, Phillips, Redgraves, Griffiths, and newcomer Whitaker, are believable as people, if not in actions.This movie purports to be about an old man falling in love with a young girl and their realistic, not necessarily romantic, resulting actions. Romanticized love slash raw realism I expected. I looked forward with interest.I cannot say that what took place on screen wasn't real. But if that was their real relationship it was truly a sad thing. Not even tragic, just plain sad. Maurice beggars himself for small doses of what passes for returned affection or even just returned lust from a young twit who's trading finger-licks for whatever she can squeeze out of her admirer. She offers herself and when he responds, whether with affection or lust, she calls him a dirty old man. He sees her for what she is, but gets upset when she rejects him or takes advantage of him.The "climatic" scene was quite plainly what Maurice deserved from Jessie. Lay down in the road and someone will run over you. It wasn't dramatic, or even shocking, it was just horrid.Just what was the point of this movie? I really tried to find one.As for reports of it being comedic drama, they need to get a dictionary and look up both terms again.Some may consider this a slice of "real" life, and maybe it is. However, that does not make it entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unlikely combination: lovely and repugnant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think we can pinpoint the time at which Peter O'Toole stopped being an Actor (with a Capital "A") and became a Movie Star with the 1982 film "My Favorite Year," in which his character, Alan Swann, actually says "I'm not an actor, I'm a movie star!" (Jack Nicholson has passed through the same metamorphosis; he now plays the "Jack Nicholson role" in every one of his movies.)Why tamper with success?I was anxious to see "Venus" because I am such an O'Toole fan, and I was intrigued to see how much of his innate dignity he would maintain while playing a character, an old thespian named Maurice, who was largely billed as a "dirty old man." My frustration came at seeing Maurice, who quotes from Shakespeare so mellifluously and has had such a storied career on the legitimate stage reduced to his baser instincts. His best friend and roommate, a fellow actor named Ian (Leslie Phillips) requires a caregiver, and a young woman whom Maurice dubs Venus (Jodie Whittaker) is hired for the job. What neither she nor Maurice expect is that he will attempt to relive his salad days as a randy young actor through Venus, but not with her.Whittaker comes off quite well in her first film, and doesn't seem intimidated in the face of playing practically all her scenes with a legend. But the things the script asks Maurice to request and Venus to provide debase both characters.When sex is not Topic A, O'Toole infuses his role with his customary élan, and a touch of (perhaps) unexpected pathos. Another unexpected joy in "Venus" is the presence of Vanessa Redgrave, as Maurice's ex-wife. She is truly luminous and on screen far too briefly. In their scenes together, O'Toole and Redgrave are acting on the same plane, and I yearned for more of that throughout the film. The scenes with Ian and Maurice come across as childish and infantile by comparison, a fate the occasionally witty barb they toss in each other's direction can't conceal.The same writer, Hanif Kureishi, and director, Roger Michell, brought us "The Mother" in 2003, a film which might or might not be equally off-putting as "Venus" depending on your point of view. But I greatly admire "The Mother," partly because its lead character, marvelously played by Anne Reid, retains the viewer's sympathy throughout almost the entire film. She is so vulnerable and such an emotional wreck that her plight is understandable even if her attempted resolution is not. The same might be said of Maurice, except that he seems to be more manipulative than vulnerable. Yes, he's suffering the vagaries of old age, but he is emotionally balanced. (Maurice does know who he is, despite his protestation to the contrary to Redgrave.)The desire to recapture lost youth is a perennial one, and Maurice's character is an Everyman in that regard. I just wish that his journey had been more dignified and "respectable". Had it been so, I believe Peter O'Toole would have at long last received the competitive Oscar that has eluded him for decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O'Toole shines, of course, but rest of film is flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's true, Peter O'Toole is not quite dead yet, and neither is his wonderful career. In an Oscar-nominated performance, O'Toole plays Maurice Russell, a veteran of stage and screen in the twilight of his existence who unexpectedly finds himself falling for a woman fifty years younger than him. It's a classic romance.Every day, Maurice comes 'round to visit his friend Ian, also a longtime actor, who is convalescing. Ian has procured for himself someone to take care of him, the daughter of his niece. Jessie (Jodie Whittaker) is in her early twenties and is aimless, jobless, and even somewhat expressionless, and it's not long before she and Ian are locking horns. From the moment Maurice sets eyes on the girl, she's either stuffing her face or guzzling some of Ian's booze. Oh, and she wants to be a model.Maurice becomes quite taken with the girl, although the feeling certainly doesn't seem to be mutual. But really, how could it be? Maurice is supposed to be in his seventies (although here O'Toole looks about 95), and Jessie is in her twenties. When you were in your twenties, didn't anyone at least old enough to be your father seem, you know, kind of decrepit in your mind? There's simply no realistic scenario that would have Jessie falling madly in love with Maurice, and thankfully that never really happens.But then what exactly does Jessie see in Maurice? Well, for one thing, as Ian dislikes her on sight, Maurice is kind and giving - he even attempts to find a modeling job for her, albeit as a nude model. He calls Jessie "Venus" because of a painting they see depicting the goddess. (Hey, it's as good a reason as any.) So there's sort of a symbiotic relationship going on - Jessie gets support from Maurice, because Ian is better able to put up with her if Maurice is on her side, and Maurice gets to leer at her with a crooked grin. That might have been appealing, say, twenty years ago, but Peter O'Toole looks wan and about to keel over. I know, that's how the character was supposed to look anyway, but the whole relationship felt a little creepy, to be honest. Perhaps that's why Jessie isn't painted as a complete innocent but rather as a young woman reveling in her many flaws.This was O'Toole's eighth Oscar nomination (he's never won), and he did deserve it - his Maurice is elegant, whimsical, charming, and lecherous, all traits associated with O'Toole in real life. O'Toole brings quite a bit of gravitas and wit to an otherwise lightweight, pedestrian role, and his mere presence livened up every scene. Whittaker, surprisingly, is certainly his equal, matching her famous costar in even their most intimate, lowest-key scenes.Speaking of which, I had to fuss with the volume several times. Some of the scenes are SO low key that you can't hear what anyone's saying, and yet in other scenes the volume's at normal level. It's as if the director thought that merely having his fine actors recite serious lines in a serious setting was not enough, so he made them mumble them, too. A little irritating.All in all, this is a slow movie that strives to find great, deep meaning in Relationships, Aging, and Death but fails to completely deliver on any of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Infirm but Indominitable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Do no let me hear Of the wisdom of old men, but rather of their folly . . . ."T.S. EliotIn Venus, Maurice (Peter O'Toole) is an aging thespian who meets a buddy's young housekeeper, Jessie (Jodie Whittaker), and forms a friendship partly built on his impotent, prurient interest in her as the embodiment of Velazquez's Venus and her inherent sassiness and openness, refreshing for a man who has known many artful and manipulative women. For her sake, the working-class Jessie is moved by his kindness and a respect as she discovers he is "a little famous." And caring.Although O'Toole plays Maurice too infirm for me, he is as always a delight to watch. The script lingers too much on close ups that require no dialogue, and the dialogue is too spare for me, who wants to hear O'Toole intone like a Shakespearean with limitless time to recite. When he is talking with his friends, I would have liked spirited discourse, not just one liners about pills and parts. His lines with Jessie are limited by her lack of education in the Pygmalion tradition.As good as Maurice and Jessie are at affectionately sparring with each other, Maurice and his ex-wife Valerie (Vanessa Redgrave) are a match to die for, perfectly modulated responses to their love, even in the face of his blundering exile from her and their child for a young actress years ago. Their affection is palpable, almost teary-eyed, as they face the end in a forgiving manner that allows only caring to dominate, not recrimination. And that low-key sentimentality is characteristic of this enjoyable film, in which old age is infirm but indomitable, longing to be more vital but accepting time's restrictions.Jesse's growing love of Maurice, and his of her, is the visible symbol of the film's assertion that love, be it between friends, old flames, or generations, will survive another day. Seeing O'Toole once more in a meaty leading role is as well an emblem of greatness that endures beyond the physical fading to black.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O'Toole is growing old un-gracefully</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter O'Toole is Peter O'Toole, well he's actually Maurice but you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise in this scarily autobiographical role. He is playing an ageing actor in his twilight years knocking on heavens door so to speak and he is marvellous. With brilliant support from Leslie Phillips as his best mate Ian its like 'Withnail &amp; I' revisited. Jodie Whittaker is pure chav as Jessie as she enters the old men's lives and starts to cause Bacardi Breezer fuelled madness. Maurice always a ladies man falls for her and names her Venus (after one of his favourite paintings) but unfortunately his mind may be up for it but sadly his body is not. Struggling to come to terms with his inability to pull like he used to and keep up with the young he tries to woo Jessie with culture and art and this unlikely friendship see them both learn a lot about themselves and each other. From side-splittingly laugh out loud to heartbreakingly beautiful moments this film has it all and the script by Hanif Kureishi is full of chances for O'Toole and Phillips to shine as the grumpy old couple. Low on budget but high on life the film is peppered with meditations on what it's like to grow old and see your own impending closure creeping ever closer. It could have been over sentimental but it cleverly avoids all the clichés and with the fabulous performances, O'Toole is Oscar nominated, it is a pleasure to watch. It must have been a hard role to play for O'Toole as it is so close to reality but he handles it with a grace only he could and its great to see him having fun and showing everyone he has still got it as an actor and when all is said and done its been an hour and a half in the company of some fine British talent and just like the painting from which it takes its name it is a work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relic Romeo finds his Venus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 31 films I saw there this makes my top five. What can one say about Peter O'Toole that hasn't been said. His presence in this film alone made me want to see it and it's truly a lead role as he is in almost every on screen scene. At 74 lead roles in quality films must be as hard to come by as the character he plays in this film. O'Toole is Maurice, an aging film and stage star who still actively seeks out a role here and there and demands to be paid in cash on the spot for his work. His days are spent chumming around with a retired actor that he has known for 50 years Ian (Leslie Phillips) who is looking forward to his teenage grand niece coming to live with him as a housekeeper/caretaker. Jesse (Jodie Whittaker) has no skills in caring for an aged great uncle and very little social skills coming from a small town to the big city and being at Ian's is the last thing she wants to do as she aspires an unrealistic goal to be a fashion model. Maurice, who once had a reputation of being quite a lady's man is now creaky Casanova and is smitten with Jesse. The aging amorist launches into a courtship for Jesse's attention before he takes his final bow. Vanessa Redgrave is Valerie, Maurice's former wife and they still care very much for each other. Former Royal Shakepeare Company director Roger Michell who made the transition to directing several successful films directs a story from former playwright Haris Zambarloukos. O'Toole has received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his role here. He's been nominated seven times before and has never won although the Academy did award him a special Lifetime Achievement Oscar in 2003 of which he reluctantly accepted citing that his career was not over. He indeed proves there was more to come in him with this role. Forest Whitiker in Last King of Scotland must be the odds-on favorite for Best Actor but O'Toole could pull it out from under Whitaker as not just a sentimental favorite but as a fine actor as a long-lived Lothario for Venus. A nice blend of sensitivity and comedy here. Some R rated language and situations. Great soundtrack from British pop singer Corrine Bailey Rae. I would give this an 8.5 out of 10 and recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the last year I have watched well over 100 films, probably more than 200, and very few of them have pleased and stunned me as much as this small independent British film.A simple story of an unlikely relationship between an old actor near the end of his days and the young unvarnished grand-niece of a friend, it is brave, funny, truthful and moving. The clichés inherent in a tale of a dirty old man's burgeoning obsession and a shallow and somewhat damaged young woman's readiness to take advantage of it take on far greater depth than the simple scenario might indicate.Peter O'Toole, always impressive, has never been better but Jodie Whittaker, in her first major role, holds her own. Leslie Phillips, Vanessa Redgrave, and Richard Griffiths in supporting roles lend sterling support.There is laugh-out-loud humour (particularly if you are getting on in years), there is some very rough language (much of which is justified), there are some shocks and, above all, there is truth. It is never too late to learn, and both the lead characters do so.A wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncomfortable Truths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carrying the torch for Britain's great heritage of kitchen-sink dramas, we have 'Venus'.Peter O'Toole demonstrates a calibre of acting that few modern players could scarcely emulate, and at an age when most would struggle to remember their own names, let alone their lines. He plays to type; an ageing Thespian growing old in grace, and with humane and vulnerable decency. Somehow, (I missed the very beginning) he falls-in with a delinquent young woman who proceeds to take advantage of the conflict between his declining abilities and his still-unquenched desire. There's something not quite well with her too. And in time, we learn that she herself has been the subject of earlier abuse and loss, and in convoluted pathology is revenging herself upon his vulnerable condition. He is the first person over whom she has had power. And, having been abused, turns abuser.Some of the scenes of private intercourse between they two are both tragic and offensive, yet at the same time starkly real. They are so well presented as to make viewers uncomfortable, like unwilling voyeurs, compelled to observe moments of disagreeable intimacy with which we can easily identify but would sooner not see for that very reason.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is very much a voice for old age, and - heaven knows - in Britain today age needs loud voices. The elderly die for want of common necessaries in the 3rd millennium almost as quietly and cruelly as they did in the 19th century. They're scorned, maltreated and neglected in ways that disgrace any first-world country. Contempt could not be more manifest than by reference to our doomed hero as a 'dirty old man', for possessing no more than the timeless instincts of younger men. As if, in age, that were somehow a sin. At what year does sex become dirty? In a world were relationships may cross race, religion, and even gender orientation, (discrimination against all of which have been outlawed); a relationship that crosses generations still excites hostile reproof. And never moreso than since the post 60's adoption of 'youth' culture. The young woman in this movie is above the age of majority. She is perfectly capable of making her own informed decision. What then; is an old white man an inferior or immoral choice compared to a young black one? If both adults give informed consent, what business is it of anyone else? Happily, age-discrimination is being outlawed in this country, but it will be a long march to remedy our culture of petty resentment. If older people had the same legal protection as homosexuals (and why not, they being more vulnerable?) then that would be a step in the right direction, and senior citizens might at last come in from the cold.Everyone should watch this movie, and think about growing old. Because, if they live long enough; everybody does. And its no sin; it's no disgrace. The covenant of youth is not betrayed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best of films, this is the worst of films. The best include O'Toole's scenes with his wife, Vanessa Redgrave. Their kiss is beautiful. Richard Griffiths is very good as one of his friends but even better is Leslie Phillips. Their meetings in the café are excellent as is the last scene with O'Toole and Venus at Whitstable.The worst include an unnecessary sprinkling of the F and C words. They added nothing but coarseness. Also a couple of scenes with Venus and O'Toole, are unpleasant, particularly the finger smelling one, which is disgusting.O'Toole is so good as a lecher that he must always have been one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning O'Toole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. There is a certain nostalgia with watching one of the all-time greats succeed again. I would urge viewers not to fall into that simple trap here. While it is an amazing performance by Lawrence of Arabia himself, Peter O'Toole, the movie itself is nothing special and actually a bit sloppy.The first part is mood setting proving to us that Maurice (O'Toole) and Ian (Leslie Phillips) are both old and hating it. Maurice has much more spirit than Ian, but Ian is a bit excited that his 20 yr old great-niece is coming to live with him. He imagines being nursed and pampered ... "without the uniform". Maurice still has a load of romance within even while struggling with his prostate. The running gag is the "type-casting" of O'Toole as a corpse.The film picks up a bit when Ian's niece Jessie (played well by newcomer Jodie Whittaker)appears. Of course, she is nothing like what Ian had hoped and they are both miserable from day one. Maurice immediately falls for her young, off-beat charms and the challenge afforded. Initially it is kind of cute to see the two characters, more than 50 years apart in age, struggle to communicate. However, it quickly disintegrates into a quite creepy, even sleazy situation where O'Toole ogles and fondles the youngster. Not at all pleasant to watch.Director Roger Michell ("Changing Lanes", "Notting Hill") keeps the sets dark and the lighting obvious in most scenes. His direct approach at the topic is what causes the film to fail. Without giving much away, O'Toole gets much pain through his connection with Jessie, but the obvious eventual salvation feels phony and unrealistic.See this one for the performances of not only O'Toole and Whittaker, but also Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Griffiths and Leslie Phillips. Just be prepared for major-creep factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O'Toole gives a sterling Oscar worthy performance in this gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>VENUS (2006) *** Peter O' Toole, Jodie Whittaker, Leslie Phillips, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Griffiths. O'Toole gives another sterling Oscar caliber performance.Like a lion in the winter ? and excuse the pun in re: to this being a title of one of his films from his pact ? Peter O'Toole gives yet another sterling Oscar calibre performance (the man has never won but been nominated 7 times prior; another crime against the Academy! His last nod was for one of my favorite films, "My Favorite Year" in 1982, nearly 25 years ago!!!), that may clinch a statuette for the former Golden Boy himself.Playing close to typecast, O'Toole stars as Maurice Russell, an aged actor of some celebrity whose mark is on the wane getting bit parts as dying coots here and there when he's not hanging out with fellow geezer thespians Ian (Phillips) and Donald (Griffiths) in their favorite tavern in London. With little to do but trade pharmaceuticals and ailments while reading the obits to see which of their contemporaries has left this mortal coil, the friends don't have much to do in between naps and loneliness.Enter Jessie, Ian's grand niece, who is sent to live with him to take care of his household needs and cooking but instead proves to be a slovenly disaster area with her blunt meanness and obstinate demeanor with the ridiculous notion of gaining a job as a professional model when her appearance ? although lovely ? is in a perpetual state of unkempt disarray. Upon his first meeting with his friend's new charge, Maurice is absolutely smitten with the gorgeous young woman, and his charm has some uneven affect on her ? she's at first off-put and revolted by the old man's abruptness but then realizes he's a kindred spirit. Maurice is not necessarily wanting her for sex ? even after his operation nearly rendering him impotent ? but instead a special needs vanity project where he mentors her in the cultural arts, making her outward appearance better reflect her inner and ultimately falling in love one last time before time runs out for himself.Directed by Roger Michell does a fine job with the up and down screenplay by Hanif Kureishi (although both collaborated on 2003's "The Mother" which I didn't see, it is apparent both are in sync with their sensibilities here. A showcase for O'Toole's thinly- veiled biographical turn ? a formerly glamorous, raconteur playboy with devilish wit and verve on display in his now 'golden years' as a faded movie star who apparently has been put out to pasture ? proves to still have 'it' - true talent and that star quality in one of the year's best performances. His Maurice may be a tad vainglorious and borderline pathetic but he ultimately makes him empathetic and more importantly, touchingly human. Co-star Phillips is a riot as the ever-maladious complaining co-hort who is just as lost and confused as his compatriot. Newcomer Whittaker gives as good as she gets in her thrust-and-parry chemistry with O' Toole and has her moments as well, with her woman-child busting at the seams with ripe Lolitaesque sensuality but saves her character's cartoon-ization in the long run allowing dignity and again, love &amp; self-respect to come through.The main quibble I had is the last act of the screenplay where Jessie's barely spoken of 'boyfriend' enters the film and the results seem rushed and quite frankly improbably idiotic making Jessie ? "Venus" (dubbed by Maurice after a museum visit) ? less than sympathetic.Again it is nice to see O'Toole, arguably the last of his kind, embrace a role with gusto and his few scenes with the legendary Redgrave as his ex-wife imbue the film with a nostalgic melancholy of exquisite beauty; a rare gem indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. O'Toole 10+/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another IMDb.com member, "Acting Sans Botox", commented:"This is one of those movies that grows on you oncethe credits are done. Quickly paced, sharply writtenand deftly acted, Venus is a movie that unfolds soquickly that one is immersed in the action from thevery start."1) for me it grew on me just before the end.2) it is quickly paced, even though I found it to be slow... or better said, gently paced, and definitely not plodding.3) I wasn't immersed in the action, just Mr. O'Toole's wonderful personality, grace, and skill as an actor.4) finally, if Jodie Whitakker didn't deliver a strong performance then the movie would have appeared cheap tawdry and in bad taste. As such it stood up and turned out to be wonderful.5) some have called it a "May-December" romance (that's what I thought it was going to be and thus my distaste), however it is NOT a romance. While Maurice (pron. Morris, Mr. O'Toole) is trying to woo Jessica (Whitakker), there is only trying.In fact, I hated this movie at first, but Mr. O'Toole is so wonderful to watch I stuck with it, then it grew on me, and then ... I was in tears. 10+/10-LD_____________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You will wish they would make more movies like that these days. Won't be possible without actors like O'Toole though. If anyone can call himself an actor and hence is qualified to receive a "Best Actor" award - it is Peter O'Toole ! A fascinating movie. Has all the ingredients: Sweet, Somber, Moral, Controversial, Sexy, Funny - combined with fine acting. No shoot'em up explosions, no shots fired ! Just dialog, acting and good cinematography... Compares to classic movies Gregory Peck style. Here is O'Tooles really deserved &amp; earned Oscar. The score is simple but fitting. Unfortunately a too short appearance by Vanessa Redgrave. Finally, Leslie Phillips is a fine counterpart for O'Toole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Women love to be admired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just before I saw the movie I read a bad review about it. I went anyway and did not regret it one second.I consider some movies art. This was one of them. I love the British for showing real people. Old people. Young people. People in real life situations and surroundings. I think Peter O'Toole and Vanessa Redgrave are beautiful. Their old faces are expressive and impressive.The movie brought back flashes of memories when old men were trying to get a little bit too close to my teenage self. Touching, kissing, sniffing. I remember being flattered, proud, feeling important and admired. I started to feel like a desirable woman for the first time. Only later I learned about dirty old men and that I might have been in danger. But I do not really think, I was. I think, it is all about pleasure given and taken. So those of you expressing your disgust, lighten up. There is no penetration of any kind in this movie.The film brought old memories back. It also gave me a more encouraging outlook on old age. Lately I was getting depressed, that I would not be able to survive without cosmetic surgery, botox or other snips and tucks, as it has become so unfashionable in this society to show your age. But the movie proves to you , it is all about relationships in life. Nothing else matters. You need to interact with other human beings not with surgical instruments to enjoy life. It is a film about humanity and what better actor to portray humanity than Peter O'Toole. I hope, he finally gets the Oscar he deserves.Please go and see the movie. I saw nothing wrong with it and gave it a perfect 10 because of the pleasure it gave to me. This is one of the few movies I will buy on DVD because I know I can watch it many times.</fullReview>

It was a sympathetic look at old age without being too sentimental about it at the same time. Why would a young 17 year old know of Shakespeare and why would the old man know of Kylie....these two worlds were thrown together and both found ways to appreciate each other.Redgrave was excellent as was Leslie Philips...."I am praying for euthanasia" and many other excellent lines.Excellent - 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In need of Hollywood-style discretion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were lots of things to like about this film, mainly the set-decor for the interiors such as the the old men's rendezvous cafe and their cluttered flats. The Thames-side Regents Canal scenes, like the stately home film-set, the actors' memorial church and English seaside smacked of the tourism promotion shots familiar from Richard Curtis films.The old men were well-portrayed in terms of contrasting characters, with a comic turn from Leslie Phillips and self-effacing support from Griffiths. Vanessa Redgrave turned her usual sterling performance as the deserted but forgiving wife.I've endured enough Hollywood couplings of older men with younger women over the years to be prepared for a Spring/September romance, but Jessie, emotionally, educationally and financially vulnerable, was too easy a target for O'Toole's lechery. Shots of O'Toole's leering eyes and yellow teeth were too graphic, despite the face-lift ironing out some of the wrinkles, and I began to long for some soft-focus in the close-ups. I never thought I'd praise Hollywood for discretion, but we are usually spared the spectacle of geriatric tongues licking young flesh, and the hero's post-operative urine bag strapped to his leg. The spectacle of slobbering and groping was too nasty to be glossed over by waltzing to a church quartet or a seaside paddle.What was all that stop-and-start camera work on the final journey at about? I'm sorry to say it, but I suspect it was so the tourists could look at the scenery.Homage to aging actors are one thing, but when it's achieved with such cynicism and so little left to the imagination it leaves a nasty taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Boring movie. The acting is fine, but that cannot make this movie good. Toenail humor does not work. Shame on Peter O'Toole. If Hulk Hogan had done this film, viewers would admit it sucks bigtime. But, Peter "deserves" an award. He is a good actor. Yep.The cast is fine and they have a few scenes that are worth seeing. Some of the dialog, especially between Peter and his old sho-biz buds, are laughable. Unfortunately those few scenes are like strawberries in a garbage can. The totality of this film is not entertaining.If you want to see three old men having fun with their years, watch Going in Style with George Burns. The Three Stooges did not have to resort to proctologist finger closeups and needles being inserted into skin to get big laughs.Watchability is what this movie lacks. There is no way a group of friends will get together on a yearly basis to watch this poor excuse for entertainment. In the old days of Elvis movies and Gene Autry movies, the plot revolved around a song that led to a fight and a fight that led to a song. This movie has an attempted joke that leads to a disgusting moment which leads to a close up of someone's yellow teeth and then someone's foot.Peter O'Toole looks too sick here to be playing the part of a patient. Put a sheet over him and get it over with. I believe Peter could still do a really good movie. He could do something exciting. He could do real comedy again as he has done before. He will need makeup and hair and a stunt double, of course.If catheters were funny, we would see more of them onstage in Las Vegas.The Emperor has no clothes. I hope this is not Peter's last hurrah.Boo.Tom Willett</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Venus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Venus" starts out slowly and even comes across as depressing. But this is to be expected, because Venus is about old men, Maurice (Peter O'Toole) and Ian (Leslie Phillips) who already see the writing on the wall: they are going to die. Most of the jokes that Maurice and Ian tell each other in the beginning are centered on that theme. In one scene, Maurice remarks that he has cornered the market for roles involving dead people. There is also a sense of gloom when one sees Maurice with his wife Valerie (Vanessa Redgrave).But then the story, which starts off as depressing, slow and morbid, evolves into something else. Ian has agreed to accept his grand-niece, Jessie (Jodie Whittaker), into his home. He naively believes this girl will cook for him, clean the house and come to his aid whenever he rings the bell. Moreover, he notes that since Jessie is fond of music, she would no doubt like Bach's St. Matthew's Passion. It never seems to have occurred to Ian that Jessie was into more contemporary music. Jessie turns out to be a nightmare and Ian, in a fit of desperation, begs Maurice to take care of her instead. Maurice, who has a weakness for younger women, agrees; and what follows is probably one of the most unlikely and interesting relationships ever put on screen.Venus is not a naive love story. It is far more honest and far more complicated than that. A has-been actor, Maurice knows he will die soon and simply derives as much pleasure from the relationship with Jessie as he can, even if it amounts to the act of holding her hand or making her smile.There is a certain mystery surrounding Jessie's feelings for Maurice. We do not know whether Jessie loves him or, if so, to what degree. Jessie used him most of the time to pay for drinks at the bar, a pair of earrings and then a snake tattoo. She even strikes him when he is unable to pay for her dress. But she is not a horrible person. Instead, she is troubled and suffers from low self-esteem, as reflected in her tendency to sleep with men who treat her poorly. She has great difficulty articulating her own feelings, because throughout her life no one really loved her. At the same time, she is capable of showing genuine warmth, as revealed in a scene where she is clearly concerned when Maurice collapses during a performance.Finally, Maurice and Jessie clash even when they do not mean to. In the beginning and middle of the film, Jessie does not know how to respond to the kindness and patience shown by Maurice. Maurice cannot stand her philandering ways, even though he does not put up much of a complaint until the end. They have trouble understanding their different worlds, but eventually they do. In the end, Maurice and Jessie are changed in a negative and positive way by the time they have spent with each other.As you may already guess, I thought the film was brilliant. I was bored with some of the scenes in the beginning, but the film really evolved into something meaningful to me. Peter O'Toole gives a great performance as Maurice and it is a shame he did not win an Oscar for the role -- he had already been denied nine times before. But I would also like to draw attention to Jodie Whittaker. She took on a very difficult role in Venus -- that of Jessie -- but was able to master it like few actresses can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter O'Toole received the latest of several unsuccessful Oscar nominations for his performance in this film, and while he certainly sparkles as an aging actor, I'm not altogether convinced he would have deserved to win: his every move is eminently watchable, but at times the overall impression of this movie is dangerously reminiscent of Harry Enfield's 'Old Gits'. The film itself is an engaging piece of whimsy, about O'Toole's engagement with a young girl, and while there are some nicely judged moments, overall I wasn't completely convinced by the dynamic of their relationship, and the girl herself is not a particularly interesting character. But it's still very pleasant to watch, thanks mainly to the entertaining interaction of the the older members of the cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we have a premise for a great film with a touching story on life and the effects of age. However, the script moves away from that and becomes the story of a dirty, foul-mouthed, old man who lusts after a girl 60 years his junior. What really gets me is how she uses him to get things and he plays along. Surely the great Peter O'Toole has more dignity than that. It has some good scenes, such as Maurice making a pilgrimage back to his old stomping grounds, but it ends on a sour note and we are left wanting more. In my opinion, the script starts out fine, but then goes into a downward spiral of mindless lust, nude modeling, and a rather humorous fight. Overall disappointing.</fullReview>

And even though they had to actually be able to watch and understand scenes that last longer than 3 seconds, they loved it. This movie is filled with meaning.

		<shortDescription>"Venus" Mythology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the mythology of "Venus" that's going around...people would lead you to believe that this is Peter O'Toole's Oscar winning performance at long last. I love O'Toole as much as the next film enthusiast and stage fanatic--but, c'mon. He's had his chances and has been seriously overlooked in the past. If this truly is his swan song from film (and I, for one, hope that it isn't), then, this was more flattery for the man than substance for the film--and I really wanted to like it, but, 6 is as high as I can go.O'Toole plays the septuagenarian thespian, Maurice Russell, who has fallen for his "old fruit" fellow once actor, Ian's (Leslie Phillips) great niece Jessie (Jodie Whittaker). So smitten is Maurice that he dubs the 20 year old diamond in the rough "Venus." This is a plot pregnant with possibilities, but, becomes raw and uncomfortable pretty darn quick, I'm afraid. When I found out that this film is based on a book from the same guy who was behind the book-to-film "Mother," I wasn't a bit surprised. That was another film that went dark rather than illuminating and raw instead of real. I'm not saying that "people of a certain age" can't be sexual and sensuous, but, there's no need to make them degraded, either. The oft mentioned scene where Venus allows Maurice to sniff her fingers for a tattoo is nothing but demoralizing. But, I have to say, all of the scenes that were between Venus and Maurice--or at least the one's that centered around rewarding him for his gifts--seemed staged and awkward...for the actors, not the characters.I was far more interested in the relationship between Maurice and his estranged wife, Valerie (Vanessa Redgrave--always fabulous). Their time together on stage is brief, but, those are the scenes with the most meat in them. It was in these scenes where I could see where the film was trying to go, but, it had no idea how to get there. Also enjoyable are the diner scenes with Maurice, Ian, and their friend, Donald (Richard Griffiths). The language that seemed to offend a lot of viewers didn't bother me. Having been backstage most of my life, that's how actors talk--so having three semi-retired old actors speaking that way seemed for some reason normal.In the end, I knew what was going to happen, only the details were somewhat unknown. Venus's sudden Epiphany seemed a little forced to me and everything got wrapped up a little too tidy. These are all script problems--the actors did their best with what they had.In the end, if nothing else, I hope this makes O'Toole rethink his retirement. He needs a better vehicle to go out with...this, sadly, wasn't it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harold and Maude In Reverse ...Only Subtler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've gotta love dirty old men to enjoy something like VENUS. It certainly hits home with those in the 70 or older range who've lost their sexual physical attributes in some fashion, yet retain their psychological need for female companionship.The freshness of Venus is that we get to see Peter O'Toole (CASANOVA) play an age-appropriate role and do it so well that he takes over the entire film. The downside is that there's little else to give accolades to.Kind of a reverse HAROLD AND MAUDE (1971), Venus switches the sexes and puts the age on the man and the youth on the woman. The woman is Jessie (newcomer Jodi Whittaker), the barely-out-of-her-teens niece of a friend of Maurice's (O'Toole). Maurice's buddy, Ian (Leslie Phillips), thought his niece might help take care of him, even liven up his rather dreary and mundane life. But when Jessie turns out to be an embittered and angry young woman whose only wish is to eat and drink him out of house and home, Ian runs and hides in his bedroom.Enter Maurice who takes an instant liking to Jessie (he calls her Venus). Sexually attracted to her yet battling prostate cancer, Maurice and Venus teach each other the wiles of their ages. Maurice is a down-and-out actor who mainly plays dead or dying characters on TV programs ("Typecast again"). But he's also a lover and a married man. Like many in the film industry, his relationship with his wife is distant; so distant, in fact, that he doesn't live with her (his wife played by the esteemed and understated Vanessa Redgrave). To battle boredom, he and his friend Ian throw their many prescriptions on tables in a game to see who can find the greatest combination of pills that'll numb them out. Enjoying the female body more than he should, Maurice entices Venus to go out with him. Being bored, she accepts.Little does Maurice know, though, that this Venus is just as dangerous as the real goddess. Don't mess with love! She learns that her new paramour is quick to lust and gradually taunts him with her desirables. Why she does this isn't quite clear, but it appears to be a way to regain her composure she lost from a previously bad relationship (one that involved a pregnancy and her forceful mother).Although the unusual nature of their relationship is one of the more interesting aspects, it is O'Toole who, even in his advanced age (74?), carries off the dirty old man persona with equal parts disgust and longing. Whittaker (Venus/Jessie) tries hard to keep up but fails often in believability. Her line delivery often falls flat or overly-dramatic. Rarely does she hit the middle of the road, which is where O'Toole lives and breathes.That said, this isn't a bad film to spend a night watching. It holds more interest than most movie rental dregs currently lining your Blockbuster store. And it'll make you think about what awaits you in old age, be you a man or a woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lovely film - truly British. It's the sort of film, using gentle humour and quiet sadness, that the Brits are really good at making. Peter O'Toole plays a fabulously dirty old man - showing us that old men have the same feelings as young men inside. Jodie Whittaker shows that she has a great future as an actress. Leslie Phillips - what can I say - what a pro - a delightful performance showing the strength and frailty of an old man in equal measures. The real star? "The Neptune" pub on Whitstable beach. If you go there on a pilgrimage there is a sign on a chair in the pub saying "Peter O'Toole sat here" - truly British!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved everything about this film with the possibly exception of a couple of jumpy edits. Everybody in it is wonderful but I was particularly moved by the scenes between Peter O'Toole and Venessa Redgrave and wished for more of them together--in another film please! The script is exceptionally touching and witty and everybody was up for it including me. The photography in the interior intimate scenes is reminiscent of the light in a Dutch masterpiece and the movie was worth watching just for that.Why is there no soundtrack available for this? I was delighted with the adaptations of the Slavonic Dances of Dvorak for a string quartet which was played in the church and also splendid distortions of Erik Satie's music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching old people is uncomfortable in our society. And elderly sexuality is definitely a taboo for us. No spoilers here-- there's no sex, per se. But the themes of sex do play out quite a bit. As O'Toole's character is an aging actor who used to be 'gorgeous', and who used to be a sex god and total player, etc., it cannot escape the audience to make comparisons and create imaginary scenarios--- What if? How come? Etc. I was brought to the edge of discomfort a few times, but then I was brought more to the poignancy of the situation instead. Here is some old guy, and in fact, there are several old guys, who through no fault of their own just happened to have not died. They got old. And I was forced to consider all of my own beliefs about aging, the end of the lifespan, what all that means, etc.The young lady, Jody Whittaker, was delightful. Her tone was just right. She was kind, mildly curious, and also affected by the potential for disgust. But through a course of totally believable honesty and artistic truth, she was able to open up and confront the 'foreign' world of old age, and an old man, specifically, and find a way to be her own innocent and loving self at the same time.The movie pulls no punches, and avoids any saccharine or soppy sentiments. At the same time, it does not 'rub our noses in' the plight of the elderly. It just plays out a drama that each and every one of us will absolutely play out in our own lives one day. If we don't die first, that is.This movie was touching and sweet. I really liked it. O'Toole deserves an Oscar. I have also recently seen 'The Last King Of Scotland', for which Forest Whitaker also was nominated for his Oscar. Whitaker deserves to win. O'Toole deserves to win. Oh my! What a dilemma--- only one can get it. Oh well, an embarrassment of riches, I suppose.Don't be afraid of this stunning and poignant love story. It will inspire and uplift you! I gave this a well deserved 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I've never been a great fan of Hanif Kureishi and don't quite know why he's got a following. He simply hasn't got anything to say about anything and all the films he's been involved with are arch, self aware and vacuous. Save for the acting of all the principals, Venus is typical and has got absolutely nothing to offer. The 'plonky' directing doesn't help. It thinks its being terribly serious and adult but the cardboard cut-out characters are handled in a theatric and self aware way. Only their inherent talents save the film from being truly diabolical. I went with my nineteen year old daughter and she felt exactly the same way. I saw it yesterday and I've forgotten most of it already. That sums it up really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard of this film mainly from two things, the lead actor being nominated an Oscar, and it being made by FilmFour, it turned out to be quite a satisfying film, from director Roger Michell (Notting Hill, The Mother). Basically Maurice Russell (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Peter O'Toole) and his friend Ian (BAFTA nominated Leslie Phillips, known for his catchphrase "Ding Dong") are two successful but ageing actors, and the best part they could get nowadays is a corpse or some arty-farty costume drama. Ian, fearful of death being around the corner, agrees to let his niece's daughter, Jessie (Jodie Whittaker) move into their flat to look after him, but it turns out Ian, a hard-drinking, rude, and dismissive twerp, can't stand 20-something Jessie. Maurice however is liking Jessie's company very much, he in fact sort of guides her with his kindness, although it is obvious that he likes Jessie - 50 years younger than him - much more than just a friend, which explains why he calls her 'Venus'. When Maurice dies in the end, with Jessie of course, she finds the courage to face her fears, and after refusing before, agrees to go nude to be painted, just like Venus. Also starring Harry Potter's Richard Griffiths as Donald, Vanessa Redgrave as Valerie, Philip Fox as Doctor, Cathryn Bradshaw as Jillian and Bronson Webb as Jessie's boyfriend. O'Toole lost the Oscar to deserved winner Forest Whitaker for The Last King of Scotland, but you can still see this is a very creditable performance, with an also endearing performance from Phillips, and featuring music and songs from Corinne Bailey Rae, including "Like A Star" and "Put Your Records On", this is quite a watchable romantic comedy drama. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic amalgamation of cinematography, music, story lines, punch lines, acting prowess and whatever else went into this "fictional" biography of the actor Peter O'Toole. OK, It's not supposed to be a biography at all, but I guess it's a pretty good summation of the life and past times of our star actor. This film is not for those who relish the fast-paced, "in your face" formulaic fare. Rather, it is a slow moving, subtly comfortable and dry-witted story about some aging London thespians (O'Toole and Leslie Phillips) who find their lives turned topsy-turvy when Phillip's grand-niece is inserted into their rather mundane existence.Mr. O'Toole goes "ga-ga" over the new gal (Jodie Whittacre as Venus), but he does it with restraint and calculation, and with large doses of humorous innuendos and tongue-in-cheek bawdiness! That sounds very nice and maybe somewhat superficial, but what underlies all this is a man's total acceptance of his lost glory and of his new situation in life as an old man whose time is dwindling, whose body is literally falling apart. His memories and sense of humor and destiny (and Venus!) are all he has left and he makes the the best of it, due in no small part to the wonderfully unique relationship he develops with the young lass. Note also the scenes with Vanessa Redgrave, who plays the estranged wife. No tear-jerking gushing of over-sentimentality abounds (just a few well placed boo-hoos!) when they reminisce about their past. Rather, an innate acceptance of what had transpired in their relationship that is visibly manifested by their infusions of ample doses of dry humor. It's like "What, me worry?" because what does it all really mean in the final analysis, including how many "columns" you'll get? In addition to the wonderfully subtle yet emphatic acting by the aforementioned actors and the marvelous script and cinematography, one would have to include kudos for a most poignant soundtrack by both Corrine Bailey Rae and David Arnold. It encompasses not only an eclectic mix of wonderful musical styles and textures, but also a savvy insertion of these tracks at the proper moments in their respective scenes. I really feel that many moviegoers and reviewers seem to place the musical score as somewhat beneath the rest of a given film's ingredients. Take the score out of this film and you lose some of the film's innate charm. In total, however, it becomes a wonderful piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter O'Toole takes my breath away. As the movie started I didn't think I would enjoy it, but I was sucked in by the magic. O'Toole, Phillips and Griffiths show us where old actors go - their graveyard if you like - and when Phillips' great niece is thrust upon him, and he is revolted, O'Toole starts to be nice to her and falls madly for the image of young womanhood and all it had meant to him. There are splendid scenes with his wife, played as ever flawlessly by Vanessa Redgrave (all hail to thee) and we are captivated by the unravelling story of an old man's final passion and its inevitable final curtain. Betrayed by the young woman's controlling boyfriend (watch out for him, he can act without speaking) O'Toole is then spiralling downwards and outwards from this life, and somehow inveigles the girl to take him to his seaside haunt. He dies happy, with wet feet and she is changed for ever. It's true, it's not a comfortable watch,(but it's not creepy and it is funny) but I wouldn't have missed it for the world. Where will we ever find their like?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O'Toole Does it Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a subtle and intelligent film. A famous actor now decrepit, Maurice, has turned on to a tight-jeaned teenage girl, Jessie, worshiping her as a goddess, hence the nickname Venus. Asshe sees that his interest in her is pointedly sexual, she abandons respect due to age in favor of restrictions against liberties he would like to take. It is this forced equality between them which is the source of a lot of fun. She says she would rather see him fall down naturally than stand for his intimacies.He knows of course that his romance is "doomed," but he fills up his imagination with her concupiscent body. He is a thoroughly devoted lover, but among the numerous ironies of his situation, he surreptitiously slips off for a few days to have a prostate operation.This is a film which reminds me of Desmond Davis' Girl With Green Eyes, which also describes a relationship across a chasm of age and social status. Here again, while Maurice's romantic case is entirely unsupportable, it too benefits the young girl in ways she could not experience within her own generation. And, while she maintains her defenses to the end, they do share warmth and intimacy. She reveals that a guy her own age had left her in the lurch, causing her to get an abortion. It is not exclusively his lustfulness which binds them together.In a jealous confrontation with an actual sex partner of hers, he delivers two uncredible body punches to his competitor who does not retaliate. Instead, the girl herself knocks him down. This is a remarkably natural outcome to the unnatural scenario of his own creation.This incident lands him in the hospital, but nearing the end he still chooses her companionship over soberer choices. Lynn Redgrave, as his former wife, has supplied all the warmth and affection he might require, but his pursuit of the game, (like his casual use of alcohol, which he maintains in sickness as in health), takes precedence in his view. In this way, he rages against the dying of the light. Peter O'Toole, fortified with the thinking of for example Henry Miller and others of his generation, is uniquely able to stand up to the predations of a society seemingly fueled by menopause to present both the sanity as well as the insanity of a relationship which flies in the face of convention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Venus is a loving (albeit irreverent) look into a May/December romance involving Maurice and "Venus," the ne'er-do-well grandniece of Maurice's best friend, Ian. Maurice's latent submissive personality results in a volatile end when he continues the slow and nearly-successful seduction of his precious Venus in spite of the fact that she's found herself a beau...a younger, angry, bruiser of a beau.This character study culminates a beautiful comedy drama wherein Sir Peter O'Toole rediscovers his inner lad, in the eyes of a (very) young girl who openly does not love him. The audience sees, from the very beginning that this girl will use him, abuse him, and leave him to die a slow, painful, miserably lonely death.But Venus surprises us by accepting responsibility for her treachery. I have to say that this is possibly the best performance of Sir Peter O'Toole's career. He is brilliant. THIS was an Oscar-worthy performance, and the Academy made a large mistake, by not bestowing the coveted award to Sir Peter. "Venus," as you may know, is the eighth nomination for Sir O'Toole, who has unfortunately never been awarded a competitive Oscar. Instead, the Academy slipped an "honorary" award upon the veteran actor, although he has earned many. It is my opinion that Sir Peter O'Toole far out-shined not only Whitaker (the Oscar-winner), but Smith, DiCapprio, AND Gosling (his fellow nominees)! All in all? This is a rather serious comedy/drama with some bracing language and liberal ideas, which some may find offensive. It serves to remind us that one man's perversion is another man's lifestyle, while also allowing for the beauty of love, at any age. The love is demonstrated not only between the characters of Maurice and Venus, but also between Maurice and Ian, though not romantically between the latter.This is not what most would wish for a Friday/Saturday night's viewing, but I did find it delightful, nonetheless. There are no explosions, no escapes, no pirates, no swashbuckling, no chases, no effects, no bank robberies, terrorists, or spies...the are only great characters, an awesomely progressive and entertaining screenplay, and quite possibly the best performance of O'Toole's illustrious career. Shame most people will never see it. I love it.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

This is not done through flashbacks, as is commonly done but through a relationship with a much younger girl--what sort of relationship? The kind where one would wish it to be a "real" lovers relationship, yet it is perhaps one of the most loving and romantic relationships portrayed on the screen.It's played pitch-perfect by masters of their craft, including relative newcomer Jodie Whittaker, who is, as they say in the DVD extras, a breath of fresh air. At first I thought of O'Toole as chewing up the scenery, this because of seeing the extras first (which is a bit like having dessert before the meal--yummy but ill-advised), but this was soon forgotten.There are many movies worth seeing in the theater, more on video. There, however, aren't many movies worth buying. This one is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointing film in what many are calling Peter O'Toole's swan song for motion pictures. It would be a shame if this bad film turns out to be O'Toole's last. He has given us such memorable performances such as "Becket," "The Lion in Winter," and "Lawrence of Arabia."In this film, O'Toole becomes mesmerized by a 20 year old girl who is taking care of his ailing friend. The girl turns out to be a nasty little thing with a vicious boy-lover as well.O'Toole acts like he is really aching here. While I didn't think that Forest Whitaker deserved this year's Oscar, he was far better than Peter the Great.Naturally, the girl redeems herself when it is too late. Richard Griffiths and the aging Vanessa Redgrave are also along for the ride. Redgrave really must be short on cash if she took such a part. Given her political beliefs, I had hoped that she would retire from the screen. I never forgave her for her 1977 anti-Zionist outburst during her acceptance speech for winning the supporting Oscar for "Julia."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nuanced Turn by O'Toole Elevates a Platonic February-December Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what feels like a valedictory performance, Peter O'Toole gives a remarkably nuanced performance as famous septuagenarian actor and raconteur Maurice Russell in director Roger Michell's modest 2006 character study. It's impressive when an actor of O'Toole's stature can refer back to his own illustrious career within a semi-doppelganger character without calling undue attention to it. The actor is given an uncommonly rich role thanks to Hanif Kureishi's perceptive, often trenchant script, which sets up Maurice as a man who embraces his mortality but not his withering virility. His need for female attention is palpable but does not veer too adamantly toward prurient.Through his bosom buddy and fellow thespian Ian, Maurice meets Jessie, Ian's niece's daughter, a sullen, disrespectful girl who steals all of Ian's alcohol while she acts as his caretaker. Ian is appalled by Jessie, but Maurice is intrigued enough by the girl to help her land a job as an art class model and teach her about the arts. However, his intentions are not altogether altruistic since he takes advantage of opportunities to caress her when given permission. This is where the film does its most delicate dance, as the potentially unsavory aspects are leavened by the sheer romanticism of Maurice's overtures safely insulated by his medically-induced impotence. The story only goes astray toward the end when Jessie's thuggish boyfriend enters the picture on the fringes and catalyzes the inevitable conclusion.Beyond O'Toole's masterful work, there are sterling performances from Leslie Phillips as the easily flustered, high-maintenance Ian and especially a vanity-free Vanessa Redgrave, who almost matches O'Toole's impact in just three telling scenes as Maurice's resigned ex-wife Valerie. With her shopworn beauty and enervated manner, she is able to convey subtle shifts between anger and affection to a man who had long ago abandoned her and their children only to forgive him for his past sins. As Jessie, Jodie Whittaker holds her own against the veteran cast, and her portrayal of the character's steely resolve minimizes the shock value of the burgeoning relationship, though I have to admit the inconsistencies in the script's view of her character are a bit jarring within the story flow.The loping pop-chill music of Corinne Bailey Rae dominates the soundtrack, and it suits the movie well. The 2007 DVD has he standard set of extras - a brief making-of featurette, "Venus: A Real Work of Art", which celebrates how celebrated actors like O'Toole, Phillips and Redgrave still have to face ageism when it comes to good roles; four deleted scenes of little value; and a rather dry commentary track from Michell and one of the producers, Kevin Loader. It's a small-scale film, alternately vitriolic and poignant, elevated by O'Toole.</fullReview>
