		<shortDescription>A Great Quadrangle of Mischievous Witches.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before HARRY POTTER and DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES and after BELL, BOOK, AND CANDLE, THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK came out and charmed the pants off moviegoers including me who, when we saw the film in theatres, loved not only the fantasy element, but also the great interplay between the actors.Loosely based on the John Updike novel of the same name, THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK concerns the shenanigans of three housewives, all close with each other, who live in a sleepy New England town and dream of having a man come to their lives. What they don't know is that their empathic desires materialize not a knight in shining armour, but... Jack Nicholson? Surely you jest. Cher, the first to meet him, loathes him -- her verbal assault is something that belongs in an Edward Albee play. But he matches her word for word and bests her. Susan Sarandon, playing completely clumsy and repressed, gets ravaged in a bombastic way that would make any woman go nuts. And Michelle Pfeiffer in her breakout role meets a tender man who wishes he could be a woman.The key her is not the story: that the Devil has his own designs as Darryl van Horne and that he may have some eventual opposition from the town is predictable -- it's the way Nicholson embodies his role as van Horne. Pacino would do an over-the-top performance in THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE years later; Nicholson prefers to change his demeanor with regards to the women he gets involved in, and his Devil is almost an overgrown boy who just wants to have fun and enjoy life. Seeing him sharing screen time with such different actresses is worth the entire movie -- he oozes chemistry with all of them, he makes you believe he's that charming and sweet or passionate and maybe irrepressibly vulgar, full of his own cat-like sensuality. He's having fun, but making it known it's also not a one-note performance.Performances are what save this movie from its overblown ending and 80s production values: to watch Veronica Cartwright stealing her scenes, perfectly comfortable in playing these types of roles, go from concerned to completely mad, is a hoot. That she also may be a latent witch... is possible. Cher tackles her role like a total feminist and brings a lot of her own blunt self; Susan Sarandon does wonders to what in her own words was an underwritten part, and Michelle Pfeiffer glows.Great fun, fantasy at its purest form, THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK makes you want to draw a 'D' in the sand and see what happens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bewitching tale with something for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a genre blending film I found at Fry's Horror section for only $2.49 retail. It can be described as a supernatural Battle of the Sexes with horrific, comedic, and dramatic elements with a bizarre love story/ orgy at the center of it. The 3 "witches" (Cher, Susan Sarandon, and Michelle Pfeiffer) make a request for the perfect man who is delivered to them in the form of Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson) aka the Devil. According to Daryl, when a man is encountered by a strong woman, his manhood goes limp. The woman is called a "witch" and set on fire. This is used to make women scared of men and scared of themselves. Daryl's attention allows the 3 women to embrace their sexuality, fertility, passion, and ambition. Eventually, they realize they no longer need men for anything, including Daryl. This culminates in the ultimate showdown with man vs. women. The SFX quality was good enough to win the BAFTA Award in 1987. The music by John Williams earned him an Oscar and Grammy nomination. Nicholson gives an incredibly over the top performance that was good enough to win both the NY &amp; LA Critics Choice Awards. There is a lot of back story to this as well. Bill Murray was originally set to play Darryl and Cher and Sarandon switched roles once they walked onto the set. The studio execs hassled the director so much that Miller halted production. When they threatened to replace him with another director, Nicholson said he would walk away from the production. This ended the feuding. Favorite Quote: Almost all the dialogue. Cher asks Nicholson's character if he is married. To which he responds, " I don't believe in it. Good for the man, bad for the woman. She dies, she suffocates. Then the Husband complains that he is f*cking a dead woman and he is the one that killed her. Where is your Husband?" Cher replies, "Dead." DVD Extras: Full Cast &amp; Crew Bios, a set design feature entitled " Conjuring Eastwick", a "Bewitching Look Back" at the history, Awards, Commentary, Interviews, and a Trailer (which indicates there are deleted scenes missing from the DVD. There should also be the numerous alternate endings they had shot). Bottom Line: Bewitching tale (pun intended) with something for everyone. Rating: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The songs Witchy Woman (women) meets Sympathy for the Devil, combined for a comic fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Miller (Mad Max) creatively sets the stage for a story of three witches and one Lucifer, who are in regular human form, in a small, uptight New England town. Of course, for a tale like this one can try to suspend disbelief, and it has to be when dealing with the supernatural. Thankfully, Miller has great casting tastes- Cher, Sarandon, and Pfieffer are wonderful in their roles, each with an acute, potent sexuality that was at their peaks in the late 80's. And then there's Mr shark grin himself, Jack Nicholson, who gives another superb layer to the performance of the dark prince. There are other actors who have portrayed the man downstairs- Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate was the devil as lawyer, Billy Crystal was himself in the Woody/Dante sequence in Deconstructing Harry, even Elizabeth Hurley in Bedazzled. But rarely have they had this much outright fun and charm with the role, enough to almost make me, a man in his 20s, charmed too. Maybe it's the eyebrows. Nicholson gives one of his best over-the-top performances as the "horny-little devil" Darryl, who comes into town during a storm and cooks up more than that for his avid female guests. Of course, he doesn't have control for long, when the girls find they have powers of their own. When the movie gets overly fantastic (which is a number of times) it gets a little hard to take, yet the acting is above par, and the special effects are a delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gleefully Gross Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Updike probably panicked when he saw what screenwriter Michael Cristofer and director George Miller did to his book.....but this movie is all the BETTER for what they did! Careening wildly between scenes of light fantasy, full-bore horror and extreme gross-outs, this film is wildly imaginative and terrifically entertaining. With Jack Nicholson as the devil himself, things just don't get any better than that! Actually, the whole cast is very well-chosen and all give great performances.A great cult film...can't wait to see and hear those barfing scenes on DVD! Four stars!!!! ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sin Has Rarely Looked So Good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three lonely New England women (Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer) dream of a man to satisfy their every need as they suffer from isolation with their husbands constantly away. That man---Jack Nicholson (always on a lucky streak it seems). Wicked little comedy with Jack going over the top and having great fun with the helter-skelter material. The women (Cher and Sarandon in particular) match his intensity and the star power makes up for the crazed screenplay and unsteady direction by George Miller. Overall I liked "The Witches of Eastwick". I am not quite sure why I did, but once again Nicholson proves that if there is just enough substance available that he can raise mediocre film-making techniques and share the spotlight with his fellow co-stars. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson gives his funniest and one of the finest performances as Mr. Darryl van Horn, the mysterious and wicked man who arrives to the quiet and sleepy little town of Eastwick after three women, the Blonde Souki (Pfeifer), the Redhead Jean (Sarandon), and the Brunette Alex (Cher), best friends and witches dreamed him up as a man who can bring some changes and excitement in their lonely lives.Several great actors have played the Prince of Darkness during their careers but Nicholson was born to play a "friendly" devil that can seduce any woman with no exception by becoming exactly what she wants him to be. The scenes where Nicholson seduces Alex (Daryl Van Horne: Well, if that's how you feel about it, then that's how you feel about it. Is THAT how you feel about it?), Jean, and Souki are among the sexiest I've ever seen.The movie has too many vomiting scenes for my liking, and the visuals are sometimes too screaming but Nicholson is delightful. I never thought that playing cello could lead to such flaming results ? and I used to play it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-told tale of an age-old struggle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director who brought us Mad Max comes a modern-day fairy tale of sorts that examines the age-old battle of the sexes. Alex (Cher), Jane (Susan Sarandon) and Sukie (Michelle Pfeiffer) are three single women who live in the sleepy New England town of Eastwick. Since all of them lack a man in their lives, and are dissatisfied with the ones who are in town, they wish for a handsome stranger to visit. Miraculously, their wish is granted when Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson) strolls into town and succeeds in turning their lives (and the town's) upside down. For the most part, I thought that the story was very effective in setting up its characters and giving them depth, even Daryl. The three women who are the titular "Witches of Eastwick" were all distinct personalities and had situations that made you care about them. Generally speaking, the performances were all very good, although Jack Nicholson towers above the rest of the cast as he brings his brand of insanity to what is essentially the devil in human form. Even the whole "witch" thing was dealt with rather subtly, as the women only become witches by finding the power within themselves. It is this struggle between male and female power which forms the core conflict of the film, and it is a compelling one even though it has been many times over in various forms. The townspeople are also given some development, although probably not enough to warrant the attention provided them. There are references made to the Salem witch trials, and the wife of the town's newspaper editor (Richard Jenkins...with hair!) acts as the mouthpiece for morality when the the three "witches" start their relationship with Daryl. Despite this interesting aside, I think it detracts a little bit from the main conflict. Moving on, I also thought that John Williams' score was fantastic and had this magical/mysterious quality that really meshed with the story and visuals. It's not his best score, but it was still a very good one. There were also a number of special effects by ILM which I thought were also well-done, especially considering this was made in 1987. Overall, I thought this was a very entertaining and funny movie that presented a well-worn theme in a fresh way. The only detraction, I think, is that there's a bit of a mean streak in regards to the portrayal of the male characters which might turn that half of the audience off. Still, this is a quality film that shows off director George Miller's versatility and the acting talents of its cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad luck for the three "witches," great entertainment for us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the old days anyone who strayed from the "truth" was labeled a heretic or a witch. For centuries these people were portrayed as morally bankrupt menaces to society whose "crimes" were punishable by torture and then death. Books were written about them, rarely painting them in a positive light. L. Frank Baum showed that there could be such a thing as good witches when he wrote his 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.' Hollywood too wanted to show both sides of the culture, sometimes seriously and other times it comes out as fluff. The latter is not necessarily a bad thing if done right, which is the case this film based on the novel of the same name. It's not an historical account, but it's not lacking in smarts either and is more than a light comedy.Pros: Grade A cast, excellent performances by all. A really good story. Full of witty dialogue. Often very funny. Fabulous score. Beautifully photographed. Fast paced. Some really good effects that have held up. Director George Miller, creator of 'Mad Max,' does a really good job here and has some fun.Cons: Somethings could have used more fleshing out. Seems like it's trying to be too many things at once and doesn't totally succeed in every area.Final thoughts: Before 'The Craft' and 'Practical Magic' there was 'The Witches of Eastwick.' A highly entertaining and funny near two hours with a cast that you can tell really enjoyed what they were doing. Sure it's a bit messy in the script department, but there's enough goodies to keep the film afloat. Jack Nicholson's performance as the "horny little devil" is worth the price of admission alone, but there's a lot more.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that this is one of my favorite movies. The two best things about this movie are the things that movies should have-a great plot and a great cast. The plot is original, funny, dramatic, and there is even a bit of horror. The cast is perfect, each person brings something into the movie-especially Jack. The three women characters bring strength, sensitivity, and sexuality, but the movie does not focus on one trait-women have all three, but its funny that this movie has a character for each character trait-the devil needed to have three for himself, when one man would only need one woman-a good man, anyways. But, my favorite thing about this movie is the plot. There is not one boring part to this film, and that's why I have to say that it is one of the greatest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange Combination of Horror and Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the traditional and conservative Eastwick, the sculptress Alexandra Medford (Cher), the shy musician and teacher Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon) and the journalist Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer) are best friends. Alexandra is a widow; Jane is divorced since she can not have a child; and Sukie is divorced because she frequently gets pregnant and has five children. They are sexually repressed and one night, they describe the characteristics of their ideal man while drinking. There is a storm on the town and the mysterious Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson) appears in town and buy a notorious mansion. NJobody can recall his name, but he seduces the three friends. Meanwhile the pious Felicia Alden (Veronica Cartwright), who is married with Sukie's boss Clyde Alden (Richard Jenkins), has a weird accident and feels that Daryl is the devil. When Felicia dies, Alexandra, Jane and Sukie realize that there is something strange about Daryl. But what can they do? "The Witches of Eastwick" is a sexy and original film with a strange combination of horror and comedy. Jack Nicholson is comfortable performing another totally incorrect character. The sinful witches are represented by three gorgeous actresses. The special effects are great and responsible for funny scenes. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "As Bruxas de Eastwick" ("The Witches of Eastwick")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fun little movie. Reserved Jane (Susan Sarandon), sassy Alex (Cher)and lovable Sukie (Michelle Pfeiffer) are good friends in a small, conservative town, Eastwick. They are all widowed or divorced and dream of a tall, dark and handsome foreign prince to come riding on a black horse and sweep them of their feet. What they don't know is they are witches and when they all wish for something together, it is granted. There is some all round good acting. The three leading actresses are amazing as the average single working women who just happen to be witches. The movie manages to give them interesting personalities. Jane in particular has a really comedic character arc.But it is Jack Nicholson who steals every scene he is in. His Daryl van Horne is the devil himself who has come as an answer to the witches' wishes. He is over-the-top, funny and despicable all at the same time. This character is a good addition to his collection crazy-guy roles. The premise is silly and the movie knows it. Hence, it gives us lot of hilariously silly moments. The climax is one good laugh-fest. A good movie to watch if are looking for some light entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What fun Nicholson must have had with this! He really hams it up here. Very good supporting work by Cher, Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pfieffer, and Veronica Cartwright. The plot is a little bit impenetrable. The "witches" are at first unaware of their power. I suppose I should read Updike's novel, but the one book of his I did read sucked. Anyway, I recommend the film, for it seems a bit different than normal Hollywood formula.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I over all enjoyed the Witches of Eastwick, it was an original plot with some terrific actors. Although from the title, I guess I was expecting something different. Still, for some odd reason, this movie more or less struck me as more of a TV series. Maybe because the plot is so Charmed meets Desperate Housewives, but it also worked as a movie.We have Jack Nicholson who plays the new man in the town of Eastwick, he's rich and mysterious, he also sleeps with three women who are best friends as well. He grants all their desires and wishes, not to mention makes them feel more alive then they ever have before. There of course is always a catch, Jack is a warlock, a very powerful one at that, not to mention an evil one. But after he is rejected by the girls, he decides to get back at them, not in the most pleasant way. The girls decide to trick him and use his own magics against him.Sometimes a comedy, sometimes horror, but over all I'd say that this movie is worth a watch. I mean, the stars alone are worth it, we have Oscar winners and nominee's. The story is original and entertaining, but like I said, you'll see what I mean, if this would've made a more entertaining TV series.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps one of the most admirable feats in life is to show how far one has come through hard work and change. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once put it, "unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." Director, George Miller, is an example of such, as he went on to direct The Witches of Eastwick merely two years after the last installment of the Mad Max movies, a trilogy that was his own creation and quite frankly, one of the most inane contributions to cinema in the last 30 years. Adapted from the novel by John Updike, The Witches of Eastwick concerns a female trio who have been abandoned by their husbands and upon meeting Daryl Van Horne, a mysterious newcomer in their sleepy town of Eastwick, they discover they have magical abilities. Van Horne is quite clearly an incarnation of Satan from the outset, seeking to corrupt the women and ultimately control/destroy the world once he gets some action from the hypnotic trio of course.The film is well paced, particularly at the beginning. Nicholson, although a stereotype for this kind of role, is a perfect fit as Van Horne and the scene where he appears snoring his head off in the back row of Jane's music recital (played by a rather young Susan Sarandon),encapsulates the tone for the entire film. The chemistry between the actors is, in no small way, responsible for the mischievous and entertaining air throughout. Pfeiffer, Cher and Sarandon are quite believable as a group of friends who get together to eat, drink and commiserate about the men in their lives and subsequently, as a coven who attempt to overthrow the power of Satan in typical 80&#x2032;s comedic fashion. If we're going to be really critical here, the film falls down somewhat in its portrayal of the trio as strong, independent women as they are nothing of the sort until the very end of the film. The only impetus for the women to go the extra mile and indulge in their wiccan powers, is through the introduction of an all-powerful male figure who uses up each woman and causes them explicit (but hilarious!) pain. Van Horne's power is ultimately subverted as he is conjured up by the women themselves and as the women discover, he can be made to disappear by them also.Let's not get too caught up in technicalities with this film, it doesn't try to be something it isn't although it varies considerably from Updike's novel. The last section of the film has been widely criticised for spiraling into ridiculousness, a criticism that is quite valid as it lends a monotonous tone to the ending in comparison to the light-hearted, magical atmosphere of the earlier parts. Overdone and overbaked at the end, it's an unfortunate notion that not even Nicholson's comic talents are able to save the climax from losing its momentum. Despite this, the film is very watchable owing to the high standards of acting turned in all round, in particular by Nicholson and Veronica Cartwright (playing a Christian wife of Eastwick's newspaper editor in a scene-stealing supporting role). Overall, an entertaining romp that knows how to churn out the laughs. 7/10.All Rights Reserved © Copyright 2011 Michelle Lacey (Michelle Ní Láitheása).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a sense of humor. I like many different kinds of humor. I like more or less sophisticated comedies. I'm open for experiments. I really wanted to like "Witches of Eastwick". I tried really hard . I've even seen the movie twice , but I simply don't like it.On paper this movie looks interesting. Directed by George Miller ("Mad Max") with all-star cast ? Jack Nicholson ("Chinatown") , Susan Sarandon ("Atlantic city") , Michelle Pfeiffer ("Dangerous liaisons") and Cher ("Mask") plus unusual idea (three women with magical powers versus Satan). So , what went wrong ? The movie is simply unfunny.I liked the performances of the cast. The special effects look really good even after all those years. As I said earlier the idea for this movie is original and interesting. The movie does say something about mentality of small town society and the desires of women.The movie however is no fun. It's supposed to be horror-comedy , yet it fails as both horror and comedy. It's not scary , but what is worse is that is not one bit funny. I honestly don't see where all the jokes are. Where are the moments when I was supposed to laugh ? Can somebody tell me ? I can't even say that this movie has forced humor , because I don't see ANY humor here. The whole movie feels like the movie makers were having fun with special effects , but nothing more."Witches of Eastwick" are dull compared to "Beetlejuice" or "Gremlins". The whole movie is too self indulgent and self serious to be funny. I give it 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Your Average Horny Little Devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexandra, Jane and Sukie are three friends living in the historic New England small town of Eastwick. All three are single- Alexandra is a widow whereas Jane and Sukie are both divorced- and are looking for a new man, but seem unable to find anyone suitable. And, unknown to anyone, even the women themselves, all three are secretly witches. And then the tranquil life of Eastwick is turned upside down by the arrival in town of Daryl Van Horne. Van Horne is ostensibly a wealthy New Yorker, but in fact he is, quite literally, the Devil. When he describes himself as "just your average horny little devil" he is speaking more truth than anybody actually realises. He settles down in the town, buying an old mansion, and quickly makes the acquaintance of the three women. In fact, he does more than make their acquaintance. He manages to seduce all three and persuades them to live in a ménage-a-quatre in his luxurious mansion, an arrangement which provokes much scandalised gossip among the good citizens of Eastwick.Van Horne, however, is intent upon using the three for more than just his own sexual enjoyment. He also wants to tap in to their latent magical powers and to use these for his own ends. At first Alex, Jane and Sukie are happy to go along with what they see as an amusing game, but eventually they begin to suspect that he is manipulating them into abusing their powers for evil ends, especially after Felicia Alden, Van Horne's most vitriolic critic in the town, dies a mysterious death. The women realise that they will need to resist Van Horne and start to fight back against him.I was not particularly taken with the three female leads, Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer and Susan Sarandon, none of whom seemed very inspired. Jack Nicholson, however, seems to be gifted with the ability to give good performances even in otherwise run-of-the-mill films; "Terms of Endearment" is one such example, and this film is another. Nicholson has never been conventionally handsome, but he has the charisma needed for a role like Van Horne, playing him with a mixture of swagger and devilish charm and making him curiously attractive despite his satanic nature. The other notable acting contribution comes from Veronica Cartwright as Felicia. To her neighbours Felicia may seem like a crazed, superstitious religious fanatic, forever ranting about witchcraft, and yet she is the one person in the town perceptive enough to realise that what is going on at the Lennox Mansion is something far more sinister than mere sexual impropriety.The film's main weakness is its plot, which differs considerably from that of the John Updike novel on which it is supposedly based. It is a long time since I read the book, so will not pronounce on here as to which is better, but it struck me that the film starts off well but quickly goes downhill and by the time it reaches the ending is more or less nonsense. (This was a view shared by some critics; according to the "Washington Post" the second half "lost its magic and degenerated into bunk".) The scenes of Van Horne's arrival in town and his seduction of the women are well done, but after that the film seems to lose its way."The Witches of Eastwick" reminded me in a number of ways of "Death Becomes Her" from five years later. Both are black comedies with a supernatural theme. One positive feature they have in common is some decent acting. In "Death Becomes Her" this comes from Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn as the two feuding rivals, with a good supporting contribution from Bruce Willis as the man they feud over. Both, however, are heavily reliant upon special effects; indeed, I would say that they are over-reliant upon special effects to cover up an unsatisfactory story-line. And neither film has really stood the test of time; both seem much less fresh and interesting today than they would have done in 1987 or 1992. Yesterday's ground-breaking effects will inevitably start to look commonplace; yesterday's good story will remain a good story today and tomorrow. 6/10</fullReview>

Soon, wealthy and mysterious man Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson) moves into town and seem to satisfy their desires. He seduces them one by one and ultimately begins an affair with each one, but bewitching activities soon follow.This movie has an interesting script and story that basically delves into the mystery and nefarious activities of witchcraft, which are comically and dramatically depicted in this film. Nicholson gave a outrageously crude-mouthed and wicked performance as Daryl, and Cher, Sarandon and Pfeiffer each did a pretty good job in their respective roles. There is a good amount of mystery in the movie to keep it suspenseful and a good amount of horror to keep it frightening at times, but entertaining (the cherry throw-up scene has always been a bit disturbing for me). The entire atmosphere and setting of the movie reminds you of a Salem era - perfect for a witches-themed film.Overall, the movie's not a masterpiece, considering some of the overly used crude elements and the diabolical aspects of the film. But it's still good, fictional fun.Grade B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is HILARIOUS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From start to finish this movie delivers. I saw this movie when it came out in 1987 and then I recently saw it again last night. I'm 33 years old and in 1987 I was 15 years old, naive and didn't get any of the humor. The only thing I understood then was that there was a devil that came to Eastwick.Seeing the movie again last night was so awesome. Jack Nicholson who is one of my favorite actors gave a stellar performance as the Devil. I recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good laugh. My favorite scene is the one where Jack Nicholson goes in front of the Church and also the confrontation he has with Cher's character. I must have rewound those scenes 8 times in a row last night.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WITCHES OF EASTWICK : Symbolic Sexuality, Subtle Themes, &amp; Great Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK George Miller's 1987 adaptation of John Updike's hit novel has always been a movie I admired and wanted to love more then I ever actually did. But something about the film was so bizarrely intriguing that I have always returned for repeat viewing sporadically throughout the years. Upon reflection, I think I always expected it to be a different movie then it is... b/c I finally feel that I understood what the film aimed to be.In the past, I always watched the movie expecting a spectacle of witchcraft and fantasy... but in reality that's not what one should expect from this movie. "The Witches Of Eastwick" is a sexual suspense film with an underlying supernatural mystery.It tells the story of three bored women (Cher, Susan Sarandon, &amp; Michelle Pfeiffer) who don't seem to realize the powers they possess. They live in the town of Eastwick, where not much happens for these women, especially when it comes to eligible bachelors. One night, they decide to wish for the arrival of a worthy man who can offer all the things they most desire. To their surprise, the next day, a wealthy bachelor moves into the town's landmark mansion and he is ready to woo the three "witches" of Eastwick.Alex (Cher), Sukie (Pfeiffer) and Jane (Sarandon) all eventually fall under the spell of their magical suitor, Daryll Van Horn (played by Jack Nicholson). He appears like magic and offers them all the fantasies and pleasures they had hoped for. However, for another resident of Eastwic, Daryll represents evil. Felicia Alden (played wonderfully by Veronica Cartwright) suffers from hysterics as she is the only person to sense Daryll's evil plan.Little by little, the women realize that Daryll is not exactly a magical blessing. Instead he is a demon/devil who took advantage of the dark magic they accidentally used to summon him. Turns out Daryll, or the devil's plan was to unite with these three witches to create his offspring. But once the witches find out they've accidentally opened the door for a demon to enter Eastwick, is there still time to stop him? What sounds like an outlandish plot of fantasy and horror is actually handled with a great deal of subtlety up until the film's climax. The majority of the film uses cunning sexual symbolism to allude to Daryll's inner-devil. He playfully seduces the women by saying exactly what they want to hear... but little do the women know it's b/c he's a powerful demon who can manipulate their needs and desires like a true Casanova. Symbolic links between sexual desire and seductive bliss are apparent through the emphasis on such things as snakes and "forbidden fruit".One thing that is so interested about "The Witches Of Eastwick" is that it never bends to the audience. The undertones of the film are subtle and nothing is ever spelled out for us. Our only clues to Daryll's true identity are in Felicia's incoherent rants. However, slowly but surely George Miller offers revelations that link Felicia's theory and Daryll's actions so that the audience realizes the truth about the situation.The performances in this film from the 5 leading players help to elevate both the depth and the "cool" factor for the film. Jack Nicholson doesn't bring much nuance or subtlety to the role of Daryll... however, he is barrels of evil fun here. Without reserve, Nicholson captures the total evil of Daryll mixed with his primal need to hold onto the women he lusts after. And those women are all portrayed with equal confidence and talent. Cher, as the leader of the pack Alex, brings a tough as nails attitude to the role while layering her with a woman who still yearns for the protection of a man. Pfeiffer, as the free-spirited Sukie, brings an innocent awareness to the only character who seems to believe in the powers the girls possess. And meanwhile, Sarandon is tons of fun as plain Jane turned sex addict... her's is the most fun performance of the Witches.And to top it off, the film features a dynamite supporting performance from Veronica Cartwright. It's a role that could have gone high-camp very easily, but Cartwright grounds it with so much conviction that it works beautifully. Prepare for the scene in her house with her husband (think of Cherry Pits)... it's a good one.Watching "The Witches Of Eastwick" in the past, my favorite part was always the finale. In it's final 15 minutes, the movie turns into a special effects action sequence. These final moments are most exciting because it is the only section of the film in which the Witches use their powers knowingly. Where-as in the past I had hoped more of the movie would be about the magic/fantasy elements... upon this viewing I came to appreciate the slow burn the movie uses to build up to it's grand climax.While the film is not perfect... it is an interesting time at the movies. It offers a handful of fun performances from actor's who clearly had a ball making this film. It also keeps the audience guessing for almost the entire film by keeping many elements under the surface. Sure the film maybe could have been a little shorter, and having not read the book I'm not sure whether it lives up to the source material. But for me, "The Witches Of Eastwick" is a really great film that only improves with repeat viewings.... B+ ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that should have turned out much better than it did. It had a lot going for it -- based on a best seller by one of America's most distinguished writers, a stellar cast, slick photography, and beautiful locations. But they blew it. One big problem is that you're continually aware of the finicky balancing act the film has to do to give the three female stars exactly equal exposure -- I felt I was watching something put together by agents and lawyers rather than actors and film makers. And (though I haven't read it) the film apparently bears only a vague resemblance to the book. Also, some of the gross scenes (if you've seen it you know what I mean) seem just disgusting rather than scary, and in general the film seems like it can't decide whether to be a charming fantasy or a frightening horror movie, so it opts for being the former with a few horror-type scenes thrown in. And there are the really cheesy special effects that fill up the final scenes. Finally, though Jack Nicholson gives a memorable performance, I thought he often went over the top even considering who he was playing. I found myself yearning for the beautifully understated Walter Huston performance as Old Nick in The Devil and Daniel Webster, which I still think is the best portrayal of the personage in question that I've seen. Interesting that both Huston and Nicholson in these respective films play the violin. Is the devil always a fiddler? Advisories: no violence or language, pervasive but mild sex: the R rating seems rather silly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. Decent acting, great directing work, story is funny, sexy, dark and sassy. Special effects are not bad at all considering it's a 1987 flick. That being said... This movie is great! If you're a fan of Sarandon, Cher, Pfeiffer, or Nicholson, you'll probably like it.A strange man, apparently summoned by three frustrated women, shows up in a perfectly ordinary American town. He soon will change their lives for the better or the worse. Filled with magic, symbolism and detail, the movie catches our attention from the start. Susan Sarandon's is the most fun to me, as she goes from super-dowdy to a free-spirited sexual being. And you've got to love Jack Nicholson being suave and evil as only Nicholson can be. Plus, Cher with huge infomercial hair! This film is wonderfully scored by John Williams (Jaws, Hook) and his music suits the film amazingly. I also thought that John Williams' score was fantastic and had this magical/mysterious quality that really meshed with the story and visuals. It's not his best score, but it was still a very good one. There were also a number of special effects by ILM which I thought were also well-done, especially considering this was made in the late 80's. Still, this is a quality film that shows off director George Miller's versatility and the acting talents of its cast.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a local columnist and alone with six daughters. The three single friends lament the lack of quality men and share their dream man wishes. Then the mysterious wild Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson) arrives with his manservant Fidel buying the Lennox Mansion which is suppose to be the site of witch burnings. He seduces the three women unleashing their inner power. Felicia Alden (Veronica Cartwright) is the religious wife of newspaper editor Clyde Alden (Richard Jenkins) who is Sukie's boss.Firstly, Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast for this role. The problem is that I hate this character. I find him annoying and really off-putting. He's not fun to watch. There is something more than simply evil that is grating on my nerves. It makes the movie hard to watch although the story is interesting. I just don't find it fun.</fullReview>

He's handled the film exceedingly well. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is perfect. Special Effects are fine. Art &amp; Costume Design are good. John Williams's Score is tremendous. Performance-Wise: Jack Nicholson is at his GREATEST as the devil. His spell-binding turn as the seductive &amp; manipulative villain, left me speechless. He owns 'The Witches of Eastwick' from start to end! Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer &amp; Susan Sarandon as the eponymous witches, lend remarkable support &amp; add a lot of weight in the goings-on. Veronica Cartwright is extraordinary in a strong supporting role, while Richard Jenkins leaves a mark, as always.On the whole, 'The Witches of Eastwick' left me overjoyed by its top-class execution.

She is a true witch; it is a great pleasure to watch her unleash her heroine true self.Cher is very good, if only somewhat reserved. Michelle Pfeiffer has quite a few good moments.The whole female trio works really well.Veronica Cartwright over-the-top performance as an evil moralfag is another great, if somewhat guilty pleasure.

		<shortDescription>Proof that the movie need not be faithful to the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With both the novel and the movie so popular, one need not go into great detail regarding the plot, or differences in the story lines. The fact is that both were great works and wonderfully of their time. And those involved in the movie exploited the fact that film is a visual medium, and piled on the styling, adding to Updike's tale and perfectly catching the over-stylized, romantic feel of the mid-to-late eighties. The movie and book are a pairing though, and I believe that one should really not experience one and not the other. Certainly one should not just see the movie, as it does lack the depth and significance of the novel. But then that is usually the case with an adaption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Witches of Eastwick ? A light magical comedy about empowering women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witches of Eastwick is a light comedic tale about women in a small town, their status as single parents or divorcé, and about magic.The story itself and the plot are quite interesting, well written, directed and edited. No complaints on that level. You're rapidly plunged into the thick of it, and everything moves at a rather rapid pace. Each scene is well set and linked with the others. The intrigue thickens with each one passing, and the end is nice, logical, and well rounded.Now for the bad. The three main female characters are probably the least well acted. Cher's, from the get go, is over acted or maybe simply over done, but in Hollywood, that happens often at the beginning of movies. Michel Pfeiffer's is probably the most balanced and best acted of them. Susan Sarandon over does hers in the middle of the story. Maybe that's the director's fault, maybe he pushed them a little too much.That being said, I must say that some of the monologues of Veronica Cartwright and Jack Nicholson are impressive in delivery and content.It's a movie that's easy to watch and will make you think if you stop a minute to consider the implications. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very difficult to define this film. In fact, every definition is fake because the essence of words or gestures is ineffable.Daryl Van Horne may be a type of Godot. The incarnated hope, the symbol of filling or image of any victim.The three women- variant of Tchekov's "Three sisters".But the reality is not so easy. In East Europe of Communist era, The Occident was the Heaven in all senses. It was the lost Paradis, the normality, the escape. A part of this wonderful world was shield against the daily nightmare. The fall of Communism was not the solution. Occident is a form of chimera not like education or mentality's result but like the personal treasure.The film is not a moral lesson or image of ex-Sovietic country in transition to European values. It is not on George Miller's page. It is only a short life's story and description of a subtle escape. It is slice of dream's rules, descending in past who remains only present and future.Cher's acting is magnificent. A powerful character with a victim's mask, a fragile grandmother for who the life is not only fight or fear, past memories or sweet desire but a form of world's contemplation.In fact, Alexandra Medford is the Ada's image. And Nickelson's death- solution of interior crisis of every character. The end of life in nostalgic universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Tale with one Sexy Devil!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first sentence on the back-of-the-box summary for The Witches of Eastwick mentions that the only good choices for playing the Devil would be the Devil himself and Jack Nicholson. That statement holds true right to the end of the film, for I cannot (and I'm sure that most who watched the movie and liked it would agree) imagine anyone else portraying the repulsive and strangely sexy Daryl Van Horne. Susan Sarandon, Cher, and Michelle Pffiefer also give wonderful performances as the three witches of Eastwick, who start out as bored (single) housewives looking for a good man, and end up trying to banish the Devil from their small-town New England home. The three women are Jane (Sarandon), Alex (Cher), and Sukie (Pffiefer), who have radically different personalities and yet are best friends. Jane is shy and klutzy, Alex is artsy and feminist, and Sukie is just a little ball of motherly sweetness. One stormy Thursday night, the three meet for their weekly card games and martinis, and begin to list the things that would compile their perfect prince charming. However, their unconscious sorcery seems to grant their wish; this man on a white horse comes in the form of mysterious New Yorker, Daryl Van Horne, who captivates the town, including our three desperate heroines. For Alex, he appears as a man who can actually keep up with her patronizing and spirited speeches, for Jane, he is a passionate musician who helps her bring out the wildcat within (similar to transformation of her character Janet in The Rocky Horror Picture Show), and for Sukie, he is a tender, gentle man who just wants to cast off his genitalia and become a female. But their new foursome family, bent on having sex at every opportunity and just having a good time, soon encounters some family issues, and it is now up to the witches of Eastwick to banish their mutual lover from their town before he tears it apart. Overall, this was a wonderful movie, full of friendship, laughs, and chills, as well as riveting performances from every actor in it (even the ones with 10 lines). Brilliant!</fullReview>

Just like the evil powers that be greed develops, and Nicholson cast pain and suffering on the three ladies after his pleasureful seductions. Like any good witch would do the trio uses the gift of devil magic to good use and Nicholson's devil character dies from a voodoo doll spell. All three of the coven give birth to a child after Van Horne's death.

		<fullReview>This star-studded cast turns in gold star performances!! I saw this in the theater, and now years later, I own it.Let me start by saying that Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfieffer were absolutely marvelous in this movie.Their characters perfectly complemented one another, lending their own individual strengths to one another's weaknesses.Cher's total down to earth wit (and her brutally honest assessment of Darryl while he's lying on the bed attempting to "not" seduce her *loved loved loved that exchange*), Sarandon's driven desire to succeed, and Pfieffer's (almost) desperate attempts to bring her life together with some form of cohesion and meaning, were all portrayed with dramatic genius.Their mutual desire to no longer be alone causes these three small-town women to invent the "perfect" guy. As they creatively begin to "dream him up," they have no idea that they are casting a very powerful summoning spell.Jack Nicholson was extraordinary as the Darryll "Devil" VanHorn - the result of the women's summoning; an obvious and well written metaphorical personification of the old adage, "Be careful what you wish for." His performance was top row, rather than over the top.He IS an avatar of "the Devil." How would you EXPECT him to act? This movie is fun, highly entertaining, funny, quirky and warm (though it does trigger the gag reflex WAY more than once). Its sentiments are genuine and the star-studded performances are brilliant. It's one of my favorite movies.I must also say that I loved the three women's use of sympathetic magick against Darryl the "Devil." It was beautifully done in that it showed the true power of Sympathetic Magicks to those of us who cared to look.Of course things don't work on this plane as it does in the movie, but since Darryl was from the ethereal plane of Shadow, I think even the fantastic affects the girls' magick had upon him were very well portrayed. This movie gets an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

You always expect something scary to happen and it s better than seeing it happening. Here Jack Nicholson plays one of his favorite roles, the flamboyant seductive irresistible charmer, who enters the lives of three lonely neurotic women. First he is repulsive and weird but soon they become his real salves and "One big happy family". As you might anticipate, Nicholson is the real dynamo of the movie, and u feel that every moment he is off screen is a waste of time. The movie is very good and I think it was underrated by both critics and audience. There is no reason why this movie didn't become one of the horror classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumbed down to nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In John Updike's playful novel, 'The Witches of Eastwick', the "witches" are three ordinary divorcées considered such for two reasons: by others for their unconventional and active sex lives, and by themselves, as they start to fear that some occult games they engaged in have actually created the devilish new lover who appears in all their lives. This film starts reasonably true to the book; but soon descends into a terrible mess. The sexual element is downplayed, whereas the mystical element is taken increasingly literally. The move ends with an extended, excruciating sequence of supposedly comic horror; this is neither comic nor horrific, but moreover, stripped of the writer's subtlety, at least one scene becomes directly misogynistic. If the film's worth seeing at all, it at least gives one an exposure to its triple dosage of 19080s big hair; for a wry take on sexual politics, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exaggerated but enjoyable fantasy comedy/drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably THE weirdest film I have ever seen in my life. Despite being bizarre, it was a very good film to watch. Three renowned Americans star as the "witches", Cher, Pfeiffer and Sarandon. All perform well in an enjoyable strange story as they all one night recap their lives and wish for them to be turned around, that's when Van Horne, played brilliantly by Nicholson (One flew over the cuckoo's nest, as good as it gets) arrives in their home town. The story is exaggerated and unrealistic at points but regardless it is an engaging plot. You are always wondering what is happening and why, its strange but its gripping. It's a well thought out story with great acting from everyone involved. The pace and tension are key but also the relaxation and mystery surrounding the story make it enjoyable and ironically heart-warming.Some of the scenes involving the witches actions seem poor and deliberately stupid. Nicholson's character is phenomenal, a sensational character who is juxtaposed with the three witches to create a tense and interesting scenario. He is very seductive, mysterious and manipulating and therefore is simply great to watch. I was really unsure about the ending; I personally thought it was poor, completely over exaggerated. However it did leave many questions open and therefore encourages audiences to think carefully about it which makes it an interesting ending. There are many ideologies of sex, families, children, and a strong idea of religion encoded. Religion is a key issue in this film, the way people believe in heaven and hell. The use of story telling is also very powerful and influential to capture the character's views on life etc. Apart from the ending and some very unrealistic scenes it is an engaging story, worth watching once but not an essential watch. The characters and setting are amazing with an acceptable storyline. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is some of the greatest writing (lines), directing and editing I've seen in any movie. This masterpiece showcased Jack, Cher, Michele and Susan in an elaborate display of their unique ability. It would be interesting and probably rewarding to witness a platform that would compliment these four actors as well as this collaborative effort does. It would be a tough act to follow. "We don't deal the deck down here, we just play the percentages." I enjoy great lines and great scenes. If the Academy would dissect movies into categories including, best lines, best scenes, etc.; this movie could be nominated as could movies such as True Romance, Pulp Fiction and The Professional (Leon).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: WITCHES OF EASTWICK, THE Rating: **** (out of 5)***YES, THERE ARE SPOILERS***Based on the novel by John Updike, EASTWICK is the story of three middle aged women who, through the use of black magic (and unaware of their witchly powers) conjure up the "perfect man," who, in reality, is the devil in disguise. Two of the women (Michelle Pfieffer and Susan Sarandon) are divorced, and the other (CHER) is a divorcee who reside in a picture-postcard New England town which is ideal in the sense of living a simple life, though when evil comes into town things start to go out of control. The main reason to see this film is for, of course, Jack Nicholson who contributes another dynamic and delightful performance as the self-proclaimed "horney little devil," and Sarandon, Cher, and Pfieffer are very well cast and wonderful, despite that fact they play it virtually straight when compared to Nicholson, who surely pulls out all the stops. The supporting cast, led by Veronica Cartwright as a woman who slowly goes insane, are terrific as well, and really make this town come to life in terms of the simple existance having its fair share of bad apples.This is one of those movies where I read the book afterwards (you shouldn't really do that, I know) and discovered of course that the book is much different in style, tone, and texture...i should have mentioned "loosely based" when I started this review. I've seen the film many times and love it, though I do agree with many other fellow critics of its primary flaw: unevenness. Despite that fact, it has everything you could imagine in a film: comedy, drama, horror, suspense, action, and even a musical element added to it. I view it more as a black comedy more that anything else, though it is quite literate and unique....certainly not the usual black comedy, for sure. The film seems to shift wildly in tone without warning, and even though it adds a level of unpredictability to the film, it also seems to make us a little confused in the process. The film, admittedly, does leave some unanswered questions, but for what it presents it truly entertaining from start to finish...which also means that your really not supposed to think about it too much afterwards. In addition, I say its not for every taste because of the subject matter involved...the film tends to get crude at times, which is something that will most likely offend some church goers...though even they would have to admit that Nicholson gives the perfect intrepretation of Satan, at least on a contemporary level. Plus, the most honest thing he says I will repeat at the end of this review as my favorite quote from the film. The direction (by George Miller) is respectable and stylish, and although I mentioned the film's unevenness, Michael Cristofer's screenplays is, more often than not, witty, intelligent and right-on- target (that scene in the church alone near the end is pure brilliance). Plus, let's not forget John William's brilliant score, a real highlight which really moves the film along at a brisk pace. Even if you don't believe in or care for witchcraft, this film is great fun, if only for the terrific performance; the actors must have had a genuine field day while playing these characers (most notably Jack). Just sit back with your girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, husband or just a bunch of friends with a lot of alcohol and you will have a outstanding time watching this.Quote: "You don't think God makes mistakes? Of course he does, we all make mistakes. Of course when we make mistakes, they call it evil; but when God makes mistakes, they call it 'nature'."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Witches of Eastwick" is recommended for all the ones who like to see things about witch-craft. If you watch the TV show "Charmed" or liked "The Craft", you can't miss this one.The story is quite simple: three single women, unhappy with their lives, beg for help using the black magic. Suddenly, the women (played by Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon and Cher) meet a man named Daryl Van Horn (Jack Nicholson), and then things start to change- for good... or bad.With much black-humor, a good story and many dark elements, "The Witches of Eastwick" turns into a very good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you thought his role as Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick version of "The Shinig" was something, you haven't seen anything yet! Jack Nicholson does his absolute best play a devil of a "dream man." In "The Witches of Eastwick" three very lonely women have the worst luck in finding a man. They somehow get more than they bargained for when they create Daryl Van Horne(Nicholson), a very flamboyant, yet obnoxious man that ever set foot in the quiet village. The most disturbing scene in the movie is when the woman fell off the stairs and breaks her leg. And most sexual scene in the movie is where Van Horne opens Jane Spifford's(Susan Sarandon) legs and places the cello there when she was getting frustrated. Yes, Van Horne got a lot of style and class, but what little they know about Van Horne that he's one devilish son of a gun! Man, I liked this movie from the start, a little slow beginning, yet the rest is good to go. I did hear "The Price is Right" playing in the background, especially when I hear Gene Wood's voice there. A very good movie, Cher was as great as ever. Michelle Pfeiffer did very well too. (She appears 7 years later with Nicholson in the movie "Wolf"). Rating 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The devil is in the details</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Updike has written some wonderful novels. I can only think the reason they haven't been adapted to film is that their strengths lie more in their verbal felicities than in the kind of forceful plotting and characterization Hollywood loves. I don't think The Witches of Eastwick is any more suited to movie adaptation than, say, Couples or "S." It succeeds so well, with only a little tweaking, that it makes you wonder what we've been missing. The chief glory of this movie is the beautifully detailed production. You can't precisely capture Updike's masterful use of the language on film, but the careful attention paid to the minutiae of the three witches' lives and the town they inhabit is the best approximation I've ever seen. You can't take your eyes off this movie. I've read a lot of praise for Jack Nicholson, in the role of the devil, but I think he might be the weakest element. The production itself is the real star here.Highest recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent fantasy horror, but not much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Witches of Eastwick blends a number of genres, including fantasy, horror and comedy, and somehow blends them all into a mostly coherent film about lust, sin and the age-old idea of 'be careful what you wish for'. I have to say that the film isn't really what I expected, as the title suggests witchcraft and this film is more angled around the drama surrounding the loneliness of its three central women, with some tentative satanic themes thrown in. Director George Miller has seen fit to cast all the central roles with strong personalities; and while Jack Nicholson stands out the most, the themes of the story and the other performer's aren't lost under his star profile. The plot centres on three New England women (Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michele Pfeiffer) who, bored with their lives, inadvertently conjure up the man of their dreams. Soon after, their town of 'Eastwick' is graced by the presence of Daryl Van Horne (Nicholson), a wealthy and handsome man who manages to satisfy the desires of all three women. However, Daryl has his own sinister motives...It has to be said the plotting is rather hit and miss, as the film features great slices of acting; such as the scene between jack Nicholson and Cher in his bedroom, but then this is offset by a lot of very silly instances, and what could have been a great film is marred by a too prominent sense of humour. Jack Nicholson is a delight to watch, however, as he lights up the screen at every opportunity and ensures that the film is always at least worth watching. Cher is my pick of the female leads as she provides the strongest and most memorable female character in the film. Both Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer are decent enough, but don't particularly stand out. The themes of the plot don't come across too well, and at times I wondered whether this film actually had a point to make or not. The director also seems to keen not to show any nudity, and this is a shame as The Witches of Eastwick features prominent themes of lust throughout, so some nudity wouldn't have gone amiss. But even so, despite many flaws and inconsistencies; The Witches of Eastwick is fun enough for a single viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could we have more of an all star cast with Michelle Pfeiffer, Cher, and Susan Sarandon, and Jack Nicholson. This movie is funny, crazy, silly, sexy, and just plain great entertainment. It should teach all men not to cross a woman cause you just may not know when you're dealing with a witch. When powerful women get together things happen and men beware. This film shows these women in their normal lives and then when they get together the powers unfold. So fun to watch things happening to Jack Nicholson....his acting is brilliant as usual. When you want to be entertained just rent this film and remember why each of them is a star. Why do we love the all star casts? Maybe because the reason for their stardom is their personality and when great personalities get-together on film.....we all love the chemistry.</fullReview>

Oh well, this is a great movie with great music, great New England scenery, great direction by Mad Max George Miller and a great screenplay.

		<shortDescription>Major Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Miller's star-studded fantasy about three women who conjure up the man of their dreams, in the form of 'Daryl Van Horn' (Jack Nicholson), is trashy and rather absurd for the most part.While Jack Nicholson absorbs his role well, the plot remains ridiculous and one can never believe that any of these supposedly intelligent women could fall for the obnoxious character he plays. For a comedy, it lacks humour, and the premise itself isn't even funny. Veronica Cartwright, in a ludicrous role of a very ill woman, is very good as is John Williams' lively score, but not much else is worth a look in this major disappointment.Sunday, November 15, 1992 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been re-watching a lot of childhood favorites lately and, to my deepest regret, quite a lot of them aren't nearly as good as I remembered them. "The Witches of Eastwick" is half an exception. It's not the genuine black comedy masterpiece that I worshiped when I was twelve years old, but it's nevertheless still a very amusing 80's fantasy with outrageous performances (Jack Nicholson truly excels!) and a handful of unforgettable gross-out moments. The film wondrously opens with atmospheric images of a sleepy and stereotypical small New England town called Eastwick. Alex, Sukie and Jane are three close friends who have all "lost" their husband one way or another and meet up every Thursday to drink, forget about their loneliness problems and fantasize about better lives. They don't realize, however, that the three of them can make things happen if they wish for something simultaneously. That's how they unwarily conjure their ideal man, the not-so-attractive but charming, eloquent and overly sexually active Daryl Van Horne. All together they develop a vivid quadrilateral relationship, which causes a tremendous scandal in the conservative town. The women also slowly begin to realize that Daryl is a devilish individual if he doesn't get what he wants. The Australian born George Miller directs with a surefooted attitude and a great feeling for comic relief, especially during the first hour and a half. During the last half hour, the emphasis lies more on horror and special effects. Although I usually like horror and fantasy, the climax of "The Witches of Eastwick" is a little too boisterous and chaotic, especially in comparison to the moody and ironic first two acts. The film is primarily worth tracking down for the fabulous performances of the entire cast. Michelle Pfeiffer, Cher and Susan Sarandon form a wondrous trio and Jack Nicholson, well, ? he demonstrates why he's righteously considered as one of the most gifted actors who ever lived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best witch movies!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS POSSIBLEI liked THE CRAFT, and I thought PRACTICAL MAGIC was very mediocre. THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK is the best of all modern witch stories, and the 2 above titles must have been inspired. CHARMED is another knockoff which is probably very inspired by this 1987 horror/comedy about 3 women in a tiny New England hamlet, three women who have all been married and have lost their husbands in one of three ways: Death, Divorce, Desertion, the 3 Ds!!! Alex Medford (Cher) is a sculptor, widowed with one teen daughter; Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon) is a cellist and music teacher whose husband divorced her; Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pheiffer), a writer for the town newspaper, is a very beautiful and very fertile woman whose husband just plain left her because she gets pregnant almost every time she has sex. She has six kids so far!!! These three are good friends and spend at least one day a week together trying to have fun with macrame, cookery, and martinis. But they all yearn for a man to sweep them away from their lonely humdrum lives. One night, a mysterious stranger moves into town and before you know it, he's swept all three women off their feet and is partying with them in the mansion he bought. Ever since he arrived, prominent citizen Felicia Alden (a positively DEMONIC performance by Veronica Cartwright!!!) has been acting strangely, saying weird things in public, having visions and psychotic episodes, and driving her long suffering husband (Richard Jenkins) out of his own mind. The stranger in town begins to wreak havoc in the women's lives, and they don't realize who he is until terrible things begin to happen in town. Jack Nicholson as Daryl Van Horne is funny, romantic and menacing.There is no graphic sex, but you get the idea that the three women and Daryl are involved in group sex and lesbianism. They begin to think of each other as family. The conservative classic New England town doesn't like Van Horne, and scandal follows the foursome everywhere. There is lots of comedy, memorable lines by Nicholson about midwives and male dominated society, but this is a very good horror flick too!!! Some stuff might turn a weak stomach, especially cherry pits being vomited up. Pheiffer's hemorrhaging scenes are very frightening. The final showdown between the women and their devilish boyfriend is very scary and satisfying for anyone who likes good supernatural horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all-time favorite, if only for the last twenty minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the little hamlet of Eastwick, three women(Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon and Cher) have suffered the "three D's":Desertion, divorce and death. While sitting by a fire eating cheese-whiz and ritz crackers, they unknowingly summon Daryl Van Horne(Jack Nicholson), God's(or should i say Satan's?)gift to women. Seducing them one by one, they undergo personal and physical transformations into women of lust, desire and audacity. Offended by this behavior, the town socially outcasts them, which leads to them to abandon Daryl. Daryl simply won't put up with being dumped, so he uses his otherwordly powers to exact revenge on the three women. Ultimately, it becomes an epic battle of the sexes, which includes a voodoo doll, one the most interesting car chases yet filmed, and lots and lots of feathers.Bursting with visual excitement, George Miller peerlessly directs this literate if not completely faithful adaptation of John Updike's novel. Nicholson is wonderfully over-the-top, and Cher, Sarandon and especially Pfeiffer use their beauty as well as their brains to produce superior comedic results. Well-executed in every respect. Even the vomiting scenes are tasteful. Veronica Cartwright is worth mentioning as Felicia Alden, a woman who suspects Daryl and becomes maddened by his powers. The last twenty minutes are a hoot, and have surprisingly great special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miller Is God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMHO: George Miller is the best director that money can buy. Of course, you can't buy Miller, because his experiences with the two producers on this film were so traumatic that he swore off Hollywood and returned home to Australia, where he contented himself for a time with smaller budgets. Smart man.It's a testament to Miller's talent that Fox is now underwriting the fourth film in the Mad Max series -- despite the fact that the entire saga has not even grossed $100 million. There isn't another filmmaker in the world who gets that kind of respect in this business.... Well, maybe there's one.Anyway, by George Miller standards this movie is a bit of a mess. Still, it rates an 8 out of 10 on my scale. If you give a damn about movies at all, you'll watch all his films. For a sense of how he stacks up against some of the better known names in Hollywood, rent The Twilight Zone movie, which Spielberg co-produced. It's Miller's piece that sends you out of the theater -- and not by accident, either.Best moment in Witches: that clown toy bobbing back and forth with blood splattered across its face.There are some actors who could hold your attention just by reading the phone book. Extending the metaphor, there are only about three or four directors in the entire world who could manage the same trick. Miller's one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Witches Of Eastwick is an odd story of three bored small-town women who make a wish, only for that wish to come true as a seductive stranger (Jack Nicholson as Darrell van Horn) arrives and manages to effortlessly sweep the three of them into a menage a quatre. However, they realise that the supernatural overtones of what is happening mean that Darrell's charming persona fits only as long as he is getting his own way: severe troubles lie ahead if they do not send him back where he came from.I guess one might call this a supernatural horror comedy satire with sexy overtones. In truth, it is a complete mishmash yet somehow, for the most part, it works. The three women - Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon, and Cher - are all excellent, but the film is Jack Nicholson's. Darrel van Horn is a part which fits Nicholson's screen persona of the expectation of scenery-chewing like a glove. He is very funny indeed.The climactic 20 minutes or so is a terrific piece of cinema - suspenseful, funny, and scary.And John Williams' theme - one of his less well known pieces - is brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good entertainment, despite everything.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Witches of Eastwick" always had been a movie that I enjoyed watching, ever since my childhood. It's some good quality entertainment, while it actually isn't even all that great as a movie.Main problem with this movie is that it actually as a very poor story, that actually make this movie a very pointless one as well. The concept of it is actually filled with plenty of potential but the story does far too little with it. You definitely should expect some more fireworks and magic from a movie that features the devil himself as one of your main characters. There just isn't enough happening really in this movie but yet the movie really still manages to work out as some great entertainment.Seriously, without all of its fine, well known actors, this movie would had been a totally bad and pointless one to watch. It really are all of the actors and their dynamics together. They give this movie so much and are the reason why the movie throughout remains such a perfectly watchable one, even when really not an awful lot is going on. The characters and actors really manage to keep things going and interesting. I hope the casting director received some sort of bonus afterward, since brining Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon, Cher and Jack Nicholson all together in one movie turned out to be pure gold. You can of course also never go wrong with having Jack Nicholson playing the devil.It's pretty unique for any sort of movie to feature 4 main characters, that each share an equal amount of screen time and importance to the movie and its story. You might start picking sides with one of them after a while but this is no real problem and the movie does a good job at making each and every character important, without that ever going at the expense of another.They even managed to let Susan Sarandon look somewhat attractive in this, which also really was an important aspect for the movie. It was important for all 3 female leads to be equally attractive, or else the entire aspect of the 1 guy going for- and living with 3 women wouldn't had worked out that convincing. It also comes across as convincing that the 3 leading ladies remain friends throughout the entire movie, despite everything they go through and all fall for the same guy. It's really thanks because of their acting skills but also really because they all shared some great chemistry together, as if they were all already good friends for years, before doing this film.You could perhaps also really thank director George Miller for this, as well as the movie its fine dialog. Director George Miller did not only manage to keep things going and interesting, despite of its lacking story, he also managed to make the movie, despite everything, such an enjoyable one. It's a movie with a light and pleasant sort of atmosphere. You can tell this is a movie made purely for entertainment and not for any awards. It's a movie with plenty of laughs in it and some enjoyable (supporting) solid characters. I miss this sort of entertainment. The sort of entertainment Spielberg also used to make earlier in his career, for instance.Still story-wise, the movie is a bit of a mess and I'm pretty sure there were lots of scenes left on the cutting room floor. That would explain so much as to why sometimes seemingly random stuff is happening in this movie and why some characters suddenly change appearance.But there really is plenty of other stuff to compensate for this, next to the earlier mentioned acting performances and dialog. The movie for instance also features some pretty good early special effects and a nice musical score by John Williams.All in all this remains some good entertainment to watch, despite of everything.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie more on repeated viewings, when I began noticing subtleties that I had missed the first time. It's an understated adaptation, certainly reading the book would help but I think it tells the story quite well on its own, and it's full of clever touches that the second and third time around made me smile and think "that's just perfect", with lots of dry humor scattered throughout. I disagree with the comment about it being a "hash". Being about the power of the unconscious and supernatural (or more precisely the primal power of nature, specifically feminine power and nature) it works well as a mood piece, and the sparse plotting leaves the viewer who is open to it to join the three women on their inner voyage of discovery. For example, they were all shocked and frightened (as we were) at the earth cracking under their feet during their argument. The conclusion is subtle but powerful; male and female forces in a fragile balance, with the women really in charge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Witches of Eastwick Could we have more of an all star cast with Michelle Pfeiffer, Cher, and Susan Sarandon, and Jack Nicholson. This movie is funny, crazy, silly, sexy, and just plain great entertainment. It should teach all men not to cross a woman cause you just may not know when you're dealing with a witch. When powerful women get together things happen and men beware. This film shows these women in their normal lives and then when they get together the powers unfold. So fun to watch things happening to Jack Nicholson....his acting is brilliant as usual. When you want to be entertained just rent this film and remember why each of them is a star. Why do we love the all star casts? Maybe because the reason for their stardom is their personality and when great personalities get-together on film.....we all love the chemistry. My vote is 9 out of 10 for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contrary to the decidedly sexist (particularly heterosexist) views of previous comment makers about this movie, I found it to be brilliant. A fairytale equally for men and women alike who have a good sense of dark humor.The actors are at their comedic and dramatic best. You almost get a sneaking suspicion that the roles were created for these actors - or that these actors were created for these roles. Some of the lines would be unforgivably offensive if spoken by any other actors but these. It was a delight to see Susan Sarrandon (of Thelma &amp; Louise fame) give us in this movie a veritable encore performance from her stint in Rocky Horror Picture Show. The Witches of Eastwick music soundtrack, by famous Star Wars &amp; Indiana Jones composer John Williams, is so fantastic that it literally sold out in stores.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based upon a John Updike novel in which three witches Cher, Susan Sarandon, and Michelle Pfeiffer conjure up the ideal man mate, for all three to share, but it turns out to be the devil himself Jack Nicholson. Nicholson turns in an over the top performance as Daryl Van Horne the sex driven evil devil. A role that suits his real life personality perfect. Nicholson seduces the coven, which gives the trio power evil power the devil's power. Just like the evil powers that be greed develops, and Nicholson cast pain and suffering on the three ladies after his pleasureful seductions. Like any good witch would do the trio uses the gift of devil magic to good use and Nicholson's devil character dies from a voodoo doll spell. All three of the coven give birth to a child after Van Horne's death. This film gives us the message that evil can pleasure us only so far, then when mistreated we must give revenge with our own obtained evil's and enjoy our kept pleasure from the departed evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose having Jack Nicholson play the usual Jack Nicholson character was thought by some to be a casting coup - and a masterpiece would be born. Cher. Sarandon. Pfeiffer. A real casting coup. All they needed was a script.They didn't get it with this dreck. The Hayes Code is long gone, but movies like this tell us why codes evolve in the first place: hideousness built on wretchedness heaped on tastelessness served on poor writing pretending to be clever and wry. With Satan as obnoxious centerpiece.When anything can be filmed and standards evaporate, shock shlock results - attention earned not by great dialogue, clever sets, smart comedy, but by puking, mocking, and dialogue out of a bad True Detective parody.Satan comes into the lives of three women in small-town America. In one choice vignette, he gives a mocking, foul speech in a church. In another, he gives a mocking foul speech . . . Well you get the drift. Foul speech, puke, foul speech, puke, interspersed with not the slightest bit of cleverness. A high school film project effort where the teacher never showed up to advise.Hideous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those dam* perfect movies, which means that it does everything it wants to do perfectly. It's not Gandhi. It's a small wonderful movie with terrific actors at their insane best having monstrous fun. Sarandon, pinched up constricted small town music teacher turned libertine: 'OK, get rid of your music?all of it??Now on 4 we're going to play the sh*t of this piece'. Char, Pfeiffer, Veronica Cartwright ? brilliant moment after brilliant moment ? Nicholson above all, with every look on his face. His speech in church at movie's end: 'WOMEN?WAS IT AN ACCIDENT? or DID GOD DO IT TO US ON PURPOSE?' Incredible, totally amazing incredible speech. It should be a classic. The whole movie should be a classic for what it is, an absolutely brilliant small movie.Notes:#1 I haven't parsed 'Witches' out scene by scene, but I almost suspect every shot could be perfect. Absolutely nothing wasted, stuffed King Kong - then three boys in the bath. But like any small perfect movie, it's absolutely essential to watch this as in a movie theater, in a dark room, most of the lights out, preferably at night. #2 Screw Douglas in 'Wall Street' ? Nicholson should have won best actor for this, and he wasn't even nominated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is worth watching if only for the performance of Jack Nicholson as Daryl Van Horne, conjured up by three lonely women from the small town of Eastwick (Michelle Pfeiffer, Cher and Susan Sarandon) as the answer to all their problems, who then discover that getting everything that they want in a man isn't necessarily a good thing! Nicholson is absolutely hilarious as the self proclaimed "horny little devil" who runs amok through the streets and churches of Eastwick, until the girls finally figure out a way to get their revenge. He will have you rolling on the floor with laughter here. It's hard to pick out any one scene of Nicholson's that particularly leaps out, but his seduction of Alex (Cher) is priceless and his performance in the church ("when God created women was it a mistake? Because if it was, maybe we can fix it!") will have you in tears.Cher, Pfeiffer and Sarandon were all good playing what were essentially straight roles here, but they were overshadowed by Veronica Cartwright as Felecia, who understands that evil has come to Eastwick and is driven insane by it, much to the chagrin of her husband, poor Clyde (Richard Jenkins.) Cartwright was almost as hilarious as Nicholson.As funny as it is, the movie has its serious moments. I think particularly of Daryl slicing open a fruit to cause severe pain to Sukie (Pfeiffer). That was actually quite unsettling; made even more so by the overall hilarious tone the movie set.This is truly an excellent movie; a must-see in my opinion.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More appropriately titled `Warlock of Eastwick' given that the devilish powers of the three women only materialise after consummation of their relationships with the ol' devil himself, Jack Nicholson. As a 2-hour slice of entertainment it serves us OK, especially with some fun visuals and four of the business's best known actors. The problem is that it's an adaptation of a John Updike novel. It's one I haven't read, but knowing some of his other work leads me to believe that there is, or should be, more to this than meets the eye. The ability to vomit prohibitive distances, or for the cello to make such a fiery contribution to seduction, works fine within the context of a Hollywood production. But as an Updike novel? I think not. Take it for what it is - a bit of fun; you'll have the devil of a time looking for hidden meanings and probably finish up spitting cherry stones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morality tale with, very funny scenes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the points in the movie are left unexplained. It seems a little discontinuous. Assuming these three gals are witches, haven't they ever noticed it before? Why are they attracted to the repulsive Nicholson? How did they acquire the power to suspend themselves in midair? A couple of things like that, but they're not too important.We know the story is looking into peoples' relationship with God, not just because the movie shows us this but because we know that John Updike, who wrote the novel, has been absorbed by spiritual issues throughout his career. In case we don't know about the novel, many of the most important scenes take place in the local church, which cue us in.Not that the church scenes, or any other scenes, are particularly solemn or preachy. We're distanced from everything that's going on because it's so clearly a fantasy and sometimes an outrageously funny one. The cast could hardly be improved upon. In most of his scenes Nicholson is into his self-consciously ironic mode -- that fake smile seems to sit on his face whenever he's not speaking. But in two key scenes, when Cher confronts him while he's ironing and at the climax, he puts effort into his performance and it clicks. The three babes are great and complement each other perfectly. There is an overhead shot towards the end when the three of them are running barefoot at dainty full speed across the marble floor of the mansion, their loose silk robes billowing behind them, their fluffy curly mops of hair bobbing (one black, one amber, one blond), that seems to turn them into three mice or gerbils or fairies. A delightful shot. The director is fond of overhead shots. (God is a major player in this movie.) They're used well. Veronica Cartwright must be mentioned too, since she gives the closest thing to a serious dramatic performance in the film. She's driven mad by the devil and, what with her clogged nose and croaking voice, evokes pity in us. She's the only person in town who sees exactly what's going on, and she dies for it. Her husband has a difficult role but handles it well, a necessary balance between his rage at his wife's insane behavior and the need to smile and chuckle and treat these preposterous troubles as nothing more than a slight perturbation in their normal orbits. He blows his stack at the end. Also his wife's stack.Some scenes linger in the mind more than others. The harmonious foursome frolicking in a sea of balloons while "nesun dorma" plays from a boom box. (Some of the sound, including this aria, is irritatingly tinny.) The song in its operatic context combines heartbreak with ecstasy. (It's used to the former effect in "The Killing Grounds" and for the latter here.) The scene in which Nicholson coaches Sarandon on the cello then leaps to the piano and bangs out the accompaniment is thrilling. No wonder the cello smokes! The climax at the mansion is an extravaganza of special effects, but it's not the most funny or meaningful scene in the film. That takes place a bit earlier, when the three witches blow Nicholson's devil into the church, then practice more voodoo on him. First he vomits a couple of gallons of cherry pits in some glucous fluid onto the clothes and upturned faces of the congregation, dismissing the event with a casual, "Pay no attention. A cheap trick. Anyone can do it. I TAUGHT it to them. Just a little domestic problem." In this sea of people staring at him and moaning with disgust, he's staggering around in a filthy robe covered with ice cream and feathers while he launches into HIS idea of a Sunday sermon. "Did God make women deliberately or was it a mistake? Huh? Whaddaya think? You think God doesn't MAKE mistakes? Sure, when we make a mistake we call it 'evil' but when HE makes a mistake (he strikes a bizarre port de bras with arms pointing towards heaven) we call it 'NATURE'." He and Updike have a point. If God never makes mistakes, then how come my nerves are all ajangle, and why did He run my urethra through the middle of my prostate, and whatever moved Him to create my ex wife? Then Nicholson gets into a riff on how women are a deliberate curse and the sooner we realize it the better because then we can do something about it. (He's really warming up to the sermon at this point.) We can find a cure -- or invent a vaccine. "Build up our IMMUNE system or sump'n. Get a little exercise! Twenty push ups a day and they disappear!"It's not all that funny, and it's not a horror flick by any means. Evil is seductive, but ultimately destructive. It can be overcome by human rectitude. it's an engaging film, a good job by everyone involved (except the sound man), including John Williams who did a sprightly loopy main theme. Devilishly clever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK was a watchable 1987 comedy/drama about three repressed women (Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon) who have had bad experiences with men in the past and end up accidentally conjuring up what they believe is supposed to be the perfect man (Jack Nicholson); however, the man they conjure up and arrives in Eastwick to charm the three women turns out to be Satan. There are some entertaining scenes in this film but there are problems too. Once Nicholson arrives on the scene, I don't understand why all three woman continue to vie for his attention. It makes no sense to me that these three woman who have supposedly been lifelong friends would fight over the same man; however, this film is completely watchable due to the hammy, overblown performance by Jack Nicholson as Daryl/The Devil. Nicholson just seems to be having a ball here and he makes this OK movie seem much better than it really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk about wasting potential...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There I was in the video-store a couple of weeks ago. Without nothing better to do, I found 'The Witches of Eastwick' DVD in the Horror section. Originally, I haven't never heard of it. But when I read the informations about the movie, I was completely thrilled by it and my hype went sky- high. I mean, how can a movie directed by George Miller (the 'Mad Max' series), with a score composed by John Williams (the 'Star Wars' series, the 'Indiana Jones series', the 'Superman' series, 'E.T.: The Extra- Terrestrial' and many others) and featuring four of my favorite actors of all time (Jack Nicholson, Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer) could be bad? Well, apparently, this movie succeed into wasting all this potential in a boring and non-sense flick...'The Witches of Eastwick' story is based on a novel by John Updike that tells the story of three single women that live a (very) small New England town called Eastwick. They are Alexandra Medford (Cher), Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon) and Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer). The shallowness of their lives is soon to be changed when a new man moves into town. Daryl Van Horne (Jack NIcholson) is exactly what the three of them were waiting. He is filthy rich and wild eyed, and they innocently conjure up to him. But while with him, they discover almighty powers in them selves, finding out that they actually witches and Van Horne is the devil. The plot seems to be kinda nonsense and it is, indeed. And aside from not making sense at all, the movie's screenplay is also badly adapted from Updike's book by Michael Cristofer. This makes the movie worse than it is, because of the horrible development of the story and the completely garbage dialogs. There also some scenes that are unnecessarily disgusting and bad-written. But the script is not all bad. There are a few funny lines, though, and the movie has a surprisingly well-made and fun ending. With a cast like this, you can't help but wait a top-notch overall acting. And that's why I've got completely disappointed by the acting here. It seems like the ensemble just didn't work, and that's a shame. The always-excellent Jack Nicholson delivered a great performance, as usual, with some nice voice and body work. His final speech is something truly amazing. But the rest of the cast simply didn't know what to do. All the supporting cast was bad, specially Veronica Cartwright and Richard Jenkis as two of the city's habitants. And when you though that Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer were going to equal Nicholson's work, they didn't. All the three female stars were bad, specially Cher and Michelle Pfeiffer. Nothing compared to what they did in movies like 'Moonstruck' or 'Scarface'. On the other hand, Susan Sarandon at least tried to deliver a comic performance, but just couldn't. All she did was embarrass herself (and this statement works not just for Sarandon, but for Cher and Pfeiffer also).There's nothing to comment on George Miller's directing work in this picture. It's just another point to be disappointed by - he did nothing special. The special effects were great for 1987, but it's sort of thing that didn't age well. Kids these days would laugh at some scenes. Aside from Nicholson's performance, two other things saved the movie in my opinion. They were the set-decoration, which I really liked, and John Williams's original music score. There are some truly great pieces written for the movie, and some of the tunes don't get out of my head.Overall, 'The Witches of Eastwick' is the movie that wasted most potential in cinema's history. A could've been great flick was transformed into a disappoint because of the horrible acting, writing and directing. If it wasn't for Jack Nicholson's good performance and John Williams' catchy tunes, 'The Witches of Eastwick' would've been a fail in every sense of the word. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really the camp 80's film it's marketed as...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the small American town of Eastwick, where Christian values of morality and family life serve as the law, strange and violent events begin to occur with the arrival of a new, big city, millionaire charmer by the name of Darrell Van Horn (Nicholson). His entrance is seemingly brought on by the wish of three single women, who are supposedly Witches (played by Cher, Pfeiffer and Sarandon), who can make anything happen by wishing it at the same time. Soon we see Van Horn seducing and having a polygamous relationship with the three witches, which leads to happiness, laughter and disaster. Who exactly is this Van Horn character and is this the beginning of a new era in family values? Like its other 80's contemporaries, such as Working Girl and Fatal Attraction, The Witches of Eastwick doubles as a social commentary on the state of women in a male dominated society, as well as a simple point A to point B story. Here, the focus is on the new breed of middle aged single women, who can be mothers and career women and still have time for a cocktail at the end of the day, without the need for a providing husband.While the film does work as a thought inducing critique on the perception of modern women and the men who have always tried to exploit them, as a whole, it lacks focus. At various points it tries to be a thriller, a satire and a serious look at modern America, but director George Miller never really manages to blend these different tones into one cohesive whole. As a result, the film seems a little confused. On the plus side though the whole cast give fantastic performances, especially Nicholson and Sarandon, who clearly seem to be having more fun playing their mischievous roles than others and the film does have quite a few dark "laugh out loud" moments.For those of you looking for a fun, camp eighties movie, it might be a better idea for you to revisit Working Girl or Overboard, since you will clearly be disappointed by this picture. Fans of Nicholson and "Gurrrl Power"(in it's most radical sense) should definitely check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do women want ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not to be taken at it's face value, that is the evil stuff, special effects and the witches settling down with their respective ,totally different looking kids, and not resembling their biological father Daryl, but more or less with their moms. As many of the reviewers have correctly pointed out, a more competent, thoughtful and mature direction would have turned the movie into a memorable movie, than a forgettable one, and actually flippant , to put it more bluntly.Starting with Jack's seductive best, and isn't he known as the greatest seducer of them all, on an d off screen, it becomes a mockery of his earlier image,of a charming, sexy,witty maverick,into a totally destroyed individual, devoid of his all evil powers, a physical and mental wreck ! This doesn't match with his aggressive persona projected through the pranks he plays ,when his ego is badly bruised by the three women, who have now turned hostile, and want to ruthlessly destroy him, and get rid of him for ever ! Nicholson is truly brilliant,has given a good performance as usual, but perhaps with a better script and stronger direction, and more scope to allow him for delivering his powerful dialogs, it certainly would have matched his role in The Shining, a classic horror movie of all times. The confusion over comedy, horror ,or some thing different, has resulted into robbing the movie of it's excitement, awe, and thrills. We already know that the this guy who came in as a powerful factor in the lives of the three witches,is finally going to lose after all, and this prediction deprives the climax of all the charm.Now about my interpretation behind the apparent plot line of a more-or -less not too ancient tale of some thing unusual happening in a small town; Well, he goes to buy ice cream and stuff like that, doesn't he ? So, according to my some what wild thinking,this is a take on the psyche of women, who are shown ruthless, merciless, determined to take revenge, coming together to achieve that, and not being grateful to what a man has given them; a palacious home, cute kids, wealth, a butler, a dog, and above all, torrid sexual pleasure ! i felt very touched when Daryl tries to communicate with his babies, they,too,gleefully chuckle and respond; and what do these three women do ?Just vanish him with a remote ! Seems to be inspired from Shakesperean dramas, where the women are more evil, and cold-hatred than even men. i normally don't miss this movie, whenever it comes on any channel, specially HBO, and i do it for Nicholson, to see his seduction, his desperation, and his eyes; but end up feeling that some thing is missing. Cher, Susan and Mitchelle, all look good, but don't have much to do. so also about the other supporting cast; i have given seven, as i feel, one should watch it at least once, specially for Nicholson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The eternal struggle for power and recognition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As was mentioned in another review on this site, when watching "The Witches" for a second or a third time, one tends to concentrate more on the content and the ensuing message it conveys than on the visual thrill the movie has to offer. The subject matter is obviously an allegory of the battle of the sexes and the recognition of the abyss that separates men from women or to put it in more lay terms: the impossibility of man ever understanding woman and vice versa.The devil in this case is the male in his most extreme form: with just one preoccupation on his mind, and we all know what that is, he considers his female counterpart exclusively as an object of lust. The use of the term "mind" in the previous sentence was intentional and an important element as the male is all too well aware of the passion that drives him but also of his unsuccessful attempts at satisfying his logical side, namely by finding a rational explanation for the world he lives in. In his opinion the clash between the rational and the irrational isn't reflected in the woman he desires and this observation not only frustrates him but adds to his confusion. Do the three witches represent woman as seen by man? Apparently they do: although they initially seem to have their own unique personality they soon blend together by certain traits most men attribute to women in general: notwithstanding their seemingly high moral standards they easily succumb to the cave man tactics of the outrageous seducer and rapidly adapt their life style to one of luxury and debauchery. At one point it is Sukie ( Michelle Pfeifder) who states that women are more a part of nature than men as they go with the flow of the absurdity of life. A rather cynical reference to the values of women is the ludicrous appearance of Felicia (Veronica Cartwright) , the editor's wife, who's moral principles drive her to madness. Who comes out the winner of this battle of the sexes? Without any doubt: women. When required, they can leave their rivalry, envy and jealously behind and punish even the most virile of men. The final scene shows the triumphant witches who have apparently obtained what they really wanted to achieve: a thriving matriarchy where surrounded by babies, they can conjure up the devil (man) on a screen and delete him whenever they wish. As stated above "The Witches of Eastwick" is an allegory...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director George Miller (Mad Max, Babe: Pig in the City), watching this film again was a good idea, I do remember giggling and liking the stars, but I certainly needed a better idea of the story. Basically, in the town of Eastwick, New England, friends Alexandra Medford (Cher), Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon) and Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer) are bored, and conjure up a mystery man to satisfy their desires, as they have no husbands anymore. So along comes the man who fits the bill perfectly, filthy rich Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson), and one by one, he gives them a night of passion, and they find powers within themselves. They realise that Daryl is too much for them all to take, and after one final night of passion for the three of them, the women make a voodoo doll of Daryl to use and ruin the life of, to try and make him go away. This spell only enrages Daryl, who they realise is the Devil on Earth, but they do manage to destroy him, and they are all left with babies from him, and he can only communicate via television. Also starring Alien's Veronica Cartwright as Felicia Alden and Richard Jenkins as Clyde Alden. Nicholson, along with the three female leads, make good performances, the bewitching special effects are quite good, and there are some amusing moments, I think for me it is the charming sensual fantasy that makes this watchable. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for John Williams and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Effects. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oscar winner Jack Nicholson (As Good as it Gets) plays a person whose name everyone in town has problems remembering: Daryl Van Horne! He is outstanding as Daryl. I have the tape and the beginning of the every Fall I tend to watch it, I guess: (1) It came out in the Fall; (2) The advertising for the film was "something wicked this way comes" And Halloween is just around the corner. By the way because of Halloween's tradition, it is not on my favorite list of Holidays perhaps there is nothing "holy" about it! This is a sleek, sexy comedy with a touch of horror. It more fun than fear really! Unless you start thinking that the people who put the movie together really researched the occult and know exactly the power of evil forces. Which they did! But I tend to leave judgment aside and enjoy the movie. I like acting, and an actor like good a good lawyer cannot judge. That is for judges and judgmental people! The movie is set in one of those New England towns that everybody wishes they lived in. All cute little white houses, with white picket fences. The photography is great in part because of the cute place. There are three best friends: Oscar winner and fitness guru Cher (Moonstruck) plays Alexandra Medford; Oscar winner Susan Sarandon (Dead Men Walking) plays Jane Spofford, a very prudish music teacher, whom I like best without the red wig, and Oscar nominee, Michelle Pfeiffer (Scareface) is Sukie Ridgemont a journalist who has bunches of kids. Their friendship is enviable. Veronica Cartwright, has one of the most interesting parts in this movie, she is the sensitive good person who dies because she sensed the evil surrounding her and the city. However in the movie, the viewer is led to think that she is the bad guy. Veronica Cartwright played very well the part of Felicia Alden. Alexandra, Jane and Sukie have the unconscious power to make things happen. They wished to date a nice man, typical feelings for women, and there comes Van Horne. I always have a good time watching this comedy. My favorite quotes: Daryl Van Horne: " Little! But potent!" "Ballroom, interesting word: ballroom!" "Don't let her get to you, have a cherry! Have another cherry, here another cherry." "I called first because that way you feel superior and see me at the same time." Van Horn understands women! My favorite scenes: The tennis match and its special effects. A memorable scene: the projectile vomiting also used on the movie The Exorcist. We always laugh watching the same movie every early Fall . . . hopefully... nothing wicked will come this way, except a few kids in the search of candies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't watch this on a Sunday. Loosely based (I hope!) on John Updike's story, one comes away from this feeling dirty, its apparent underlying message: There is a Satan, but God is AWOL or plain helpless. A perfect example of entertainment and repulsiveness combined. Oh, sure, everything works, from Pfeiffer's innocence to Nicholson as Hell's minion (who could play it better) to the cinematography, and even Cher's often nebulous acting... but all of it to what end? It's cholesterol for the soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, it's pretty amazing that Cher was a pretty hot movie actress 20-25 years ago (not a reference to her looks, although... see for yourself).Unfortunately, she and her co-stars, Susan Sarandon (she still looks great today at 60-something) and Michelle Pfeiffer, are in a mess of a movie.It was a neat idea. The devil comes to earth to spawn. He seduces the three women and when they find out who he is, they also discover they have magical powers and use them to get rid of him. Well, not entirely. The ending is one of the more insane ones I have seen in a mainstream movie.Jack Nicholson has enormous fun. Could you picture anyone but him in this part? Al Pacino tried a decade later and failed in The Devil's Advocate. The problem, I think, is the plot doesn't service him that well. He doesn't do a lot of damage and his intended minions aren't really dealt with in an intelligent manner.One great thing is the woman played by Veronica Cartwright. Truly a scary and memorable performance. The vomiting is a bit much, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Witches of Eastwick, based upon the bestselling novel by John Updike was the first Hollywood feature from George "Mad Max" Miller. The Mad Max trilogy established Miller as a director of tremendous promise. Indeed, when he directed the final story for Twilight Zone: The Movie, although unknown, he ended up making the best story in the entire film. So it was with The Witches of Eastwick that he got the chance to show Hollywood proper what he could really do.But The Witches of Eastwick was a very troubled production behind the scenes. The Australian Miller didn't get along at all with the Hollywood producers, who kept interfering with his decisions. It got so bad that production of the film was shut down until Miller's demands were met. And even Jack Nicholson threatened to walk off the set if the producers replaced Miller. The experience was so upsetting for Miller that he returned to Australia, and has yet to make another film in America.Not surprisingly, Miller's output since has been extremely sporadic. It would be five years before he returned to the directors chair, and even then, the films he's made are unworthy of him. With the exception of the superb Happy Feet, a film that marked a return to the playing field for Miller. And a return to form.When you finally watch The Witches of Eastwick, you wonder what it was the producers were so worried about. I don't know what they're problem with Miller was. Because none of those backstage production headaches had any effect on his direction. Its a wholly enjoyable film. One of the most entertaining black comedies ever made. A near perfect delight.In the fictional town of Eastwick, single women Alex (Cher), Sukie (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Jane (Susan Sarandon) are bored. They live in a town so boringly respectable they're just dying for something to shake up the place. And that something is Jack Nicholson. Daryl Van Horne (Nicholson) blows into town, a mysterious stranger, and one by one, seduces each of the three women. But it turns out Alex, Sukie and Jane are witches, Daryl is The Devil, and now they've summoned him into they're lives, its not so easy to get him out.Few films satisfy like The Witches of Eastwick. Everything about it is marvellous. This is a film that gives you pleasure by just regarding it. Because there is so much to like. The film is a visual treat. It has a wonderful music score from John Williams, one that finds an epic sweep one minute and a whimsical one the next. The script from Michael Cristofer takes us through the several nuances of seduction and betrayal. And it has a superb ensemble cast. One of the finest ever assembled.When it comes to actors playing The Devil, no one is more qualified than Jack Nicholson. Put horns and a goatee on him and he would even look a dead ringer for Satan. One suspects George Miller wouldn't have had the slightest interest in directing if Nicholson hadn't agreed to sign on. Unlike The Shining, where Stanley Kubrick made the mistake of putting him into a part he wasn't right for, Miller knows he's got the right actor, which is why he allows Nicholson to play things to the hilt. In The Shining, it was just plain annoying. In The Witches of Eastwick, its a tour-de-force.This is a role that fits Nicholson like a glove. A known womaniser in real life, he brings so much conviction to the part. Its tailor-made for him. With those eyebrows that arch into the air, and that Cheshire cat grin he can do so well, he leers and sneers his way through the film. Large as life, he gets some great opportunities to give it all he's got. Denouncing women one minute, seducing them the next. Not only does he grin like a Cheshire cat, he purrs like one!But we mustn't leave out the women. They all give great performances. As the sensible Alex, Cher provides a steady anchor. The bit where she points out all of Daryl's faults is an instant classic. Michelle Pfeiffer is as lovely as ever. She always plays better in offbeat roles, and does so here.But its Susan Sarandon who gives the best acting of the three. Always a greatly underrated actress, she gets one of her best roles here. A prim and proper music teacher, who becomes a seductive, sexual temptress. She has great chemistry with Jack Nicholson. The film fires itself up whenever they're paired together. Especially the scene when he teaches her to pour her emotions into a difficult music piece, and transforms before our very eyes. Its a superb performance.An often overlooked performance comes from Veronica Cartwright, a woman who stands for all good and purity, and goes through a Linda Blair like possession. Veronica Cartwright came off a bit neurotic in Alien, but when turned toward black comedy, her through the roof hysterics become quite funny.Most people who've seen The Witches of Eastwick think it falls apart at the end. Although I'm a huge fan of the film, it does seem a little unsure of itself in the second half. It ends with a lot of running around and special effects, as if George Miller didn't know how to end it. But its still fun all the same. Who couldn't love a scene where Daryl vents his hatred for women in church while he vomits up cherries on the ushers? Despite the uncertain ending, its still a wonderful film. And such an addictive treat. Jack Nicholson's broad performance is brilliant. The set design is sumptuous. And it sounds magnificent. I notice new things every time. A film I can never get enough of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but not much like the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow about half way through making this film someone decided that John Updike, one of the Worlds greatest living writers, didn't know how to tell a story, so they abandoned the book and made up their own story.I don't dislike this movie. The actors do a wonderful job of playing the characters that were raised up from the entrails of the great book after it has been disemboweled. The special effects are fun to watch and so on. This is perhaps because I saw the movie first and read the book a few years later. Having been an Updike fan since reading Rabbit Run in high school (a long long time ago), I was rather puzzled by the movie because it was such a departure from Updikes sex filled dramatic stories about relationships in rural and small town America. OK, they had the sex, and the small towns, but the battle with the devil just didn't seem very much like something the writer of Rabbit Run would write. The first half of the book and movie are quite similar, but the second half really missed the point of the book. The women come out looking like saints who save the world, and Jack Nicholson character becomes a devil. On the other hand I don't think John Updike would hate the movie -- he'd probably find it very funny.Its entertaining and as movies go, well worth seeing. In fact I'd recommend it for anyone who is NOT a John Updike fan. I've rated it for the benefit of non-Updike fans. For Updike fans, I guess it deserves a 3 (at least it had the sex, the small town people, and the humor of the original -- that counts for three). But I'd really, really, like to have seen the book made into a movie.... So heres an idea, change the name of the film to Witches Dual the Devil and make a real translation of Updike's book for the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The screen adaptation of John Updike's novel is a more-or-less typical package deal: a generic assembly-line production marketed for adults but aimed at adolescents, and supported by the crutch of high-tech (circa 1987)special effects. Somewhere lost within the cartoon scenario about three restless New England divorcées and their pact with Satan is an underhanded comment on male chauvinism and gender aggression, but the film is never allowed a chance to rise above the level of a summer bubblegum fantasy (with literary pretensions). Was it meant to be a horror film? A comedy? An allegory of Women's Lib? By trying to be all three it ends up as an awkward mishmash of each, with only Jack Nicholson's juicy-ham performance (he plays the Prince of Darkness like a dirty old man) holding any interest.</fullReview>

Do you have to be American to find this funny? I love John Updike and I am prepared to believe there is a dark enjoyable novel behind this film. But it has been turned into a humourless, grotesque film. Nicholson has made a raft of poor films offset by some of the finest performances of any actor. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets outweigh any number of duds. Polansky extracted a wonderful performance in Chinatown. But wide-eyed wildness does not make humour. The set pieces are just embarrassing most especially the pink balloons and the tea trolley. I have to be honest the 80s hairstyles really do not help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over the top film is occasionally fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast alone seemed to be worth the price of admission. But the writers and director didn't know what they wanted to do with the material. It osculates wildly from comedy to romance to disaster movie, with the story alternating from gross-out humor (the film has the most vomit scenes in movie history) to satire of a puritanical New England that hasn't existed in ages. Three women (Cher, Susan Sarandon, &amp; Michelle Pfeiffer) are lonely and bored with their mundane lives in a small New England town. They cast a spell and viola, Jack Nicholson appears to them. While Nicholson wouldn't seem to be the fantasy man of many women (he looks like a bum in this film), the three leads go ga-ga for him. It's suggested that he's the devil, but you'd think that the devil would be more powerful and bold than here. But if that were the case, the ending would have to be changed. No one seemed to have any idea what to do with the material, and this spread to the actors. Michelle Pfeiffer is the exception, as she gives the best performance in the move. As for the rest, Jack Nicholson simply revises his character in "The Shining," while Cher is sullen and Susan Sarandon goes through the motions. Veronica Cartwright, who has given good performances in the past, is little more than a stereotype, a serious version of The Church Lady from "Saturday Night Live." While some of the humor works, it more often falls flat. As a result, the films technical expertise is wasted. The photography is genuinely beautiful, and the special effects are good, if inappropriate for the story. In fact, the climax seems to have been inspired from the old Irwin Allen disaster movies. The star power was enough to carry the movie financially, and thankfully, there were no sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had good stars in it and they did a really good job with the scenes. Their acting was top notch. The plot, I could not tell you what this movie is about very well at all. The best I can figure is that the three main female characters obviously have some powers, or not at first. They somehow summon this guy that is supposed to be their dream guy or something or not. He proceeds to show them their powers, and kill this woman and then the girls turn against their dream guy and they have a final showdown with said guy. It sounds a bit messed up and it is. The story is not very clear what the heck is going on at all, still the performances make up for this flaw in the movie and they have some rather funny scenes in this flick too. If only they could have explained a few things better then perhaps it would have been an all around good movie. I suppose the book might have cleared up stuff a bit better, and when it was transferred over to film a lot of the crucial elements were lost in translation. Still, the movie really has good acting from Jack, Cher, Susan and Michelle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh what could have been...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel sorry for Australian George Miller, director of the iconic Mad Max and and Max Max 2, for this, one of the only other major films he's directed is a sad misfire.And what a near success it was too: how can you go wrong with Jack Nicholson playing the devil, Susan Sarandon doing what she does best: seeming to be reserved and prudish then turning around and into a sensual, sexual little mama, a great fun witchy score from John Williams and a story about sex, magic and witches! Cher and Pfeiffer look great, if nothing else. They at least do no physical harm to the picture.Direction is the main thing missing, unfortunately for Mr Miller. Firstly, the script needed rewrites: there are major things which go unexplained, like how the girls are never really shocked at their witchy powers when they finally realise they have them, a major moment of the ball-dropping is not enough reinforced, why the girls move in with some weirdo they don't know, whether they ever realise he's the Prince of Darkness or not, and in general the script is clunky and mechanical. The movie plays out like a poor adaptation of a book - with weak connections between scenes, overlong dialogue scenes, episodism and a generally disconnected plot. And the script started it off with these problems. Miller was the guy who should have said this script is not good enough. But then, instead of trying to improve it by stepping up the pace, he directs it in a languished, over-wrought style. There is by far too much silence for a movie about witches. He wasn't sure what he was making here: drama, sex-comedy, fantasy, tragedy, action or what - and each scene betrays this. For a movie about magic, there is a distinct lack of magical happenings, which are all mainly replaced by an out-of-place storm-and-action filled finale, at the centre of which is stop-motion animation.Each of these scenes should have been shorter, more fun, have better motivation and explanation and more music. Williams' score doesn't play through enough of the picture, again which is more suited to drama than comedy.Jack, the main reason i was watching this, does his best to fight the director's snail-like instincts at every turn, but still can not rescue the suffocating drawn-outness of the whole procession. He's still a total scene-stealer, and still great fun as the devil, but thanks to Miller, not nearly enough fun, which was the main thing that ruined the whole experience for me. This strange tale of witches, devils and magic did not have enough of a sense of humour to not take itself too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Updike May Be in The Credits, But He's Not in the Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK is not the best of John Updike's novels, but it's a masterpiece compared with this hash of a film. Updike's novel, about three women on their own in a small New England in the late 1960's, messing around with magic as a distraction from their troubles and unintentionally summoning up the Devil himself, is a spiky but diverting fantasy (Updike wittily plays with the idea of female outcasts as witches, as many of the women of the past who were accused of witchcraft were often just such outcasts). He also makes good use of his period setting; amidst the general social upheavals of the time (not to mention the fact that ROSEMARY'S BABY was released during the summer of '68), would it be terribly surprising if someone managed to conjure up Satan, and get involved in a messy sexual quadrangle with the fellow?None of that is to be found in the film. Eastwick is just a picture-postcard setting for the story, and although Satan (aka Darryl Van Horn) still beds the trio of friends, it's all rendered as some sort of hip, luxe romp, something that in-crowd, liberated sort of people get to do, as opposed to the unsettling group-sex mess that Updike describes (in a bit too much detail, frankly). Moreover, the "witches" of the title are nothing of the sort until the end; screenwriter Michael Cristofer eliminates all of the details of the women's mini-coven, and the bits of magic they do to amuse themselves and get their bit of revenge on the small-town types that make their lives more unpleasant than they already are. Also gone are most of the violent deaths that Van Horn causes as his relationship with the women deteriorates.And it wastes most of the cast. Jack Nicholson luxuriates in playing Satan, of course, and he's amusing enough, but he's too old and finally too polite for the role (he isn't terribly Jewish either, but frankly that's something of a relief; there's an edge of anti-semitism in Updike's depiction of the devil as a New York Jew). Both Cher and Susan Sarandon were more than adequate to their roles, and they give the characters some texture (Sarandon is hilariously silly after her character throws off her repressions)-- but Michelle Pfeiffer is lovely to look at and pleasant to know--not much more and hardly credible as a woman who's given birth to a passel of children. There are those who thought Updike's portrayal of the women in the novel was tinged with misogyny, an idea which has some merit, but he gave thm the sort of guts, bone and muscle they don't have on screen, and the film's conclusion, which shows them living in some sort of flossy high-rent feminist paradise, complete with lots of domestic help (as opposed to the more mundane fates of the women in the novel) is annoying. The Devil came to town just so this trio could become well-heeled single mothers? Sounds a bit too L.A. for a fellow who comes from Pennsylvania . ..The film gets what little charge is has from George Miller's direction; he gives the more fantastic scenes a feeling of real-world magic; what happens is sometimes so lovely and extraordinary that you start laughing at the wonder of it, and the finale, where the women use a bit of magic to send their boyfriend back to his hometown is breathtaking and hilarious. But Miller agreed to direct this script, which earns him at least ten demerits--I mean, the MAD MAX movies were better than this . ..</fullReview>

Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer are three single gals in New England who fall in lust with the new man in town--a fat, balding, horny character with a high charisma-rate and a smile of temptation. The picture has a sassy opening and some ribald humor, but wow! this thing is really uneven. It is both fantasy and frolic while at times attempting something deeper and more dramatic, embellished with special effects that are awfully heavy. The editing is poor, with scenes that run on entirely too long, particularly the TWO vomiting sequences; also, we seem to miss a lot of background detail on Pfeiffer's character, who looks sickly in the second-half and has an unexplained sore above her lip. I didn't especially like the picture in the theater, but it does play better at home. There you can overlook the wayward dementia of Jack Nicholson (who goes too far), and possibly some of the lapses of judgment in the direction. Either way, however, the ending is flat, leaving behind a bad aftertaste and causing the viewer to wish he had spent the previous two hours doing something else. ** from ****</fullReview>

George Miller directed and shows no real flair for comedy. Unless there's a funnier unedited version somewhere. Nicholson acts silly rather than imposing and the three ladies pretty much just bark at him. The supporting cast is fairly colorful with Veronica Cartwright getting some laughs as the local gossip monger. Beyond that there is very little to recommend.

		<fullReview>Three talented performers, and Cher, participate in the waste of time and effort that is The Witches of Eastwick. I usually try not to start off reviews too negative, but I sat through most of this movie only to justify writing this one and to be polite to my fellow watchers.The Witches of Eastwick starts off in a god-fearing small-town community where three women (Sarandon, Pfeiffer, Cher) talk about their lacking lives and wish for an extraordinary man to arrive and give them something better. They're witches, so the wish comes true and arch-creep Jack Nicholson is the summoned one, who apparently possesses demonic powers to seduce them into a world of promiscuity and philosophical man versus women theories. Right then the movie has passed the first third of it's time and unfolds into one of those funny stories you wrote with your friends in elementary school by taking turns adding a sentence.It's not the numb limb of a plot that makes The Witches of Eastwick a pain to watch though. It takes itself serious. It actually believes to be fascinating. Pretense is added to every shot by pompous orchestral music that begs 'Look, it's interesting! Feel the tension!'.Since I haven't read the novel this movie is based on, I can't judge whether director George Miller (Mad Max 3, Babe) read it upside down or the book just stinks itself. In any case, I couldn't find anything to redeem it from wasting time and actors. I can't recommend it to any serious viewer. If you want Nicholson and Pfeiffer, see Wolf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Witches of Eastwick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a devil's avatar inadvertently being summoned by a trinity of 3D women (Cher, dead- husbanded; Sarandon, divorced; Pfeiffer, deserted) in the Eastwick as the paragon of the man of their dreams (Nicholson, who would believe that?), this comedy-horror has reveled in its runaway pulp fondness, occasionally sprinkled with a few trashy SFX, but the overall consensus is that it could pamper to a certain female-skewed audience (who are zealous about woman's independence), but by and large it fails to conjure up a first-class piece of work and more regrettably the characters are really underwritten, a dream-team cast is squandered (Sarandon at least plausibly fares all right with a transformative presence, while Cher and Pfeiffer barely shine in their goofiness and tediousness). First billed in the film, Nicholson continues his lucky streak in horror-maniac breed since his emblematic creepiness in THE SHINING (1980), whose inexplicable sex appeal has never been fully expounded, yet, all three women plain fall for him all of a sudden (maybe this is love's magic attribute). Then the polygamy orgy doesn't last long since (again inexplicably), a local woman (Cartwright, who unbelievably gives the best performance of the film) has been possessed by the devil and does some sort of tele-simultaneous stunts (in a pretty disgusting manner) and slaughtered by her bleeding heart husband. So 3D women apparently are shocked and start to doubt the real identity of their ideal man, who on the other hand, feels being snubbed by them and discharges a fit of torment on them and eventually 3D women unanimously fight back and voodoo the devil and manage to dispel him, later on their live happily with their children (who are the devil's seeds) while the devil is incarcerated inside the multi-TV screens. My recount is as inconsequent as the film goes, but there are my guilty pleasure moments, e.g. the near-end of Nicholson being witched by his own tele-simultaneous tricks, but the blithe spell is too short to be pleased by. Anyway it is glad to see director George Miller (from MAD MAX franchise) has re-regulated his career orbit, now he is the one running the show of animations, the Oscar winning HAPPY FEET (2006, a 7/10) is under his belt, which I could not have foreseen from this film in any event.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth it for Jack, not so much the rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three lonely women in a conservative New England town who's husbands have left them one way or another wish for the perfect man over their usual Thursday night martini get together. He shows up in the form of a smooth talking devil, literally, and seduces the three of them both physically and mentally. Once he starts being cruel to his enemies the women jump ship, but the devil isn't so eager to part ways.Somewhere down there is a sharp film, unfortunately it's way down there below layers and layers of Hollywood fluff. Part romance, part supernatural horror, part feminist message movie, part a lot of things, really, and succeeds at none of them. Nicholson was born to play the devil and he shouts and spits and smirks something fierce. But the feminism is trite Hollywood puff (ie. women are honest and beautiful like nature while men are base pigs), half the time someone is either levitating or vomiting, and there's really nothing one can take away from the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown, poorly conceived and enormously disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a story premise, The Witches of Eastwick held enormous promise - after all, who better to play the devil than Jack Nicholson, and when backed by such respected and charismatic actresses as Michelle Pfieffer, Susan Sarandon and a well renowned pop star such as Cher playing a trio of seductive witches, how could it possibly turn out as anything less than a wonderfully witty comedic success? Upon viewing the film, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what went wrong, but by the end, it's very easy to see the result for what it is - a hackneyed and ill conceived mishmash attempt at a romantic comedy thriller which ends up being neither romantic, comedic nor thrilling in any way whatsoever. While the movie boasted an excellent premise, it took screenwriter Michael Cristofer and Happy Feet director George Miller to mangle their source material, managing to turn an intriguing story into a patronising, imbalanced and out of control mess. The film ranges from dull and yawningly predictable to just plain surreal, never once managing to draw the audience in in the least, apart from certain moments of utter bewilderment. But if the shoddy helming wasn't enough, the film also inputs some shriekingly bad early attempts at CGI, (most memorably a 'devilish transformation' which would have been far more effective if it were simply implied, ?-la Devil's Advocate, rather than garishly thrust on screen) which lose the film even further credibility. Even John William's score, which would normally be a high point of such a film, is far too over-dramatic to fit the tone, and simply seems out of place. It's hard to decide if the film's central weakness comes from the seeming indecisiveness as to whether to turn the film into a horror epic or romantic comedy, or simply shoddy directing and writing - either way, the result is excruciating to behold.It is tragic indeed to see such a tremendously capable cast put to such waste. Jack Nicholson is a master at playing sly and devious, imposing and dramatic, and witty and humorous, all without breaking a sweat. The role calls for all of these qualities, but he achieves none; resulting in an overly goofy and unconvincing performance, complete with a cringe-worthy and immensely distracting hairstyle. Cher is simply a deplorable casting choice, seeming constantly flat and emotionless, and never once convincing in her role. Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfieffer (especially the latter) try their best, but their characters are so poorly written that they are given little of interest to do except undergo painfully contrived seduction attempts by Nicholson's character. Both are capable of far superior work, and they appear to know it. The supporting cast almost unanimously overact to the point of hysteria, only adding to the viewer's overall feeling of disdain.All in all, The Witches of Eastwick may have started out as a clever idea and a superb cast, but ultimately the film falls short on essentially all fronts, mainly due to the shoddy, uninspired directing and weak, imbalanced script. It is truly tragic to see the legendary Nicholson reduced to such a level of mediocrity (though tiny traces of enjoyment can be obtained from him time to time, overall he is still a colossal disappointment) and sadly enough even the highly talented Pfieffer and Sarandon also fall short of their true potential. All parties involved are capable of far superior work, and it's highly disappointing to see such a talented array ending up with a film as poor as this. -3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weird chick flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to get this movie because the other movie I got ,A Goofy Movie, made me uneasy remembering how long ago it's been since I've seen it. But, it turns out I was wrong. A Goofy Movie, a kid flick, was better than this movie. But, don't get me wrong or anything. But, this movie was weird and funny at some points. While it failed in some other places and made me feel like I was watching the adult version of Twilight. Though, I do like the two church scenes. The first one being where the woman starts screaming about whores and how she knows what the three women are doing. The second scene I liked was when Van Horne was vomiting up cherries. Overall, it was a good film and I would recommend it to someone who enjoys these old campy 80's movies. Otherwise, I would pass this movie up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson is fun, the movie is just so-so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Witches of Eastwick" is about three women in a town called Eastwick and how Satan visits them and alters their sex lives. It's kind of a weird movie. Actually, come to think of it, really weird.But when the women include Michelle Pfeiffer and Cher and the devil is Jack Nicholson himself, you know you're at least in for something moderately entertaining - if not particularly special.And that's basically what "The Witches of Eastwick" is...moderately entertaining fluff. Women will probably get more of a kick out of it than men because of its sexual awakening jokes and everything. Men will get a kick out of Nicholson hamming it up (almost as much as Pacino would a decade later in "The Devil's Advocate").If you like the actors, give it a go. Otherwise, stay far away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Entertaining But Very Blasphemous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, here is the "horny little devil" getting his due. He ("Darryl Van Horne"played expertly by Jack Nicholson) gets in his philosophies and beliefs for much of the film. He gives us mostly feminist (overly so) Left Wing rants and does so in crude manner but the women don's seem to mind because they are crude themselves.One look at the cast (Nicholson, Cher, Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pfeffer and Veronica Cartwright) tells you this script was not written by members of the DAR! These are all very liberal people with liberal viewpoints. Sex jokes abound throughout ans the women casually talk about the size of men's penises, etc Although Nicholson - The Devil - gets it in the end with some voodoo nonsense, he still comes out looking like a pretty cool guy. That's no surprise, coming from Hollywood. The only person in this story who knows from the start that he's the Devil (the others are clueless most of the time) is the Christian woman (Cartwright) but of course she's pictured as some wide-eyed lunatic.The actors are fun to watch, it's an interesting story but for any Believer, this movie is blasphemous, big-time. For the secular crowd, which means most people, this is a fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson is one of the few sure bets in film, but boy did this movie stink. With this cast I expected so much more. Maybe if you need to rent a movie and the only other option is Caddy Shack II this wouldn't be a bad choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A LOT of fuss surrounded this movie. It's not worth that much.The story is enjoyable enough but some scenes that are supposed to be artistic and esoteric are just long and boring. It's funny... at times, even sarcastic when portraying Christian America and its outcasts (3 single and lonely women, each in her own way) but it lacks in cinematography and overall plot.If you must see it, see it for the great performances of the actresses and the relationships they have. Nicholson is... well... being Nicholson... nothing new or unseen in any other Nicholson part.All in all a fairly disappointing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why didn't I like this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now here is a prime example of a major film that made a big splash with many that I just didn't like. Although, I'm sure EVERYONE has a few flicks like that, and this isn't the ONLY well known film, by far that I didn't agree with the majority on, it baffles me WHY I didn't like this. I am a fan of most of the talent involved, particularly Sarandon. I love the subject matter. It should have appealed to me tremendously. But honestly it didn't. I have never even seen the whole thing, I have tried to get through it more then once and wind up turning it off. And I don't know why except maybe because the movie moves at a snails pace and it just never reaches out and hooks me. In fact, I got more and more restless as it went on. I thought it was very over rated.One of these days, maybe I will try it again-but I doubt things will be much different. I WANTED to like this but I found it hopelessly boring from the get go and added it to my list of "never seen in its entirety movies". And now I iwll read the other reviews and see if SOMEBODY agrees with me....</fullReview>
