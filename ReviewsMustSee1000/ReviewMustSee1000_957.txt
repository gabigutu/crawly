		<shortDescription>Everybody's Fine: The family that came unglued find a reason to stick together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once the trailer hit the internet, I knew I was going to see this movie. Nostalgia, De Niro and Barrymore were the primary reasons. Of those reasons, Nostalgia and De Niro were most responsible for the big lump in my throat and regret that I had no Kleenex.We go to movies to either escape reality or simply live in fantasy, don't we? I have to say, so much reality existed in this movie, escapism and fantasy seemed totally lost. The subtleties of everyday life can mean so much in retrospect. Every little thing that we do, no matter its importance, can come back and haunt us. That, surprisingly, is what makes this movie so real and endearing.Nothing about Everybody's Fine is lacking if you can find yourself or someone you know in this movie. The beauty of it is, you will find someone you know. If you haven't tricked yourself into thinking this might be like Christmas Vacation or Planes, Trains and Automobiles, then I hope you can appreciate its evenly paced, nostalgia filled beauty.De Niro has outdone himself with this simple heart-filled "grown family" film. I can truthfully say I liked him more in this than anything else he has done, although I also believe he probably didn't have to dig too deep into his soul to be Frank Goode. I will be surprised if he has not turned the heads and hearts of those who can nominate him for an Oscar. While all the characters were easy to relate to, this movie was more about Frank Goode's journey from state to state and through life.Believe me, Everybody's Fine is more than just fine.9/10 and one giant hug for everyone involved in making this beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, not Everybody's Fine in this, nevertheless, very fine movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If trailers were ever suggesting that Everybody's Fine might be a comedy, or even only a light-hearted drama, they were truly misleading, and a simple drama denominator from its poster does the movie better justice. Though, and not the least thanks to occasional humorous undertones, evidently somewhat a weaker part of the movie, and despite really uneasy feelings that story frequently brings out (viewers are often ahead of father in whatever sad facts his not-everybody's-fine children have concealed from him), one can get almost exhilarated with quite an optimistic ending when the father, Frank Goode (Robert De Niro), on his disastrous cross-country tour to meet his children, one by one, not without a trouble of going through serious health problems, finally reconvenes with surviving ones (Kate Beckinsale, Sam Rockwell, and Drew Barrymore) and, postmortem, reconciles with his long ago estranged, ultimately lost son, finally coming to terms with his artistic limitations, even seeking to buy one of his paintings. An early sketch he discovers speaks volumes within the running metaphor of Frank's life, with its working part spent in putting coating on telephone wires that should connect people. However, when those wires, in the times subsequent to his wife's demise, continue transferring embellished pictures of lives of his own ones, in order not to disappoint fatherly expectations, unfairly, in their young lives, so highly imposed on them, ties get easily broken where it hurts the most, between father and his children.One inevitably wonders how such a depressing story, full of toned down, bitter emotions, has even been considered to be made into a Hollywood movie? It becomes easier to understand after discovering financial support (Miramax) and creative mind (British director Kirk Jones) behind it. Times and again, inspiration for such a movie has been drawn from an overseas' predecessor of the same, literally translated original Italian title, Stanno tutti bene, from directorial output of Giuseppe Tornatore, best known for his masterpiece (Nuovo) Cinema Paradiso.After a longer while, this movie finally offers a role deserving of Robert De Niro's great talent, often wasted on mediocre films. His latest, truly emotional tour de force, rather different from his memorable, primarily physically demanding roles earlier in his career, made his character here, though fully resonant, yet quite independent of whoever he associates with, whether he interacts with his own, up to his high hopes underachieving one, or talks to a total stranger whom he meets while on his tour.As coincidence would have it, it is interesting to notice: Robert De Niro was 66 years old in 2009, while shooting Everybody's Fine, the very same age as the late Marcello Mastroianni at the time when he had done Stanno tutti bene, in 1990. An old-fashioned (meant as a compliment) song, (I Want To) Come Home, from a year older Paul McCartney (67) is featured in the movie and accompanies the end credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This may be DeNiro's Best Performance Since Awakenings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night in a crowded theatre with persons of varying ages. At the conclusion of the film, I noticed smiles and tears in the eyes of the older viewers and some boredom and rush to leave in the younger ones. This is a movie for parents and will probably not appeal much to the under 25 set.That said, this is a beautiful, heart-felt, and sometimes painful story of a father recognizing and coming to grips with the reality of his parenting and his lack of control over his children's lives. It is about truth and how we try to spare others pain or discomfort. It is about how many parents still see their grown up children as small children who we are responsible for.While the supporting cast turn in good performances, this is Robert DeNiro's movie. It is his best performance since Awakenings (he deserved that Oscar, and not just the nomination).I suspect that this film will get a lot of nominations, but don't think it will win many awards. I base that on the idea that they younger voters have not yet been in the shoes of the older ones and will not be fully able to appreciate the character or his growth and understanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant performance by a great actor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many times have you ever asked, or ever were asked the question: How are things? Invariably, one replies, "everything is fine," except of course it's not true. The response is a polite brush-off. This movie is about how a man decides not to accept the brush-off, this time coming from his own children and as a result makes some interesting discoveries. This movie contains Robert DeNiro's strongest role in years. The entire story revolves around his character and he really brings the character to life. A brilliant performance by a great actor. This movie is like Robert Young in Father-Knows-Best deciding to really connect with his children after years of just being around. What's even better is that the movie avoids becoming trite and effectively brings the audience into this family's world as the story explores themes that are relevant to all families. Children grow up, leave the home, go their separate ways, leaving behind memories. A wonderful movie.Ah, platitudes. We're all guilty of using them. They're a polite way of telling someone to buzz off, that you don't want to talk to them, that they are unworthy of your time. This movie is all about platitudes, most cruelly applied when it's least needed or wanted. In this movie a man wants to initiate communication with his children, all of whom are adults and have long since left the home, and he and his children go through a lot of changes as they attempt to bridge the gulf that separates them. This doesn't mean the children don't care about their father, they do. But the emotional closeness was never there and this is what this movie is about: breaking down barriers to establish an emotional connection. This movie is a Robert DeNiro vehicle. It is his re-emergence onto the Hollywood scene after years of cinematic oblivion. His performance is a tour de force; he deserves at least an Academy Award nomination for best actor. He carries the movie. Drew Barrymore also gives an impressive performance as one of Mr. DeNiro's daughters. Ms. Barrymore shines on the screen and proves once again that she is one of the premiere actresses in Hollywood. Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsdale also are excellent. What a great movie! Never cold-shoulder your father.This is the best Robert DeNiro movie in years. His strong acting carries this sentimental story about a man trying to reconnect with his children. The movie places a strong emphasis on family relationships and does an excellent job in engaging and keeping the audience's attention as Mr. DeNiro's character embarks on an odyssey of emotional discovery. At times the story verges on becoming openly maudlin but succeeds in avoiding that pitfall. The movie also avoids becoming hokey and corny and succeeds in staying on course as the DeNiro character continues on his journey. All in all, this is a wonderful movie featuring a strong performance by Robert DeNiro. After watching this movie, you will think twice before telling someone "everybody's fine" unless you mean it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert DeNiro's Acting is More than Fine...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Guiseppe Tornatore's 1990 Italian film, Stanno tutti bene, writer/director Kirk Jones has brought some of the best work out of Robert DeNiro in decades. Everybody's Fine is a fascinating tale about Frank (DeNiro), a widower who wants to get his four adult children together for dinner, but when one by one they all cancel for good reasons or lack of a better word excuses, he decides against the advice of his doctor, to make a surprise trip to all their residences in New York, Chicago, Denver, and Las Vegas. What the trip brings him however, is a heavy realization that despite what his late-wife told him, maybe everybody's not fine.Treading heavy territory to resemble films like About Schmidt, Everybody's Fine is a heartfelt, emotional film that will leave you in tears. Though the narrative could come off a bit over-dramatic at times, there's no denying the warmth that the film conveys to family and loyalty. DeNiro is most effective in his role of Frank Goode, the hard-working father whose long hours putting up coating on telephone wire may have cost him more than he thought. Director, Kirk Jones makes some great artistic choices, especially in the final scenes of the film. One thing however that is surprising is how the film is being marketed. Portraying itself as a holiday-comedy is going to be quite unexpected to viewers as the film is weighty with emotion and less on the laughs. The supporting players, in this case the adult children, are all beautifully cast. Drew Barrymore has never been sweeter in the role of Rosie, a dancer in Vegas with a "Daddy's Girl" mentality. Kate Beckinsale is stunning in looks and adequate in delivery as Amy, a top advertisement executive. Sam Rockwell, who is long overdue for Oscar attention, plays Robert, the musician who painfully seeks his father's approval. Enough can't be said about DeNiro who gives one of his finest performances of his career. Showing a softer side yet remaining in tuned with his fatherly instincts, DeNiro has redeemed some of his lesser works in the past years. He takes in some of the best and worst parts of all fathers' across the world. Worrying yet too hard at times it spills over into his children's decisions. Where the narrative misses in some aspects, DeNiro makes up for with his devotion and commitment to the character. It's an outstanding turn for him in his late career.Over-dramatic, cliché, and a bit predictable, Everybody's Fine shows a beating heart. There's no stupidity or attitude in its form, just pure feeling. If you come from a family of secrets for the greater good (which may be the majority of us), this will speak volumes. ***/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For What It Wanted to Achieve, It Hit Every Note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to see this, I expected one of those progressive stories like he was getting ditched and as he went and surprised them things got better, they had laughs and things were healed sort of typical thing. But it definitely didn't go down like that. There were about maybe 8 people in the theater when I went to see this movie, 3 of them were me and my 2 friends.I have to say this movie was really sad and had a lot to say about child/parent relations. I am only 18 years old but I love these types of films and it made me think about how I would be with my parents when I get older and it really makes me want to make sure I keep a good relationship with my parents. My dad has always pushed me and wanted better for me in school and I have always been very average and against the grain, as it seems like David was.I don't know if the makers wanted the relation between Frank and his kids to seem empty, but that's how it seemed to be throughout the film until the end. Even if it was lack of chemistry between actors, which of course I highly doubt it was, it works wonders and shows that Frank is like an alien to them and also that they are alien to him. When he learns that all of his children aren't actually as successful, he seems like he's struggling within to try and understand where they're coming from instead of just showing his disappointment. When things finally come tumbling down towards the film's climax, they come right back together as a family would. This movie made me tear up and really the only reason I didn't cry was because I was with friends. I could write a lot more about this but I'll just suggest that if you're looking for a good movie about family, or even if you just like De Niro(that's why I saw it), you should definitely see this movie. It won't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very depressing, but good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to a screening of this film today, and I had decided not to watch the trailer, or read anything about the movie before. Looking at the poster, I was expecting a Christmas-y comedy or something like that. I was totally wrong (and don't get me wrong this is definitely not a bad thing for the movie!) Just don't expect a laugh out loud comedy. It did have it's funny moments though, and those were great. The movie made me feel really really bad for the De Niro character, and through the whole thing just made me want to go give him a big hug LOL. De Niro's performance was great and made you feel what that character was feeling at that time. The other performances were also fairly good. All in all, a good movie as long as you are not expecting a straight out comedy! I would definitely recommend seeing this one when it comes out in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's been a long trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/director Kirk Jones just needs to work a little more frequently. His first two projects were the fascinating Waking Ned Devine and the deeper than expected Nanny McPhee. The guy has some real talent and unique insight. He is also wise enough to cast Robert Deniro and then bring out his best performance in years.Sure, there are some similarities to Nicholson's wonderful turn in About Schmidt, but contrary to the trailers, this one is no light-hearted holiday fluff. There are deep emotions and more real-life family baggage than most will care to admit (translated, there were quite a few sniffles in the theatre).Deniro's kids are scattered about leading their own lives after a childhood of pressure, demands and expectations. The differences in how each have handled it is very interesting. Drew Barrymore wants very much to be the daddy's girl, while Kate Beckinsale is the corporate type-A who just can't manage her family. The always excellent Sam Rockwell is the music prodigy enjoying his stress-free live as a symphonic percussionist (instead of a conductor). The youngest is a troubling story line that ends up tying everything together for the Deniro character, as well as the family.Aside from the mostly atrocious music, this one is an emotional tug-fest that will stimulate a bit of self-analysis from all parents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A LITTLE GEM, Euro-style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't planning on seeing this movie until I read some of the other IMDb reviews--then I reconsidered because one of the reviewers said it would be more meaningful to older folks with adult children. Glad I did. It's a little gem. It's more like a European film really, where nothing much happens (action-wise) but the characters are so well-drawn. Or, to put it another way, it's like reading a novel by Anne Tyler. I did think of ABOUT SCHMIDT during this movie--similar theme of a recent widower on a road-trip of self-discovery--but only to reflect on DeNiro's more subtle characterization. The movie is very well cast as a whole and all the acting, particularly from the child actors, is very natural and unaffected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing family drama, filled with heartbreaking moments.Robert De Niro carries the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not your typical holiday movie nor at the end of the week- movie.Not everybody's fine.The story revolves around a father(De Niro), who's wife has passed away, and his desire to reunite his four children for the holidays.Now, when he's alone, preparing the house for the upcoming holidays, all of his children cancel the holiday meeting with no explanation.The lonely man sets on a journey around the States to find his children and learn the truth as well as to reunite the family again.The truths, he finds, are more painful, than he could ever imagine.The story is obvious at the beginning-but then the viewer begins to discover painful truths, the now-grown-kids are keeping away from their loving father.There are some very inventing and innovating twists, that are merely unpredictable.The story is told beautifully, with some poetry in it, which improves on Robert De Niro's brilliant acting.I would say, he deserves a higher praise, for what he has done, because i personally think, that Jeff Bridges wasn't better than him, with all my respect, of course.De Niro's outstanding performance carries the movie until the end.As for the other cast, i wasn't that impressed.Kate Beckinsale and Drew Barrymore were at the same level of quality, but that just wasn't enough.Sam Rockwell was mediocre, definitely not good enough.I know they were supposed to be cold, but even coldness can be portrayed better than that.The director did his best, which wasn't that much, considering the cast and script he had to work with.Every director should be able to pull it off, when he works with an amazing actors (again, mostly De Niro in that case), and a solid script.But as a whole, he did a good job.I felt, that the tragedy was a little to much in the end, but things couldn't have been better revealed than this.It was depressing, but necessary to say the least.And again, i'm looking at De Niro with new eyes now, he touched me so deep.The pain is deep sometimes.But you have to fight with it to keep your family united, and together, no matter the distance.The distance in your heart is, what really matters.And in the end Everybody's Fine.My rate: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Return of DeNiro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody's Fine (2009) *** (out of 4)Robert DeNiro plays a widower who grows tired of his four children making excuses for not coming to see him so he disregards his doctor's orders and takes a trip to visit all four. Along the way he starts to think about their childhood and where their lives are at now. I remember when THIS BOYS LIFE was released it featured a trailer that would make you think you were walking into one of the greatest family films ever made even though the actual film was a dark one about child abuse. I mention that because this film is pretty much the same effect as the poster, TV ads and trailer makes you think that you're in for a good time but the film is actually an incredibly depressing affair but it finally gives star DeNiro a true character and he does great work with it. Now, I'm not one of those who thinks DeNiro has wasted one performance after another for the past twenty years. I think he's given several very good performances even though many of the characters weren't the strongest items for an actor of his range. The performance here is downright terrific and truly deserves to be called that "old DeNiro" style. DeNiro doesn't need words to show what his character is feeling and he perfectly brings to life this rather sad character who is smart enough to know there's a lot more going on with his children then they're willing to tell him. I found DeNiro to be perfect and one would hope he'd get some Oscar consideration but that probably won't happen considering how the film did at the box office (but I would ask why that should matter). DeNiro gets to interact with various characters and the amount of life he brings this character will make one remember the type of work he was turning in on a consistent basis years ago. I won't ruin DeNiro's big scene towards the end but it's certainly very overwhelming. The supporting cast has Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell playing the children and they all give fine performances and mix with DeNiro very well. I do wish the actual film would have been a bit stronger because it's extremely depressing but at times I felt the film was holding back. I really can't explain what but it just never really felt like a full movie and at times there were some plot details that were a tad bit over dramatic and other times that the film pushes too hard to get its point across. While the film does have its share of problems, the real reason for anyone to watch this is for the return of DeNiro and that alone makes this worth seeing. Again, not the happiest film out there but at least we get to see DeNiro playing his best character in quite a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must See Family Reality Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loved this movie, DeNiro at his best. Older folks will definitely come away with a different feeling about this movie than younger viewers (40yrs. or less). I think this movie re-affirms that adult children have no clue about "who their parents are." Frank Goode might have been absent during their formative years due to "earning a living" but he still cared. His wife tried to protect him and lessen stress by turning all info into good news, not uncommon in some marriages, but this resulted in a lot of misinformation. In the movie, DeNiro is now alone after the death of his wife. He plans a cookout, buys a new grill, everything you can imagine to make it a perfect day for his four grown children. Then the calls start coming in, all "can't make it." You see the sadness and let down after his great effort to get his family together. But instead of wallowing in his disappointment, he decides to go and see "what's going on" with his children, trying to make it a surprise visit. This is the interesting part, his children are obviously afraid of his disapproval and act accordingly. The result,the children have no time for him and even keep a secret about their brother. So many parents will relate to this movie! Sad to say, this is reality played out. We learn the truth along with DeNiro and there is a "Christmas" type ending. This is a winner for parents of grown children!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorrow and Sadness. Proving happiness is different for people, you feel the emotional tears from hidden secrets.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that "Everybody's Fine" is clearly one of the better movies I've seen in a long time as after watching I was touched and even teared up almost wanting to cry. The film is certainly an emotional drama. And the performance from legendary Robert De Niro ranks as one of his finest as Bob is one of the best actors in the business. "Everybody's Fine" is blended well with drama and intrigue yet the themes of secrets and sorrow overshadow everything only in the end happiness is finally reached.Robert De Niro is Frank Goode a recently widowed man who misses his wife and has the house all to himself. Frank has four grown kids who all do their own thing and live in different parts of the country. Frank wants to get all of them together for a visit yet when he contacts them all three of them just can't find the right time to visit and the other one son David(Austin Lysy)is unable to be reached. So Frank decides to set out on a journey to visit them all.Frank uses many forms of travel along the way even though it was against his doctors wishes for him to journey out and travel. So he boards the train on the way up to New York City to visit artist son David and along the way Frank looks at the power lines of telephone polls to remind him of how life has passed for him over the years as laying power lines and poles was what Frank did for a living. When arriving in New York City David's apartment is empty the only memories Frank has is his flashbacks of David as a small boy,(as this film uses the flashback technique well with Frank seeing all of his grown children as little ones when he first meets them). So Frank then decides to journey off by bus to see his next child.This meeting happens to be with daughter Amy(Kate Beckinsale who as always looks so bright and sexy)who's a successful advertising executive in Chicago. Everything seems normal for Amy she seems happily married while raising her young son, and money seems okay as you can tell by her living space and the professional elegant clothing she wears. Only at the dinner table friction is felt and Amy tells dad she just doesn't have the time for Frank to stay at least for an extended time.Then the next journey on more buses is to the Rockies in Denver to see son Robert(Sam Rockwell)who plays the drums in an orchestra and he seems happy as Frank is somewhat disappointed that Robert is not the leader of the band so to speak! Anyway they talk and Robert seems happy but not happy enough to spend time with dad. So then Frank takes another journey of trains, and buses with his sights set on Las Vegas. Only some roadblocks and jams come up along the way for Frank like a missed train and a somewhat dangerous encounter with a teenage thug that deprives Frank of his medicine in a big way. Interesting is seeing him hitch a ride into Vegas from a woman trucker Colleen(Melissa Leo)which was comical. Now he meets daughter Rosie(the witty and quirk Drew Barrymore)everything seems fine with Rosie nice apartment she says work as a dancer is fine yet you can spot she's a probable lesbian when the female friend brings a baby over that ends up staying for the night. Still all three siblings had no word or info on David just hidden suspicions. So Frank flies away yet hits major medical turbulence on the plane.Oddly enough awakening in the hospital bed surrounded by his children Frank discovers truths from each yet it was foreshadowed some by his before hand dream. Only he will sadly learn the tragic fate of David. Yet aside from the lonely mood and sad sorrow feel of this film it teaches important messages. Frank always pushed his children hard as he found out they turned out fine yet he learns an important factor that the definition of happiness is different for everyone as people like his kids spread their wings and live life their way on their own time. Sure secrets were kept only because they didn't want to disappoint Frank which oddly the secrets ended up providing bonding and happiness for Frank and his children in the end as proved by the holiday get to together! As Frank saw that everybody's just fine the way that they are and that was how things were meant to be as the secrets don't have to worry you and he still loves his children the same just the way they are. Overall great film with an emotional and touching performance from De Niro even though it's sad and lonely sorrow feel may dominate the minutes, this picture still ends with happiness proving that love conquers all for people just the way that they are even during family secrets. Great movie that's touching and emotional you will feel like you want to shed a few tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>over-sentimental expositional rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a very good film that stars a Hollywood legend playing against type as a retired widower taking a road trip, along the way facing issues about his own life and those of his relationship with his offspring. 'About Schmidt' is that film's name and it is wonderful. This film is NOT that film.While 'Everybody's Fine' follows a very similar premise, unfortunately it doesn't share anywhere near the same quality of theme, character, performances or dialogue as Alexander Payne's vastly superior film. This effort is tentative at best in its character and plot set up - the reasoning behind why the kids are so distant with their father is only barely convincing as De Nero's Frank Goode actually seems like a fairly normal kind of guy, as oppose to the fastidious, over-bearing patriarch suggested by his off spring. My main problem with the film is its over sentimentality in the final third of the film. The director cranks up the melodrama with weepy strings on the score and some awful examples of expositional dialogue making abso-bloody-lutely sure we have no doubt what EVERYONE and EVERYTHING means, with ill-advised voice overs, dream sequences and only the very happiest of endings on offer, which is in itself deeply unbelievable as anyone with a dysfunctional family knows, you cannot un-do a lifetime of bad feeling with a few Christmas lights and a well-cooked turkey. The fact that lots of these reviewers are calling De Nero's performance here the best for 15 or 20 years really just shows how far he has fallen from his truly great performances in the 70's and 80's. Soppy over explained but undercooked melodrama that really should've been better considering the wealth of acting talent available.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Everybody's Fine" is just, well, fine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Everybody's Fine" is one of those quieter holiday movies. They weren't going for a big awards push, no splashy CGI/animation, and no grandiose plot line. They did everything they were going for just fine.We have Robert De Niro, a widower, travelling to each of his grown children's houses for Christmas. David (Austin Lysy) is in New York; Amy (Kate Beckinsale) is in Chicago; Robert (Sam Rockwell) is in Denver; and Rosie (Drew Barrymore) is in Las Vegas. They each of course have their own problems (in their own niche of their big city) which belie their constant refrain, "Everybody's fine, dad".These are all competent actors doing a good job, with story lines which work well for them. The issue with the movie is, that we as the audience know the trouble and lies that are brooding beneath the surface, and we know them long before De Niro finds out. So all we get is a sense of frustration along with the sadness they are currently facing. I also wouldn't want to keep secrets from De Niro for very long.The jokes are minimal, and too often, drawn out for no good purpose. "Everybody's Fine" is a weeping drama which espouses on some of life's important(?) lessons.

		<shortDescription>Warm and sweet movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much to see, since I am trying to avoid comedies in a wide circle and the previous ones with De Niro never left a big impression on me. After 5 minutes of watching a movie, I realized that this is actually a drama where De Niro had an astonishing performance!His lovely character takes you through the whole movie with a lot of sentiment and sadness. This is a movie about family, loss and different paths each of one took in lives after leaving a family nest. It's warm, sweet, sad....I was even brought to tears couple of times. All in all,I gave this movie 10 point just to increase the poor rating, where my real choice would be 8.5!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody's looking at De Niro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino for some reason decided to have plastic surgery. Aside from making him look permanently shocked, it ridiculous that a character actor would want to mess around with his main source of income, in the same way that a physicist wouldn't drink White Ace. On the other hand, Pacino's contemporary and regular collaborator De Niro hasn't touched his mug, leaving him free to clean up in the lucrative grandfather and retired policemen market. In Everybody's Fine he plays the former, an old man who becomes increasingly lonely following his wife's death, and so goes in search of his four children, hoping to reconnect with them.De Niro is Frank Goode, a telephone cable maker who spent his entire life working to provide for his family, whilst pushing his children as hard as he could to succeed. As a result, they are all a bit resentful and cagey towards him. Everybody's fine is about his attempts to get to know them, a process made almost impossible as they try to hide their problems from him, not wanting him to judge them failures.It's not a fast paced film and much of its impact relies on what the characters don't say rather than what they do. De Niro does a superb job with Goode, portraying him as a tired old man whose need to see his children comes into direct conflict with his natural desire to try and direct their lives. Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore and Kate Beckinsale all perform well as Frank's children, although their roles themselves are exceptionally basic, requiring almost nothing from the actors, which makes it fairly surprising that they signed up, all testament to De Niro's still exceptionally powerful allure as an actor. Kirk Jones' screenplay requires very little from anyone except for De Niro, and even then not an enormous amount. The story is not a complex one and by telling you so little about the characters he lets you read pretty much anything into them you want, which can be a good or bad thing, depending on whether you think Drew Barrymore's character in ET would have grown up to be a lesbian dancer. Jones does a reasonable job as a director, but again, it is mostly De Niro's performance that keeps you watching to the sad but predictable end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody May Be Fine, But They're Not Interesting (Or Convincing)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this premise sounds very familiar to you, that's because it is. About several years ago, Jack Nicholson did the same thing in 'About Schmidt' that DeNiro is doing here. The difference: the older movie is better. It wasn't a great movie, but at least it was more realistic. "Everybody's Fine", on the other hand, is a bit sentimental. DeNiro looks like he'd rather be in another movie. As for the other actors, well they're about as subdued as he is. I'm sorry to report that this movie is too pat for my taste. In my opinion, these characters seem like strangers, rather than family. There's hardly any reality, no tension, no fights or arguments. Overall, there's no bite. Essentially, the film is just a story in search of a movie. Instead of having DeNiro visit family, why not put him in a crisis, say, a foreclosure on the house that results in him becoming homeless, for example? If something like that had happened instead, then the movie might have gone somewhere.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Estranged Father Take a Lugubrious, Sentimental Cross-Country Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Family dysfunction is given a lugubrious, sentimental treatment by writer/director Kirk Jones ("Waking Ned Devine") in what is actually a remake of a 1990 Italian film, "Stanno tutti bene", written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, no stranger to sentiment since he made the neo-classic "Cinema Paradiso". The earlier film starred the legendary Marcello Mastroianni as a Sicilian civil servant who travels throughout Italy to pay surprise visits to his children after his wife has died. This mirror version stars the equally legendary Robert De Niro as Frank Goode, a former blue-collar worker living in upstate New York, doing the same thing with his grown children. The first part of the plot reminds me of an even earlier classic, Yasujiro Ozu's "Tokyo Story", which told the story of an elderly couple who visit their grown children in Tokyo only to discover they have no time for them. That film was a subtle classic that didn't telegraph its emotional impact around contrived plot turns.The same cannot be said for this turgid 2009 drama which bears the sometimes unbearable stamp of manipulation in Jones' overly deliberate treatment with sometimes too-perfectly composed shot compositions courtesy of Henry Braham's immaculate cinematography. The plot follows Frank on his voyage of discovery as he settles into his unfulfilling widowed existence. After being rebuffed by his four children to come home for the holidays, he decides to take matters into his own hands and visit each one of them despite a serious heart ailment. He begins to realize it was his wife who had been the emotional conduit that kept the family in touch despite the divergent paths they all took. Frank sets out by train and bus to surprise each of them in their locales. The first is David, an artist living a boho-type lifestyle in Manhattan, but he isn't home for reasons that will become clear later in the story. Then it's off to see Amy, a successful, Type-A Chicago advertising executive living a life out of the pages of Architectural Digest.Frank moves on to Denver to meet his son Robert, a symphony percussionist whom Frank thought was a conductor, and finally to Las Vegas where he visits Rosie, a dancer living in a luxurious apartment. Needless to say, things are not what they appear, and Frank becomes aware of how estranged he truly has become from his children as revelations start to unfold like clockwork. As an actor, De Niro seems to have settled into a relatively passive figure only evoking the heat of his past performances during key moments. Unfortunately, that happens in the film's worst scene, a hallucinogenic fantasy scene where Frank is talking to his memory of his children as toddlers only to have them talk back like their adults (a bit like the classroom scene in Woody Allen's "Annie Hall" but without the laughs). Otherwise, De Niro makes his character a befuddling, somewhat endearing presence throughout. Kate Beckinsale plays Amy efficiently but not too deeply. The ad pitch during her sequence is the one unexpectedly funny bit in the whole film.Sam Rockwell fares better as the son since the sense of disappointment is palpable between father and son in his scenes with De Niro. Drew Barrymore uses her natural warmth and likability to play Rosie as Frank's obvious favorite, a daughter who won't do anything to let her father down. The always watchable Melissa Leo ("Frozen River") shows up in a convenient but touching cameo as a sympathetic truck driver who bonds with Frank over their recent spouse losses. The whole plot executes on a series of conveniences such as the blatant connection between Frank's former job in covering PVC cables and the overlapping voiceovers of the siblings on moving images of telephone wires. The 2010 DVD release is weak as these types of releases go with the only extras being seven deleted/extended scenes (interesting but excisable) and an interview with Paul McCartney, who wrote and performed the appropriately sentimental song, "I Want to (Come Home)", played over the closing credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro makes the movie worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨If you would ask me I would have to say in all honesty, everybody's fine. Everybody's fine.¨ Kirk Jones (who also directed Nanny McPhee and Waking Ned Divine) directs this Italian remake from the 90's called Stanno Tutti Bene. He also is given credit for adapting the original screenplay to suit this American version better. The film works because De Niro gives a pretty powerful performance and makes you forget all the clichés the film has. Yes, it is very formulaic and we know every single kid will have something to hide from his father, they all have a problem, and they all are withholding information from him. The journey De Niro's character is making will be revealing and teach him some lessons which he never learned in his 60 years, but he will now in these few days. Everybody's Fine follows all those formulas which we have grown used to in Hollywood films, but thanks to some interesting performances the movie is worth your time. It is a dramedy, a movie that likes to play with our emotions, but it still is worth checking out. The weakest part of the movie is the distance that De Niro's character has with his children. It is hard to believe sometimes that this is actually a family and I think the director exaggerated a bit with the coldness and distance between them, and it all just ties up too neatly at the end.Frank Goode (Robert De Niro) is a widower, who is planning on having his four children for dinner on the weekend. After making plans for preparing a nice meal he receives calls from each one saying that they won't be able to make it. Frank hasn't seen his kids since their mother's funeral and he realizes she was the one that maintained the family together, so he decides to go give them a surprise visit each. Frank has a lung condition and his doctor recommends him to stay at home and not travel, but he decides to go anyway across the different states on train and bus. His first stop is New York where he plans on visiting David (Austin Lysy), an artist. He is not at his apartment and Frank waits for an entire day without being able to reach him, although he is glad to see one of his paintings at a gallery near his apartment. Frank decides to move on and visit his daughter Amy (Kate Beckinsale) in Chicago. She is a successful ad executive and has a nice home she shares with her husband and son. Frank then travels to Denver the next day because she is busy and visits Robert (Sam Rockwell), who plays the percussion for the orchestra. Frank's last trip is to Las Vegas where he meets up with Rosie (Drew Barrymore), a successful professional dancer. Frank realizes that his children have all been lieing to him and that they are not all fine, but he wonders why they can't trust him and figures it is because he pushed his kids too hard.Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances in years, and it was good to see him in this kind of role. Drew Barrymore also gives a great performance and she seemed the closest with her father, and perhaps the only one who really had chemistry with him. It was hard to believe his relationship with his other children, especially with Kate Beckinsale's character who was too distant. Sam Rockwell gives a good performance, he is a great actor, but he was much better in Moon. The movie has a slow start, but after a while you begin to get involved in the story and wonder what the kids are hiding. Frank has worked hard all his life making telephone cables in order to give his kids a good education and has really pushed them, perhaps a bit too much. Ironically that communication media is not used anymore by his children who all use wireless cellphones, and it represents the communication between them that has been broken over the years. I think that the main problem the film has is that it tries to resolve everything at the end, and it just doesn't work that well. However, the story is well told and if you are into these emotional movies then you will probably enjoy this one because it has some good performances and is a very touching movie. The problem I had with it was that it was too formulaic, but still worth it in my opinion.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Everybody's Fine"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Everybody's Fine." Yes, the title of the film is actually "Everybody's Fine." Excited yet? Apparently director Kirk Jones wanted to preclude the silly notion of narrative conflict upfront. While the truth may be that everybody isn't entirely fine, the title is still more than appropriate given that the world of the film is a sunny euphemism for life where good intentions reign and happiness is just a smile and an old photograph away. Even in portraying sexual solicitation or drug addiction, Jones can't help but do so with the utmost optimism. "Wanna see my legs?" a prepubescent conception of a prostitute asks a neutered Robert DeNiro. "Wanna see mine?" he quips back. Pause for effect. That's about the height of humor in this aggressively inoffensive holiday family film.To preface, DeNiro plays Frank, a man who gets stiffed by each of his four grown children whom he's invited home for a family weekend. So, with a chip on his shoulder and against his doctor's recommendation (uh oh!), Frank sets off for a spontaneous surprise visitation circuit! The spunky old coot! His visits reveal that each of his children (Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale) has been lying to him about some major aspect of their life, and go to ridiculous lengths to sell their lies. Beckinsale as Amy invites her ex-husband over for dinner for fear of revealing their separation to her father, Rockwell as Robert is a percussionist who claims to be the conductor for an orchestra and has picked up smoking, and Barrymore as Rosie borrows a friend's Vegas flat to impress her father and suppress her lesbianism. You can't make this stuff up, folks. Somebody smashed open a pi?ata of clichés and "Everybody's Fine" is a God damn mad dash.Then there's the matter of Frank's fourth child. I had wanted to spare you the tragic--No. No, it's best that you hear it from me. Poor Tom (James Frain) has gone missing from his apartment, and while his siblings bicker back and forth over what lie to tell their father, building obvious, heavy-handed tension as the film wears on, they hit a wall. Tom is dead. Sure, you never see him alive and thus form no emotional attachment, but it's sad. It's sad. He overdoses after 'buying drugs from a bar' in South America. The language regarding the incident is vague and naive, as though the writer himself can think of nothing worse than the indistinct concept of drug use. A middle-schooler could have thought of a more shocking transgression, and believe me, would love to.However, the problems with "Everybody's Fine" far exceed its clinical detachment from engaging conflict, as it drops its toothy disposition in the final act and suddenly becomes a misguided tearjerker. Frank has a bizarre near-death experience involving his children (played in this sequence by actual children) sitting around a picnic table finally speaking truthfully about their lives. The pretension of the dialogue and the schmaltzy sentimentality of the premise make the scene downright embarrassing to watch. And as if you couldn't guess, Frank soon recovers and finally gets the holiday he's always wanted with his three, now emotionally honest children. The camera pulls away from the warmly lit dining room and Frank's voice over kicks in. Three guesses as to what the last line is."Everybody's Fine" is not funny, not moving, and not in the least bit original. It's troubling to see DeNiro take a film like this, as even the third-rate police dramas he's been churning out for the last decade maintain a degree of his dignity as a cinematic bad ass. Frank is just a wet noodle of a character and on the whole, "Everybody's Fine" is blisteringly uninteresting. To be fair, I suppose many big stars and great performers have received a free pass around the holidays to star in invariably awful family films. So Merry Christmas, Robert, I hope it was worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about a father and his 4 children. He loves them so much, and when his wife is still alive, he didn't pay much attention to their status. When his wife is dead, he regrets about that and wants to get all the children together to have a family party. However, something bad happens, which makes it not possible. So he visits them one by one. During the visit, he knows that everybody is not as successful as they claim they are. However, he realized that David lives the life that he wants him to live, instead of doing something he himself really wants to do. This is bad thing, because people should live their own lives. Obviously he has spoiled David's life. Then he said "no matter you are a painter or an artist, I love you". It's touching. Overall this movie is good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Good. Not Great, but really good (for a fake American movie)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand why this movie was not a hit. It's a little slow, and much of it is pretty depressing. But if you stick with it, you'll be rewarded with a movie that's sweet and genuine and quite creative and inventive in some of the methods it uses to tell its story. It did, however, trigger one of my pet peeves. I've always been annoyed by Non-Americans pretending to be Americans. Even though Kate Beckinsale's American accent is perfect, while watching the film, I kept hearing her say things that an American would never say. "How could this happen?" I wondered. Answer: The writer/director and his co-writer are both Europeans. At one point, she says she had an appointment, but the man "didn't turn up." Ever hear an American say that? To me, it's like a slap in the face that distracts from the story and makes me wonder who the hell made this film that wouldn't catch such a thing. Later in the movie, the same character says twice that she flew from Chicago "out to Mexico." Anyone with the vaguest understanding of North American geography would say they flew "down to Mexico." Nonetheless, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a serious look at family relationships and the strains that come along with aging parents and siblings spread far and wide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody's Fine possesses the heart and soul most modern movies lack. Yet it seems like director Kirk Jones does not know how to manage it. The story is so bogged down by sentimentality, near the end it feels like a heavy bag of luggage. The story has very few light moments and a lot of drama, though not incredibly well-done. It also looks incredibly like a Lifetime movie and not like a cinema released in theaters. Yet there are some moments of beauty including a strong performance from De Niro. After it is all done, there is not much to rave about, but at least writer-director Jones's heart was in the right place. Liked the intentions, did not like the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like my summary says, "Everybody's Fine" is a well acted drama. It's another example of a movie having nothing but dialogue and still being enjoyable.Frank (Robert De Niro, who is great as always), is looking forward to seeing his children and having the family in the same house for the first time since his wife's passing. However, the kids cancel on him unexpectedly, citing unexpected events in their own lives. That does not keep Frank from deciding to pay each of them a visit, however.Frank travels across the United States, meeting Amy, Robert, and Rosie. He is unable to find his other son, David, however. During each encounter, Frank discovers that the lives of his offspring are different than what he was told.The film has a nice cast. Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale, and Sam Rockwell each give good performances. So, if you are looking for a good film, try this one. It is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best? acting role by Robert De Niro......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a good movie and makes one think about the fact that we all respond "fine" when we're asked how we are doing. It also makes us realize/appreciate the relationships we have as parents and children.I wish the movie offered more. It would have been better had there been more about the 4 children growing up, the interaction/relationship each had with their mother, and how/why each child chose to move so far away. Each of the children seemed genuinely caring and loving but none chose to stay in close contact with their father (Robert De Niro). I found that contradictory given how the story line developed.I do think that casting was extremely well done and all actors played their roles superbly. As I read the reviews on the IMDb website, I was very surprised that some/many thought this was one of De Niro's best acting roles. I found he did a very good job, but he has had many superb acting roles and this is not one of his best. I believe he is a superb actor and have seen all of his films.Drew Barrymore is also a superb actor and I was not disappointed by her performance. I didn't see anyone saying that this was her best role and I would agree that she has had better.Another aspect that would have made the film better would be if they added more interactions with the siblings. They did talk via phone but there could/should have been more.I do definitely think this movie is worth seeing. It's also one I would buy on DVD to watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro's best work in decades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Everybody's Fine" sees actor Robert De Niro playing Frank Goode (the name's a sly joke), a 66 year old recently retired widower who embarks on a road journey across the United States. His mission? To visit each of his four children, and hopefully heal the emotional disconnection that developed between him and them over the course of a lifetime.What makes the film different from similar fare is this: De Niro is not some alcoholic, bum, or deadbeat father, but a perfectly good man. Whilst De Niro typically plays "tough daddy" or "stern patriarch" roles (ie the "Meet The Fockers" movies), here he is a normal breadwinner and problem solver who has always wanted nothing but the best for his kids and who has always done his utmost to provide for them.But by showing the rather superficial relationship that exists between a father and his offspring - one borne out of respect and fondness rather than emotional closeness - the film is critiquing a kind of masculine emotional repression. And so many of the film's scenes involve De Niro's teary eyed children (now adults with careers) confessing that they never felt comfortable enough to bring their many problems to him. This, of course, relates to the film's title. Everyone's not okay, but because that's what Daddy wants, that's what we will all pretend.But the film also looks at the way these gender/family roles are upheld, not just by the patriarch, but by the kids themselves. Both father and offspring are emotionally distant because they falsely believe it to be in everybody's best interest. What this results in is a mutually upheld illusion. And so what the film's advocating is not only a kind of emotional honesty or openness, but a willingness to pass disappointment and suffering around the table. This, of course, is a traumatic thing to do. Humans are creatures of denial and it would take a far greater artist to deal with this subject properly.De Niro is often very bad at playing insular characters, often resorting to face pulling and odd mugging, but here he is excellent, stand out scenes including him breaking down in a hospital bed, reminiscing about his children when they were younger and a great fantasy scene around a table. The supporting cast is equally great, with Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsdale ? both of whom are racking up a slew of excellent independent films ? and Drew Barrymore, who does her usual, infectious "ray of sunshine" routine.Aesthetically, the film's direction is flat and uninspired and its symbolism is a bit forced, with De Niro playing a blue collar worker who spent most of his life stringing telephone wires across the country. Get it? He has communication problems, but his life's work keeps the country in touch.The film has been bashed by critics for being manipulative, sentimental, contrived and resemblant of made for cable movies. This is all true. But the film plays well on the small screen and does several things well, at times going further than fare like "Broken Flowers" and "About Schmidt".The film was marketed as a comedy, but is not. It is quite dark and melancholic, dwelling mostly on regret and disappointment, with the occasional tearjerker moment shamelessly thrown in.7.9/10 ? De Niro's best work in decades. The film is heavily flawed, but generally moving, and will strike a chord mostly with ageing fathers and children with quietly domineering parents. IMDb statistics show that the film is ranked higher by males and females under the age of 18, suggesting that the film resonates with kids guilty over disappointing their parents.Worth one viewing. Makes a good companion piece to "The Savages".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a horrible movie, but with some serious flaws, Everybody's Fine suffers from schmaltzy forced dialog turning unbelievable. With a group of good actors coming together, they do a fairly good job with what is unfortunately poor writing. Deniro's father character does not have common sense or stretches believability as though written to be a naive and torn father - boiling to trying to show by telling vs. demonstrating with actions. His pestering of his children grows wearisome equally as much as their dishonesty. Too much schmaltzy dialog does not make characters more complex. (spoiler)Likewise, writing in dishonest and dysfunctional family communication and then turning around and justifying it by death didn't work. This movie felt petty and beneath the talent of Robert Deniro and Rockwell. Not really recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Goode, a recently widowed man, has a lot of time to himself. He has not come to terms with the death of a wife that kept his life in order. Now having to face reality, he is somewhat lost, even in the most mundane chores, that his wife probably took care of. This is the same wife that kept from him the truth about their four children, now on their own, and what paths they decided to take as adults.Frank, who is retired, decides to bring the four kids home for a sort of family reunion, but each one of them, with the exception of David, calls to send their regrets. Having such complicated lives, Frank decides to surprise them instead. First he goes to New York, but David is not around for the visit. He pushes on to Chicago, where daughter Amy is living in what appears a luxury existence, but he notices there's no love between her and a husband that appears not to be living at home anymore. As much as Amy tries, he still can see through her.After Amy, Frank goes to Denver. His son Robert, who he thinks is conducting the Symphony Orchestra, turns out to be a percussionist. He excuses himself by telling the father he is going on a tour, so Frank goes on to Las Vegas to visit Rosie, a successful dancer. She dazzles her father by taking him to a luxury apartment she has rented to impress the old man. The arrival of an infant tells Frank that his daughter is hiding something from him, and in reality, Rosie is indeed connected to the lovely baby that comes unexpectedly with his babysitter.Frank, who has a heart condition, was advised by his doctor not to fly, so he has taken to the roads and railways of the country. When he has seen that everyone is fine, he takes a commercial flight, something he shouldn't have done, in the first place. This brings the family together at last. Unfortunately, David is the only one that can't make it this time.Kirk Jones adapted the magnificent Italian film "Stanno tutti bene" and transferred the action to America. Unfortunately, Mr. Jones didn't have a charismatic Marcello Mastroianni to play the central character. Not that Robert Deniro is not up to the task, it's that somehow this is not an interesting dysfunctional family which we are taken to be examined. Somehow the viewer does not get as involved as Mr. Jones intended. The original screenplay was by Massimo De Rita and Tonino Guerra, who was a genius in the Italian cinema. The original film was made better by Giuseppe Tornatore, a man who knows how to pull heart strings.The cast that was put together is enough to attract an audience. The sad fact is Robert Deniro, like all mortals, is aging. What a great career he has enjoyed! Even though his Frank Goode is not one of his best creations, he does a fine job in giving him life. The three children, played by Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale, and Sam Rockwell, are all fine. Sam Rockwell fares better perhaps with his take on Robert, the musician.Henry Braham's cinematography takes us for a ride cross country with his sharp eye showing the way. Dario Marianelli's musical score plays well in the background. One would have wished Kirk Jones, in his Americanization of something that was done much better before, could have improved on the original, but at least, he tried.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody's Two-Dimensional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Harry and Tonto is the blueprint for the apex of how to do a widower-roams-country-in-search-of-his-family movie and About Schmidt is the abyss, then Everybody's Fine is the midway point between the two. DeNiro does everything one could do with his character and more. This is necessary to make this movie passable because all the characters are underwritten and the secrets that are eventually exposed aren't particularly profound or earth-shattering. Unlike Harry and Tonto or The Straight Story, only one of DeNiro's side-interludes between destinations - with a female trucker - is amusing or interesting in any way. The rest is just filler as are the many montages and flashbacks the movie indulges in.The gimmick of him seeing and talking to his grown children as if they were still children wears paper thin quickly, especially toward the end when he imagines them revealing secrets to him while he is going through physical distress. Another detriment was the very unconvincing street person-turned-attempted mugger who seemed to be trying to work the method as we watched it work him instead; as a result, the entire scene was stilted. Also, New York Indy queen character actress Lynn Cohen was able to do nothing with their bit part except mug.All that said, DeNiro still pulls it off. And all the remaining supporting performances are quite good and it was fun to see Katherine Moening of the L Word as Barrymore's "friend." Barrymore, Rockwell, and Beckinsale were all fine-plus as was Beckinsale's spouse, Moening, DeNiro's doctor, and the young actor playing Beckinsale's son. The direction seemed to try to make every mundane moment seem important and in the absence of any great truths, this grew tedious but he kept the pace moving well enough to keep it warm.In sum, I've spent 105 minutes more unpleasantly than with this family and the ending does make you feel warm unless you are a complete misanthrope which I am not. So, if you love DeNiro even more than I do, add a star - but don't expect anything special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody's Fine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very interesting experience. It's one more time a proof of excellence in acting by Robert Deniro and unusually exploits one of humanity's most talented sins: lie. There's not very much to say about this movie to those who haven't seen it, because one little comment can ruin the surprise that this movie was. A five star performance by the lead and experienced actor that is the epicenter of the film. Solid job by the rest of the cast and a very worked plot. It can be a puzzle sometimes and the most familiar one too. It shows that everybody's not fine but everybody's fine. It's a contradiction and not a contradiction. The message that this piece of work sends is very heavy and the movie is so well done that it really catches the viewer and makes him think about his acts. Not an easy movie but not a complicated one too, it's something in between. Very deep and very touching, and a must-see to drama lovers - 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro is great, but the movie alone is just cold.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert De Niro stars as a widowed father in Everybody's fine, a remake of an Italian film. De Niro's acting in the movie is more than fine. Him and Drew Barrymore are very good. In some cases performances can make a movie. Well, De Niro is one of those actors that makes a movie work. But, unfortunately, the movie doesn't really work.I think that the film would be fine if it wasn't so shallow. Yes I said shallow. 3/4 of the film is shallow. I mean throughout most of the film his children are ignoring him deliberately. I mean these people are harsh. De Niro stars as a widowed father who invites his grown up kids(played by Kate Beckinsale, Drew Barrymore, and Sam Rockwell)to his house for a reunion. But they all cancel out on him. So he leaves his house, and visits his kids. But there is a horrible truth about the other child that they try to keep a secret.De Niro is pretty terrific in every movie he's in. From Goodfellas to even Stardust. And he is the only thing that brings life to this movie. This film seemed pretty shallow. Everyone besides Drew Barrymore and De Niro were unlikable. Barrymore is pleasant in anything. She is here too.The movie is really shallow. It's never exactly a good idea to tell someone bad news when they're in a coma. The film may not be perfection. But De Niro keeps it from doom. And the ending is sweet. And by the end you will have a little smile on your face. I did. Everybody's fine: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formulaic but DeNiro is better than the formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert DeNiro has been choosing some very poor projects since the new millennium began. I don't think 'Everybody's Fine' is a great film or a good choice for DeNiro but it is better than it could have been. DeNiro is to thanks for this. He takes this formula and makes it boil. Despite some major problems Everyone's Fine is decent enough to give a look.DeNiro makes this work and DeNiro alone. Everything else is just merely poor to mediocre. Kate Beckingsale, Drew Barrymore, and Sam Rockwell all give the worst performances of their career in this picture. DeNior on the other hand gives his strongest performance since 2000 as Frank Goode. DeNiro is subdued beyond anything he ever has been. Part of DeNiro's greatness has been his tremendous force and energy. In truth he has never played a character like Frank Goode before. Frank's a shell and DeNiro has the power to make him sad, tragic, and compelling. DeNiro plays the grandfather character and has never played one before. I kind of wish the picture was better but I think DeNiro makes it work.The direction isn't all that inspired. It kind of wants to be 'About Schmidt' and it kind of fails. I mean so many clichés are used, and yet DeNiro makes it work. The idea of the telephone poles is silly, the idea of the city hopping is silly, and the way the relationships are handled makes every kid come off as a jerk. DeNiro doesn't see this, and he saves this picture.I really found the last act to be the best of the picture. The film has some major problems in identifying what it wants to be. It isn't a comedy or a drama. The last act though is crystal clear and DeNiro is brilliant in it. DeNiro's character Frank's favorite son is David who has tragically experimented with drugs. David represents the lost part of his heart. In the end he learns David met a tragic end and he blames himself for it. This is good drama. The moment where Goode goes to buy one of David's paintings is very satisfactory. Unfortuneatly the rest of the film doesn't follow suit.I don't believe Rockwell, Beckingsale, or Barrymore in these roles. Placing them next to DeNiro shows their shortcomings. I don't believe they are working class people. They look like awkward movie stars trying to blend in. DeNiro even in this disappointing decade for him still is able to blend into any role given to him. While this is one of DeNiro's better performances it is the worst of those three actors, who are all very respectable. They play the material for sap, DeNiro plays it with honesty. What the picture should have been about mostly was the lost son. That is what I identified most with.I have to mildly recommend the picture. It's one that really makes me in awe of DeNiro. It isn't the Taxi Drivers or the Raging Bulls which make me love him. It's the "Everybody's Fine's that don't work unless they have him in the lead.</fullReview>

I really loved this film, but towards the end of the film Frank (DeNiro) has a very emotional scene at his wife's grave and the dates on the tombstone say 1917 - 2008 I think--am I correct? If I'm not, I apologize, but if I am, did his wife die when she was 91 years old? How old is he supposed to be? I noticed that people have depicted Frank as "old" in postings--that's scary for all of us!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody's Fine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody's Fine is a remake of an Italian film with the same title, which was released in 1990. Robert De Niro plays Frank, a lonely old man who attempts at a reunion with his busy adult children. When they all cancel on him last minute, Frank decides to take a trip and show up at their places unexpectedly. We learn vague details about the past as Frank tries to repair all of the family relationships. The premise is interesting enough, but the way the film plays out is too saccharine and manipulative to allow the audience to contribute anything.This is a film in which the architecture of the screenplay is almost physically visible. It's so painfully clichéd that we can calculate when the next laughs will come, or when we'll be expected to cry next. It has plenty of potential in its study of adult family dynamics, but writer/director Kirk Jones is too forceful with the content and the result is off-putting.Robert De Niro is an actor of devastating emotional ability. His talent knows no bounds, despite the hit-and-miss nature of his career lately. He has moments of power in this film, and he manages to rise above the screenplay for the most part. However, the material doesn't give him enough to work with, and it represses his full capabilities. Nevertheless, he's the strongest part of this feature and faithful fans of his work should give it a look.The same can't be said for the rest of the cast. Drew Barrymore, Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsale play De Niro's children, and none of their characters are written with much texture. Drew Barrymore is surprisingly strong considering what she's given, and I enjoyed some of the scenes she shared with De Niro. On the other hand, Beckinsale and Rockwell struggle visibly with their roles, and neither of them manage to turn in particularly memorable performances.The lack of adequate character development amplifies the problems with the story. The conclusion of this movie is so generic and overly sentimental that it squashes any potential it had. It's the kind of forgettable holiday film that comes out every year, which is unfortunate because I think it could have been better with these actors and themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone is Just Normal, Not Fine At All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoiler's Here"" Reviewing this movie 7 years after it came out. Watched it when it first came out, but now I have a different perspective on it. I'm not DeNiro's age, I'm more Rockwell's age, but that should not affect my opinion. This movie is one of DeNiro's last great performances. Since then he has taken roles that are not, let's say, up to his great performances as a great actor. In this movie, he still shows his talent as an actor. A father, after the death of his wife, wanting to reconnect with his children; but did he really know them at all? He depended on his wife, who now is gone, to communicate with them while he was working. Now that he is a alone, he tries so terribly hard to reach out to his children, who, he really doesn't know at all. This movie is just so sad, but perhaps real for many people in life, who depend on their spouse to raise their children, and ignore the reality of their four children. Without getting into many spoilers here; just a checklist of how disconnected this man (Deniro) is with his own children. One child he cannot find (going to NY to find him), another, his daughter is not with her husband anymore, but fakes it. Another child he thought was leading an orchestra but in reality just playing back-up percussion and one thinking was a star in Vegas, but in reality just a waitress. You have to ask yourself, why this man is so disconnected and lives in a dream world thinking that Everyone's Fine. Perhaps this should be a lesson for any parent to pay more attention to your children, instead of thinking that bringing home the "bacon" is enough. You must always look beyond your spouse to see your children, because someday that spouse may not be there anymore, and all you find out is that "EVERYONE IS NOT FINE AFTERALL", BUT they will in fact survive, or not, without you. Great movie, great writing; sometimes reality in life is hard to explain to a person who expects too much. And when the truth comes out, well, see the movie; well worth watching. Perhaps it's never too late or maybe not, to find out who you brought into the world and whether or not you were not seeing them for who they are, you just see them as you want them to be; which is not FINE AT ALL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Realistic, gentle, and a very common real life family drama. A Lonely widower travels across the ­states in a fraught attempt to round up his now grownup busy children for a ­family get-together since their mother's funeral. Wrapped around a pretty simple story yet very cleverly ­constructed. DeNiro gives a brilliant performance and still at his best while taking a calm, careworn, less iconic role. British writer-director Kirk Jones has persuaded him to turn the heat down. DeNiro plays Frank Goode - A retired guy with cardiac and ­ respiratory problems, struggling to keep up. With a strong ­ supporting cast, there is a third-act ­crisis that shares Frank's stunned ­incredulity. A film is overall very real, refreshing in a sense, yet very touching nonetheless.~ @asifahsankhan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DeNiro is great in an okay movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this one quite a bit. Robert DeNiro is excellent and ultimately what makes this so watchable. He plays a widower who sets out to visit each of his 3 grown children only to discover that they've been hiding their problems from him. I liked the idea that he had to reconnect with his kids because his entire relationship with them had been through his wife. I have seen this scenario play out myself through a couple of friends. Its awkward and tough going.Nothing too exciting really happens here plot wise, but the story still kept my attention as 'Frank' travels around the country from NY to Chicago to Denver, to Vegas, meeting other lonely people and basically intruding on his children's lives.There is a bit of a mystery involved regarding what's in the envelopes he hand delivers to each of them and also in what has happened to his son David. I enjoyed DeNiro's scenes with Drew Barrymore a lot even if her secret did seem a bit far fetched. Kate Beckinsale, Sam Rockwell &amp; Austin Lysy play the other kids. I also enjoyed the flashbacks, where he sees his grown children as young kids. Ultimately I felt sad for Frank.I'm not sure why this is being marketed as a Christmas movie when it has nothing to do with the season. Even the (bad) poster has a tree on it. In actuality there is only 1 short scene involving the holiday. 3/28/15</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misleading</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Everybody's Fine" directed by Kirk Jones, centers a widower (Robert De Niro) who realized his only connection to his kids was through his wife, so he sets out on a journey to reunite with his grown children.First of all, may I say the title is very misleading. The truth is, everybody is NOT fine.The movie begins with Robert De Niro preparing long and hard for his kids to come over for a cookout, until all his kids end up canceling on him last minute. Seeing an old man put in a lot of hard work only to be let down was not only very very sad but also very very depressing. I was hoping that maybe this movie had an "Up" type of plot, having the first 10 minutes super incredibly sad and then the rest of movie just gets better from there, but nope, I was wrong. So wrong.You would think the beginning is the worst part, but the truth is the movie just goes downhill from there, very downhill. I was hoping at some point there would SOME turn of events that would satisfy my broken heart for this old man, but that never happened.Although the movie ended with what seemed to be a "happy" ending, considering he DID get all the family together (well not ALL the family) I still wasn't recovered from the emotional damage the movie did to me, and the some-what "happy" ending sure didn't help it.I do believe the movie was very good, because any movie that makes me cry THAT hard is a movie that is well done. Robert De Niro was the star and his little innocent old man look really got to me. I would definitely watch the movie again, especially now that I know what I'm getting myself into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those movies you gotta see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank God I didn't read the dreary reviews before watching this movie. For some reason, lots of people find it "depressing". (Which depresses me, since Everybody's Fine is an accurate reflection of real life. Maybe someone's in denial?) And professional critics for the most part don't find it... something... enough. But I'm a critical viewer, and I loved it. Robert DeNiro is brilliant and completely recognisable as a father of grown kids. Maybe the people who didn't like it are just too young to have been there: men of my father's generation and before, who thought their main job was to make money and hector their kids into "succeeding" during the few minutes per week they spent together. I knew this character the instant I saw him; the opening scene -- which has no dialogue -- says it all. The dad is also deeply sympathetic, which isn't easy in a movie based on his past mistakes. But I love this guy. If you knew him in real life, you will too. But what makes Everybody's Fine so powerful is that it's a mystery; clues drop subtly, around a main character who isn't as dumb, or as inflexible, as his family thinks he is. We figure out the truth along with him. The white-lying portrayed is also completely realistic; the unanswered questions kept me trying to solve the mystery.The grown kids (whom the father still tellingly calls "my children") are a bit stock, I'll give the critics that. But the performances are good; better than some reviewers have allowed. Each one is simultaneously the same and different; again, realistic. And the grandson is brilliant. Lucian Maisel manages to play it just teenaged enough to be real (and charming), without quite stepping over the line to obnoxious. He's sarcastic and outspoken, but remains inside the story. If you haven't seen this movie, stop reading the reviews. See it and make up your own mind. I'm glad I did.</fullReview>

So he decides to go all over the country to visit each one. When he visits David in NY, nobody's home. His other three kids Amy (Kate Beckinsale), Robert (Sam Rockwell), and Rosie (Drew Barrymore) all know that David is in trouble with drugs in Mexico. But none of them are willing to tell him any bad news in any of their lives. It is a family dysfunction where the mother was the one who listened while Frank dismissed.This is a sad little indie. De Niro isn't using all of his power. He's leaving a lot of things unsaid. So does everybody else. I do wish that he play a tougher character. It would be more compelling. However I do understand that writer/director Kirk Jones is making a certain type of character. He's not a bad father. He's just a little more closed off.In many ways, this character suffers from being too regular. He's not bombastic, or truly meek. He's just an old fashion guy who always asking "Are you Happy?" Inevitably, the only answer that can come back is "Everybody's Fine."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Importance of Good Communication and Parenting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read through a couple of reviews before writing this and it surprised me how so many thought the performances were terrible or the focus on the young children were "so annoying." Great movies are only made great by those who understand them. How many great classic novels are pushed aside today because they sound boring or too difficult to read? Reading requires knowing how to read a book in order to understand what the author is saying, that's why English is required in school. Film "reading" is not required learning but should be since everyone watches movies.If you don't understand what you are watching, then how you can understand something wonderful happening in front of you? This film reflects the lives of so many who reach that point in their life. This is why for many dads, the song "Cat's in the Cradle" really hits home for them and their sons. They want to know that a part of them is with their children now and will live on. The subtly and simplicity of this film is what made it so wonderful to watch. A father visiting his children may not seem like much but when you're life is near the end, that's the best thing you can do with your time. You really have to understand how people live their lives in order to see all the little details in order to truly see what made this film so great. There are a few shots of him alone at home just living that show how lonely and quiet his life has become. It's also meant to reflect isolation, and the need for that human connection again. In old age routine becomes your friend and your enemy all at the same time. It gives you a reason to get up in the morning, thankful for another day and gets you doing stuff around the house.You find a theme of the importance of communication throughout the film. All he wanted was to find out what he missed all those years, but under that need, he just wanted to fill the shoes of being a good parent. This is something that many people can relate to, there are some who only talk to their mothers and some who only talk to their fathers over the phone. The one parent may tell the other but how often do they really listen. It's that little act of caring that does have an impact on the children. Parenting is not easy and everything you tell your kids does affect them later on, sometimes for good or bad. This movie shows those effects and how, if given the chance to talk to your young kids again, you would do things differently.This movie has been compared to About Schmidt and that this is De Niro's version of that. If it is or isn't, it really doesn't matter. Movies are meant to pull us into a world and get us to think. If this is another movie that is meant to appreciate your family and the time you have with them, then it's important to listen to the message. You only get so many Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners with your kids; you don't get all of them. You only get to hug them so many times before they have to start doing that for their kids, and you know it's never enough. Everybody's Fine is about a man who wanted to see how his family was doing and found out, and it took some heart ache to do it, but that's because he cared enough to get out of his routine to do it.If you plan on watching this for the first time, bring some tissues, don't let anything interrupt you, and if your kids are watching it with you, keep them near you, you'll know why near the end. If your kids are adults now, then maybe this will start an open conversation with everyone.Film watching tip: don't bring anything into the movie (emotionally I mean), just sit, listen, don't talk, and look for the details. You will see why this movie is such an amazing, yet simple, film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent flick for a rainy day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this film after years of hearing about it or seeing it on store shelves. Surprisingly, De Niro was not the reason I saw this film, but the relation it had to Paul McCartney's input with the song "(I want to) Come Home". It's not the best reason to watch a movie I know, but I'm not one for a hokey "learning about ourselves" premise. That being said, I was taken by how well written the film really was. I was expecting something tired and slow, but it turned out to be quite "SNAPPAY" in its dialogue. I also liked how its a story that shows why the "American Dream" can not only be daunting for parents and children, but also toxic for relationships. My biggest shock was the man of the hour himself, Robert "Double Oscar, second coming of Vito and professional volleyball filler" De Niro. I thought........he was kind of bland. (SHOCK AND AWE!! SNAPPAY!) I really respect you Bob, I think your an extremely talented and actually pretty funny actor, but this film felt a little off to me. It felt like he was being one of his gangster roles while speaking to a homeless man on a subway (Not the sandwich shop, no one gets mentioned till I get paid), but became as soft as he was in "Awakenings" while speaking to his grandson or a baby he is forced to look after. He was good, but not the best he has been. That goes for the film as well, along with its supporting cast. While Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore and Kate Beckinsale (and the rest!) dish out good performances, that's all you can really say about them, good. The film and actors are not AMAZING, but they leave you all warm, fuzzy, and feelin' fine.The film isn't a masterpiece, but its not even close to bad. Its a movie that you can watch without thinking too hard, but don't turn your mind off completely, there may be something you can relate to.BONUS DISC!!!!!!!: One last thing for all you freedom fighters out there. There is an interesting nugget in the special features with Paul McCartney and the making of the song "(I want to) Come Home". If you like Paul and his work, that will be worth at least a rent. While you have it though, watch the film, you may be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

He tries to bring all the kids home for diner and be together again but gets phone calls from them saying they were on a busy week and they can't come. So Frank decides to leave to seek his children without even saying that he is coming up wanting to make them a surprise. The first time he goes to New York to one of his sons, David, but fails to reach him because he is not at home. Then he goes to one of his daughters, who has a child and is pleased when he sees his grandfather. Amy is surprised by his coming there because they do not expect him to hit the road so long especially because he is sick. After having lunch together she says she's busy and her son goes on a trip so Frank is forced to see farther down the road. He goes to the other son, Robert that he thinks he's a successful conductor, but in reality he only occasionally beat the drum. Then goes to Las Vegas to meet Rosie, she is very happy seeing him and after going home to her apartment that is not hers, then Frank finds out that is rented. Then he returns home by plane, which typically do not do because it doesn't like to fly and has a heart attack, arrive at the hospital where his children come to visit and here find out that David died because of drugs. His wish is being fulfilled at the end of the movie when he reunites his family.It's a drama sprinkled with an emotional message about a dad with a desire to learn that children are exactly what they wanted to be when they were small and they said what they want to do in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 2009's "Everybody's Fine" Robert De Niro plays a widower who is down because his four kids all canceled on coming home for Thanksgiving, so he decides to go see each one instead (Kate Beckinsale, Sam Rockwell and Drew Barrymore respectively). This entails traveling all over the country over the next week or so.I don't get all the positive ratings on this one. Sure, it's well made, has a great cast and makes a good point, but it's just humdrum from beginning to end. Maybe the story works better for those who can relate to De Niro's character, but for everyone else this is a really slow and boring road movie. Being boring is the ultimate sin in cinema.If you want to see Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsale in an outstanding drama be sure to check out 2007's "Snow Angels." GRADE: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a sad movie. It's not a tear-jerker in the classic sense of the word, but it has an atmosphere of sadness throughout. It's a wonderful performance by Robert Deniro, who catches and portrays this atmosphere of sadness perfectly. His performance isn't overpowering, because that's not the nature of his character. It's just incredibly solid, and perfect for the role of Frank Goode. Frank is a recent widower who, without his wife, is just a little bit lost. He won't admit it. He tells people he's fine, but he's really not. We know he's sick with a lung problem, and we know he's alone. He has four kids that he loves, but they're scattered throughout the country and it was his wife who really kept in touch with them, and based on what she told him, they're all doing fine. As the movie opens, Frank is planning for a family re-union. All the kids are coming to visit and they'll be gathered as a family around the dinner table ("just like at Christmas") for the first time since his wife's funeral. Then one by one they all drop out, and Frank decides that if they won't come to him, he'll go to them, so he sets out on a cross- country trip to drop in on each one.We know something's wrong with Frank's eldest son. It's revealed really early on that he was arrested in Mexico. We don't know anymore, though, and all the kids want to keep this from their dad. In the meantime, as Frank makes his visits, we discover that even with the other three, not everything is as fine as Frank's wife had led him to believe. Frank knows everything isn't fine. He senses that something's wrong; that things aren't quite the way his wife told him with any of them. And we slowly unravel the mystery.Kirk Jones directed a slow-moving, gentle but very good movie. The supporting cast (especially Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell as the three kids Frank does connect with) all do their jobs very well. One thing that helps move this along, and prevents it from just being consumed by the sadness, is some low-key humour scattered throughout. Things like Frank asking the totally clueless supermarket clerk for help buying wine ("well, we have some good English wine from France, and some really good Italian wine from all over Europe"), or Frank playing golf with his grandson, or Frank thinking the trucker who gave him a lift to Reno was coming on to him. (It was a woman trucker!) They all brought a smile to my face and helped with the pacing of the movie. Without some humour, this might have been a bit too heavy.The sad atmosphere really lasts almost until the very end, only the last scenes really giving you a feeling that, finally, maybe everything will be fine. It's a fine movie, highlighted by Deniro's performance. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert De Niro gives a nicely restrained performance in Everybody's Fine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because my sister recommended this last year, I finally ordered this from Netflix and just watched it with my mom. It stars Robert De Niro as a recently widowed father who, having been told by three of his four grown children that they can't come home for the holidays, decides to visit them unexpectedly at where they all live. The three he visits are played by Kate Beckinsale, Sam Rockwell, and Drew Barrymore. The fourth is mostly referred to until near the end. I'll stop there and just say this was a nice change of pace for De Niro, usually known to me for his violent movies he made with Martin Scorsese, as he mostly gives a restrained performance here and pretty well, too. The others are also good in what their roles require of them. There are also some dream sequences of the offspring as children that also provided some interesting insights of what De Niro's character thinks and knows they're not telling him that I also liked. Oh, and Paul McCartney's song during the end credits was also touching. So on that note, Everybody's Fine gets a recommendation from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phenomenal Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was superb. It is a very simple story of a dad trying to connect with his kids after they have grown up and grown apart. This film is a marvel of character development so vivid that you truly feel an impact from the realistic scenes and dialog. It is played perfectly by Robert DeNiro. I would recommend this to anyone looking to enjoy a good story that is wonderfully told. There are some funny parts, there are some sad parts, there are some really meaningful personal resolutions and it is all told very artfully.I am not one much for writing reviews but this film did compel me to say something since I think this film's story needs to be shared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deceptively depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Everybody's Fine" should instead be called "Everybody's in Denial"(or maybe just Robert Deniro's character). I bought this at a thrift store, and it was not worth the money even at that low price. I bought this mainly because Kate Beckinsale is in it, but I also like Robert Deniro. I was expecting something lighthearted, but this was one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. The back cover promises that you will "laugh and cry". I certainly didn't laugh. What little attempts at humor are in this are not at all funny. I didn't literally cry, but I sure felt worse for watching it. Maybe it was expecting something similar to Deniro's character in the "Meet the Parents" series, but all I got was a sad depressed old man. Not that Deniro's acting(or anyone else's) was bad in this movie, the story was just huge downer. It's about a guy after his wive dies, and his children practically never talk to him. They would talk to their mother more, and now that she's gone they rarely if ever call their dad. The idea that children talk to their mother more is believable, but now they have HUGE things going on in their lives that they don't even bother to mention to their dad. They even go way out of their way to deceive him when he goes to visit. Can a family really be like this? It just doesn't seem believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great depiction of modern America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think one of the main themes, aside from family relations, are how busy American's lives are. I know myself that when I have a family obligation I find myself inconvenienced from my daily life. In the movie, Dinero was from a different time, where being successful didn't mean catching flights every few days.I'm not really sure why the other son lied about flying out when he had no plans, but when Drew Barrymore's character had time to hang out with Dinero, it was somewhat refreshing after being rushed out of his first 2 kid's houses.Great movie, super depressing. Would watch alone with a glass of wine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart warming, great De Niro movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening sequence kept my initial doubts about the film firmly silent. The film oozed out with emotion, sentiment, nostalgia and a great sense of loss which was evident when De Niro first appears on screen. This is what contributed to make an extraordinarily powerful emotional roller-coaster of a film and whilst watching made me go through emotions I didn't even know I had. Most of this was down to the inspiring and successful acting from Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore, Kate Bekinsale and most importantly from one of the greatest acting performances from the legendary Robert De Niro. Also the style adopted from Kirk Jones made it more real and made emotion more meaningful by his use of deep focus shots throughout the film.The film uses technical aspects which don't allow us to escape from reality. It keeps up engaged in Frank's life meaning that we feel emotion more and can emphasise with him even more. The film is a successful drawback to the dramas of yester year. This is because all though I'm only 17 it is easy to identify how different movies are from the golden ages of film such as the 30's and 50's and even the 70's. It is refreshing to see a film in this day and age which doesn't solely rely on shock value to leave a lasting impression on the audience. It doesn't use extreme violence to portray conflict or superficial special effects to bamboozle the audience with cheap thrills. Even though I can appreciate how special effects can be used successfully the film doesn't need them at all in its powerful approach to the film as it brilliantly uses old fashioned values to achieve its strong impression.As previously mentioned the performance of Robert De Niro was the main reason why I enjoyed it so much and why it can appeal to any audience. His performance strongly broke the stereotype people have labelled him as, because he has had success at playing psychotic violent men like Travis and Jake or when playing gangsters like Al Capone and Vito Corleone. His performance used subtle emotion as he once again immersed himself into the role and became Frank Goode has a played a character that was incredibly soft and yet had lots of masculinity and was mentally strong when it came to caring for his children. He used excellent body movements which strongly presented his loss and the spectrum of emotions which he went through during the film. In my opinion it ranks among "The Deer Hunter" and "Taxi Driver" for De Niro's best performance and in my opinion it showed how he has adapted his acting style to suit his age in what I consider to be one of the most underrated performances in film.The film is worth seeing for so many reasons it is a strongly sensitive drama which is accessible to all. It is a film that uses simple effective methods to produce its class and tell its story in a fine way. It's a film where we are easily to relate its characters and most especially we can appreciate the courage shown by Frank in his brave journey through America. The film ranks among the best dramas and is certainly one of the best in the noughties. Awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro Shines In Everybody's Fine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody's Fine is a comedy/drama film or dramedy about a widower that realized his only connection to his family was through his wife sets off on an impromptu road trip to reunite with each of his grown children.It stars Robert De Niro as Frank Goode,the widower together with Drew Barrymore,Sam Rockwell, and Kate Beckinsale.It is a remake of the Giuseppe Tornatore's Italian film Stanno Tutti Bene. It was written and directed by Kirk Jones.Paul McCartney wrote the ballad "(I Want To) Come Home" for the movie's soundtrack.Everybody's Fine starts when Frank Goode, whose wife recently passed away, is getting ready for his children to come visit him.Though, each of his children call to cancel on him at the last minute. Feeling a bit down by the rejections, Frank decides to head out on a cross-country trip,visiting each of his kids. Frank takes a train to New York City, to see one of his sons, David.Next visit is to daughter Amy in Chicago, who tells him it's a bad time to visit. She had turned down her father's earlier invitation to visit, saying that her son Jack was sick. However, once he gets to Amy's house, Frank realizes Jack wasn't sick and Amy was just making up an excuse. Frank hits a few golf balls with grandson Jack in the yard of their impressive suburban home. Dinner is uncomfortable with tension between Jack and his father. The next morning, Frank accompanies Amy to her fancy downtown office and hears her agency's pitch for a TV ad. She takes him to the train station to visit his son Robert in Denver. While waiting, Amy introduces her father to a male co- worker of hers.Frank arrives in Denver expecting to see Robert conduct the city's orchestra. Robert also tells Frank his visit is at a bad time, as the orchestra is flying to Europe the next day, but this is only a lie. So within hours Frank prepares to take a bus to Las Vegas to visit his daughter Rosie. Frank is adamant that each visit be a surprise, but Robert calls Rosie to warn her of his arrival. He has a dream that his son David is in trouble.Rosie,his daughter, meets him at the station in a stretch limo and tells him she was in a big show that just ended the previous week. During dinner, Frank asks Rosie why his adult children never talked to him and told him things, when they told their mother everything. He is not comfortable, having a feeling that all his kids are lying to him.Frank flies back home but ? without any more pills ? he has a heart attack in the plane's lavatory. The last scene shows the family at Christmas. Frank is cooking the turkey and remembers that he never had the heart to tell his wife hers was overcooked. All three children are around the house helping cook and decorate the tree. It's also revealed that Rosie and Jilly are a couple and are raising the baby together. Amy's co-worker whom she is dating is also at the gathering. The film ends with Frank walking into the dining room, to his family and everyone sitting at the table together.Everybody's Fine may not be the greatest of family movies but Robert De Niro shines as Frank Goode.He tries to his best through his portrayal as a father that tries to bring his family together and it makes up for whatever the film lacks particularly the chemistry among the others actors involved and the screenplay as well.Although the film maybe predictable and formulaic,De Niro's performance tries to make the movie interesting and engaging from beginning to end.Overall,Everybody's Fine is worth watching for De Niro's acting alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie that I saw it for 2 times :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well at first, I should say that I really like this movie. I like playing of Robert De Niro and I like some parts of the movie that are related to the family. Because of my cultural views, I didn't like the role of Drew Barrymore but the rest of the players were okay. First time that I saw this movie, I saw it with my parents and the second time I saw this movie with my parents and my aunt and his husband. My aunt says that the age of Robert De Niro is a bit lower than an old and sick father and I realized that she is right. I think he is a bit young. But he tried his best to become an old father but I think his make up is a bit low. I really liked the part that Robert De Niro cried and at that time I see all of the visitors of the movie were crying too (and of course I cried too). At the end I should say that the message of the movie is that we should always be with our family and we should be united.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pleasant family drama which is a must watch for DeNiro fans, with some names like Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale &amp; Sam Rockwell in the titles, it would be hard to turn down! I really loved the family more than their very ordinary story, and loved the way the Old man starts off for a trip to see his children ignoring his Doc's advice.A pretty predictable storyline with all the family members getting together finally, yes, a very common plot we see in our neighborhood. Nobody's fine and supposedly act out to be fine and that's the only way we make ourselves believe that we all are fine. :-) Robert DeNiro was never acting, the dialog delivery and his movements, man i wonder how could he be so original all the time! All those scenes where he's at table were so real. The movie isn't that great to see a second time but to watch RobertDeNiro I wouldn't mind playing it over &amp; over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Everybody's Fine" is a movie about loneliness,life,family and communication.It tells the story of Frank,an old widower,and his struggle to reconnect with his children,two sons and two daughters,all living their own lives,all apart from each other.Unfortunately,for me,the movie didn't hit any emotional "soft spots".The main reason the movie is worth watching is the lead.Robert DeNiro proves us that he is not just an old has-been,he's still got it.I only wish he would chose more serious character-driven roles,he can still shine if he wants to. The supporting cast is also good,but unfortunately they are overshadowed by DeNiro.On the technical level,"Everybody's Fine" has great cinematography and soundtrack,no erratic editing/shaky cam,which is also a good thing in this day and age of cinema.My only complaint would be the direction-the pacing seems to be a bit inconsistent.It is a movie I recommend to any movie-lover,and it's a must-see for every DeNiro fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't think I've ever cried this much for a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting anything from this movie. My mom just told me a few days ago about this movie and how one of her friends recommended it. I thought I'd give it a watch since I had really nothing better to do. Hey, I was just looking for a way to pass some time. I never thought that I'd get something more than that."Everybody's Fine" follows Frank as he sets off on a journey around America to surprise all 4 of his grown children. Frank has high hopes for each of his kids and can't wait to see all of them making their way into the world- his artist son, his high-ranking ad executive daughter, his son, a band conductor, and his daughter, a dancer. However, they all don't turn out the way he's imagined.Robert De Niro was perfect for this role. He plays the old widower who, as we can see, really loves and cares for his family. I felt that I could see my own parents in him in many scenes, which only made me more emotionally involved in the film. I felt for him so many times.I don't know what else to say about this movie. Only that it truly is beautiful. I don't think I've ever cried THIS much in a movie before. I teared up during many scenes, even if they weren't really aimed to be sad. And my gosh, by the near-ending, I couldn't stop my tears! A movie that is able to make their audience react in such a way, is truly amazing and brilliant.This isn't a comedy. It is a depressing film. Which is ironic, as you can see from the title itself. But it makes you think and appreciate your family more. I think that I'll be able to appreciate this movie more when I have a family of my own. But as of now, I was still able to see the beauty in this film. This was a great film. That's all I can say about it.1st viewing: April 30, 2011 ; 2nd viewing: November 7, 2011</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite a classic, but very good..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is based on the 1990 Giuseppe Tornatore film "Stanno Tutti Bene" which I'll admit I haven't seen. It's has a gentle pace that slowly unfolds the story of a man trying to make a connection with his children after his wife has sadly died. Here's a very brief summary before I tell you my thoughts (summary haters please look after the garden while I'm away writing the next paragraph ? thank you).Frank Goode is waiting for his children to come and visit. It is the first time the family has all been together since his wife passed away eight months ago. Giving one excuse or another, the children all cancel, but Frank is determined to see them. He doesn't like flying, and has a lung condition that prevents it anyhow, and so he gets on a train and a bus and goes to see all four of them. They are all in different parts of the United States and so it is quite a trip for a man of his age. The four children are; David, an artist in New York, Amy, an advertising executive, Robert, a musician on tour with an orchestra and Rosie, an actress in Las Vegas. I won't go into details here, but none of them are telling Frank the entire truth and he soon realises that it's going to be tougher than he thought to connect with them all.Although it has quite a slow pace, I don't mind because it gives the viewer a chance to become invested in the characters, particularly Frank. I love the way that he always sees them as little children rather than the grown-ups that are before him. Great performances all round, particularly from Robert De Niro as Frank; he reminded me what a fine actor he really is. Drew Barrymore did a fine job as Rosie, as did Kate Beckinsale as Amy and Sam Rockwell as Robert. You may think I've forgotten the other son, David, well, that's a mystery I'll leave for you.The gentle pace may not be for everyone, I think you have to be in the mood to watch this one, but if you are, it's worth it. There is a really good pay-off at the end which I found both satisfying and heart-warming. I like the cinematography and it has a very appropriate soundtrack, including a song by Paul McCartney that I haven't heard before. It's not perfect and it won't be to everyone's taste, but I quite enjoyed it? Recommended.My score: 7.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but missing something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So as seen on the poster, this movie has a great cast: Robert De Niro, Sam Rockwell, Kate Beckinsale, and Drew Barrymore. However, the supporting characters are on screen for only a short while, and your mostly going to see little old Bobby. Of course this isn't necessarily a bad thing, since De Niro is great as usual. It's a story of an old widower who is trying to reconnect with his kids. It's sort of like About Schmidt (2002), but doesn't have the same effect as the other movie. It gets sad towards the end, and the final scene is sort of sappy, but it just isn't as powerful as the other movie I mentioned.The plot is decent enough, a person story and the acting is great (though there could be more Rockwell. There could always be more Rockwell). It's just missing a little something. It's not bad, but I recommend seeing About Schmidt instead if you want to see a film about a sad, lonely old man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cute little gem of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film last night at a special preview in Goa, India. Going into watch the film, I had a fair idea of the theme of the film. I thought that the theme has nothing new to offer and the film could be quite predictable. But alas I was taken by surprise.The film starts pretty slowly but eventually starts growing on you. The editing is superb as there isn't a single moment where you feel that a particular shot could have avoided. Even though the storyline is not extraordinary, the direction is superb. No review of this film would be complete without mentioning the actors. Robert De Niro proves that age is no barrier when it comes to acting. He has given a stunning performance yet again. His body language and expressions are unbelievably magnificent. The whole support cast is also superb. Drew Barrymore is excellent and Kate Beckinsale is awesome. But what amazes me is the performances of little known actors who appear in cameo roles like the two ladies in the train or the lady driving the truck and even James Murtaugh playing the role of a doctor. Each of these characters add further depth to the film. This film might not appeal to younger audience. But I would recommend people to watch this film as it would definitely touch your heart in a unique way. Don't Miss this cute gem of a film....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never cried so much while watching a film as I did during this heart-wrenching drama. I think that this film will appeal to anyone who has ever felt guilty about withholding truths from those they love. I know a lot of reviewers have pegged this a great film for the older crowd who have adult children, but I think it greatly appeals to those adult children as well. I am 26 and I saw both my dad and my grandfather (paternal) in DeNiro's Frank Goode. I saw my father's desire to know his children and never be lied to and I saw my grandfather's stern loneliness. I am just glad that I have a strong relationship with my father and tell him everything or I would not have been able to make it through the film. I hope he never feels this lonely. That would break my heart. I suppose I could see a little bit of each of my siblings and I in the 4 children in the film (we too are 2 boys, 2 girls and all adults) though as far as I know none of keep anything from our parents or each other. I am going to make them watch this so they realize that they never should. You can easily miss out on a lot of life while trying to hide your life from those who know the real you.A must see for anyone who values family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hand on heart, this is one of the better movies I have seen in a long time.First off, the assembly of cast for this movie is phenomenal, lots of top notch names here, and everyone delivered great, believable performances. Especially Robert De Niro, his performance in this movie rendered me speechless. Wow! He has proved it before that he is an actor of unique caliber, and once again he hits it straight on.The story is not fast-driven, but it moves at a good pace, building up the storyline as it goes along, and you really get to feel for Frank Goode (played by De Niro), as he travels through USA to visit his family and hand them these 'mystery' envelopes after they all had canceled on visiting him. And I must say that the curiosity for what was inside those envelopes had me wondering throughout the movie, and when the contents were finally revealed, it sank straight in."Everybody's Fine" is a very emotional movie, and I think it can best be described as a very beautiful movie. The director truly has managed to capture the essence of family bonds and the love of a father in this movie. This movie is the type that appeals to the heart and soul.When I sat down to watch it, I had no idea what it was about. I entered the movie with a clean slate, so I had no expectations, and I was more than pleasantly surprised, because this movie took me by storm, and it held on till the very end.If you haven't already seen "Everybody's Fine", you should do yourself the favor of doing so, because this is truly a masterpiece of a movie. You might just want to bring a box of tissues just in case. This is definitely a movie that I will be watching again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprise of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I like French films, because they are always character driven. American films are normally driven by action and/or schtick comedy. The lowest grade. Here is a film that has it all, excluding schtick. There isn't a moment that is not completely riveting. Deniro plays the father, Drew Barrymore, one of the daughters, along with kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell, as one of two sons. There is another son, David, but he has overdosed on drugs when this story gets started. This viewer has seen Deniro in everything he has done on film, but his tired, bewildered father is incredible. As in all of his work, he shows you his entire life in every scene, whatever his choices, his life is there between the lines and you can feel it. What an actor this man is. He wasn't tough in this one, just loving and compassionate. On the other hand, you knew was a tough father. As a matter fact, there is a scene with the kids when they were youngsters where we see him disciplining the children harshly, but the love behind it is palpable. Drew Barrymore. I'm always happy to see her. She's like our child, who has grown up to be extraordinary. From a engaging child in E.T. to Never been kissed, Charlie's Angeles and finally this wonderful grown up woman, who is afraid to admit she is a lesbian. I just love her art. Kate Beckinsale is astonishing. An Aussie, who masters the American Language, as if it were her own. From the horror films and well done, by the way. She plays action as if she lives it. But, this daughter is not an action hero, she is a caring and doting off-spring, compassionate and wise. Just as consumed by protecting her father as the others. Sam Rockwell has never seized to amaze. The first time for me in Galaxy Quest, then Dangerous Mind and many others. He is an artist through and through. This movie should be watched and savored for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a light hearted family comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was marketed and billed to be the next family holiday movie last year. So naturally I believed what I saw in trailers last year. Foolishly rented this movie for my family and I to watch. Well, they fired me from renting movies from now on. Once you realize this movie isn't the light hearted family romp centering around a holiday, then you get into the plot. But only after you first admit - "I don't think there will be many laughs with this movie". DeNiro is great in it, as is Drew Barrymore. But honestly, I just can't get past the fact they tricked viewers! That is just not nice.If you want a downer, and to cry, rushing to the phone to say call your elderly parent whom you may have neglected to call recently, then watch this film.If you want to watch a funny movie, this isn't for you.I honestly don't know how to rate it. Because I still am disappointed with the producer or whomever marketed this film. Even the DVD box pictures a HAPPY family. They are not happy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good to see DeNiro in a film that allows him to express his abilities once again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My main problem with Robert De Niro's career beyond 1994 is that he has seldom chosen a part or a script that has been up to the merits of his acting abilities. I'm glad to say that in Everybodys Fine, we see a sensitive and touching performance from De Niro that reminds us what a huge talent he is. DeNiro plays a widower travelling around America in an attempt to reconnect with his four children who have all gone their separate ways in life.While the film is touching and thought provoking,it ironically, lacks the one thing there's been too much of in DeNiro's career since the Sorcese heyday,comedy. I felt a few more lighter touches here and there would have given the audience a little more relief in what is for the most part,a fairly downbeat and heavy film in terms of the emotional journey it takes you on.From the directors point of view,the film is very capably handled and does indeed take you on a kind of journey of discovery but it is DeNiro who truly shines and for that we must be thankful. It's worth noting that DeNiro is well supported by Sam Rockwell,Drew Barrymore and Kate Beckinsale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just start out by saying that i hardly ever cry in movies, but in this one i just broke into tears.Its not an all an out depressing movie...but yeah it is sad &amp; it leaves you thinking.Last time i felt like this after a movie was probably FORREST GUMP(not that there is any similarity..but feels similar).This movie has its beautiful moments and a few laughs in between &amp; it teaches so much about relationships in a family... especially a father's relationship with his children.Robert De Niro plays a father(Frank) of four grown ups &amp; lives alone.He decides to visit all his children and give them a surprise and thats how his journey starts &amp; he learns some truths about his children.Robert De Niro just shines in this movie...its very rare to see a performance like this...so true to character and so convincing as an old father just desperate to meet his children and get his family back in one place and on one table after losing his wife! He really deserved an Oscar nomination for this flawless performance! Rest of the cast play their part very well too.It has some really touching scenes which can make almost anyone cry...especially the scene in the hospital!!All this combined with some great background score and Paul Mccartney's "I Want to come home" ...this is just a beautiful movie to watch for the whole family!!All of you who want to watch a good heartfelt drama about relationships should definitely watch it.Its not really a depressing movie if thats what you are concerned about.You will feel possibly every emotion while watching it!! I highly recommend it!! My Rating : 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tell Your Kids, Tell Your Parents That...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been sort of a sucker for movies about dysfunctional families probably because I see much of myself in them. While the title already suggests that everybody is NOT fine, the trailer of Kirk Jones's 'Everybody's Fine' might be a tad misleading as it gives the impression of another sugarcoated larger than life Hollywood movie with big stars. It's quite the contrary, with the exception of the 'big star' part. 'Everybody's Fine' is a deep, subtle and human drama about a widower trying to connect to his children after sensing them drifting away.The little things of everyday life, things we barely notice most of the time like the passenger sitting next to us in a train or the importance parents give to things that their children own, the things that they look at with pride because it's something their kid achieved, are depicted so sincerely in this picture. 'Everybody's Fine' holds nostalgic value too. A parent can easily relate to the flashbacks the father has of his children.Moreover the execution is brilliant. The visuals, especially of the cross country locations are stunning. The score fits very well as it's effectively underused. The contrast between the flashback and present-day scenes are well displayed. I'm only confused a little about the Robert character. I'd assumed him to be the eldest but in the flashback scenes he looks younger than Amy and Rosie when Rockwell clearly looks older than Beckinsale and Barrymore.The enviable cast is terrific. Sam Rockwell, Kate Beckinsale and Drew Barrymore are superb in supporting roles. They are very believable as Frank's children and they downplay their parts with skill. Cameos by the likes of Scott Cohen, Katherine Moennig and Melissa Leo are an interesting choice for the actors. Leo particularly stands out as the hard working truck driver who lost her husband. She's pretty much Frank's counterpart. Needless to say, it is Robert de Niro who carries the film with an understated performance. His minimal expressions and gestures speak volumes. His subtlety allows us to see a different side of the actor who is generally recognized for his rather vocal performances.'Everybody's Fine' is more than a fine film. I'd recommend to watch it with your family, especially parents because of its nostalgic value and to remind each other how much they are appreciated. Tell your kids how proud you are of them and tell your parents that you love them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Everybody's Fine (2009)' never goes anywhere that you're not expecting, but that's fine. I've found that I really enjoy films like these; ones that, gently and amusingly, make you sit back and think about life. I guess I'm at the age when you have to start thinking about where you want to steer your next fifty years. 'Dan in Real Life (2007)' was another one that got me in that mood, a lighthearted, good-natured comedy about how life likes to manoeuvre you onto unfamiliar roads. Rather than taking place at the beginning of a love story, 'Everybody Fine' picks up at the end of one. A year after his beloved wife's death, Frank Goode (Robert De Niro) just wants to have his family around the same table once again. When all four children cancel for the holidays, Frank hits the road to visit them one-by-one, coming to realise with every mile the substantial distance ? both literal and emotional ? that has separated he and his children all these years.The children's affection towards Frank is undoubted, but it's hidden behind a veil of deception. Amy (Kate Beckinsale) conceals a problematic home-life; Robert (Sam Rockwell) says he's an orchestral conductor, when he's really a humble percussionist; Rosie (Drew Barrymore) takes Frank to somebody else's apartment. Even when he surprises them in their home cities, there's an invisible wall between Frank and his children, every exchange unfolding like a wary telephone conversation. De Niro underplays the role nicely, a comically endearing old man, but one shrewd enough to discern that his kids are not being straight with him. At the film's emotional climax, director Kirk Jones uses an unorthodox but effective cinematic technique: he seats Frank around the dinner table with his children as he remembers them, as children, and only in this guise is Frank able to confront them about his worries and fears. 'Everybody's Fine' is a remake of a film by Giuseppe Tornatore (best known for the wonderful 'Cinema Paradiso (1988)'), which will no doubt be worth tracking down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good but not really a comedy (nor was the original)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the Giuseppe Tornatore film of 20 years ago stars Robert DeNiro. It concerns the story of a retired man who is disappointed that his children won't visit him so he goes to visit them instead. Walking into their lives unannounced he finds that contrary to what they say everyone isn't fine.What was billed as a feel good comedy is actually not. yes its funny at time, but the depiction of life is rather sad. Is it any wonder the film played about a week in theaters before showing up on DVD a scant 8 weeks later? Its not a bad film. Its just a heavier drama than most people expect when they see it.I liked it, but there is a reason its been sitting on my DVD pile for weeks and has been watched in pieces, its the sort of film that you have to be in the mood for. I'm not sure I was in the mood, but I soldiered on. Well acted and well made its a slice of life thats well like a slice of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in a plane while on a business trip. I did not know about this movie at all, simply watched whatever the airline put on the screen but this happened to be most difficult movie to finish without an emotion. I was sitting with my colleagues (female), so it was truly hard to hide my emotions (and tears) from them as I watched the movie, because I realized I had so much of expectations from my kids who are still under 5 (yeah, you see!), but in the end this movie puts me into shoes of DeNiro's role, so it was really hard to keep my tears because it felt so true and so real to me how this poor father felt deep in his heart. It's a really good movie, I am planning to watch it with my wife again, hope everyone has kids will enjoy this and think of their kids differently. We should let our kids grow on their ways and face the world in their ways and we have to just appreciate and enjoy having kids and seeing them growing with their dreams and live in their world. Good work for everyone in this movie. It's great movie I ever saw this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine movie , well Directed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dealing rather plainly with a very important theme, Everybody's Fine is a nice Family Drama. Robert De Niro steers the ship in this one. The storyline is familiar but the simple treatment it receives at the hand of the Direction team makes the movie easy to follow, interesting, direct and also quite effective. The best part about the movie is that it touches upon some very real issues and aspects of Life. Inspite of the fact that the movie lacks humorous content , it is not a movie which rubs on negativity on to the viewer.Like I said earlier it deals with how things really are in life and tries to dismantle both melodrama as well as unnecessarily dark impressions.The Actors have done a fine Job. May not be exceptional but they all fit beautifully into the movie. In my eyes a true post modern art piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert De Niro is Frank Goode, retired from a job where he made vinyl-coated wire for telephone transmissions. By his reckoning he made a million feet (or was it a million miles?) of wire to help pay for his children to have a better life.Frank's wife of many years had died only 8 months earlier, and now he had invited each of his 4 grown children back home so they could all sit at the table again, and visit face-to-face. He shops for the best steaks, the best wines, and even buys a new BBQ pit. But one-by-one he gets messages that each one cannot come, for various reasons.So the takes things for what they are, and decides to visit and surprise each one. So off to New York where his son David is a painter. But David is not home. Then it is off to Chicago to visit Amy, she is home but there is a strange dynamic and Frank is told they are too busy to host him that week. Off to Denver to see Robert, the "conductor" but who turns out just to be a percussionist. Then it is off to Las Vegas to see his dancer daughter, Rosie.Drew Barrymore is Rosie, Kate Beckinsale is Amy, Sam Rockwell is Robert, and we see little of him, but Austin Lysy is David.I like this movie a lot. I have 5 grown children between 33 and 40 and I can relate to Frank. When your children grow up you naturally remember a lot of how they were when they were young, but as adults they become quite different, and you have to deal with it. All Frank wants his children to do is tell him the truth, but they do their best to put up the face they think their dad wants to see.SPOILERS: It turns out David, Frank's favorite it seems, still was getting mixed up in drugs. We learn that he is in Mexico, arrested, and they believe he might have swallowed some drugs to avoid being caught with them, and he dies. Amy and her husband had been separated, but she didn't tell Frank the truth. Rosie works as a hostess in a Las Vegas hotel, but tells Frank that she is a star dancer, has a baby, and might be bisexual. And so it goes, the 3 surviving children do go home for Christmas, and they begin to be honest with dad.July 2012 edit: I just saw it again, I enjoyed it even more this viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Genuinely Heartfelt Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you look at my past reviews, you'll notice that I have reviewed a grand total of 3-4 films. I don't usually enjoy complimenting or slandering a movie, regardless of how useless or how enjoyable it was. This movie, however, deserved my accolades and motivated me to do actually log onto this site and comment on it. As a precursor to the review, this movie was the only movie that has ever brought tears to my father's eyes in his entire life. I've only seen the man with tears in his eyes once before-- when his mother passed away.You can see what the premise of the movie is about from the other details, so I won't harp on that. What I will say is that the actors and the plot intertwined with one another so well that you could tell these people were personally inspired by the story in some way. You could even say that they were genuinely passionate about their acting (and honestly, can we really say that Hollywood is really passionate about anything in a non- lustful way?). I was extremely skeptical of De Niro in this role (and Barrymore as one of the daughters). But seriously, everything from the heartless bum in Vegas to the stubborn tenacity of the old man that was De Niro, this film really gets you going. Realizing that you may have some general biases for the actors before you come into the scene, realize this: I have NEVER seen such stellar acting from Barrymore, De Niro, or Beckinsale ever in my life. For these "A list" celebrities, that says a lot (especially with De Niro after seeing him in Awakenings). Now, with regard to the plot, there were some things that really surprised me and made me evaluate my own life. As you may have been able to surmise, I am close to my family so I did not expect to be moved by this. However, I felt that the main characters were echoing a piece of who I am in their own way. During and after the film, I even began evaluating my own lifestyle, my own circumstances if you will. I never thought I'd say this, but after watching this movie, I think most of my life decisions were wrong.At the end of this all, I really could not shower this movie with more praise. I guess the last thing that you will benefit from knowing about my father is that English is not his primary language. And for a movie not produced in his native language to communicate in a way that tugs at his heart without him understanding the dialog... That just says the world about this film; truly, it does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>thoughtful family drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With baby boomers moving ever closer to the age of retirement, an increasing number of mainstream American movie makers have taken it upon themselves to deal with the issue ("The Savages" being probably the most notable example).The most recent effort is Kirk Jones' "Everybody's Fine," a touching family drama featuring Robert De Niro as a recently widowed retiree whose four adult children have spent their entire lives keeping secrets from him in an effort not to upset or disappoint him. When the kids can't seem to make the time to come and see him, Frank Goode heads out on the road to pay each of them a surprise visit. However, Frank doesn't always receive the welcome or the news he was hoping for when he arrives at each of his destinations. One of his kids, Robert (Sam Rockwell), is a supposedly successful orchestra conductor who is actually just a drummer in the ensemble; another, Amy (Kate Beckinsale), is a high-paid executive whose successful marriage and happy family life are not all that they appear to be on the surface; Rosie (Drew Barrymore) is a dancer in Las Vegas who has a child with her lesbian lover; and, most disturbingly, David is an artist who's currently in jail in Mexico on drug-smuggling charges. Frank is blissfully unaware of most of these details of his children's lives, having been sheltered from the facts by both them and his late wife who felt it better not to let him in on the truth.Though it suffers a bit from its episodic structure and its tendency towards the lugubrious, "Everybody's Fine," which is a remake of an Italian film from 1990, is a generally moving and understated look at parent/child relationships in the 21st Century. With insightfulness and sensitivity, it explores the various and sundry aspects of the issue: adult children who are too busy to make time for their aging parents; parents who place burdensome and unrealistic expectations on their children; parents and children struggling to find something to talk about after a lifetime of never really communicating in an open and honest manner. And, throughout, the movie does a nice job of capturing the discomfiture and awkwardness of strained family relationships.De Niro effectively blanks himself into the role of a soft-spoken but gregarious man forced to confront some of the mistakes he's made in his life - and he is matched by a first-rate cast. There are also some impressively mounted scenes, such as a bizarre but strikingly realistic encounter with a young man in a railway station and a hallucinatory dream sequence late in the film that crystallizes much of the movie's purpose and theme for the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My finer and not so finer points of "Everybody's Fine"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The so-called "holiday" flick (it was promoted as a Holiday movie even though there is not much of Holidays in there) "Everybody's Fine" is fine by me, even though I have seen finer (why does my wife say that same phrase to me every once in a while?). Robert DeNiro stars as Frank Goode, a recent widower who wants to reconnect with his adult offsprings who reside in various parts of the country. When each of the little (or maybe not so little) "Goodes" cannot visit Frank for Thanksgiving, Mr. Goode decides to take the Goode road trip by visiting them in their various residencies, unannounced. Goode then discovers that each one of them might be hiding some secrets about their lives, and suspects major lies from each one; maybe Frank should not have let them see "Pinocchio" so many times when they were kids. The Goode Junior lineup include: Kate Beckinsale playing the successful advertising executive Amy who resides in Chicago with hubbie and child, Sam Rockwell playing the percussionist Robert residing in New York with drummie and bile, and Drew Barrymore playing the showgirl Rosie living in Vegas with ?. (hey, what happens in Vegas in a movie, stays in Vegas in a movie, so I cannot reveal). Oh, and there is another Goode Jr. who just might have taken the downward-spiral "drug road" more traveled these days. All the performances are fine, but I again I have seen finer from these seasoned thespian veterans. Even though Kate Beckinsale does not have to act much to be very fine by me! What a stunner she continues to be! DeNiro does get the Finest Acting Performance in "Everybody's Fine" because?.. he is Robert Deniro for God's sake!! Writer-Director's Kirk Jones family-bonding tale did hit a few fine points especially in the scenes when Frank interacts with other travelers and city dwellers during his journey; the diner scene with Frank and the 94 year-old grandfather recalling how all his children have abandoned him is priceless. Where I thought that Kirk hit the verbose downslopes was with his sappy &amp; formulaic screenplay in the scenes with Frank and his children that definitely lacked tact finesse. Sorry Mr. Jones, but you are not yet a Captain Kirk in the filmmaking industry. "Everybody's Fine" might not be for everybody, but it is still marginally fine enough to give it a try. But again, there are finer films out there! *** Average</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody's Fine: Bleak and Touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another addition to the recent spate of independent films featuring big names that have found their way to my screen, Everybody's Fine brought with it certain assumptions on my part. Such films are far too often marred by over-sentimentality, an almost boring predictability, and, despite their independent status, Hollywood-worthy endings. Fears of such flaws filled me as I sat down to watch.After decades of hard blue-collar work in service of his family, Frank Goode is a retired widower, adapting slowly to life alone with his grown up kids spread across the country. When they each excuse themselves from a planned family gathering, the aging Frank decides to surprise them with a visit. Unbeknownst to him, their absence was not entirely the product of reluctance.With the aforementioned potential pitfalls of independent cinema utilising big stars, as well as the rarity of De Niro's excellences over the last number of years, I envisioned this film as an exercise in mediocrity. It wasn't long before this was forgotten, the genuineness and believability of De Niro's character well expressed and nothing short of transfixing. It's not hard to see your own father in this man: the sacrifices; the hardships; the enduring love. The beginning of his journey, in which he regales strangers with tales of his life, recalls every old man on every train I've ever travelled on. There are some oddly placed moments of attempted comedy here and there, best left forgotten. The ergonomic telephone wires, normally avoided by cameras for their ugliness, are celebrated here, framing the landscape and adding a neat network and nice stream of imagery to the film's narrative. The charming and heartwarming kindly old widower scenes are punctuated by brief discourses into deeper and darker areas which question various elements of paternity and of wanting the best of your children. These slowly escalate in dramatic terms, Goode coming to realise his flaws as a parent and how pushing in one direction could drive someone in another. The sweetness of De Niro here works effortlessly, contrasting with the underflowing emotions of the film and creating one of the veteran actor's best performances in years. Rockwell and co provide strong support, working together to give a believable portrait of this widespread family. The concluding series of scenes are, rather fittingly, simultaneously bleak and touching, giving us an ending devoid of saccharine sentimentality and tacky tradition, and refusing to neatly tie a bow over a pretty package.Managing to neatly avoid the traps to which much of its ilk fall prey, Everybody's Fine delivers solid entertainment with an edge of emotional depth which ought to keep most people happy. De Niro is the best thing about this for sure, as is the film the best thing for him at this point in his career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, And though they are with you yet they belong not to you." --Khalil GibranA petulant, demanding, working-stiff of a father learns too late that wanting a better life for his four children is a feeble basis upon which to become a successful parent. This moral is particularly relevant in today's economy, when children of the 70's and 80's are facing the hard reality that they may never achieve the level of "success" their parents enjoyed.This is a theme that has been around for a long time. "Ordinary People" and "The Dead Poet's Society" come readily to mind but, unlike those two great films, this one is told from the point-of-view of the parent. That role is played masterfully by one of the great actors of our age, Robert De Niro. If his performance doesn't grip you by the throat and threaten to never let go--he's in nearly every scene--I'd be surprised.I have two adult children who live a thousand miles away. They were born in the late 70's. In their relatively short lives, they have both seen more pain and faced more struggle than I ever did. Sometimes we all seem to be dancing on the edge of a cliff, blindfolded. This film reminds us of the fragility of young egos and the sacred duty of every parent to heed Gilbran's wisdom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The above summary being said, lets get on with the review.The DVD box cover &amp; the trailer would make you thinkthis thoughtful film would be a laugh filled comedy.Everybody's Fine is not that type of comedy. How often do we reply this titles sentiment to people who ask how our family is doing. Sometimes we do not want to tell the truth for many assorted reasons,even to a parent we will say --everybody's fine.Kirk Jones wrote &amp; directed this movie. it is only his third film (in an over 10 year period) He was responsible for the delightful 'Waking Ned Devine' &amp; a so-so Emma Thompson film. This time he has recreated an Italian film directed by Guiseppie Tornatorro, which starred Marcello Mastroianni. Robert DeNiro stars this time &amp; like the original star he is excellent.He is a recent widower trying to reconnect with his 4 adult children. For various reasons this family never really connected with each other.They all like each other, but cannot &amp; probably never did properly connect.The movie is somewhat sad but does make you think about people you know, including your own family. Did we always tell the truth when asked how is every body. when we know the truth may be distressing to the one who asked.I waited nearly 24 hours before writing this, I had to think of what comedy really is. ITS LIFE &amp; sometimes it may not be really funny.Kate Beckinsale &amp; Drew Barrymore are his 2 daughters, Sam Rockwell is his oldest son. All 3 are excellent.The other son, who really is the crux of the movie only appears very briefly.Brendan Sexton 111 has a brief but telling role, he is slowly becoming a top actor &amp; may become a star soon..The film is very well made, My rating is not too high as the script is 'somewhat 'hokumish'. The late great Frank Capra wrote hokum as well.The small song score here fits perfectly with whats going on.Rating: *** (out of 4) 82 points(out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the 70's, the 80's and the 90's, the mere presence of Robert De Niro in a movie was a guarantee of quality and artistic value.But, for some reason ($), during the 2000's, this prestigious actor wasted his huge talent in horrible comedies (like Analyze That and Meet the Fockers) and pathetic thrillers (like Hide and Seek and Righteous Kill), which showed how low a Hollywood star can fall when he limits to obey the requirements from his bank account.But now, Everybody's Fine looks like a positive augury for his future career.Well, I do not wanna exaggerate.De Niro clearly brings his best performance in many years in this movie; but compared with the work he did during the rest of the decade, that does not mean too much.The trailers try to sell Everybody's Fine as a comedy, but the film is in fact another affable familiar drama with pre-fabricated conflicts and an obligatory bittersweet ending.Fortunately, screenwriter Kirk Jones (who was also the director) had the common sense of moderating the sentimentality of the movie; I will not deny some moments sin of manipulation and artificial drama, but the film has a generally honest tone.By the way, Everybody's Fine is a remake of the acclaimed Italian film Stanno Tuti Bene, and I suspect the fans from the original will be disappointed for some changes which were made to it (for example, the references to the opera made in the original film were replaced by an obvious analogy between the telephone cables and the communication links the main character wants to have with his sons).As I mentioned before, De Niro brings a good performance in this movie, and I also liked the developments from Sam Rockwell (who was criminally ignored for his monumental performance in Moon) and Drew Barrymore, even though I thought her character was not very well written.The only member of the cast which seems out of place is Kate Beckinsale, who feels too "glamourous" for her role; I think an actress with the looks of a normal housewife instead of the ones of a Hollywood star should have been chosen.In summary, Everybody's Fine may not be highly memorable, and it has various fails (besides of the ones I already mentioned, I think it should have been a bit deeper), but it also offers various positive elements, and I think it is appropriate for having a good time.And I think that thing makes it worthy of a recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro's best in years!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I have watched a lot of films with emotional content, this one I must say touched me the most.This is a story of a recent widower i.e. De Niro's character Frank Goode, who embarks on a trip to meet his four grownup children, in order to surprise them and spend some quality time with them around Christmas, the reason being he was turned down by his children to visit him for Christmas. During his visits he feels the unusual awkwardness between him and his children, he feels that they are not as close to him as they were with his wife. The children used to communicate better with their mother when she was alive, they used to call her often to share their feelings with her, in turn the mother used to tell only the good news to Frank and never told the bad news regarding her children. Frank always thought that everything is fine with his children, all settled, successful and happy, which was clearly no the case so, Frank sets out for this emotional journey to find out everything for himself.This was a totally character driven story, so more was done to show the inner feelings of the character than the content itself, direction was good and the supporting cast was fine, but the real gem in the film was the acting of Robert De Niro, he nailed it. The scene where he is told about David is where i had tears in my eyes, also the scene where he is given one of the paintings made by his son David, he played the character so well that you feel for him all the way, he was somewhat strict father but now he is much more softer, his love for his children and their well being strongly comes out, when he takes the trip in the first place although told otherwise by his doctor.Overall great film to watch, specially De Niro's performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failure to communicate: A New De Niro Unveiled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EVERYBODY'S FINE is, of course a misnomer: it is that too often used phrase to cover up or at least distract the questioner from the realities that are painful. This fine little jewel of a film is a remake of the Italian 1900 STANNO TUTTO BENE written by Massimo De Rita, Tonino Guerra an Giuseppe Tornatorre. Here that story about a Sicilian father trying to reconnect with his children has been adapted successfully by Kirk Jones who also directs. Some may say the adaptation is less than the original, but for audiences in this country it is a more relevant story, and with the cast of characters selected to transform the tale into an American one it is successful. Frank Goode (Robert De Niro in a compelling performance) is a recent widower, caring for his house in Elmira, NY without very much connection to his four children who have gone into the world 'to become famous' (in Frank's mind). Frank decides to spiff up his home and invite the children now living in all parts of the country to his home for a reunion. None can come, with excuses that indicate that life outside Frank's world is more important and constraining. Much against his physician's orders (Frank spent his life making PVC insulation for telephone wires and has work related pulmonary complications) Frank sets out to surprise each of his children with a visit. He visits Amy (Kate Beckinsale), an advertising executive creating corny ads for unimportant customers; Robert (Sam Rockwell) who just plays percussion in the symphony rather than being the expected conductor; Rosie (Drew Barrymore) who instead of becoming a famous dancer has a gig in a Las Vegas show; David who was supposed to become a famous artist is simply not at home. Frank realizes that he never really connected with his children except through his wife's presence, and while the children love their father, they feel they could never live up to his expectations....and haven't. The painful truth comes when the 'family' discusses the fourth child David's status. The truths that are overwhelmingly obvious are that even in families we keep secrets that are really wounds that need tending. Throughout the film Frank takes photos with a 'film camera' - an indication of how out of touch Frank has become - of each child as well as signs that suggest they are more than they are. His moments on his various rides across the country to meet the kids reveal that it is even difficult to successfully relate to those fellow travelers on the various buses and trains. Robert De Niro offers an understated performance that is Oscar worthy, creating a character who will live in memory for years to come. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything's fine with 'Everybody's Fine'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Everybody's Fine, Robert De Niro plays Frank Goode, an aging widower who invites his four adult kids for Christmas. He buys himself a grill, gets the best wine, and prepares everything. However, when he finds out that none of them could make it, he takes it upon himself to give a surprise visit to each of them, and see how they're doing despite their assertion that they're doing "just fine." He takes the trains and buses as he cannot fly.I do love road trip movies. You can always visit famous landmarks, but sometimes you appreciate the small areas a little more just because you remember a scene from a movie. While this isn't that kind of movie, I'm reasserting the fact I like road movies. As I always say, road trip movies aren't so much about the physical transportation as it is about the inner journey.Robert De Niro, who has often played tough guys, gives a stand out performance in this film as the aging father who wasn't as close to his kids as his late wife was. At his age, he probably shouldn't be traveling alone, but I think this was also why it added so much poignancy to it. His portrayal feels very real?like most fathers, he wants the best for his children, despite the fact that they might not be as they seem. His performance brings the movie up a notch from being just good. The beautiful Kate Beckinsale (with fine American accent) and the cute Drew Barrymore as his daughters, Amy and Rosie, all turn in fine performances as well as Sam Rockwell, a musician with a bit of a chip on his shoulder. As the story unfolds, he finds out they're keeping truths from him, which one can guess from the title.The film really hit home for me, which is saying something. I've always found the best humor to be found in real life, no matter how hokey they can be for some. Kirk Jones' tight direction and script proved this, and every scene brought a little something to the story and everyone had their own voice and personality. There even were subtle moments I found myself laughing out loud that I noticed others didn't quite get. That's not to say this movie is a comedy, although funny things do happen. Admittedly, I'm at the age much like the adult children in this film. Many of their thoughts and things they go through are pretty similar to my own, and my parents are quite similar to Frank, even the way he looks. This film won't be for everybody and the really young ones may find it dull. I loved the ironic touches. There were even some great dramatic moments I thought were quite powerful. Yes, it's also a bit of a tearjerker, but it all feels true to life, and more importantly, deserved.Unfortunately, I haven't seen the original Italian version of this film, which is highly considered by many, and now I wished I had seen it, as many critics who didn't like this film have been comparing this to the previous version. I feel like one of those American critics who hailed The Departed as the greatest movie ever who never saw the original Hong Kong version called Infernal Affairs (which I personally enjoyed a little more). Nevertheless, the enjoyment of any film is affected by all kinds of factors, whether personal or otherwise, and I enjoyed this film greatly, at least enough to give this film **** out of **** stars.You can find more of my review updates on http://twitter.com/d_art</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from what one considers a "dramedy"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dramedy? You mean to tell me that this movie is classified as a dramedy? That is simply unbelievable. Every single movie ever made has lines that are comical, but you don't see labels such as horredy pop up. Everybody's Fine is a full-fledged drama. There is NOTHING funny about this movie; in fact, it is one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen. Robert De Niro plays the main character, Frank Goode who's just had all four of his kids cancel on him. Against the word of his doctor, Frank travels around the country to visit his kids one by one, from David in New York to Rosie in Las Vegas. With each trip, the story gets more and more depressing as Frank starts to come to terms with the fact that not only did his children lie to avoid getting together with him, but they've lied about their lives from their occupations to their homes. After he's done with his visits comes the whirlwind of horrible events that top off the sheer bleakness of the film and that includes an ending that doesn't quite fit.And yet, I wouldn't call it a bad movie, nor would I call it stereotypical. Of all the Christmas dramedies I've seen, they've all involved relatively wacky, yet happy people with small-to-medium problems that seem bigger than they really are, yet are always resolved in the end. Sure, the ending of Everybody's Fine might seem a little stale; however, the five Goode's are a very realistic family that go through turbulence's that are far from small problems. Frank's feeling of distance between himself and his kids is as down-to-Earth a problem that I have seen in movies and truly hits close to home. Are some elements recycle? Sure, but that comes with damn near every movie you watch these days.All in all, Everybody's Fine is a good, yet extremely depressing look at the story of a father who is just trying to reconnect and become closer to his kids. Robert De Niro gives an outstanding performance, so much in fact that it takes away from the work of Barrymore, Rockwell and Beckinsale who all gave worthwhile performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never wrote a review for IMDb before, this is the first time. And I felt like I should, after watching this movie. Even though I'm turning 20 next month and I have a brother who is 5 years older than me, I understood De Niro's character situation, his feelings, and also understood even better the situations of his children, played by Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell. This movie made me cry, not because it's sad or anything, but I felt familiarized with the story been told. It teaches you something that we're already learned,(well, most of the people) but it's always good to remember: family it's the most important thing that is given to us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Touching Film, with a towering performance by De Niro...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Everybody's Fine' is a remake of the Giuseppe Tornatore film Stanno Tutti Bene, that is written and directed by Kirk Jones. Now, I don't know how Giuseppe's film was all I know is that 'Everbody's Fine' is a decent, touching &amp; emotional film is all respects. It's rich in emotions, performances &amp; direction.'Everybody's Fine' tells the story of a father, who after losing his wife decides to meet his 4-grown-up children. A worthy idea indeed! Kirk Jones succeeds in his mission, and keeps you hooked most of the time. The penultimate 25-minutes are highly-emotional &amp; moving. Even the strong-minded would get moist eyed in those portions. The Writer- Director deserves all the brownie points possible.De Niro is not an actor, he's above that. It's Frank Goode who we follow in this journey, not an acting legend. De Niro doesn't make only Cinema &amp; his fans proud, but every human-being alive. Coming to other performances, Kate Beckinsale looks as gorgeous as it can be &amp; delivers a nuanced performance. Drew Barrymore is very, very good. This easily ranks amongst her better works. Sam Rockwell is, as always, excellent. Melissa Leo leaves a mark in a cameo.All said n done, 'Everybody's Fine' is a must watch! De Niro fans, this is something we've got to Cherish. Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is great! i mean, De Niro really represented his character. Throughout the movie my attention was captivated by Frank. Every single movement he made, the way he was speaking reminded me of my dad. He was such a gentleman; he could read his children when he knew something was wrong just like he knew they were all making up excuses not to get together in the 1st place. He cares a lot about his children, exactly like my dad does. It really is an awesome movie.It kept me motivated and captioned. I cried-i cant lie- it had a bid effect on me. Thanks to the producer, realisator, executives, actors, and every other people who participated in the realization of such a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im not fond of family dramas or sentimental films. The only reason why i felt like watching it was it having De Niro and Drew Barrymore in it. But the actual film was lot more than having them in it. I loved each and every scene of this film. excellent casting, excellent choreography, excellent direction. everything in this film is too fine. I got to see a wonderful performance by De Niro. The Nostalgia is so well pictured. the main beauty of the film is we get the feeling that we know the characters personally or will find someone we know in these wonderfully done characters.Some scenes are still playing before my eyes. Kirk Jones have done a great job. Its definitely a 'must-watch' film. Do watch. You guys will love this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know 2 or 3 months ago I saw the trailer of this movie, but I was sure that in January or in February I would watch it. There were a lot of reasons for me. First of all-Robert De Niro, Sam Rockwell, Kate Beckinsale and Drew Berrymore. I'm a big fan of DE NIRO and Sam Rockwell and have watched almost all their movies and I was not going to miss this one. Secondary, maybe you'll laugh at me, but the fact is I often estimate the movie by the poster and the first poster was like "EVERYBODY'S FINE" without any pictures. Just a two words on a white paper. And I like it, but I never could imagine that I would give this movie 9 points, I couldn't imagine the impression after movie, satisfaction after watching. The music was very pure and beautiful. De Niro made one of his bests. Drew Berrymore said the most beautiful "OK" I have ever heard. Maybe you think I'm a little crazy, but not. I'm in a normal conditions and responsible for all my words. So, being a big fan of real movies which tell us the real stories or something which is similar to real stories, I recommend to everybody watch this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love my mom!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I been delaying this movie, since it got out last year. And I decided to watch it during my summer vacation two days before my visit to my mom in my home town. My hometown is not a big city, its not full of excitement and you can't find busy people there who are too much equipped with work, jobs or businesses. It's a simple town. I left my town and moved to a metropolitan city to pursue a good study and afterward a good career. I went so busy, I couldn't make it to visit my mom even once a year. I have this huge apartment and my mom use to visit me, every alternate month.while I was viewing this movie, i got this enormous respect and love that i almost forgot about my mom and I cried. I forgot, literally forgot how much effort, potential my mom put on me to make the man I am, right now. I am successful, doing great strides in my job. What a jerk of me, that i never thought of visiting my mom, to make her happy with my presence. What could she possibly want from me; nothing. Just my presence to sit by her in the dinning room and have a dinner with her.Parents are a huge blessing of God, they don't need anything, not your money, not your fame, nothing just your presence when they feel aloof. it is my request to every person who are so busy and equipped with work, please take time to visit your moms and dads. They need you.I wish if i were the jury of Oscars; I would have probably given Oscar to the movie, to the director and of course to Robert De Nero.Great movie. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Found It Utterly Depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not at all what I thought it would be. I was expecting a light-hearted family movie, but what I ended up with was a depressing tale of a widower who sets off to visit his 4 children, all who have grown up and away from him. What he doesn't know is that all of them are hiding a secret about the most troubled child, David, who has been arrested in Mexico and subsequently set to a hospital for an overdose. When he visits the children, they all give excuses as to why they cannot spend time with him, which is really awful.I did not really enjoy this movie. I found it rather dull and the scenery too perfect (watch it and you'll know what I mean; nothing is out of place). I don't believe this is one of Robert De Niro's greatest performances at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I watched 2009' Everybody's fine, starring Robert Deniro, well was it fine well yeah I guess. This is not a movie I will rant and rave about. It has an all star cast and an indie feel to it, and isn't too sappy. I liked it, I didn't love it but felt it was decent. It is a road tale, and a story about a family becoming closer, and grieving, and dying, and living, and sometimes hiding our true selves from the ones we most love. This is a remake of a very highly regarded Italian film I hope to see someday, I think it would be nice to compare the two. As far as should you see it, well I guess if you are not the sensitive type you can skip, I personally think it is a good date movie, it has things that appeal to both sexes, and can almost cause a tear to well up at times, but you know I am too much a man for that to happen. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a drama about adult children lying to their dad because they don't want to hurt or disappoint him. The most notable part of the movie is that several of the actors are big names, the director must be friends with all of them. The Dad, Frank, invites his 4 children home and they all cancel on him at last minute. So, he decides to go on a road trip and visit them all. All are keeping secrets from him because it was their mom they told everything to. It was kind of sad to see this guy's kids treat him this way.FINAL VERDICT: A family drama that's OK, but not really good enough that I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything really is just fine about this movie. De Niro gives one of his best performances in years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody's fine is a terrific drama that not only manages to move the viewer, but provide them with an important message as well. It has a big-name cast, but they really give most of the leeway to De Niro's character here. Throughout the movie, they lean on him and we learn so much about his character. He's over-protective a bit, he worries constantly about his kids, and the overwhelming sense that his kids are lying to him. It's all beautifully developed throughout the movie, as we watch De Niro go on a journey to spend needed time with his kids, as he battles obstacles along the way. I personally believe family is very important, no matter how old you start to get or the fact that your growing up, so this one really hit home for me. The most heartbreaking scene for me in this movie had to be the subway scene where De Niro has a misfortune of helping a subway thug, I won't spoil it but it will really hit a place in your heart that hurts. I heard mixed reviews about this movie, but I'm happy to say this is a drama that I loved, and will watch again.Performances. Robert De Niro isn't quite Oscar worthy here, but he's very close to it. He's delivered many strong performances over the years, but this is one of his best in ages. His controlled, yet emotional and heartfelt performance was a treat to watch. Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore and Kate Beckinsale are fine as the kids, but they don't have that much to do.Bottom line. I think this is one of the most enjoyable films of 2009. It's heartbreaking, it's funny and very involving. I give this the highest recommendation I can give.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Box makes you think this is a Comedy...If Comedies make you Cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cover of the box shows DeNiro, Beckinsale and Barrymore smiling and happy. The title "Everybody's Fine" makes you think...well, that as suggested, everything will be fine. Oh no...not fine. Not fine at all. If fine is somebody peeing on your fresh vanilla ice cream scoop, then this movie is fine. The acting was quite superb, but this story makes drowning kittens look like a happily ever after. At least cats can be resuscitated in a comedic fashion by twirling them above your head by their tails like a lasso. (The centrifugal force pushes the water out.) Though, even that didn't work with this movie. I tried. My real gripe here is that this shouldn't have been marketed as a family comedy. There wasn't anything to laugh at. "A heartwarming film that will move you to laughter and tears." I watched this at the end of the night to get a good smile and a couple of chuckles out before I went to bed. Now I just feel vacant and depressed. Yes, DeNiro was awesome, but there should be some warning on the box that the "heartwarming moving to laughter" segment of the film is only about four and a half minutes long while the rest pulls your heart strings through the venom that binds this sad family. Most misleading billing of a film as a comedy since Fast Food Nation. Not saying it sucked...but damn if I don't feel like crying.</fullReview>

The performance of Rober Di Nero was great , he makes you feel with the character in every attitude , you feel how kind and honest is this old man , you feel his suffer and his care about the only thing is left for him his children.The movie gave me a chance to see the life in parents eyes , visits and family occasions its may be silly for me or not important but it means a lot for them . Its make you think about your relation ship with your parents , are you giving them there rights , are you taking care of them ,are you caring about them as they care about you.For people who didn't watch this movie yet i recommend it for them , it deserved to be watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Harm, No Foul. Amiable but typical dysfunctional family drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The set up here is that Robert DeNiro finally plays old (think Jack Nicholson in About Schmidt) in the form of Frank Goode who sets out on a trip to visit each of his four adult children. This is spurred by a funny and yet sad beginning where they all cancel on a planned trip to which he has devoted quite a bit of preparation. Like so many movie travelers before him, he learns valuable lessons and hidden truths (read that with as much sincerity or sarcasm as you like).I generally would recommend this movie if only because DiNero does such a good job playing the man of a bygone era. The sort who worked hard to provide financially but was disconnected from the emotional life of the family. His wife is dead and he is a bit adrift when he begins to suspect his children are never really comfortable opening up to him. Some specific details that are well done- he has the oldest answering machine imaginable, no cell phone, and assails strangers with pictures of his children. Sam Rockwell, Kate Beckinsale and Drew Barrymore play the three children we do meet in vignette like scenes that are in my opinion too short. Although there are some funny moments there is sadness running through the movie because Frank's children are keeping a secret involving the unknown fate of the fourth who struggles with a hinted at drug problem. In the end the family is brought together and the DVD box describes this as "heart warming". I never really got there. Something was missing and "it" was made apparent by it's absence. Before I forget, Kate Beckinsale did a good enough job in this movie to be forgiven for the recent train wreck called White Out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the coming attractions that I saw when viewing "The Blind Side" I thought this movie would be a light comedy with some serious issues thrown in. Well the serious issues were thrown in and were non-stop. Really nothing light-hearted about this movie. All of this being said, it carried a great message in today's world and I'm sure many families could relate to it. It is not a movie for children. De Niro is excellent in his role as a father who has just lost his wife and is trying now to get back with his children who are scattered across the country. As he ventures to the town of each child he engages in a separate story about each one. He was doing this because his original goal was to have them all visit him in one place - his home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no real expectations of this movie and was quite pleasantly surprised that it turned out to be a mid week gem. This could make me like Robert de Niro again.I last saw him in the inexcusably bad Righteous Kill where he struggled to convince as a tough guy cop, a role he is quite clearly too old to play. In Everybody's Fine, de Niro makes the brave move of actually playing his age, and he is very good. The basic plot is uncomplicated - a widower is let down over the holiday season when his kids all cancel their visits. So he sets off to visit them instead and begins to realise that he barely knows them - his late wife took care of all the intimate, messy, emotional support of family life. One of the four kids is in hospital in Mexico but none of the other three will tell him what is going on. And not one of them quite lives the life that he thinks they lead.Robert de Niro convinces as the widower, and Drew Barrymore, Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsale hold up their ends as the kids. Sam Rockwell can do no wrong for me anyway, but Beckinsale here was a vast improvement on anything I have ever see her do before. Barrymore is cute but I find her a rather one note actor.Not a great movie but not at all bad, given some of the dross I've seen in 2009</fullReview>

		<fullReview>without giving anything away this movie is basically about the important things in life,in this case reconnecting with family.Robert De Niro plays the lead character who takes a journey to do just that.in between is what happens to him as a person,and how he changes,and how his family changes.De Niro brings a strong performance to the table here,and draws the viewer in to his world and we feel what he feels.Drew Barrymore,Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell all put in good supporting performances,but De Niro is the glue which holds the piece together.this is one of De Niro's better performances in the last couple of years.and the material is also very good.for me,Everybody's Fine is an 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story to touch your heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a father who travels around the country in order to visit his children who all could not make it to a much anticipated family reunion.I thought "Everybody's Fine" is a fluffy festive comedy which actors gather and be merry, and everybody's fine. I was so wrong! In fact this is such a touching story about a recently bereaved man who realises his distance from his four children, and hence tries to reconnect with them. Robert De Niro performs well as a lonely and disappointed father. He makes his character engaging, and makes me feel for his misfortunes and disappointments. The scene where the four young children and the father talk heart to heart is truthful, effective and powerful. The quality of the communication is seldom seen even in real life. The plot provokes much thoughts about the importance of being close to your family, because they are the only family you will ever have. Once they are gone, there's nothing you can do to turn back time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Everybody's Fine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based upon the 1990 Italian film Stanno Tutti Bene, Kirk Jones' Everybody's Fine follows up the very fine contemporary films that had gone past which dealt with the aged and their families, such as Last Chance Harvey starring Dustin Hoffman, and Away from Her starring Gordon Pinsent. Everybody's Fine would work fine as a Thanksgiving or Christmas movie given its theme on the family, but I suppose having a release right about now would be apt as well given the upcoming festive period of the Lunar New Year which has the reunion dinner component, to take stock once again of the ties that bind.There are many aspects to this film that I enjoyed, first and foremost that this is a road movie. I've somehow an affinity toward road movies, in accompanying the character in his journey spanning a finite distant in whatever quest that he embarks on, on whichever decision that he'll make, and the many random encounters with people, some good and bad, which at the end of it all will shape his outlook for the better or worse. While it didn't deliberately pause and turn into a scenic, touristy ride, which I am thankful for and in the hands of lesser directors it will almost be a pimping of the locations, it did enough to flavour the cities that our protagonist journeys to, from New York to Chicago to Denver and all the way West toward Las Vegas.I wonder how many of us out there have dads like Frank, played by Robert De Niro. As the film develops I'm pretty sure his father role falls into the mould of how dads are generally perceived, hence his decision to want to reconnect back directly with his children, who Nature has determined that they connect to him through a proxy, and now that his wife has recently passed away. With dads, they set the expectations that we try to live up to, and the story journeys with Frank to see whether his surprise visit to each of his children, would tally up with what he should or already know. The main worry is of course that the siblings aren't that connected to one another given their individual successful lives, which he will learn about the secrets and the bad things properly shielded from him as well.To some, there will be scenes and techniques here that may seem a little bit contrived, but which I felt rammed home their intended point. For instance, there's always this point of view when Frank meets his children that they'll always remain as his children, not the adults that they already are. It emphasizes how we always remain a child in our parent's eye, no matter how old we become. Then there's the rather amusing scenes where Frank turns photographer with his film camera, and how people nowadays then to be a little less forgiving and irritated each time someone decides to take a picture in an inevitably crowded location, rather than to be gracious about it and allow the photographer to quickly do his own thing. For the curious, there's the end credits where the photo stills got put up, which I thought was a nice touch.At its core the film is about basic communications, where the advent of technology allows us to stay connected, yet apart as well because its pervasiveness and ease of use somehow dumbs down the value of that extra bit of an emotional connection, and as you would have experienced yourself, nothing ever beats face to face meetings, because it's not only about hearing the other party's voice, or seeing them through a computerized web camera, but always about the non-verbal channels the entire communication suite brings about when you talk to someone in their presence.Then there's the top notch casting. We're familiar with how Robert De Niro had gone from wicked gangsters to slapstick comedy without a hitch, and now to add family drama to that list of genres as well. It's practically a one man tour de force as we follow his Frank's journey from start to end, holding up the film together thanks to his wonderful pitch perfect performance. But that's not to discount his co-stars as well, since we have three familiar names playing his children, with the likes of Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale and of course, Sam Rockwell, whom we appreciate what he can do given films like Moon. While they all don't always share the same scene together since Frank's on a road trip to visit all his children, each of them bring something special to the table and portray their characters with sensitivity, each with something to hide to avoid disappointing Dad, who through paternal perception would be able to figure things out as well. You can feel general emotions all around as each child slowly reconnects with their dad, while hiding from him an important fact which they all share.Everybody's Fine is a fine movie indeed, with heartfelt performances, an excellent story filled with superb family drama that you can almost always identify with. It's incredibly moving to the point that you'll be emotionless if you didn't shed a tear in its last act, and yet doesn't go overboard with its melodrama, balancing it perfectly with its themes, and making you reflect upon your own relationships with family, especially with dad. Highly recommended, and also another noteworthy, early addition to the shortlist of the best presented here this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lifetime Movie About Fathers For Old Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somebody lied! Nobody is fine in "Waking Ned Devine" writer &amp; director Kirk Jones' family problem potboiler "Everybody's Fine." This maudlin soap opera about a retired widower who embarks on an odyssey of self-discovery is occasionally contrived, constantly predictable, and thoroughly forgettable. Robert De Niro, Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale, and Sam Rockwell were simply picking up paychecks when they made this mundane melodrama. Nevertheless, "Everybody's Fine" belongs to De Niro and his performance is appropriately solemn. There are no outbursts of the primitive rage that occur in his crime pictures. Jones scatters a modicum of humor throughout this 99-minute, PG-13 yarn, replete with low impact surprises. The overall effect is rather bland. We the audience see everything from the father's perspective. Often we are several steps ahead of Frank because Jones allows us to eavesdrop on telephone conversations among the siblings. The most important character here is the deceased off-screen wife who served as the go-between the father and his children. Ultimately, "Everybody's Fine" amounts to everybody's bored. Too much bathos and not enough humor paralyze this yawner.When we meet Frank Goode (Robert De Niro of "Goodfellas"), he is dutifully vacuuming the carpet in his living room, watering the flowers, and mowing the grass. He has a stone cherub fountain on his lawn and the water spouts from the little guy's peter. Clearly, writer &amp; director Kirk Jones must have adored this statue because he sticks it in three shots. This is as close as "Everybody's Fine" comes to irreverent humor. When none of his four grown-up children can make their annual pilgrimage to his house, Frank--who lost his wife eight months earlier--sets out on a cross-country journey to surprise them. He delivers mysterious envelopes to each that contain an old family photograph of his wife and he when the children were youngsters. Frank's conscientious physician, Dr. Ed (James Murtaugh of "Romeo Is Bleeding") warns his patient that he should settle down in the garden and work on his green thumbs rather than go gallivanting all over the country. Most of the surprises that Frank encounters have already been revealed in the trailer.First, Frank visits his artist son David (Austin Lysy of "Hitch") in New York City, but nobody answers the door. We catch only a couple of glimpses of David, but he figures prominently in this tale. Frank's genuinely troubled son went off to the Big Apple to make a name for himself as an artist. Initially, David wanted only to paint. Frank warns him that painters only paint walls and dogs pee on those walls so David becomes an artist. When Frank cannot hook-up with David, he slips his letter under his door and heads off to his next stop. Second on Frank's list is Amy (Kate Beckinsale of "Underworld"), his oldest daughter. She works as an advertising executive with a spacious office and has a son, Jack (Lucien Maisel of "Fast Track"), but things are far from right at home. Amy and her husband have separated because she caught him cheating on her with another woman. Jack and his father don't get along together during a family dinner. Naturally, Frank has no idea why Jack behaves in such an unfriendly fashion toward his father at the table. Amy has to cut short Frank's visit because she has to fly out of town the following day, and Frank hits the road again. Third on his list is his oldest son, Robert (Sam Rockwell of "The Green Mile"), who Frank mistakenly believes is the conductor of a symphony orchestra. Actually, Robert does nothing more than bang the drum. Robert points out to Frank that he is a conductor in other musical venues, but nobody will pay him to be a conductor. He isn't married and he doesn't have children. Fourth, Frank meets his daughter Rosie (Drew Barrymore of "Whip It") in Las Vegas. He learns later during a surreal scene around a picnic table that Rosie is a lesbian with an infant child. Rosie claims that she works as a casino dancer. Despite his medical condition, Frank has no problem riding trains and buses to see his children. He has a brush with a pathetic mugger at a depot, but he manages nicely by himself. Finally, after he sees Rosie, Frank decides to fly home. Frank has a fear of flying, but he is so upset by all the revelations about his children that he just wants to clear out of town pronto. Once he is aboard the plane, he suffers a heart attack and winds up in the hospital.More often than not, "Everybody's Fine" seems like a made-for-cable Lifetime movie for old guys. Frank learns that he pushed his kids too hard and that they related better to his now defunct wife than to him. It seems that she kept several important things about their children from him. The most imagination thing about "Everybody's Fine" is when Frank sees his grown-up kids, he sees them as they were when they were munchkins, very sweet and adorable. No, Frank doesn't die at fadeout, but the ending qualifies as only semi-happy. Eventually, Frank learns what happened to his talented but troubled youngest son. Nevertheless, three out of four isn't bad. This tame tearjerker is only for those who enjoy wiping their eyes and nose with Kleenex every twenty or so minutes. Incidentally, "Everybody's Fine" is a remake of Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore's "Stanno Tutti Bene" (1990). The cinematography is spectacular and the settings are scenic. Nothing memorable happens in this Miramax underachiever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fine film by De Niro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Everybody's Fine" is another winner for Robert De Niro. Kirk Jones has written and directed this emotional piece with the greatest of sensitivity. It sparkles with deep understanding of human frailty and family interchange. De Niro actually underplays to a great extent. He therefore provides one with a greater sense of reality and pathos. Drew Barrymore plays his daughter, Rosie, with a soft and gentle performance. De Niro plays Frank Goode, a retired widower who is attempting to reconnect with his children. Their only mode of contact has been with his recently deceased wife. One would not miss this film which is now on DVD. Even the credits are worth waiting for. Jones has depicted the ultimate importance of family, and it is a film that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very nice film! A sad drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite a sad film. I guess it's normal to expect negative reviews since most of the movie is filled with sentimental moments. Most of the scenes are heartbreaking. But that is what makes this movie a great movie.It's a touching movie, I enjoyed it very much. And any film with Robert De Niro is worth watching. If you don't want to see a heartbreaking film, then this will not be your kind of movie.Of course, the biggest drawback of the film is its sadness itself. There will be too many depressing moments, and probably that will be too much for a person who just wants to go to enjoy a movie.I loved it, I give it 9/10 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original title was 'Death Fart of the Baby Boomers.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert DeNiro IS Robert DeNiro playing Al Bundy. Seriously: right down to the brown slacks and jacket, DeNiro channels Al Bundy as he hunts down his four grown children to ask them why they didn't bother living up to high standards. In their place he finds several depressed people, several depressing situations, and a lot of acting that would be outclassed by anybody at an amateur acting troupe with far more subtlety and grace. This movie doesn't just give you the jest of the situations, it's amateurish and trite. It's a budgeted version of a student film where the professor stresses 'use the scenery to show isolation. And be overly aware of it.' A good film does things without being apparent. But this film is so overt with its themes of isolation and failure that it becomes ridiculous. It's hard to watch not only because it's depressing, slow, and odiously obvious, but because there's no real point to it. You see DeNiro becoming a parody of himself, you see Beckinsale mentally deciding to do Underworld 4, and you see a bunch of secondary characters excited to be meeting THE DeNiro and trying to be quirky so they can stand out. In short, you have a film that was made cheaply and looks it. It tries to be a slice of life and turns out to be a slice of film school. The bad slice, the slice that ends up working at a Target.Save your time, money, and effort. If you rented it, go back to the store and tell them it won't play on your machine and get something worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody's fine, just not De Nero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not saying the acting was bad, just hear me out. First of all , don't pick this as a date movie, I made that mistake and me and my bf were looking at each other crying ridiculously and screaming "why!" this film kinda reminds me of the movie Crossroads just with way better acting and cast and no brittney spears!. Its just one tragedy after another and just too painful to watch. The only character I was really feeling sorry for was Robert De Nero. He was the one that had to really suffer. Having four kids that seem to not care about him to tell him the truth about anything, now that's depressing. And the secrets they are keeping aren't really that bad, they just build up drama, and everything really bad that happens, happens to him. Now the big finale when one of his kids die you really don't feel remorse for that because you never meet him, but just feel sorry for the dad.I just can't sit through it again. I'm not quite sure why so many people enjoyed it. It was OK just not heartwarming like some depressing films are. Maybe someone out there will agree with me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film with DeNiro giving his best performance in recent years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard much about this movie, saying how good it was, and that it contained Robert DeNiro's best performance in recent years. After seeing Everybody's Fine finally, I have to heartily concur, not only that it is a great film, but DeNiro, an actor I greatly admire, is superb in a restrained and heartfelt performance. The other actors are excellent too, particularly a typically strong Sam Rockwell. Drew Barrymore also shines in her second best performance the past decade or so after Grey Gardens, and Kate Beckinsale's performance is much more than all looks and little else. The characters are clichéd in a way, but much is done to make us care for them. The script is excellent, with some very poignant moments. Everybody's Fine's story is memorable too, the film is perhaps not always easy to watch, but it is honest and not too predictable. The soundtrack compliments the tone of the film perfectly, the direction is adept and Everybody's Fine is beautifully shot with striking scenery. All in all, a great film. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was totally expecting a different movie that I got. For the last six weeks or so I saw previews of this film in the theaters, and they seemed to imply the movie was a heart-warming holiday comedy. Were we surprised!!! There is hardly more than three laughs in the entire film...the movie is generally depressing, and except for the end, the movie takes place during the summer and not at Christmas time. I am not saying the picture was bad...I am only saying it is not what it was sold as. Otherwise the movie is OK...a film that tries to teach us life lessons on how we should raise our kids and the mistakes that parents (and kids) do. But be prepared to cry a little and be emotionally manipulated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, maybe a bit basic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about what happens in a family when nobody wants to deal with what is really going on. I think that issue can manifest out of a number of different situations, it can happen out of a sense that a parent is judged to be not capable of dealing with the truth,either because they are judged not bright enough, or not honest enough. Truth can mean many things, it can be things are better than what is considered the truth inside a family re its members, or truth can be Dad yer a sh**, but who cares because you don't control anything anymore since were all grown up. This film is blessedly simple in that the sons and daughters of a more or less average guy have essentially clear cut lives and they all care about each other. That is well and good but also not necessarily a reflection of the complexities that tend to revolve around and within most families in North America. That said, this film is like a picture essay of how one man handles being alone and how he misses his wife , and how he feels about not having his kids around anymore-it bugs him -but he is too much of a man to complain about that aspect of things to his children. A good performance by Robert de Niro here, but it is, at its core, a sad movie about loneliness, and life 'a la mode.'I think TV today likes to constantly say that kids are this and kids are that-but very often I think it is parents who are the problem. I liked seeing a decent parent for a change. There seem to be so few.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You should bring a pistol to this movie so you can blow out your brains at the end and save some time. This is the most God awful depressing movie ever made. If you have seen the trailer you have seen every good part of the movie. There are families in Samolia who are more upbeat than this dysfunctional family. But if your goal is to leave your home, drive all the way to the multiplex and find a parking place, and pay $8 to be depressed out of your gourd, this is the movie for you. However you could just get a head start on filling out your income tax and be depressed for free. I notice that all the positive reviews are of the artys-fartsy type. The purpose of a movie is to make you feel better than when you came in, not to expand some actors resume.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, I liked your review. It was well thought out and true to form for this wonderful story. Depressed? I wouldn't go to those lengths, but maybe you were because you felt bad that you treat you own parents/grandparents the same way. I hope God will forgive me for my lack of contact (better than most, but still not enough), I wish mine were still around to have had Thanksgiving (and other holidays) together. I miss them very much ... even though they were alcoholics and my step-monster was almost unbearable to be around. That turned out to be true when the family found out she was a gold-digger. Holy cow, I am way off track here ..."Everybody's Fine," is a great remake. It follows a widower (De Niro) who embarks on a road trip to RECONNECT with each of his grown children only to find their lives are not as great as he thought. He would have preferred (on the few calls with his family) to have heard the truth about their lives.I would do the same if all I heard sounded like BS from my children. It scares the heck out of me that my daughter might ask her step-father to walk her down the marriage aisle. Luckily, we have always been very close,talk almost daily and get together every weekend ... and she is 16, has a lot of friends and lots of homework being in the International Baccalaureate program. I am so grateful for the time (and truth) she gives me. Off track again? I guess you can tell the emotions this Oscar potential movie can stir.</fullReview>

This movie leaves you with a messed up feeling and primarily a feeling that you just wasted $8 on a ticket and a couple of hours of your life. This movie was depressing wrong, horrible. Don't watch it. If you are one of those who enjoys those Emmy winning movies that no one actually watches, then you will probably enjoy this predictable, poorly executed, stupid movie. Also this is not a Christmas movie by any stretch of the imagination.
