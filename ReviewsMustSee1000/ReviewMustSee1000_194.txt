		<fullReview>"Syriana" is a blistering, powerful film about the degree to which governments and corporate conglomerates place the ambition to control the world's oil supply above the well being of their citizens and employees. In this game, there are only bad guys, and what separates the villains from the protagonists is not a question of who's good and who's bad, but rather how bad each is willing to be.So maybe "Syriana" doesn't tell us anything new. But that doesn't mean its points aren't worth making again and again. And though it is complicated, and I'm not going to pretend I followed every detail of its intricate plot, it's not *that* hard to follow. Stephen Gaghan is a good writer, and he provides a nice summary of the film's action in its final moments.What emerges from this tangled puzzle is a web of corruption and self-interest, all fueled by the need for oil. In one plot thread, the men behind two soon-to-merge oil companies will stop at nothing to make the merger go through, since the new company will be one of the most powerful in the world. In another thread, the law firm representing the company proves that it's eager to cash in on the company's new economic success. Meanwhile, a power struggle between the two sons of an aging king in an unspecified Middle Eastern country (though Saudi Arabia is obviously suggested) has attracted the attention of the American government, operating through the CIA. America (read American business) has a vested interest in which of the king's sons succeeds him to the throne: It doesn't want the reform-minded eldest son, whose priorities will be building a country to benefit his own people; it wants instead the younger son, who will continue to relegate his country to a cosy spot in America's hip pocket and take its orders directly from the president of the USA. And in the film's most chilling plot strand, we see how the struggle for oil feeds the radical Islam movement in the Middle East, providing young men with a feeling of brotherhood and righteousness in the face of a region they feel has turned its back on them in favor of big business and Western corruption."Syriana" is tense, fast and furious. Following it can admittedly be somewhat exhausting, but if you pay very close attention to the first hour or so, as each story is introduced and the relationships between characters become clear, the second half of the movie is easier to digest.I disagree with other comments here that the characters aren't developed or that the acting is unimpressive. On the contrary, I think all of the actors create extremely nuanced, compelling characters, a challenging task given the fact that none of them are allowed more than a minute or so at a time to feed us information about themselves. A movie like this could easily fall prey to filling itself with a bunch of stock villains, all cocked eyebrows and facial mannerisms rather than full-bodied characterizations, and the fact that it avoids this is a tribute to both Gaghan and the cast. And hats off to the editor on this movie, who had perhaps the most daunting task of the year.2005 has been full of terse, important films, fresh in their immediacy. There have been a small number of sensational, tough, thought-provoking films instead of a larger batch of more mediocre ones, as has been the case recently. "Syriana" is one of the best movies of the year: it's angry, yet it's not hopeless. I hope Americans see this movie. At this time of year, when people are trampling each other in malls in order to be first in line for Christmas sales, I hope they remember that the vast wealth of America frequently comes at the sake of people all over the world who will never have a fraction of the comfort those in our country take for granted.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie is Not Political Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great, complex movie. Its only faults are in the clarity of character motivations. This is not a liberal or conservative film. It is an exploration into the existing system that evolved over many years.At no point in the movie does it take any pot-shots at Bush, Republicans, or Democracts. In fact, non of those words are ever spoken. It is not a left/right - red/blue debate. At no point in time does it ever mention the political parties of those in charge.The fact is, be it a Republican or Democrat, this world depends on oil. Our country while split on how to obtain it, will do anything to make sure the flow is not cut off.This movie finds faults with the global economy. Faults with the US system that has been tweaked by both sides over the span of decades. Faults with the Middle East for squandering its earnings. Faults with emerging China and its impact on consumption.Anyone claiming this movie is politically motivated is a troll looking for attention and should be ignored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A political slap in the face reality check</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked out of this movie feeling pretty depressed. As a historian, I always knew there have been forces at work in our society that act against the best interest of the average citizen. This film does an excellent job of illustrating just how politics and big business conspire to preserve the status quo which also protects their power and profits. The global interaction depicted in this film shows how all actions have consequences. The thirst our nation has for oil drives the kind of political and business policies that cause anger and hatred towards our nation. This oil addiction has led to an unjust war that was started on lies and disinformation. The result has been the deaths of over 2000 US servicemen and women, thousands more injured and tens of thousands Iraqi dead and wounded. This act has been the best tool Islamic terrorist groups have ever had in attracting followers and money to their cause. Those that attack this film obviously buy into the fantasy that America is involved in Iraq and the Middle East due to our sincere desire to spread "democracy." Anyone who is willing to have an open mind will find this film to be chilling for the implications of the storyline. This film is a must see for those who care about how the behavior of our government and big business impacts us in our everyday lives and how it will contribute to further terrorist attacks for decades to come. A well researched story with excellent actors for the numerous roles. I will buy this as soon as it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thesis on the culture of corruption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Gaghan penned Traffic, which was the best film of 2000. Now with Syriana, he has developed a companion piece, with the oil industry as the backdrop rather than the drug trade. The irony of this is that the films show that both industries are corrupt to the core, but only one is legal.In fact, by the evidence of these two films, one could argue that the drug trade is the less sleazy of the two because it does not exist with the facade of legitimacy that surrounds the oil industry. If I was to make a list of the 10 best films of the decade so far, these would both be there.It is tough, if not impossible and perhaps even foolish to try and apply one thesis to this film, but for me, it is that what we as civilians call corruption is simply the culture of the oil business, one supported and nurtured by government, business, traders and lawyers. No-one knows why it exists, but it does, and if you cannot wade in it, you are out of the game.Syriana does not have a plot or a storyline, but it throws character and story and information at you by the bucketful. There is no warm up time. Gaghan goes out of his way to show that the people involved in this business are surrounded by a normal world with normal hopes and dreams. This is evident from the opening shot. A title card tells us we are in Tehran, but not a some stereotypical open market selling figs. It is a hip hop club.The main story of the film involves a possibly corrupt merger of two major American oil firms. From there, everything else fans out. THe story of Jeffrey Wright, the government official investigating the merger, George Clooney, the CIA operative with missions with no apparent goal, the Arab Emir from an unnamed oil producing country, and his two sons each wanting to take over his reign, the industry analyst (Matt Damon) who will use any situation to advance his firm, and the young, broke angry Arab youth who look for meaning in life and find it in the most dangerous way.Syriana is not a left wing movie, it is surprising a-political. It is not anti-American, but it most certainly lays blame on the US and the west for putting oil ahead of all other priorities. It is not sympathetic to terror, but its most compelling plot line tell us how a terrorist can be made from a bad combination of hopelessness, unemployment, anger and poverty.If you are looking for a neat and tidy ending, you will be frustrated. The film ends like a truck running into a brick wall, with all but one or two plots left hanging. It does not answer any questions because I believe that Gaghan is trying to show that no-one is really in charge and that no-one really knows what is going on.The acting is near perfect from everyone in the cast, including a small, two scene brilliant cameo by William Hurt and Oscar worthy work from Clooney and Alexander Siddig as the frustrated Arab prince.This is an important film and it is not to be missed. **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful Political Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the pleasure to view Syriana at an Academy screening and I must say that it is not for everyone. It is however a great film with an important message. Syriana is a thinker's political thriller and it will make you think. I'm glad to see someone like George Clooney trying to make important films again and Syriana is a very worthy effort. The performances are as good as it gets in any film and Chris Cooper is especially noteworthy with a powerhouse perf that will be hard to beat come Oscar time. Also worth mentioning is the great screenplay and direction by Stephen Gaghan. Syriana is not a film for those that want car chases, sex scenes, and huge explosions, but if you want a film that treats its audience as intelligent human beings, Syriana is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware, Genius At Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maddening and infuriating but also fascinating like most things we don't understand when we're told we should. I kept hearing people around me whispering - Who's that? - What are they talking about? - William Hurt!? I haven't shoosh people in a movie theater in years but I did throughout "Syriana". The most compelling aspect is that I felt let into something and hear things I shouldn't. They're all baddies one way or another but then, what else is new. Stephen Gaghan, the writer director, devices a devilish web for us to get lost into. I was mesmerized by his self assuredness and although I didn't have any kind of emotional connection with "Syriana" whoever she or it is, I couldn't dismiss the experience so, well done, cinema comes in all shapes and flavors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The interesting novel by Robert Baer seems to tell it all about "Syriana". It is a tale that is driven by the ambition of a few unscrupulous people who will stop at nothing to achieve their goal. In a way, Mr. Baer's novel as well as the film seems to be reaffirming Niccolo Machiavelli's "The ends justify the means"Stephen Gaghan's first major directorial job presents the story in multiple settings running at the same time, which, for a great majority of the public will prove disorienting. Mr. Gaghan has adapted for the screen material like the one in "Syriana" before, so he wasn't a stranger working in that format. What "Syriana" presents is a sort of rat race for the control of the oil in the Persian Golf, by whatever means necessary. Ultimately, the ones in control of that commodity will dominate the world. We are given about five different narratives in the film that interplay one another in the most unexpected ways. In fact, all these different subplots have a lot more in common than really meets the eye. One could almost recommend the viewing of the film a couple of times in order for all the different parts to come together in our minds and by doing so, the viewer will see the inner mechanisms of this intricate tale of corruption, greed and power.The cast is enormous. There are a lot of different acting styles in the film. An almost unrecognizable George Clooney plays Bob Barnes, the CIA operative fallen from grace who is instrumental in set the story in motion and who reappears at the end at the climax of the action. Jeffrey Wright does a tremendous job as the lawyer who discovers the hidden mystery in a performance that is completely different from whatever he has done before in the screen. Matt Damon plays the ambitious young man who is at the top of his profession and can help Prince Nasir with his revolutionary views about changes in his country and the Arab world. Ultimately, Wasim, the poor Pakistani guest worker makes the case for the displaced youth of that world that is willing to go ahead and commit the ultimate sacrifice.There are also good appearances by some seasoned actors that only appear shortly. Tim Blake Nelson, Chris Cooper, Jayne Atkinson, Akbar Kurtha, William Hurt, Christopher Plummer, Robert Foxworth and the rest are seen briefly.Robert Elswit photographed the film in the different locations and makes it look better. The music score by Alexandre Desplat is heard in the background without interrupting the action. The editing by Tim Squires works well with the action. Stephen Gaghan shows he can do well working with Mr. Baer's material and made an interesting film that while it will irritate some viewers, on the whole he had the right idea in the way to tell this story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Foreign and domestic intrigue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a complex film that tries to get the audience to connect the dots --to see that control of the Middle Eastern oil fields is the goal that is at the heart of so much of the political process, both in the Middle East and in the West, and that it is also the catalyst for much of what we call terrorism.To accomplish its goal, the film introduces a number of characters and a number of seemingly separate story lines in the beginning, then tries to weave them all together by the end. That makes for a challenging first hour or so, in which the film jumps back and forth from one storyline to another. It can be confusing, but not too confusing if you pay close attention.And it does weave them together in the last half hour, so the pay off is there. But the conclusion it reaches is not a happy one for many Americans, for what the movie seems to say is American oil companies use any means necessary, including double crosses and outright murder, to protect their access to Middle Eastern oil.Well enough, for the political message. But does it work as a movie? The answer, in my view, is yes, but its a qualified yes.The plot centers around the merger of two American oil companies, one a industry giant, which has just lost a big contract in Saudi Arabia to the Chinese, the other a small, independent Texas outfit, that has just won a lucrative contract in a smaller Mideast nation and is now going to be very cash rich. But there's a hitch. Did the Texas outfit bribe foreign officials, violating the US Corrupt Practices act. Fearing a Justice Department investigation that could block the merger, it hires a high priced Washington law firm to conduct its own investigation, to see what Justice might dig up against it.At the same time, the Emir of a Persian Gulf oil kingdom is about to retire to Europe and has to pick between two sons to succeed him. One is a pool shooting playboy, the other a serious, reform minded idealist. Problem is, the idealist might not be so anxious to allow US troops to continue to garrison on his soil, while his fun loving brother wants nothing more than to have the Americans there to protect his privileged lifestyle from Islamic radicals. And as all this unfolds, a young Palestinian refugee, thrown out of work by a shift in control of the oil fields, is recruited by al-Qaida or something like it, and becomes involved in a terrorist bombing plot, using a weapon originally delivered by a CIA covert op to the Middle East.But where the movie falls down is that it fails in someways to weave a human story into this and human stories, after all, are what the movies are all about. George Clooney does a fine job as a sort of world weary CIA agent caught up in the skullduggery. Although not particularly introspective, he does on occasion give you the impression that he's trying to figure out if he works for the US government or the Houston Petroleum Club. Matt Damen plays an oil industry analyst who is an adviser to the idealist candidate for emir and he is given the task of adding the human element to the story, after his young son drowns in a swimming pool. Unfortunately, Damon falls completely flat, registering almost zero emotion in his role as an exasperated advocate of democracy and reform or even as grieving dad. The talented Amande Peet ties her best as his wife, but gets little screen time and also delivers a weak performance.And these only partially successful performances and outright failures are where "Syriana" fails --as a film. What "Syriana" lacks is a clear cut central character whose fate is linked to the complex story lines. Clooney's character is as close as we get, and he does not get enough screen time to really get us involved with him and the moral questions he faces. He at one point is directly involved in an assassination plot, then tries to stop it. The lead up to that is the most suspenseful of the film, but Clooney's out of nowhere insertion in the payoff scene is the movie's weakest moment, as if the filmmakers had to recast his character as a born again good guy, despite the silliness of his actions.In the end, movies rise and fall, not by their political message, but by how their central characters grab us. "The Grapes of Wrath," one of Hollywood's greatest political films, works in the end because the complex, multi-character story is really the story of Tom Joad and Henry Fonda's portrayal of this character will forever haunt us.That simply doesn't happen in "Syriana." While we might feel for George Clooney's character, he is not one who we can fall in love with. Clooney's C-I-A agent comes off as a tool, discarded by his handlers when he is no longer useful. But the fact that he did not see until the end that he was working, not for his country, but for big oil, makes him a kind of sad dupe and that does not a movie hero make. Actually, had he gotten more screen time, he might well have been a more sympathetic character. But that would have given us less time to ponder the role of the oil companies in all this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Syriana: the smart scripts that speaks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana, starring Matt Damon and George Clooney, reveals a possible honesty in foreign political corruption. The movie starts out a bit discombobulating, but the ending unleashes a truism in our society. Directed and written by Stephen Gaghan (Screenplay for Traffic 2000), the script for Syriana shows not only a smart liberal-approached storyline, but also how much the American and Arabian lives becomes juxtaposed by oil politics. Based on the non-fiction book "See No Evil" by Robert Baer, Syriana takes its viewer step by step through the birth and processes of terrorism; and tears at the roots from where all violence and corruption derives.The movie starts with the introduction of a character, Bob (George Clooney), an American CIA agent who works in the Middle East for years witnessing the destruction of social injustice. The movie then turns light to the American governmental affairs and its due process to make oil business proposals and governmental decisions to promote oil driven businesses in the Middle East. Bryan (Matt Damon) struggling to survive in America's capitalistic society thrives to introduce business opportunities in the Middle East; but before completing any deals with reformer and leader, Prince Nasir, all the characters, including a young Arabic man suffering from American politics and social injustices, end up experiencing sacrifices beyond comprehensible. The movie leaves its audience stunned with a raw realism that the world we live is not a pretty picture, and all the beliefs you trust can be questionable. Although the movie definitely wouldn't exactly be a "feel good movie", its thought provoking and enlightening, and I don't think it was ever meant to be a "feel good movie." The movie shows a perspective worth learning, considering and understanding. And although the movie takes the viewer through a roller-coaster of different lives and people objectives at the beginning of the film, the movie ties in brilliantly to connect not only the characters lives, but the lives of the audience and everyone's lives who have capitalistic motives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exhausting Tour of the Many Faces of Corruption Around Oil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Syriana," writer/director Stephen Gaghan uses the busy style of "Crash" and "Amores Perros" to illustrate the complex geopolitics behind oil. Each sector--regulators, "intelligence", lobbyists, grease-the-wheel-ers and cogs-in-the-wheel-ers, in the network of greed, idealism, self-interest, sophistication and naiveté, is represented by a different character followed through the movie to bring them together, directly or indirectly, into the climax.This technique to coordinate a huge ensemble of captivating character actors woven tightly together in a complex story is helped enormously by Robert Elswit's ever-moving camera shots as visually and sound edited by Tim Squyres, who had some experience with overlapping dialog and movement in a more literal upstairs/downstairs on Robert Altman's "Gosford Park." Alexandre Desplat's music adds to the tense mood.The variegation that Gaghan presents is almost staggering, even more ethically complicated than a Graham Greene Cold War noir. This is the first film I've seen that illustrates the diversity of clashing Islamic cultures and interests, despite that I couldn't keep their interests or motives all quite straight. Though the English subtitles (which are commendably outlined in black for unusual legibility) wipe out some of the distinctions, we can infer that Iranians are speaking Farsi, Pakistanis' Urdu and others speaking Arabic, all with varying fluency and mutual cultural comprehension, let alone manipulators who can speak anything besides their native tongues. We've seen immigrants and guest workers in films critical of Western countries, but not the resentment-brewing conditions of badly treated non-citizens in the oil-rich Persian Gulf states, like the fictional one here which looks a lot like Dubai or Brunei, where clusters of modern skyscrapers contrast with Bedouin goat herders. It does help for background on the fascinating side plot of the radicalized young Arabs to see "Paradise Now" about Palestinian terrorists to explain particular details of their training.While each character is specifically set within a believable home and family setting, some are painted with too easy and broad strokes. While Alexander Siddig seems to have the monopoly on naively idealistic Arabs, as his similar character in "Kingdom of Heaven" against another Crusades, history is littered with the interim, modernizing liberal tragically caught between powerful forces. (Though the proliferation of Western-educated Arab intellectuals in movies is beginning to sound like all those Japanese generals in World War II movies who went to USC or whatever; at least he went to Oxford and not Harvard.) Matt Damon's un-Bourne-like energy analyst just sounds simplistic even when he's truth-telling, but we also see that he's already slid down the slippery slope of ethics in the crossing of his personal and professional lives. That so many of the oil and gas executives have Texas accents (superb Chris Cooper, Tim Blake Nelson, Robert Foxworth) does seem to say that the decades of business and political corruption there, as documented in Robert Caro's biography of LBJ, have simply been extended to a global scale.The film is also unusual in focusing on the role of lawyers negotiating the deals between companies and governments. While Christopher Plummer's Ivy League senior partner type has been seen as a shadowy force in countless paranoid thrillers, Jeffrey Wright is completely unpredictable and tightly wound, though the point of his relationship with his cynical alcoholic father isn't exactly clear except maybe as his conscience. We see before our eyes he goes from, as his mentor says, "a sheep into a lion." Most films have prosecutors like David Clennon's U.S. attorney as a hero against corruption, instead of being chillingly dismissed as "trust fund lawyers." But the script is so full of such epigrams, like "In this town, you're only innocent until you're investigated," that one character calls another on issuing them too brightly.While from the beginning I couldn't quite follow all the machinations around George Clooney's character, he is wonderful at transforming from his usual Cary Grant suave to harried, dedicated, mid-level bureaucrat who literally won't toe the Company line in a dangerous hierarchy that's shown to be a bit more competent than in real life, that reminded me both in the gut and guts of Russell Crowe's Wigand in the tobacco wars in "The Insider." It recalls how benign corrupt spooks looked in their personal lives, as there's much conversation here about houses, cars and college tuition. Indirectly, the film implicitly shows the dangers to Valerie Plame from her outing as a CIA operative, as families and personal connections are constantly used as threats and bargaining chips.Significantly, there is not a single mention amidst all these Mideast chicaneries, plots and plans of the Zionist entity, proving that pro or anti-Israel policies are smoke screens around the main draw -- oil.Movie-wise, these characters seem a lot like the gangsters and their conseglieres in "The Godfather" carving up Cuba and drug rights, let alone Gordon Gekko extolling "Greed is good" as the ultimate ideology, and fits right in with this year's other geo-political thrillers "The Constant Gardener" and "Lord of War," and those weren't even about natural resources. It works better than the re-make of "The Manchurian Candidate" because even though the focal point is a fictional country the issues are real, not science fiction. So does this make you ready to get out of your car and onto the train? Because until then, we'll still need lots of that oil from the Middle East.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Initially I wanted to compare it with Traffic, same style and interwoven story lines, but the film itself stopped me from doing so. Thank you. Comparing films can so difficult, you know, the old apples v. oranges thing. This film stands on its own without the comparison or the similarities to Traffic.Just before I went to the movie theatre, I saw an interview with Steve Gaghan the director on the Charlie Rose Show, and probably this helped me to fit most of the pieces together. The scene where Bob (Clooney) is taken to visit Hezbollah leaders, is based on the exact experience the director had when researching the story. He said that most of the film was based on his or Bob's actual experiences.So what do we have....Oil, big oil, oil executives, oil analysts, oil geography, oil politics, big time oil power brokers, CIA, Islamic terrorists, Middle East culture....It's all there. And Steve Gaghan does a very good job in bringing it all together. His directorial debut. Very good acting all round, maybe the oldest boy and his mother Amanda Peet stand out.I walked out of the theatre in an emotional daze, if that's possible. I will see this film again.My coda.... What a rotten, ugly barrel of oil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana swept the critics upon release and everything seemed to be raving about it. I suppose it's one of those films that is intensely intelligent...so intelligent that I think you need to be well versed in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind. I don't consider myself unintelligent, I've been studying politics since my early teens and I enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless it's a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message. Syriana tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away. I would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist it's a 10/10 are lying because they think they look better. This film was the most confusing, senseless, mindless dribble I have seen in awhile...Especially considering the critical acclaim, the Oscar nods, and the cast. Screenplay writer Stephen Gaghan has disappointed me yet again. His horribly written Havoc preceded this film and I think he's just trying way too hard. I can't believe he was offered the opportunity to write the Da Vinci Code screenplay. On top of that Gaghan directed the film which made it an absolute mess. I had no idea who anyone was, why things were happening, who was who and what was what. It was a disaster.Because I don't really know who anyone was I can only mention the actors and what I thought of their performances because despite the horrendously complicated script the actors did alright. George Clooney plays C.I.A. field agent and assassin I think?? Bob Barnes. Clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately he's managed to churn out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part. Barnes was a complex character with a sordid history and if I knew what was going on with him I would have really enjoyed his character. Matt Damon plays Bryan Woodman and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the headlights which I can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it. Amanda Peet plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given. Christopher Plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something. I like Plummer and love seeing him show up even if he doesn't get top billing anymore.The cast is intense if only the story made sense. I'd like to exact quote the description of plot on IMDb. "A missile disappears in Iran, but the CIA has other problems: the heir to an Emirate gives an oil contract to China, cutting out a US company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and merges with a small firm that has landed a Kazakhstani oil contract. The Department of Justice suspects bribery, and the oil company's law firm finds a scapegoat. The CIA also needs one when its plot to kill the Emir-apparent fails. Agent Bob Barnes, the fall guy, sorts out the double cross. An American economist parlays the death of his son into a contract to advise the sheik the CIA wants dead. The jobless Pakistanis join a fundamentalist group. All roads start and end in the oil fields." WHAT!?!? Say who now?? Syriana might be the thinking man's movie but it bored me to tears and no matter how hard I tried to stay with it I eventually surrendered and turned it off after an hour and a half and you couldn't have bribed me enough to get me to finish it. I suppose if you want to form an opinion than by all means watch it but I promise you someone looking for entertainment or an enjoyable film will be asleep in the first half hour. 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greed is Good, and Oil Dependency Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SYRIANA is a geo-political thriller that from interconnected story lines tells the stories of people involved in one way or other in the gravitation towards oil. It starts out with a bang and never lets up, but all too often it overplays the technicalities of political lingo in lieu of focusing more on the personal story lines, so the only story that gets the full treatment is not that of CIA operative Robert Barnes but of a Pakistani immigrant, Wahid Khan (Mazhar Munir), who evolves from being a man who cannot get a job because he does not know the language to a man on a suicide mission not unlike many suicide bombers who have left videotaped messages for those to listen and ponder.SYRIANA never takes active sides with anyone because of its attempts to expose a massive oil conspiracy by our own governmental interests which makes us as a Nation seem scarier than anything shown in 1984. We freely invade other countries and lead them by their noses, pretending to be their aides, using up their resources until there is nothing else, and kill those who have honest interests in advancing their poverty-stricken nations, such as the Middle-Eastern prince (Alexander Siddig) who in wanting to form an alliance with China had his assets frozen and was declared a terrorist. America has developed such a leeching presence in the Middle Eastern area, and SYRIANA, like MANDERLAY, paints an unflattering picture of us as a nation of greed.As in the case of most Stephen Soderbergh produced or related projects, the same team brings forth a compelling but somewhat abstract picture that runs the risk of running away from the viewer at any moment due to its very complexity. However, all of the stories presented here are terrific if a little incomplete and everyone is equal in exacting performances which portray the people on display. George Clooney is excellent as Robert Barnes, Matt Damon is deceiving as Bryan Woodman, the man who sells his soul to oil, Jeffrey Wright is understated as the lawyer investing a series of discrepancies between two merger oil companies. Amanda Peet, Christopher Plummer, Jamey Sheridan, Chris Cooper, and William Hurt round up a great cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taut - but convoluted - political thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a quick thumbnail sketch of the many plots of the new Focus Features release, "Syriana," starring George Clooney, Matt Damon, Christopher Plumber and Chris Cooper: Story 1) Bob Barnes (Clooney) is a CIA covert operative in the Middle East. An expert in this region, he speaks Farsi, is tight with Hezbollah and even infiltrated al-Qeada.Story 2) Energy expert and financial consultant, Bryan Woodman (Damon) lives a great life in Geneva with his lovely wife, Julie (Amanda Peet, "The Whole 10 Yards") and his two adorable little boys.Story 3) Attorney Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright, "Broken Flowers") is hired by a Connex Oil Co. bigwig (Christopher Plummer, "The Insider") to find out any dirt on Connex's proposed merger with the small Kemmer Corporation before the Feds do. It seems that Kemmer has procured a deal with the vast oil fields of Kasakistan while Connex has just lost a big Saudi contract to the Chinese.Story 4) A young Arab (Olivier Yglesias), despondent and unemployed because of the merger, is recruited into a radical Muslim terrorist organization.And Story 5) A Saudi king passes up his oldest son, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig) - a reformer and visionary who desires to bring progress and civil rights to his country - in favor of his less-qualified younger brother (Sam Georges said) who, conveniently, supports keeping US troops in his country.That's basically the plot setup. Now the wheels begin to turn. Barnes is assigned by the CIA to arrange the assassination of Nasir; instead he is subjected to brutal torture by a rogue terrorists, led by Mussawi (Mark Strong, "Oliver Twist"). Woodman becomes Nasir's chief financial adviser after his son's tragic death. Holiday, working with Kemmer honcho Jimmy Pope, finds a crooked connection in that company's big deal, and offers to cut a deal with the US Attorney's office. Later, after some bungling, the agency distances itself from Barnes, who heads to Saudi Arabi in an attempt to stop another plot against Nasir. Competently written and directed by Stephan Gaghan (who won a screenplay Oscar in 2000 for "Traffic," another complex, multi-layered film, this time about the drug trade), "Syriana" can be seen as either a cerebral, thoughtful, intelligent, complex motion picture, or a convoluted, confusing mishmash of a movie.To me, it's a little bit of both, with the overriding message that oil ruins everything it touches and the United States, with its secret dealings, underhanded alliances and shady involvement in other governments, is pretty much evil. Many people, however, may run out of patience before the movie ends (which seems to be almost glacial at times).Evidently, Gaghan did a lot of research here, especially with Saudi royalty, and the intricate plots show this; likewise, the many location shots give a true, gritty feel to the picture. Use of Arabic and Farsi (along with English subtitles) also gives the movie a realistic look.The acting, on the other hand, leaves something to be desired. Damon is his usual cute boy self; Peet is non-descript; Plummer is menacingly devious; and Clooney (bloated and bearded for the role) seems to sleepwalk through the role. It is a huge contrast to his dynamic work in the terrific "Good Night And Good Luck." I cannot say I enjoyed the film; but it was a decent effort which deserves a look. Whether that mild recommendation means anything, I can't say. I have a feeling, though, that it will not translate into very big box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put: the movie is boring. Cliché upon cliché is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Living in the Middle East (in Israel), I was excited when I bought my ticket for Syriana. Having seen the trailer, and being a thriller-lover, I expected to see first of all a fast moving, breath catching movie, which wisely dips in global policy-making and the relation between oil, power and corruption, from a fresh angle. Well, I almost left the movie in the middle. The pace was painfully slow, almost all characters were stereotyped, the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, in the end you don't care. Save your money, save your time, choose another movie.Robi Chernitsky</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seldom do I give up on a movie without seeing the entire show. This is particularly true when I have rented it on DVD. Syriana was one in which I did give up. Half way through I turned it off in bored disgust.This movie is disjointed, boring, confusing and lackluster. The acting was dry and without credible portrayals. The general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion that it failed to grasp my attention or interest. The multiple sub plots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual connected plot. Too bad such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop. I cannot imagine this movie receiving any nominations much less an award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was slower then Molasses in January... in Alaska. The man who put togeather the preview should get an award for managing to put every one of the 30 seconds that were interisting into the preview. I had to wake up the people I was watching it with, several times. After it was over, I felt bad for having woken them up. Most of the film is taken up with hoping something will actually happen, but nothing ever does. It was easy to loose track of people's motives, and the characters were flat and uninteristing. By the end of the movie, you just hoped everyone would died. Everyone runs around either being contemptible, petty, or pitiful, and usually all three. And worse, we watched a minute or two of the added features, just for kicks and giggles you understand, and all that we saw was people being smug about how socially aware they are. If they had spend the time on the movie that they did patting themselves on the back, it might have been worth watching. I was brought in expecting the excitement of '24.' I got a lecture on social awareness through the blery eyes of the sandman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far too Confusing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a rare event indeed for me to leave a movie before the end - its only happened maybe 4 or 5 times in over 30 years. Syriana was one of those times, and I left after about 70 minutes, just after a very unpleasant torture scene. The film started out somewhat confusing, but that is not uncommon in the action/thriller genre. I stuck with it thinking the plot would gradually develop, and all the threads would come together; well I waited and waited and it just got more and more confusing, so after an hour or so, I was still not really sure what it was all about.As far as being an Oscar nomination for best screenplay - thats amazing - the screenplay is the foundation of a movie, on which everything else is built, so its hard to see how this could have been viewed as being in the top 4 or 5 scripts of 2005. Given that George Clooney has the script as a given to work with, his performance was adequate, but hardly exceptional, or particularly worthy of an award. More to the point, Clooney won his Oscar in the category of Best Supporting Actor - though as far I could work out his was the leading role, with Matt Damon in the supporting role. All in all, this was the worst Hollywood movies I have seen in the last couple of years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't wait to receive the DVD after hearing so much about the film. What a disappointment! This became one of the most confusing films I've ever viewed. There were so many characters introduced, some resembling others, that it became impossible to follow the story line. I could not understand how George Clooney received an acting award for the film since he was hardly involved, at least in the first half of the movie. My wife and I gave up after about an hour of misery and stopped the DVD. I might have considered fast forwarding to see if the ending was any better but after so much confusion decided that chances for improvement were slim. A co-worker told me that a lot of the movie "comes together" in the last minute or less. I was glad I didn't waste another hour, waiting. I gave the DVD away the following day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So dang confusing! Confusion reigns. There is corruption -- "corruption is good?" Didn't Gordon Gekko already say something like that. Oh, right, that was greed. Weapons sale -- okay, got it. But, was Bob Barnes an independent contractor for the CIA? FBI? Did it matter? Confusing. Then the Emir met with the Chinese. Was that scene even necessary? Then they lost the contract and the deal went back to the US company. OK, I'm with ya. Then SOMEBODY wanted to prosecute a bunch of other somebodies??? I'm lost. See -- I don't know who that prosecutor was hired by and I don't know who the old man was who he lived with. CONfusing. Two kids died. I don't like that and then there's that confusion with swimming pool electrocutions -- iffy. Then Barnes threatened some old man whose home he had broken into -- was that the head of the CIA? FBI? And he took the threat seriously!!! (Laughable.) And then he gave Barnes his passport back so that Barnes could drive around the desert and warn the Emir's son. But who in the heck was behind the two suicide bombers at the end? The Chinese? I don't think so, but they're the only ones who make sense. Was this a movie about the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing?</fullReview>

As a movie, this was slow and not well put together. It was boring and hard to watch without falling asleep. I love politics but I wanted to see a movie. Don't waste your time unless you agree with the political message and feel some need to support it. If you want an enjoyable movie with a good plot, look elsewhere. They should have organized the movie differently if they wanted people to follow it better. The characters were not defined. If you want to watch Geo.

		<fullReview>We expected too much. We expected a thriller with a coherent, understandable storyline and good acting that would engage us to the characters. Instead, we got "whammoxed" with a disjointed, poorly written, un-cohesive, attempt to disclose something that we all know: The business of oil is "sticking it to the consumer and getting them to bend over for more" and this is our excuse for High Oil Prices. The acting was poor, wooden, uninspired and DULL. Amateurs from Off-Broadway would have delivered more imaginative and captivating performances. The story lacked Congruence and Continuity.It ranks among the 10 Worst "movies" we've seen in the last decade and there is absolutely NO reason for any Oscar for George Clooney unless it was to compensate for the faces he made while pretending to be tortured.</fullReview>

Seeing wonderful actors like George Clooney (Batman), Christopher Plummer (Chang), Robert Foxworth (Leyton) and Alexander Siddig (Bashir) together was a very cool move, as was the INTENDED MESSAGE the film wished to convey concerning the way the U.S./Middle East oil industry is linked by those on the front-lines a.k.a. the ground, and not understood by pen-pushers, i.e. politicians. HOWEVER, the film zips from venue to venue like nobody's business, and dialogue can be about Spider-Man one moment and jihad the next.

I am told Clooney got an Oscar for this. For what? An Oscar used to mean something.I understand this picture was made by the folks who brought us Traffic. I am not surprised. I absolutely loathed that movie, and could not finish it. Nor did I finish this one. Life is too short!

		<fullReview>This movie may be enjoyable to the average Masters Degree holder of Political Science or anyone affiliated to the oil industry, but to the average movie goer looking for an enjoyable time at the Theater and a fun way to spend your hard earned $8.00 - For the love of Pete - STAY AWAY!!! I'm a big movie fan and see most movies and for the most part enjoy all genres. Action, Adventure, Drama, Kids movies, even Chick Flicks at times, and I rarely dislike films, even bad ones are usually tolerable. But I have to stand up for all the movie goers out there like myself, just looking to see a good flick, something fun with the basic feature of being understandable - This is not it! This was the first movie, ever, that I honestly would have felt good about asking for a refund. It was that bad in my mind. There were only 20 or so people in the theater and I think I counted 4 or 5 that got up and left. One guy came back in, stood in the doorway for 15 minutes and left again.I mean this movie being compared to Traffic is ridiculous! Sure it tries to have that similar style of having many small stories with many different characters that TYPICALLY all come together in the end, but Syriana just left you hanging! I sat there waiting for something to happen but it just didn't! There was no resolve, no story, no nothing. Just a bunch of political jibber jabber that made no sense. I not only didn't understand what anyone was saying or doing throughout the entire show, but after awhile I just didn't care. I just wanted the nightmare to end so I could go home and chew on Reynolds Wrap.If you want to see how this type of movie should be made go see Crash, 21 Grams or even Magnolia, which was fairly painful to sit through, but was far, far better than this pointless waste of money. Honestly I wouldn't even recommend this as a rental, not even a dollar rental at your local grocery store, heck if someone gave you this movie for free I would use it as a Frisbee for your dog before I would waste two hours of your life on it! Generally IMDb is a great source of reviews and I think a good way to get an idea about whether or not to see a show, I use it all the time, but Syriana receiving a 7.2 just blows my mind! It saddens me to think that most of you will believe the other 90% of comments that give this movie a high rating and will watch, but I'm sure some of you will agree with me and wish you hadn't.Oh yea, and can someone please tell me what the crap Syriana even means!!???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie for those with more than half a brain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana is an outstanding, visionary, and highly austere movie that is not for those who are seeking the typical mind numbing and empty claptrap produced by Hollywood these days. If you want to see explosions and cheap sexual titillation ala James Bond, look elsewhere. If you want though provoking and challenging movie, then this is the real deal (though I realize that the vast majority of Americans these days view actual thinking with the same disdain as root canals). I think most people are missing the biggest point of the movie. The obvious main point is that the CIA works to directly support American business interests. No surprise there. The more elusive one (and maybe even unintended) is that by meddling in the very complex and convoluted politics of the region, the CIA continually creates and perpetuates the very problems it is trying to solve and therefore contributes to the social and economic disparities that perpetuate the lack of stability in the Middle East and which result in, for instance, terrorism. Oil is certainly the main theme of the movie, but references are also indirectly made to the global arms and drug trades. The point about CIA meddling is most directly brought up in the dialog between Woodman (Matt Damon) and Prince Nasir Al-Subaai (Alexander Siddig a.k.a. Siddig El Fadil of Star Trek Deep Space 9) in the Prince's hotel room. In this dialog Woodman supplies a linty of historical political intrigues and wars fought to secure oil resources for the West in general, including the seizure of the Suez Canal Zone, the Gulf Wars, and the overthrow of the democratically elected government in Iran under Premier Mossadeq. Using this last real world event as an example, joint covert operations by the CIA and British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) over through the government of Mossadeq in 1952-3 due to fears of Communism and because he nationalized Iran's considerable oil wealth. British Petrol moves in and makes tons of money. Sounds kind of familiar doesn't it? I mean the Iron Curtain doesn't exist anymore but Red China certainly does and if a certain fictional future Emir of Syriana were looking more to China than to the US, and even buying Chinese weapons and planes over American weapons, this could be a problem could it not? What is the result of the CIA's efforts? The Shah is established as a cruel and ineffectual dictator with a bleak human rights record, is subsequently overthrown, lives the rest of his life in southern California, some hostages are taken for a year or so, the country becomes a Fundamentalist Shi'a theocracy not very friendly to the West and financially supporting terrorism world wide, especially in Lebanon. The government of Lebanon is slowly destroyed, many people die, US Marines are sent in as peacekeepers, a lot of Marines die, the US is handed yet another foreign policy defeat. Oh, and not to mention Iran launching a major war against one of its neighbors (Iraq), killing millions and involving the use of chemical WMDs, resulting in Iran having a population that is mostly under the age of 25, mostly male, mostly living below the parity poverty line, and with high unemployment.Other ways in which this theme is brought out (and some of the minor points of the movie):Bob Barnes (George Clooney) is posing as an arms dealer and sells two American made stinger anti-aircraft missiles to an Iranian secret services agent (presumably MOIS) posing as an intermediary arms and drug dealer (MDMA anyone?). One of the missiles immediately finds itself into the hands of an unidentified Egyptian cleric (who happens to work in an Islamic school in the fictional Syriana). The other missile explodes in the trunk of the Iranian agent's car, killing him, his co-conspirator, and about half a dozen innocent bystanders. The minor point- American covert agents can participate in overtly terrorist acts themselves. Though precautions were taken to prevent the second missile from being successfully deployed against an aircraft (the missile was fused to detonate at 10 feet after launch), it ties in to the end of the movie where a certain CEO (Dean Whiting, played by Christopher Plummer), enjoying his strawberry juice and standing on the deck of a half full tanker at the newly opened terminal of the Connex-Killen (just love those names) corporation is about to be vaporized by a young terrorist armed, you guessed it, with the very same missile. Minor point- there is justice in the world. In between these two events, the CIA sets up one of its covert agents (Barnes) to take the fall for the killing of the Iranian agents as well as for the planned and soon to be completed elimination of a certain son of an Emir (even though both acts were officially sanctioned). Of course, the right hand does not always know what the left is doing, and Barnes ends up being tortured by a fellow CIA agent in Beirut (actually, a double agent working for both the CIA and Hezbollah, which is supported by Iran) while trying to set up the assassination. Minor point: trust no one. Woodman (Matt Damon), a low level American talking head living in Geneva, Switzerland with his family, becomes financial adviser to the Prince via the death of one of his sons and becomes the moral witness to the non-CIA based events. The funeral of his son also serves to show that America is alone in its dealings in the Middle East as shown by the reaction of his son's friends following the funeral (playing as if nothing had happened at all). Like I said, this is a complex movie with many threads to draw together but it does so very well. The cinematography is simply beautiful (in a bleak kind of way) and depressing at the same time and worth the price of admission alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart, Slick Political Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies that are timeless and classic. But there are also movies that represent the time you're in, or perhaps it's better said - are for your time. I can't think of a better one for the first decade of the new millennium. This is a taut, fast paced, political thriller that some may find hard to keep up with. Though Babel and Constant Gardner are of the same genre, and received slightly higher marks on IMDb - I believe this to be a much better movie.The story is a clinic on the competing interests of the two empires of big business profits, and the absolute control of government deciding what will and will not happen within it's sphere of power. Both entities are knit together tightly with the suffering and loss of the people whose lives are consumed by them. You'll have to see it several times to really get a hold of what's going on, but it's well worth it. Intelligent films are a rare treat, and this one is razor sharp.A powerful law firm, the oil company they represent, the U.S. Government, and the al Sabai (?) family ruling an unnamed Arab country - are the 4 main players. Though the real power lies only with the government and the oil company, equal screen time is spent with the supporting cast of the law firm and royal family, who at various levels - do their bidding. This is a film about power, the corruption of power, money - and the attempts to manipulate power or money on some level, by almost everyone in the film.Stephen Gaghan somehow produces a few pristine moments of peace or clarity in the midst of much turmoil, which I'm beginning to recognize as a mark of his. He did it in Traffic, and he does it here. They feel almost like an emotional oasis of simplicity, like you and a friend so deeply engrossed in a conversation in your car parked on the side of a very busy street, that you don't even notice what's going on around you. George Clooney, Jeffrey Wright and Chris Cooper standout in their performances. It's a great film that's well acted and well cast, and a reflection of the way we are now . . .http://fullgrownministry.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/orient/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politics of the Middle East 101 - artfully presented</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I torture-tested Syriana - watched it twice over the course of two days. Why? Because I had read that it was a complex film and that it might require two viewings to really get it. After my second viewing, all that I can say is that this film does not live up to its reputation in terms of complexity, and does not treat its subject matter with the reputed depth people seem so willing to ascribe to it. Seems to me that the film introduces the complexity of Middle East/U.S. relations, but doesn't really indicate how deep the rabbit hole goes. I did not learn much from it, but unlike most Hollywood political films, I did not disagree with it either. Despite these comments - which were not meant to be critical - Syriana is a very serious and very good film. In my opinion it is less a thriller and more of a political drama.Clooney plays Bob Barnes, a CIA field operative who is beginning to develop a conscience. Damon plays a financial analyst who, after the death of his eldest son, becomes adviser and friend to a smart reformist prince (Siddig). Jeffrey Wright gives an outstanding performance as a smart, aggressive attorney preparing for a merger between two oil companies by investigating their dealings in the region very critically. A young man (Amr Waked) and his father are deported from Iran because of a change in ownership at the refinery they worked in, and the young man begins to be drawn toward Islamic fundamentalism. These, and other stories, intertwine and eventually merge explosively.Although Syriana is not a happy go-lucky walk in the park Disney show, I found it just as interesting and compelling the second time around. This speaks very highly for the films artistry and the performances of the entire cast. Clooney and Daman are always good, but both shine especially nicely in the less mainstream roles they brought to life in Syriana. This film (or the mediocre Kingdom of Heaven) should be a long overdue breakthrough for the great Alex Siddig (Siddig Al Fadil). The cast is a long list of some of Hollywood's brightest (if not most well paid) stars. Each member of the ensemble plays their part very well, and with obvious conviction.The soundtrack is great! Gaghan's script is excellent, and the cinematography and directing are both good, though perhaps a little derivative of Traffic. Gahgan is establishing himself as one of more objective and well-informed script writers of films with political points, and I am glad to see that he is handling this difficult role with the passion, artistry and intellect it requires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new trend in "international conflict suspense" films?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope producers take this film and reinvent the genre of the "Americans vs. them." Like all the films about USSR, Communists Russia, and other political regimes the Americans hate that we all saw in the early 80's to late 90's and even today (sadly). This film will usher in this genre asking the questions of where our energy is coming from, where will our water come from next year, and where will our resources come from once we depleted them?The film itself is good because it turns the barrel upon the Americans. It also displays their strong influence in the Middle East. George Clooney is a CIA thug but Alexander Siddig plays Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, who in a American's view is a terrorist threat but in the view for what is better for the improvement of his country... he is FDR.Go see it. I loved it. Editing can get confusing, but it makes you pay attention. Slow at some points but if you have the ability to discuss the issues in the film go see it. If you don't have it go see the film then gain the ability to discuss these issue. This is important. Participant Productions as something going for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horrible story, lack of ANY character motivation, almost no character development, mediocrity in all the rest...I had the feeling that Mr. Clooney accidentally added 20 kilos and in order to justify that they decided to make a fake excuse. So they got some ideas here and there, made up a boring story, patch it up with several pointless side tracks. The big question actually is: if Clooney got Oskar for supporting role, who'd character did he support? Mat Damon's?! Honestly, Mat Damon's character was completely useless for this film. As most of the side "humanizing" the story ones! Simply stay away from this movie. Wait until it gets on DVD, or even better - wait for the TV premiere and have a good nap while watching it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I actually watched the whole thing. I kept thinking that maybe there was a point or a story in there somewhere but guess what.. there isn't. George Clooney's talent is wasted.. he is the only character that the audience even comes close to caring about and it is just a minor part in the film. I am not opposed to the idea of a film making the audience figure out the story themselves by just giving pieces.. but it doesn't work here.. there really never is a story even after you put the pieces together it is just a few badly made scenes thrown together. My thought is maybe the crew themselves lost interest in the movie while they were making it. Most of the scenes are neither well acted nor compelling in any way... this isn't "smart- movie-making"... in fact there is very little smart about the film at all. The ideas it tries to express are battered into the viewer .. there seem to be more ideas than thought. This is not "non-linear" film-making as someone has said it was... all the ideas do follow a common timeline... so if people have a hard time following the film.. which is easy because it has no story.. to say they don't understand "non-linear" films is not only insulting.. but it is just plain wrong.. maybe you need to study film more before making comments about things you don't understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not 1000 Years of Islam That's Making Them Crazy -- It's Republican Corporate Greed!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only in Hollywood! Only in Hollywood could they make a movie that turns wild-eyed suicide bombers into big-eyed waifs, that turns Osama Bin Laden into Tom Joad, that films the convulsive homicidal hysteria of an entire civilization as if it's all just plain folks yearning for something better. This isn't Jihad -- it's THE GRAPES OF WRATH! Poor Hollywood Left! They really, really don't know how to fight real evil, so they fall back on fighting the "evil" they can understand. This whole movie is one long attack on corporate greed, and it makes the case (in a dazed, diffuse, and almost incoherent way) that the centuries of violent fanatical piety of the Islamic nations is merely an unfortunate by-product of the corporate greed of the Reagan years. That's like blaming Groucho Marx for the Holocaust.On the way of course, there's drama. How Hollywood loves drama! Thrill to the sight of the robotic Amanda Peet wearing couture and looking prettily distressed as her toddler son drowns in the cement pond. Thrill to the sight of robotic Matt Damon, hard Irish jaw a-flexing, as he makes a manly plunge to save said tiny tot. I guess the brilliant liberal scriptwriters of Hollywood weren't sure we'd get that Matt is a good guy unless we saw him save a baby from drowning in the pool. Maybe to add dramatic contrast they could have shown a bunch of Republicans drowning their babies and whooping it up to country and western music!All in all, this movie is as about as relevant to the real historical and cultural roots of Jihad as one of Marie Antoinette's pastoral dramas is to the Reign of Terror. Judging from this movie, I really don't know if Western Civilization can withstand the onslaught of Jihad, but I hope so. Because you know if the bad guys win, when they march down Mulholland Drive they're likely to forget all about how compassionate their liberal friends are and just hang Matt Damon and George Clooney from the first lamppost.And that would be a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have here a very good list of actors, and the "political thriller" description was attractive, but the whole thing is full of short scenes that jump from place to place that the viewer has to try and piece together. This makes the film tiresome to watch and only creates a sense of confusion. The jolted delivery makes it hard for the viewer to develop any emotion as to what is happening. I guess if you watched it ten times you might begin to figure it out. Only after reading the synopsis here on IMDb did get some idea of what the movie was about. But watching it seemed like some dis-jointed storys that hopefully would join up in the end, which they do not. I am sure the director new what is was about, but it was not conveyed easily to the viewer. Not my favourite style of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Syriana", writer/ director Stephen Gaghan's follow-up to his Oscar winning screenplay for "Traffic", is an involving, complicated look at the oil industry. It is a very good film, but you are going to have to work at it, paying attention to every moment, in order to keep track of all of the characters, events and manipulation being depicted.Bob (George Clooney), an undercover agent, sells two missiles to a contact in Iran. One of the missiles is promptly taken away by an unknown second party., the other weapon explodes as the man who purchased it, drives away. Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) works for a small investment firm in Geneva, Switzerland. His firm is trying to become the advisors for the aging, ready to retire Emir and his two ambitious sons. Bryan, his wife, Julie (Amanda Peet) and their two sons are invited to the Emir's birthday party in Mallorca, Spain. After tragedy befalls his family, Bryan's company wins the coveted contract advising the Emir's oldest son. Bennett Holliday (Jeffrey Wright), a lawyer with a Washington, DC firm, is put in charge of scrutinizing the impending merger of two large oil firms, one of which is owned by Jimmy Pope (Chris Cooper), a good old Texas boy who doesn't seem to really want the merger. Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer), a high level adviser in the government, quietly pulls strings to make sure the "right" son becomes the new Emir.All of these characters are involved in seemingly different story lines, and they don't really interact for a significant portion of the film. As you watch a few moments with Clooney in Iran, Beirut or Baltimore or a few moments with Damon in Geneva, Mallorca or the desert, Gaghan helps us to learn a little about these characters and their involvement in a story with a huge scope, spanning many countries around the globe. Towards the end when the story lines begin to overlap, and all of the machinations begin to make sense, you get the sense that the director has prepared us well, or as well as anyone could, to understand how all of these different people, all of these different factors, are involved in the story.Gaghan, whose debut directorial effort was the rightfully ignored thriller "Abandoned" starring Benjamin Bratt and Katie Holmes, follows that up with this epic about the oil industry. Gaghan works very hard to keep the audience in the loop, helping them keep track of characters, the locations and the action. In many ways, it is very similar to "Traffic"; multiple characters, multiple locations, story lines that don't necessarily overlap. Gaghan seems to have adopted the style of Steven Soderbergh, the director of "Traffic". There is a lot of hand-held camera work, to create a sense of immediacy and closeness to all of the action. Thankfully, as Gaghan introduces the various characters, type appears on screen identifying their location, helping us stay grounded in the action, helping us keep track. If you liked "Traffic", you should also appreciate this new film. If not, stay away. I know that a lot of hand-held camera work can drive some people batty, but in this case, it really works well in service of the story.If even half of the manipulations presented in this film are based on actual truth, it is no wonder the oil industry is so filled with corruption. The people who control this industry are wealthy beyond our comprehension and they want to make sure we stay that way and are willing to do anything, including changing the course of another country's government, covering up covert arm sales, hiding bribes, etc.As the film moves from one character to the next, one location to another across the globe, and introduces more and more people, we begin to recognize there is a common thread throughout; everyone is greedy. Some of the people don't necessarily start out that way, but they are soon corrupted. The greedier they are in the beginning, the richer they are in the end. The most interesting moments, for me, are when a couple of characters give in to their greed, and the audience realizes this for the first time. The way they give in to this temptation is quite shocking and memorable.With such a large ensemble, and each of the major stars on screen for less than thirty minutes or so, it is difficult for them to create a performance that is anything more than serviceable to the story. This isn't a bad thing, but people who are expecting George Clooney and Matt Damon to share a lot of screen time, will be disappointed. Clearly, each of the actors was interested in getting this film made and didn't want to be the "star". The supporting cast is more successful, simply because they have less baggage accompanying them. If you see Clooney or Damon, you expect them to carry the film. When they don't, it is a little bit of a let down. Chris Cooper, Tim Blake Nelson, Christopher Plummer and Alexander Siddig as Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, the Emir's older son, all leave a memorable impression in a very short period of time."Syriana" is a film that is trying to educate us through the medium of drama. It isn't a documentary, but a lot of what is depicted probably has happened or will happen. Because of this, you will probably be more informed, more skeptical the next time you hear a story about an oil company receiving exclusive drilling rights in some far off country, the next time you hear a President from Texas inform the public about the rational behind increasing oil prices or the rational behind going to war in a small country in the Middle East."Syriana" is a film worthy of your attention and interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tapestry of images and characters,used to paint one story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Stephen Gahagan and co-star/producer George Clooney aim to tell a story about the business of oil in the contemporary world,using much the same brand of sort of dizzying,low-fi noise and imagery as was used in Gahagan's 2000 Traffic.The stories of Bob Barnes(Clooney,about twenty pounds overweight and scraggly),a CIA vet in the Middle East who slowly senses that his government is quietly guiding situations in the region to befit an upcoming blockbuster petroleum deal,Bryan Woodman(MAtt Damon,still looks about fifteen),a business analyst whose family endures tragedy at the palatial home of a Arab emir, a corporate lawyer named Bennett Holiday(Jeffrey Wright,becoming a solid chameleon-like actor)who may or may not have moral qualm and some sway over the fate of said oil deal,and the lives of two ground-level Islamic national petroleum workers who are laid off in the acquisition(I do not recall their names or the actors who played them,but they were quite effective and sympathetic),are the focal points and points of view at which the movie runs. The story takes great pains to show that the mundane,seemingly innocuous events and the seemingly monotone,droning goings-on of men in suits and stuffed shirts have enormous impact on the area they so blithely disregard as being simply money,assets and crude. It also gives a glimpse into how radical Islam uses people,like the disaffected unemployed workers,to be pawns in their attempts to strike blows in Western capitalism and overfed,entropic Arabic royal families,whose opulence and corruption further exacerbates the nations where they rule. The pacing is dreadfully slow,as was in Traffic,and I think that is purposeful. As said before,this effect is employed to give the viewer the sense that much is going on without the viewer necessarily witness to it,and that out of the ordinary can bloom forth jarring, consequential results. As a viewing experience,I can honestly I've had better experiences,but I appreciated the message and the intelligence this movie provides.Good,almost passing performances by a supporting cast that includes(but is not limited to)Amanda Peet(As Damon's distressed wife),Peter Gerety(as the top dog in the oil corporate merger),Chris Cooper(as one of the CEOs,a brash and impatient businessman.Effective!),Alexander Siddig(as a reform-minded prince and apparent first-in-line heir to the throne),Christopher Plummer(as Wright's immediate boss) and Tim Blake Nelson(as an out-of-control exec who sets the tone for the movie's moral) frame this film well. I cannot say that this was either a favorite of mine nor can I say it was a great,great movie. It's actually quite difficult to sit through,both because of a lack of consistent stimulation and painful-to-watch situations. But this is an IMPORTANT film,that will should provoke thoughts and conversation for anyone who has even the vaguest amount of interest in the fuel they use and how it is acquired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contrary to what the critics have been saying, watching Syriana need not be a frustrating exercise in wrestling with a hopelessly complicated plot. The key is in constructing the big picture in logical steps, finding a proper niche for each of what seem so be an endless parade of characters, and separating the essential from the peripheral.A scene at the beginning, lasting for less than one minute, explains clearly about 90% of the complicated plot. This is when law firm big shot Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) gives personal instructions to a hand-picked man in his firm, Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) on a specific assignment. In a few crisp words, he articulates the situation, and concludes by hoping that Holiday, in contrary to many of the people in his firm, is a lion among sheep.At the center of the plot is a sibling rivalry, one which happens to be of global significance as the brothers are Prince Nasir Al-Subaai (Alexander Siddig) and Prince Meshal Al-Subaai, sons of a Middle East Emir (king) in possession of internationally coveted oil fields. With older brother Nasir being pro-China and younger brother Meshal pro-US, the delicate balance eventually hangs in the decision of the aging king on who will succeed him. This is the central plot around which everything evolves.Starting with the simpler side, Prince Nasir is an idealist who believes in developing a modern system for handling and profiting from his country's rich resources, and using the profits to build a better, modernized country. His chief external financial consultant and is a small American firm, represented by Switzerland-based young financial analyst Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), ambitious and hungry as any smart, up-and-rising financial wiz would be. Prince Nasir's dealing with China is not covered in any detail, but just enough to provide a general backdrop.More complicated is scheming Prince Meshal's involvement with the US. An underdog almost by definition as a younger brother, he is opportunistic and does not have the vision of his brother. When cunning old hand Whiting slyly dangles the bait, asking how he can help the younger prince to become king, the unscrupulous princeling swallows it hook, line and sinker, and is destined to become the US's pawn in this deadly game for oil. Plummer's performance in this scene, set in a luxury yacht somewhere on the French coast, is absolutely brilliant.Then there is more. When Whiting gives his initial instructions to Holiday, he mentions not only the oil-rich country, but also a pending merger of two American corporations, huge Connex with smaller Killen, which however has managed to acquire some crucial drilling rights (via dubious means). Holiday's specific assignment, which I mentioned earlier, is to run due diligence on the merger, but goes deeper, including handling the thorny US Justice Department which may in the final analysis want to approve the merger but could make things difficult. While all these parties ? the princeling, the law firm, the two corporations and the US Government ? seem to have a common ultimate objective, they all have selfish motivations. This is the part where it may not be worthwhile, or even necessary, for the audience to completely connect all the details. Suffices to be aware that there are conspiracies, corruption and betrayal in abundance along the way.And we haven't yet come to the guy who won Oscar best supporting actor. George Clooney plays an efficient, seasoned, closed-lipped CIA agent Bob Barnes, who has been carrying out assignment after assignment (some rather dirty) with cool efficiency and mechanical precision. But we do get a glimpse of the weary individual behind facing a midlife identity crisis. His is a tragic story. As things don't work out the way his bosses want, they are ready to drop him, as they would a used car, without blinking an eyelid. His perseverance in looking for answers eventually leads him to a collision course with a force too vastly powerful for him too take on, as he is tries to help Prince Nasir.There is one final key character, linked to the main plot in only a very loose sense, but important in providing another dimension in looking at the entire picture. This is "imported" Pakistani labourer Wasim (Mazha Munir) who comes to the oil fields with his father simply to find work, but ends up involved with radical elements in reckless terrorist acts.All this is only a brief outline, but sufficient to anchor the proliferation of characters and events. One critic describes Syriana as snap shots. On average a scene lasts for maybe two minutes tops, and that is really the only way this movie can be effectively presented. On top of those already mentioned, there are tons of other characters played by big-name stars (William Hurt, Chris Cooper), rising new talents (Amanda Peet) as well as relative unknowns. They may not be deeply memorable, but all leave a distinct impression, due to a large extent to consistently solid performances.This movie is realistic enough to look like a chilling documentary and exciting enough to be a top-flight thriller. One of the bests in 2005.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is Syriana an important political film? Is it a good movie after all? Does it give the audience a glimpse at the truth? I do not really think so! Let us start with the political aspects. Is it in fact a surprise that the west (U.S. and Europe and Japan and Australia!) tries to influence the political situation in middle east? Is it really a new information to anyone that "states" like Saudi Arabia are in no way democratic? That states like this are in fact exploiting the resources of their country without taking care for their people.I think everyone can easily know this. One just has to watch the news from time to time. What do you really think happened in Iran (Mossadek), in Saudi Arabia, in Iraq? What about the tragic story of the two Pakistani youngsters? Is this truly the way, how terrorists are made? This is at least doubtful! The terrorists of 9/11 were all (extremely) well educated people. They were not unemployed, not poor! Osama Bin Laden was a rich man! Many suicide bombers were at least middle class people. It is in fact way too simple to tell us, just take uneducated, jobless guys, give them an education and a religion, and one can turn them into everything! U.S. should be full of (afro-american) terrorists! Well, I might think the political and social information is bad. But what about the storyline. Does that give the movie some grandezza? Does anyone like the sub-plot of the guy, whose child is killed and thus enters the Arab-business? Or the prince-reformer (incl. womens lib!) who is killed by the U.S. Killed by a cruise missile or what? Do we find here a Science Fiction element? Is there any character that is more than stereotype? I did not feel any empathy or sympathy for any of the persons! They were all introduced as cardboard figures. No human dimension at all.Was the acting cool? I do not understand why Clooney got this role and not Vincent D'Onofrio. All Clooney did was being a perfect D'Onofrio impostor. And the rest of the cast remained shallow. Reason: Storyline, see above.And finally pictures? At times, real great. Most of the time somewhat undecided: produce a photographic piece of cinema or a straight political thing? Syriana isn't bad. But it is very limited. And by far not reaching deep enough!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A puzzle which produces a clear picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie which demands you look at he big picture, because if you only look at the individual pieces, not only will you get bogged down but you'll lose track of who's who and how they fit. At the end, stand back and look at the puzzle...all the pieces fit and it's not a pretty picture. If you study each little piece of the puzzle as they are given to you, not only will you not see the picture clearly, you won't even get all the pieces to fit.There is the loud "bang" of a warning being sounded here, deftly. What rings in one's ears, even louder than the explosion that goes off in the first few minutes of the movie is the brilliant dialog. If you hear one good soliloquy in most of today's movies, designed for minds used only to 5 second sound bites, you're lucky. This movie has several and they all are very pithy.The movie is about a game--- "Let's play international oiligarchy." It is based on fact, but, as far as we know, is fiction. What we do know is this is how the world works and we are all a part of it. Every time you buy a gallon of gas, you play. In fact, every time you buy anything, except what your next door neighbor might grow or make, you play, for it took gasoline to get it to you and that gasoline is a part of the world's oil market.Syriana says we, as a nation, are manipulating governments, installing puppet potentates and sponsoring "regime change" in order to keep cheap oil flowing to the U.S. The result of that manipulation is a world filled with terror and, in many quarters, hatred of the U.S. This movie deals with the serpentine deals made with duplicitous rulers and the outcome of that alliance for them and for us, eventually.The flow of the movie is quick, sure footed and seamless. We watch people from several regions of the world all involved in the production of oil and its distribution. People are killed, brutally tortured, betrayed, indicted and rewarded, all based upon how big their pieces of the puzzle were at that moment. But each must realize that the size of his stake in the game can change at any moment and each must be careful or he can be removed from the game all together. We watch the Fed. Govt. go after corrupt oil execs, but charge only scapegoats. We watch the CIA get caught with its pants down, but just toss one of their operatives to the wolves to escape unscathed. We watch as one the NSA drones explodes the car of an emir we call a terrorist only because he wants to deal with the Chinese instead of the U.S. We watch as desperate men, having lost their jobs because of a U.S. take-over, form a terrorist cell and bomb our facilities. We watch as the international events unfold just as they do in real life...only we are told, at the end of the movie, this is fiction. Does art imitate life, or life imitate art?For viewers who enjoy elaborate, well crafted plots, political intrigue, mystery, fine acting, fine script writing and positing on contemporaneous events, this is a very fine movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want my... (how long was it?) ... 127 minutes back, and my $6 rental fee too.The plot elements were pure fiction, so why are there so many comments on this board whose authors seem to think this was a documentary, or a news item. This movie does not in any way resemble the world we live in, so we can gain no useful information about the world by watching it.Given that it's fiction, where exactly was the story? There was no story, just a bunch of stuff that happened -- oops, a bunch of stuff that never happened.The character development was very poor. No character appears to have more than one dimension - a single motivation - a single track to their brain. Nobody works anything significant out, nobody appears to have any degree of happiness or fulfillment to their lives for more than a couple of lines in the film, and nothing worthwhile is ultimately achieved. Human individuals are represented as helpless disposable pawns with no valid contribution or destiny that they can choose to any benefit.True art is meant to enhance us in some way. We are supposed walk away from the art seeing the world as a benevolent place for good and able people, and carry with us the feeling that we as individuals can create something good and worthwhile with our lives.Syriana leaves me in despair that such a poorly intended and executed film won an award. It's nothing but totally wrong on every level:It's the metaphysical equivalent of conning a a widowed grandmother out or her home, the epistemological equivalent of a lobotomy, the political equivalent of pornography, the ethical equivalent of a snuff film, and the artistic equivalent of Dada. I want to erase it from my memory.</fullReview>

As such this film was non partisan and tastefully done,... powerful in its message but subtle in delivering it it in an interesting intertwining story line.

While the film is very well-made, the plot is far too meandering and drawn-out, and it becomes clear that paying attention throughout is key to figuring out what the hell is going on. There are many different story lines involving many different characters, all tied to the central theme of oil in the Middle East, but there's never a real sense of connection between them all. In fact, several of the characters, and at least one full storyline, could have been cut loose without any real damage done to the film. A more centered story, and quicker pace, would have done this film very well and made it that much better.I actually thought Clooney was very good - the best in the film - and didn't find his performance overrated at all. It was very subtle at times, quite a transformation from his usual roles. The acting was solid all-around, it's just too bad the story wavered so much. When it was good, it was very, very good. However, it quickly lost my interest by attempting to add depth to all the characters, something which slowed the film down dramatically. I would have preferred to focus on one character/storyline - specifically Clooney's character's - and then showed how the other stories tied in to that. Just my thoughts.I actually found the direction very mediocre. The shaky cam is started to irritate me, as I prefer well-executed shots instead of the 'realistic' cinematography that the shaky cam offers us. I guess it worked well for this film, but I don't find it all that great. The visuals are okay if a bit underwhelming. I did like how they cut away from the explosions at the end instead of showing us a big effects shot - quite effective. The dialogue itself was quite good at times, but it, like the plot, strayed too far from the story sometimes. The acting, as I mentioned, was very good.Overall, a very disappointing film. Though it is very well-made, with an interesting story and great acting, it quickly lost my interest through a confusing plot and a dragging pace. I can recognize that this is a good film, but I can't bring myself to appreciate it at that. It just didn't enthrall me or bring me into the story at all - I frankly didn't care for the characters. This film lacked emotion in a big way, something that would have done it good. Flawed but worthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this is an excellent, thought-provoking movie. The script is good, the performances are good. The storyline needs to be told. However, the extreme complexity - mentioned in just about every comment - is really unnecessary. There are five or six separate convergent threads which demand some very careful attention to detail from the audience. I dare say these threads help to solidify the book (which I haven't read). But in the movie, there's too much. At least one, maybe two of the threads could have been cut entirely without missing the point of the movie. My vote would be to cut out Matt Damon's family issues from the movie - ditto for Jeffrey Wright's character. However, if you are prepared for very complex, intellectually stimulating political thriller, this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corruption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Gaghan's "Syriana" is a fascinating, though heavily slanted, look at America, Iran, and the dependence on Middle Eastern oil. It is a film that many will see as political statement, because it does have one, but can also be enjoyed as a fast-paced thriller. The film focuses heavily on elements of corruption, greed and deceit that exists in the oil industry and America today. George Clooney, who has a lead role and is also credited as an executive producer, gives a strong performance as a CIA Agent tasked with assassinating a Middle Eastern prince. The film focuses on several other story lines also, with characters weaving in and out of each-others lives. A married man with two sons, played by Matt Damon in his most believable role since "Saving Private Ryan", becomes the financial adviser for the prince, but at the loss of his wife. Jeffrey Wright plays an attorney having to reconcile his moral beliefs with a corporation focused solely on financial gain. Chris Cooper works for this company, Connex Oil, who merge with another oil company to become the fifth largest in the world. As this merge occurs, workers in Lebanon are told that their jobs are no longer existent, and their immigration permits are now void. One of these workers becomes involved in a terrorist organization. "Syriana" is a very well-made film; it is the kind of movie that keeps you striving to keep up with it's many twists and turns. The film is a good one to view with someone who has an interest in current events, because, even if you strongly disagree with the messages and agenda it is promoting, it is impossible that you would not have something to discuss after wards. The movie is not anti-American, but it does teeter dangerously close on the border. It portrays the American Govt. as corrupt, spineless money-mongers that abandon their men and kill off good people. I disagree with those that say it portrays Islamic extremists in a good light, as I did not find it pro-Iranian, but thought that the terrorism element only added to the drama of the the film. For those going to see "Syriana" know this: it is a heavily liberal film that makes capitalist Americans look like pigs, but also many other peoples too. The director does a good job, however, of not taking it to far, and compromising the entertainment values of the film for a statement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but maybe over edited?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some helpful comments here. I'll try not to repeat them. The film starts with Clooney, a CIA hit man, dealing with weapons. It swings to a Mideastern Emir's family, the family of Matt Damon, an energy analyst living in Geneva, Steven Wright, an attorney with a company representing various oil companies.I'll repeat what others have said: that the film is confusing. One switched from one place to another, without, frankly, enough continuity.There are characters in the film the purpose of whom confuse me. As someone else pointed out, Matt Damon's young son is killed when he jumps into a swimming pool in which the light has a loose connection. Except that that incident added some tension to the script, I'm not sure how much purpose he served.Then there's Steven Writght's roommate. It is obvious that he doesn't approve of Wright's actions. But is he Wright's father? His roomie? His lover? It may have helped a little to describe who that character was )except that he, again, obviously objected to Wright's actions.One thing the film had prodded me to do is read the book on which it is based: See No Evil. At the end of the film the screen reads that it is based on fact, though the characters are fictional. (That's not a spoiler, is it?) I think I'll read the book and find how many shenanigans, over and about our present "war," are more than travesty. Oh, and chances are, I'll see the film again. Yes,it does somewhat represent Traffic, though that film, dealing with the drug market, had a potentially happier ending...a little more hope anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but hard to follow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wonderfully believable film with fine performances and great production values, rich in insight. However, the narrative thread was too broken for me to follow. I got lost in the number of characters--all nicely realized and believable--but the focus did not stay with any one of them long enough to tell a coherent story. Adding to the feeling of being lost and jerked about abruptly, I could never tell if the immediate setting were Switzerland or Spain or Pakistan or Washington unless it were labeled. One result of all this jumping about was that the people were opaque at critical times. My husband and I are still arguing about whether the Matt Damon character was "in" on the final evil plot or not. Some business characters' relationships to the doings of the CIA and to each other are still confusing to me, in particular the Christopher Plummer character. I didn't understand the significance of the title. Does it have something to do with Syria? If so, this doesn't make much sense since Syria's presence was limited to the Hezbollah in BeirutThe interlocking corruption of corporate oil, governmental policy makers and a US intelligence agency is certainly an important story to tell. But shouldn't it be a bit more intelligible? Not everyone processes at lightning speed. I didn't even have time to read the message left behind for Bob in the torture chamber. And I'm a very fast reader.Some extraneous stuff could have been left out to direct the attention more purposefully. Even some good stuff. Like Bob's teen son's laments and the kids trying to eat fake bacon.A film is not a novel. It can't cover as much ground and therefore shouldn't try. The two and a quarter hours (approximately) should have been used to tell one story intelligibly. This film would have made a better TV series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana (2005)The second time around I still found the plot a bit demanding, and it seems that if you want to enjoy the movie, do pay attention, but also don't fret every detail. Above all, this a movie about the chilling ambiance of international oil politics and corporate criminality.George Clooney headlines the film, and he has an important role, but it's intermittent. Part of the appeal of this movie is all the plot lines, each convincing in its own way. There are stellar performances--Christopher Plummer is just chilling--but they rise even further because of the stellar writing. And kudos here go to the director himself, Stephen Gaghan, who wrote the screenplay. (He also wrote the screenplay for "Traffic,"which is terrific, wrote and directed "Abandon," which is not.)The constantly shifting, unreliable, larger than you imagine world of these people really is felt deeply in the writing and photography. I can't remember a more convincing portrayal of a world that we all know nothing directly about (most of us, that is), but which we are forced to picture, and there it is, slimy and seductive, dangerous and weirdly isolated, and most of all, unreadable. Even more than "Babel," we get a feeling here of an inability to understand one another--from the political side to the corporate one, from the Western European and American side to the Arab one. Of course, some of this is intentional--the greed is good speech of this movie is "corruption is good" more or less, and it points out just how much evil (quote unquote) the corporations and government seem to unleash behind a smokescreen of pretenses of justice. That is, the chasing of one injustice covers up the perpetration of another.See this movie. Be patient. Watch it twice. I almost think it's an "important" movie (and with Clooney acting and Soderbergh producing, this might not be an accident), and its certainly an affecting one. It's flawed, it's sometimes confusing, but it's so often dead on unsettling and persuasive, it drags the whole right up to something special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie this Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best movie I have seen not only this year but possibly in my life, and I have seen some good one's. Gaghan's last effort Traffic was amongst them, but while Traffic was good - this movie is great.The story lines which at first seem to be barely connected join at the end with an emotional finish that packs a very powerful punch. The ensemble cast is very good but there are three outstanding performances. The first is from Clooney. I have to say I never rated him as that great at heavy drama, but he is more than great in this film, he is outstanding. A very fine performance, in fact the finest he has ever given in my opinion. His distress at the position's he is forced into is restrained but palpable. Every time he is on the screen you can feel just from the way he moves what his character is going through. The second outstanding performance is from Matt Damon. Another whose emotions are barely contained beneath his facade. But in his case his performance was simply what I have come to expect from this very talented actor, who - in my opinion - should steer clear of scripts like 'The Brothers Grim' in future and stick to these sort of dramatic roles. He is infinitely superior in them. The third outstanding performance was not from the third actor on the posters, Jeffery Wright - though he is very fine in his own right. But from Alexander Siddig, an actor I knew vaguely from my brother's obsession with Star Trek. This was another beautiful performance which once again was far superior to what I was expecting. It would have been easy for him to make this character very two-dimensional, almost cartoon-like as the good Arab in a world of bad one's. Instead he gives a very finely-crafted performance of a man who is trying to change a world gone wrong. A patriot searching for a better world. But at the same time there is a slight edge of danger to this character, just the slightest hint in the early scenes that he may not be who he seems. But he is. And it is fortunate that neither the actor nor the filmmakers turned this character into something exceptional. There are no rousing speeches to wonderful stirring music, there is a just a humble, intelligent man trying to make a difference. Trying to survive. And that is what makes this movie so good. It doesn't shove facts and figures down your throat, it simply gives you real people struggling in a world crazy for Oil and full of extremists of every stripe. It is also good to see that the film does not cast the CIA as all powerful and all-knowing. Instead they do shady deals in back room's with those that they would wish you to believe are evil in order to get rid of a more immediate threat. Lack of Oil.The storyline and actors are helped by some wonderful camera-work and direction. Stephen Gaghan has created a masterpiece that rather than not seeing evil - sees evil everywhere. A movie that everyone should go and see. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I get it. And, for the most part, I even enjoy it as a film. The weaving of the stories is handled exceptionally. The acting is often brilliant. Many of the beautifully shot scenes transport me to the Middle East.Perhaps I understand it too well. Some reviewers have said that this is a complex film that shows that there are no good guys. Others have said that it is just typical Hollywood fare created to bash conservatives. I found the film neither complex nor typical conservative bashing; it is patently offensive. How can anyone say that Syriana captures the complexity of the issues? It isn't complex. There's a villain, the United States, and a hero, the good prince who is killed by the United States. As such, this film makes a perfect propaganda piece for everyone in the Middle East who wants to kill Americans. And propaganda is seldom complex.Like most Americans, I love my Arab brothers and sisters. I know soldiers who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq with a gained respect for Muslim beliefs and culture. These are men who risk their lives to help people like the good prince in this film.Today, I have an Arab living in my home. Although I am not Muslim, I have been celebrating Ramadhan with my friend by fasting from sunrise to sunset for 30 days. Perhaps my fasting has distorted my judgment, but I see very little goodness in any of the the power hungry and money grabbing Americans portrayed in this film. This film portrays an exceptional young Arab prince; it glorifies a suicide bombing by a saintly young Muslim boy; and it says that Americans are simply greedy, cold-hearted killers.In a world where ignorance, fueled by propaganda, causes so much death and destruction, why would anyone want to create more ignorance?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, but hardly watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana paints a disturbing picture about what happens behind the scenes of the oil industry, on a geo-political level. At least, I guess it does. Because frankly, as a film I find it hardly watchable. New characters pop up every minute, and they hardly (if at all) get introduced. It's all so confusing you can hardly keep track of what's happening. I watched this film with 3 University schooled people who have a fair knowledge of international politics, and above-average experience in watching 'intelligent' and 'non-Hollywood' films. But neither of us could really say he understood the entire story and who was who. If it was the goal of the film to portray the story with all it's characters as cloudy and confusing as these geo-political processes tend to be, then it would be a good film in an arty pretentious kinda way, but I doubt that's the case. Maybe it's described in the film script who's who, and then maybe it would be a good idea to offer that film script accompanying the film next time. Because, I suppose Syriana wasn't supposed to be solely an essay on the oil industry and international politics. Maybe a book would have been a more suitable medium for that. I just assume Syriana was also supposed to be a watchable film, and on that level I really can't give it more than a 6 out of 10, and I think I'm being very forgiving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film's premise is so simple and obvious that only a Texas millionaire high on oil fumes and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if someone shouted it across the proverbial parking lot. In summary: the oil business is in cahoots with The Government (or Gummint if you prefer), the Gummint is in cahoots with Middle Eastern despots, and the CIA is a singular festering pool of double dealing sons-of-(insert word) willing to toe any line that comes their way. The only people that get done over are the good ones, like Mr Clooney ("Bob"). Oh, and terrorism is a result of the poverty which globalization creates when wicked multinationals stalk the world looking for a tasty takeover or three . That really fits to the profiles of the well-heeled 9/11 perpetrators.In Syriana this facile tissue of political half-truths and Hollywood holograms is stirred up in a repugnant vermicelli of story strands that twist, turn and whirl through the gloopy circumlocutions of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion that: 1. the "director" (good joke) should never be let near a camera again 2. people like Clooney and Hurt might know how to act, but they sure don't know how to pick a script 3. if you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big business and the state, go and see Claude Chabrol's "L'ivresse du pouvoir", which is insightful, funny and brilliantly acted. Empty, doom-laden sententious piffle spun out to evening-ruining length.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contrary to most other comments about "Syriana" on the IMDb web-site, I and my family found watching this film on DVD at home a complete waste of time and space.In short, this was a film based on a script whose writer was being too clever by far. Rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner, it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30-second vignettes of different story-lines from a dozen or so "story-lines" at the audience made for great and clear viewing. No, sir, it does not. What does make for great viewing is total clarity, precision, plots and story-lines - and characterisations - which have a beginning, a middle, and an end.This kind of cinematic presentation - akin to the Dim Sum experience in a Chinese restaurant - is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme.Thank goodness, then, for the TV and DVD presentations of the Hollywood and British film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers, director, and actors knew the value of clear story telling, diction, and acting that meant something.This is one DVD that this family will not be sitting through again.</fullReview>

For those of us who realize that it doesn't take killing off a good guy to make a point, we'll stick to other movies. In summary, this was a horrible attempt at an 'Ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to- think movie because not only do you not know what's going on, nobody who made the movie did either.

		<fullReview>"Syriana" has to be one of the most disappointing films of last year. Here is a movie that's supposed to be very smart and show great insight into contemporary politics, but I found it a boring mess. It's not just that the movie is intentionally confusing, jumping between four different plot lines that involve much shady double-dealing. It's that none of these stories is told in a sufficiently interesting way to make you want to figure out the connections between the various threads.I expected "Syriana" to be like "Munich," another recent film that treated Middle Eastern politics in an intelligent way. But "Munich" was much more successful as a piece of entertainment, with an exciting thriller plot and more fully developed characters. The people in "Syriana" are just pawns in a diplomatic game, and maybe that's the point, but it doesn't make them interesting to watch. Moreover, when the filmmakers attempt to add human interest (e.g. a family tragedy befalls Matt Damon's character), it doesn't work. The ending sequence is nicely suspenseful, and ties some of the disparate plot lines together, but the movie takes much too long to get there.The worst (that is, the most boring) of the four story lines is the one where Jeffrey Wright plays a lawyer investigating possible corruption in an American oil company merger. It's very difficult to make this kind of material cinematic, and writer/director Gaghan doesn't succeed. Many of the characters involved in this plot make speeches that are meant to be thought- provoking, but they come out of nowhere and are just as quickly forgotten. Better is the story about the young man training to be a terrorist: it's easy to follow, and shows us something not usually depicted in movies. Still, sandwiched between the other plot lines, it feels like a shallow exploration of how terrorists are made.George Clooney, with his beard and weight gain, is certainly unrecognizable in his role as CIA employee Bob Barnes, and his acting is competent. But if he hadn't been involved in "Goodnight and Good Luck" this same year, I doubt he would have won the Oscar for this performance. Even here, he is outshone by Alexander Siddig, who plays Nasir, a reformist Arab prince. In a movie that tries to show the complexities and gray areas of Middle Eastern oil politics, Nasir is perhaps the most complex of all: spoiled and ambitious, but with noble ideals.Also, for a movie that wants to be an intelligent exploration of the oil industry, why is the Iraq war mentioned only once, in a throwaway line?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Syriana was one of last year's most anticipated and yet disappointing movies. The only recurring thought I had while watching was, "Huh?" The plot, in a nutshell, is conspiracy, American foreign policy in the Middle East, and lots of oil. CIA cooperative George Clooney gains twenty pounds and learns to make Arabic sounds but has yet to pronounce a single comprehensible word, let alone have a clue about the culture. He visits a Beirut I've never been to; a Beirut where militiamen occupy every single rooftop and drag Americans out of service cabs, tear out their fingernails and then set them free.The movie aims to shed some light on America's meddling in the Gulf. A respectable cause except that it goes as far as showing a scene of the American army targeting a Gulf prince via a satellite missile because he was too "idealistic". I'm pretty sure that's not standard procedure. Young oil broker Matt Damon is the only watchable character in the film, torn between his family, his career and unveiling the truth.I would have given the writers credit for at least trying to show the other side of the story, but I can't even do that. The whole thing just seems like another political sensationalization. Criticizing American policy in an unconvincing and far-fetched manner is exactly the same as painting every Arab, or in this case, Pakistani, as a terrorist. Do some real research for God's sake.</fullReview>

But I hate the snobbery that's associated with this type of film, this school of thought that says anyone who didn't fully understand it or anyone who didn't enjoy it must be thick.I'm happy to go on record as saying this was a big pile of boring, boring crap.I saw one IMDb review saying that this wasn't for anyone who enjoyed 'Wedding Crashers'. I haven't seen that particular film myself, but what's wrong with enjoying a comedy? Isn't that what cinema is about - entertainment? Sure, it's good to be challenged once in a while, or for a film to depress or disillusion you at points. But in the end, there must be some sort of entertainment value, some degree of escapism or connection to characters.And there isn't with 'Syriana'. No entertainment value whatsoever, no excitement. Just a bunch of boring, dry characters discussing oil business and situations in the Persian Gulf. A lot like sitting through a two hour lecture or exam. The dialogue is nigh impenetrable, the acting is rigid, and...nothing much happens. The odd explosion, death or torture aside, it's just talking. Talking. Talking. Blah blah blah. I found myself looking at my watch a good five or six times, just wondering when this would end.The whole thing feels like it was written by the head of BP or Shell, a man who knows the oil business upside-down, inside-out, but couldn't write a decent film with a gun at his head. Which doesn't really make sense given the fact that it was written by the guy who did 'Traffic', but there ya go.It's just so, so, so boring, and dry like the Sahara desert. The credits started rolling and every single person in the audience was completely silent - it was one of the most awkward moments I've ever sat through in my life. It was two things - A) a collective sigh of relief, and B) the feeling that you didn't want to be the first one to admit you didn't understand it / you thought it was shite.For the next hour after leaving the cinema, the four of us (me, my girlfriend, my mum and dad) ranted and ranted and ranted about what a horrible waste of two hours that was. Just boring, boring, boring beyond belief. And I'm going to discuss this film at length for weeks to come - I'll warn everyone I know to avoid it at all costs, and should I happen to meet anyone who liked it, I'll ask them "Why? What did you enjoy?"I think anyone would be hard pushed to come up with an answer that wasn't "Well, it was a challenging expose of how big oil businesses..."Not really a reason to enjoy a film, is it?So, to steal from the Sunday Telegraph reviewer who once said that there are two types of people in the world - those who have read Lord Of The Rings, and those who intend to - I've coined my own phrase to summarise this film. There are two types of people in this world - those who won't enjoy 'Syriana', and those who will pretend to enjoy 'Syriana'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I couldn't even finish it, and I really tried. Made Freddy Got Fingered look like a masterpiece. I figured with the all-star cast I couldn't go wrong. The next time I want to toss away 4 dollars, I will definitely do it on a gallon of premium gasoline for my sports car. The acting wasn't bad, just the movie lacked...well about everything that movies are suppose to do. Which is entertainment. But this is only my opinion, and about 10 others I talked to. It was enough to make me sign up for an IMDb account to let others know to beware of this flick. You will get nothing but disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I have never watch a movie completely and then wondered what it was I just saw. Maybe its above my intellectual ability to comprehend, but I had no idea what happened in this movie. It was a very choppy movie with about 30 different stories going on that never connected with one another. There are things that happened in the movie that happened for no apparent reason in the plot of the story. I don't believe that even was a plot. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. If anyone can tell me what happened, I would be grateful to know. Its the worst three dollars I have ever spent in my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Art of Incoherence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can a movie be THIS compelling and engrossing, yet still be so difficult to follow? That is the question I found myself asking all the way through "Syriana," a fascinating political thriller that keeps you riveted to your seat for well over two hours yet is almost completely incomprehensible for most of that running time. The mark of a great filmmaker usually lies in how well he is able to illuminate a complex subject for a less-than-enlightened or essentially uninformed audience. In this case, however, writer/director Stephen Gaghan's refusal - or is it inability? - to unravel the entanglements in his narrative somehow works in the movie's favor. Is it because the subject matter itself is so messy and incoherent that the presentation of it needs to be as well? Whatever the case, "Syriana" is a wholly riveting and absorbing cinematic experience - even if only a tiny percentage of it makes any real sense. (And don't forget that coherence of plot, in and of itself, is not necessarily a prerequisite for a quality film. After all, it's widely admitted that the screenplay for "The Big Sleep" is virtually impossible to figure out, yet that film is considered a classic).Based on the book by Robert Baer, Gaghan's tale takes us to the dark heart of international oil politics, where strategies are planned and deals are struck, often at the expense of individual freedoms and the snuffing out of thousands of innocent lives. Gaghan shows us the behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing, power politics, corporate corruption, governmental malfeasance, human exploitation and personal betrayals that go into filling up the gas tanks of our SUVs. In this turbulent Middle Eastern world of sectarian strife, arms deals and acts of terror, Gaghan finds little room for good guys or heroes, although he does imply that heroic ACTS may indeed be possible. Instead, he shows how all of us, to some degree or another, share in this shame.Rather than taking a purely linear approach in his narrative (which would certainly have made things more understandable) , Gaghan, as he did in "Traffic," provides us with an assortment of characters and story lines that often seem arbitrary and disconnected from one another. This is primarily why the confusion arises, for we are often whisked from one subplot to another before the first has been fully explicated. The film is something like a mosaic; it doesn't really matter if every single detail doesn't attain complete clarity as long as we are able to pull back and focus our eyes on the big picture Gaghan shows us.There's not much point in trying to relate the fine points of the complex plot here. Suffice it to say that the film is filled with vivid scenes and memorable moments, as well as outstanding performances by George Clooney, Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper, Amanda Peet, Kayvan Novak, Amr Waked and many others.By plunging headlong into the most timely and important issue of our time - the violent clash between Western secularism and Muslim extremism - "Syriana" certainly establishes itself as one of the bravest and best movies of 2005. However, it may take a few additional viewings on the part of the head-scratchers to convince THEM of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oil Companies Under Fire in Politically Charged But Overly Convoluted Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have read Kenneth Pollack's penetrating book about the current political malaise in Iran, "The Persian Puzzle: The Conflict Between Iran and America", you will have some idea of what writer-director Stephen Gaghan is attempting to portray in this tightly paced, atmospheric but ultimately confusing thriller. The movie's social commitment is impressive, but the narrative is so fragmented and some actions so vaguely motivated that the result is unfortunately something of a muddle for much of its 126-minute running time. By traipsing the globe in brief scenes one after the other, Gaghan attempts to peel the layers off the complex and often corrupt relationships among American oil companies, intelligence agencies, the government and the ruling class of the oil-rich Persian Gulf. With its shaky hand-held camera-work and lightning-quick pacing, the movie bears a striking similarity to Stephen Soderbergh's version of "Traffic" (he is an executive producer here) but not in terms of its dramatic resonance.There are at least four separate stories that intertwine through the various locales, most intriguingly in a fictional Arab country where one of two sons is about to become the ruling emir. Which one is selected has direct bearing on a high-profile merger between two oil companies in Texas. There is another subplot focused on a Pakistani oil worker whose frustrations with the oil companies lead him toward drastic measures. None of these strands are very clear at the outset, nor how they are interrelated. I kept hoping there would be a more lucid portrayal of the volatile Middle East situation amid the military forces and oil companies. Instead, like what Fernando Meirelles does with "The Constant Gardener", which has a similar disregard for the major pharmaceutical companies in Africa, Gaghan seems to be going for a more visceral tone to drive his story, and on that level, it works.What also works is the stellar acting even if the characters are so elliptical in motivation that you need a playbook to keep up with their stories. The three leads are quite effective. As Bob Barnes, a rogue CIA operative respected for his experience but alienated by his entrepreneurial approach to his work, George Clooney appears to be evolving nicely into character roles that stretch his skills. Through soulful gazes and some brutalizing scenes of torture, he is able to convey his character's conscience with a minimum of fuss. Matt Damon is ideally cast as Bryan Woodman, a derivatives trader and global finance expert who provides guidance to the "good" son, a progressive Arab prince who really wants to restructure his country's economy for lasting benefit to its citizenry. Jeffrey Wright continues to impress as Bennett Holiday, an ambitious Washington lawyer ordered by his boss to not only vet the oil merger but rubber stamp it. Intriguingly, all three characters have been given more personal profiles - Barnes has a college-age son with whom he feels estranged, Woodman goes through the loss of a child, and Holiday has a resentful alcoholic father - but none of these dimensions are explored with any depth.Gaghan has certainly assembled an extensive cast, and there are solid contributions from Alexander Siddig as the reform-minded Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, Chris Cooper as one of the oil company CEOs, Christopher Plummer as Holiday's corrupt boss, Jayne Atkinson as the poker-faced CIA division chief, and Amanda Peet as Woodman's inconsolable wife. In even smaller roles are stalwarts such as William Hurt, David Clennon and an emphatic Tim Blake Nelson. Despite the film's intentions and often powerful execution, I just wish the film was far less convoluted and the storyline more streamlined within its framework. By the way, one of many unexplained details is the title, Syriana, which is a Washington insider term referring to the notion that the US can recast developing nations in our own image.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>phony premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the film's central themes involves the emerging nature of a relationship between big oil in the US and in the Mid-East. In fact, there is nothing emergent about this relationship; it is as mature as a 50 year old French Bordeaux. The Bush family and other powerful families in the US oil industry have enjoyed cozy relationships with the Saudis and others like them for decades. So for me the sense of reality most people talk about regarding this film is completely phony, reducing the film to an elaborate cartoon. The film-maker would have been better served if he had told a traditional three-act story within the context of the cross-cultural elitism that typifies relations between the aristocracies in the US and other oil rich nations. The truth is that such people completely ignore 99 percent of the world population's needs in order to line their own pockets. A story told whereby the director endeavored to make the audience feel thusly ignored would have been much more unsettling and effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you like puzzles? I do. I work crosswords, encryptions and sudoku. I think that's one reason I liked Syriana. But this movie left me puzzled.Do you like movies with convincing acting, and character development. I do. I think that's another reason I liked Syriana. But who all of the characters were, and what characters were not revealed in the movie left me puzzled.Do you like movies with mysteries, and with a credible backdrop of events relevant to today's world? I do. That's another good reason to like Syriana.I think you get the idea. Syriana is a very good movie, but with so many characters and inter-related plots that it is difficult to assemble all of the pieces. You definitely get the main idea though: oil is all-important, and whomever controls oil gets very rich and powerful.George Clooney, Matt Damon, Christopher Carter, et al., are a terrific ensemble cast that portray their characters very convincingly. Their stories are told separately and coalesce at the end of the movie, much like in "Traffic" and many other contemporary movies. Who are the "good guys" in this movie one may ask. That's difficult to discern. Maybe there aren't any (and maybe there aren't any bad guys either; or, maybe they're all bad guys.) If you decide to attend this movie, pay attention right from the beginning of the movie. And, if you like mysteries and puzzles, try to solve the question of who has the ultimate power among the characters in this movie. As for me, I think I'll have to see the movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA....and ORLANDO, FL Syriana, certainly supremely somber and dark, both in focus and in execution, with a cast replete with A-Listers like George Clooney (also listed as one of the executive producers), Matt Damon, Chris Cooper, Christopher Plummer and Amanda Peet, had a budget of 50 million dollars....All for the purpose of presenting a striking vision of the troubled state of the world in which we live.To dig a little deeper regarding Syriana, a film nominated for several Oscars (which were quite well deserved, in my opinion) is the kind of psychological-political thriller where you, the spectator, is forced to put your brain into hyper drive in every scene, every line from the movie, from start to its final seconds....If you do not want to end up with gaps in the arc of the story, you'd best not let down your mental guard, even for the briefest of moments! So, if you prefer your films "Light &amp; Breezy", Syriana may not be the most appropriate option. The story development is not linear. Constantly changing location, focus, characters and, especially, chronology! Syriana is akin to taking a cinematic rocket ride?.Beginning its journey slowly, deliberately, but with a huge explosion from the ignition of its engines. Then, there is rapid and constant acceleration throughout its entire trajectory! Gradually, one begins to feel a constantly building imminent danger.To the extent that Syriana approaches its climax, there is a pervasive sense of impotence that is transmitted to the viewer and to each character and each entity in the story. It is as if each and every one involved were all cells in some Gestalt organism with a separate life all its own, yet, unable to change course and detain the inevitable. Syriana is a most convincing portrait of a coolly calculating, complicated and Machiavellian world 9*?...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!

		<fullReview>The base story is a good mix of a derivation from the all too-well-known CIA spy premise, a story about Islamic fundamentalism, a story about oil business and the corruption in the politics around it, and a story about family loss.The story is developed nicely well. It's complex, sharply piercing and exposing the potential sleaze and corruption within and around the oil- rich region of the Middle East. The mood of the movie, having it as a drama-thriller movie, is nicely kept stable with a fluctuating pace of being fast at times and being slow at other times. One thing I found quite funny is that seeing George Clooney and Matt Damon on the cast list, I was expecting that they're going to be having intense in-frame interacting and duration together, but instead they are only in-frame together on the last scenes of the movie. They also don't share a dialog together.The acting is nice, the level that we expected from the two big names of George Clooney and Matt Damon. Having Christopher Plummer, Jeffrey Wright, and Chris Cooper is also a great touch that emphasize the seriousness of the political aspect in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At first confusing but eventually powerful political thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched Syriana for the first time I was confused and infuriated. During the first half nothing seemed to happen, the plot was garbled and the motives of the characters were left unclear. I needed to watch it 3 times more to fully absorb all the twists and nuances of the story, and even now it feels the movie hasn't revealed everything about itself. It's one of the most complex and challenging movies I've seen, but also one of the most rewarding.Syriana is a movie very similar to Steven Soderberg's Traffic, using multiple story lines and characters surrounding one big subject (this is not a surprise, Syriana's director Stephen Gaghan also wrote Traffic). In Traffic it was drugs and its illegal trade, in Syriana it's Mideastern oil and the competition for it. An unnamed Arab state declines the offer of Connex, an American oil giant, and makes a sale with the Chinese. To avoid defeat, Connex merges with a smaller oil company called Killen, that has managed to make contract of the oil in Kazakstan. U.S. Justice department scents something shadowy in the project, doubting that there's corruption behind Killen's deal with Kazakstan. Hoping that the DoJ approves the merger, the oil tycoons decide to sacrifice a few of their front men. Meanwhile, CIA is intriguing against an Arab prince. A former CIA-agent Bob Barnes and an energy analyst Bryan Woodman also get tangled to this devious game. Does this sound amorphous? That's what it is at first, but Syriana is a movie that takes more shape the more you watch it. It's still not a movie for everyone, requiring continuing concentration and some interest towards oil politics. Traffic was a similar, but a much easier film with its smoother pace and color world that was different in every storyline. Syriana instead doesn't make anything easy for the viewer. The plot twists aren't thrashed out and the film jumps from a place to another completely unpredictably. It's a 2-hour political thriller about oil, terrorism, corruption, money and betrayal with a puzzling narrative that both astonishes and fascinates. Once all the plot lines have formed, the film's subtleties are impossible to deny.The acting is solid all the way, but no one really gets to shine since there are so many characters and the plot travels fast. Still, George Clooney delivers a startling performance as the tragic Bob Barnes. He has managed to strip away all that ladies man's charisma that he's famous for. Matt Damon as Bryan Woodman and Jeffrey Wright as lawyer Bennett Holiday hired to investigate the Kazakstan-deal's background are also splendid. Mark Strong, Tim Blake Nelson and Oscar winners William Hurt, Chris Cooper and Christopher Plummer appear in small, shady roles.But what is the film's message? Quite familiar: oil business is cruel and affects many people around the world. It has been heard before, but as long as films this brilliant are made out of it, it doesn't bother. The film's complexity is intentional, but the same complexity makes it fascinating every time. Syriana is an underrated masterpiece that shows how America does business. And that is not beautiful to watch, but endlessly compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stew of oil companies, politics, lawyers, madrassas, CIA, assassinations, terrorism, all in the Mideast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana, while not a disaster, is below par and below what it might have been, had more realism and less fancy been applied to it.The movie stylistically is a stew, a mixture, a potboiler consisting of what seem to be disconnected elements that are eventually all brought together, as one might expect they will be. The story is told without a central character, unless it be George Clooney's CIA agent. The story seems to be instead about events and how they come about. Yet people bring events to pass and motivations are critical. But Syriana doesn't bring out motivations deeply.The movie is done more or less clinically, i.e., without developing sympathy for any person. It has its dramatic style, but not the conventional style. This is "Traffic" done in the Mideast. Indeed the screenwriter for Traffic, I now learn, directed this movie. I commend his ambition, but the script of this one needed quite a lot of work really to be engaging or hit the mark.The narrative is an attempt to show more or less dramatically how the climaxes of the movie came about. It shows the threads that lead up to the climaxes. These are an assassination by car explosion and a terrorist explosion of an oil terminal. However, in showing these threads, the movie fails to develop suspense. It also lingers on some events that bear little or no relation to the climaxes, and it fails at some points to provide scenes that would bear a relation if they were shown. The film is not quite a mess, but it comes close. It becomes "heavy" and plodding, and some of the actors may well be wondering what they're doing there.At the halfway mark, I was still wondering what, if anything, the story really meant to be about. The climax or climaxes became predictable shortly thereafter.As drama, I myself was surprised by nothing I saw depicted, but I am very well versed in the politics and economics of this region. I follow its news closely.The title of Syriana is misleading. Syria has nothing to do with it. Iran has little to do with it, even though the film spends time in Tehran for a robbery in which terrorists get some weapons. There's an oil deal that has to do with Kazachstan, whereas the main geographical focus is a sheikdom on the Arabian peninsular somewhere and the oil company that operates there (a combination of Conoco and Exxon called Connex).The emir of this sheikdom has two sons, one of whom will take over for him. The older and more mature son wants to move the country forward in various ways; the younger one is crafty, power-hungry, and shallow. For some reason, the emir chooses the younger son. Despite this fact, the CIA wants the older son killed.Matt Damon has a thankless or fanciful soap opera type of role as an oil analyst who has access to the emir's sons and thinks he can affect social policy.Clooney plods along as a CIA agent, intent on an assassination and then changing his mind. He looks bewildered for most of the movie, that is, when he's not having his fingernails ripped out.Connex is doing a merger. It has to spread money around to achieve this. An opposite oil company team has a bright lawyer on hand who is digging up this dirt so's they can quash this merger. An ineffectual politician is trying to affect this, but in the end he settles for a couple of scalps. Big oil triumphs. Arabs are laid off who then, being unemployed, become terrorists after being indoctrinated. They are then willing to blow up an oil terminal from the sea.The CIA bigwigs are busy doing an assassination that Clooney fails to stop, although it's unclear why. They have the electronics to pinpoint a car and demolish it by drone presumably or some other aerial bombing method.It's a Mideast soap opera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana is a geopolitical thriller film written and directed by Stephen Gaghan. George Clooney stars in the film together with an ensemble cast led by Matt Damon,Jeffrey Wright,Amr Waked,Chris Cooper,Amanda Peet,William Hurt,Christopher Plummer,Tim Blake Nelson,Alexander Siddig,Mazhar Munir and Kayvan Novak. Gaghan's screenplay is loosely adapted from Robert Baer's memoir See No Evil. The film focuses on petroleum politics, and the global influence of the oil industry, whose political, economic, legal, and social effects are experienced by a Central Intelligence Agency operative, an energy analyst, a Washington attorney and a young unemployed Pakistani migrant worker in an Arab country in the Persian Gulf. It uses multiple, parallel story lines, jumping from locations in Iran, Texas, Washington D.C., Switzerland, Spain, and Lebanon.This is intelligent, committed, and politically provocative movie about the oil industry. It is complex, engrossing, involving and depressing. Difficult to absorb as it treats its audience as adults but it is an extremely rewarding film that handsomely pays off the concentration required to watch it.It is one of the best political thrillers ever released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Study of the Middle East and Corporate Oil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brilliant movie in many respects, but it is also unusual enough to almost be unique.The view of the middle east presented in Syriana is the most true to life I have seen in any American movie ever, and I've lived in the middle east so I have some experience (lived peacefully, I hasten to add, I didn't go there to shoot the locals). The view on the ultra-corrupt oil business is also penetrating to the point of being uncomfortable to watch.Some here have criticized it for being above the head of the "average movie-goer". I would argue that depends on where that movie-goer lives and what he or she knows. For the crowd who's world-view is shaped entirely by CNN and the like(or worse, FOX news) the world presented in Syriana will no doubt seem alien. That shadow does not fall on the film, though.It is however true that Syriana demands some attention from its viewer. It is indeed complex (though not complicated) and a general understanding of world politics certainly does help.Many of the negative reviews here seem to come from people wanting to be spoon-fed the same old Hollywood hero-worship (these are the "it's boring" reviews). If that is you, then you won't like Syriana.The rest of the negative reviews are mainly politically motivated. Not because Syriana is a preaching political film, it isn't, but because it does not toe the line and stick to the official message. Syriana portraits middle easterners as real people for one thing (this alone makes it a target for accusations of "glorifying terrorism" of course). But it also attempts, and mostly succeeds, in showing the religious/political/cultural complexities of the region. Finally it gives a realistic account of the real reasons for terrorism (as opposed to the standard "they-hate-us-because-they-are-evil" garbage).As for acting it is very well done all around. George Clooney does an excellent job, as does, unsurprisingly William Hurt but the mid east actors also put on a very convincing performance. Extra points for using local actors and let them speak their own languages, rather than having American-Arabs speak broken English. The tempo of the story is generally slow though the cuts are fast, this only make the moments of violence hit you so much harder.This film is highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the subject-matter, a brain and a reasonable attention-span.</fullReview>

The film's weakness is that it explores everyone's culpability except the consumer's, and the sheer obscurity of the plotting can feel a little high-handed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four movies in one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie weaves together the stories of four different people: an American financial expert, based in Switzerland, who specializes in energy; a Muslim Pakistani guest worker for an oil company in a fictional Arab country who evolves into a terrorist when losing his job when two oil companies merge; a CIA agent; a legal counsel in a firm whose job it is to handle any political ramifications of the oil company merger. In addition there is an Arab prince, oil company executives, congressmen, and so forth, as well as some people you are never quite sure about. This is a complicated movie whose message seems to be that when it comes to global politics and oil, nothing is simple. The lives of the four principal characters overlap only tangentially and the clever plot construct is that, while the actions of each character has consequences for the others, none has any realization of that. You come away feeling that getting at the full truth behind any geopolitical situation is hopeless, there are just too many moving parts.Nobody comes away looking terribly good, except perhaps the Arab prince. While this is fiction, I felt that it was quite believable. The actors are in fine form and, unusual for this type of film, you see that the characters have personal lives and have to deal with everyday problems like anyone does. You get to know them as people rather than pawns in a game. There would be enough material in the lives of any of the four principals for a full length feature.This film is not a light entertainment; it has important things to say. You are thrown into the middle of events from the beginning; hats off to anyone who comes away with a firm grasp of things after a single viewing. I only came to appreciate what a fine movie this is the second time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to Understand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Syriana to be a very confusing film. Its editing was very choppy and the story line was hard to follow. The subplot with the migrant workers introduced in the exposition was a story line that was spoken loud and clear to me.The migrant workers clearly valued their family and were very poor it was easy to follow their thinking and actions. Their motivations were simple and easy to relate to. When the young migrant worker boy is picked on and is asking desperately around for a job we sympathize and maybe even pity for him in his situation. We relate to him in the way he loves his father and looks out for him, hugging his father goodbye and translating for him at a meeting. When they run themselves into an oil rig with an explosive for a 'holy war' we the viewers are suddenly faced with an example of the so-called 'terrorists.' The movie brings us along the story of two men suddenly without jobs because of America's capitalist system and their quest for belonging eventually causing them to destroy part of the same industry that caused them to be feeling lost and without jobs. We criticize terrorist actions, and indeed they are atrocious, but do we understand why they do it or how they come to be in the position where it was an option. When we are shown a Hezbollah controlled suburb that a main character is transported through we begin to examine our own culture and how safe it is comparatively. We see men on the roofs of buildings with large guns and dirty streets filled with people of "questionable" motive.The corporate slanted plot was difficult for me to understand beyond the visible actions of the characters. The film blurred the division between business and government giving the viewer a waning sense of confidence in the competency of the American government. The government turns on its own employees and abandons them making me wonder if the government would do that to anyone.I noticed in all the main characters they had established a family connection. Each character was seen with at least one member of their family. Most of the film takes place not in America but in the Middle East. Was the thoroughly established family connection shown in the film present to exemplify the Middle Eastern notion of an intimate importance of kin? I believe the story is largely pivoted on the action of the aging ruler of the country giving up control to his youngest son, instead of traditionally the older son, because it desires to emphasize the importance of family. The tie in with the oil crisis brings together two otherwise very different cultures and shows mostly differences.The discombobulated feeling that the movie originally conveys through non-narrative format becomes wrapped up with the governmental confusion of two clashing countries over oil. We are shown that the government we place our trust in doesn't really know what they are doing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana is three things.First, it is a very good film. Well written, well acted, thoughtful and it treats its audience as adults, fully able to take on board what it offers them without being spoon-fed mock heroics, non-stop explosions and so on.Second, it is complex. A number of threads interweave and interact, and things done by one element are seen to have consequences as far as others are concerned which are far outside what may have been anticipated.Third, it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth afterwards. This because it so credibly offers a vision of a world in which money - and nothing else - is the prime motivator in westernised society, and its pursuit trumps all other cards. I know that this theme is far from uncommon, but it is rare to see it portrayed on screen so clearly, so accurately, and with such an absence of retribution for those most deserving of it.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horizontal Storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Gaghan's Syriana is one of the most ambitious scripts to come out of Hollywood in a long time. His story strategy is a strange combination of showing the audience an extremely big picture while also placing them in extreme ignorance. He tells a very horizontal story, showing many elements and forces working at one time, but also puts the audience in the same position as a cop trying to figure out a crime.Gaghan is clearly within the storytelling tradition of the last hundred years in which the viewer comes to understand over the course of the story. This approach reached its apex in such European films as Last Year at Marienbad and The Conformist. It makes the audience work hard, but the endpoint is supposed to be a deeper learning of the real patterns of the world.Unfortunately, that never happens in Syriana. What comes together at the end is the idea that the powerful of the world conspire together to increase and perpetuate the powers that be. But we know that from the beginning. The specifics of what happens remain confusing and there is almost no emotional completion.When you make the audience work this hard to figure out so many strands, and force them to sit in ignorance for almost the entire film, you had better have a fantastic plot revelation at the end. In effect, if you make them take their medicine, you have to give them a great treat for their effort. But we never get the treat. Gaghan might argue that he is purposely trying to cut against a big Hollywood finish, with everything tied up neatly. But giving the audience a great plot isn't "going Hollywood." It's good writing.Even if you accept this excuse for a flat plot payoff, Gaghan has to justify taking the medicine with something. With an intellectual, multi-strand movie like this, the payoff isn't going to be emotional. It has to be a great thematic revelation. But this too is missing. We know from the beginning that big corporations run the world and get most of what they want. So learning that at the end is not learning anything.Study this script carefully if you want to see the strengths and weaknesses of horizontal storytelling. Perhaps the biggest insight a writer can take from Syriana is: the more characters you track in a story, the harder it is to make an emotional impact on the audience.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm afraid this film lost me right from the start. I waited and hour and ten minutes for it to get going and it never did. Mind you, I selected this film because the topic does intrigue me, so it wasn't that I would have found it uninteresting. Unlike one of the main characters -- if there are any -- I even know what an Emir is and have a fine sense of the geography and history of the region. It's simply too disjointed a film to be anything but uninteresting, irritating and frustrating. I did watch the whole film through once, though. I didn't understand the film; I didn't even understand the scenes. I just kept asking myself, "Why did this happen? Why did that happen?" The next day, I tried it again. This time I gave up after the first five minutes, right after a car exploded without explanation. The camera work was likewise distracting. Too many long shots of people talking off in far corners of the screen while somebody's head or shoulder occluded another part. If the shots were actually composed, they were composed to look like they were not composed, which doesn't seem to do anything for them. I have heard this film euphemistically described as "non-linear." Yes, well that it is, but I wouldn't use it as a euphemism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>gets better if you see it more than once (the old saying, but it's true)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if I'll ever think Syriana is a masterpiece or great film or worthy on a top 10 list or other. But it's something that sucks me in when it comes up on TV, and after seeing bits and pieces- following already seeing it twice in the theater- I have a grasp on it, firmly. It's a political drama/thriller about big oil and terrorism and lobbyists and behind-closed-doors negotiating and death and torture and so on and so on. It's confusing, but it's really not so if you pay attention. It's just that Stephen Gaghan's script is so dense that you're bound to loose yourself in the specifics of what's happening when or why or through what channel or whatever (Jeffrey Wright's character's story, arguably, goes through the most to try and get the thinking viewer to pay close watch). But there's also some strong dramatic connections going on, things that bring out the humanity, or the suppression there-of through bigger-than-life business and murder and sadism, that make it worthwhile.Particularly the strongest asset is George Clooney, which he got the Oscar for (albeit as a possible sympathy vote for ditching him on his other two Oscar noms for Good Night and Good Luck); his portrayal is calm and with an underlying sorrow that's crushing at times. This guy's seen so much, and knows likely too much, for him to be kept around long in a government that will sell out anyone for the price of big oil. To see him go through a small scene like that with his character's son, or to see him in a dark movie theater sharing a secret with William Hurt's character, or being tortured, or going for broke in the climax, is exhilarating; his scenes probably ground the film, at best, for the audience. It's everything else that you'll need to try and keep an eye on: the tragedy of Matt Damon's character, a market-watcher in Europe who's transferred to the mideast, and that of Wright's professional who gets in deeper and deeper in corruption, are a little trickier to navigate. And it's frustrating in that, unlike Traffic, it's a more challenging script than that of direction and storytelling; we're never too sure where it's going at times in the mid-section, but to keep engaged is the tricky part even as the script dazzles with its spot-on, mature dialog and little subtle twists (the king's son who doesn't want the power, and then explains to Damon's character why, very good scene).The best thing to do is to go in knowing what to expect, and then take it on the terms of how it goes: an intentionally confounding take on the biggest, most incredulous industry in the world. You might wonder if the "addiction to oil" even means anything. "Corruption," Tim Blake Nelson's character says, very directly and dishearteningly to the point, "is why we win." 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot less matrix of intrigues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a stylish-looking intrigue thriller evocative of sound bites and headlines from the Middle East near the beginning of the 21st century. Based loosely on CIA operative Robert Baer's memoir, See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Solder in the CIA's War on Terrorism (2003), the main point of the movie seems to be that our need for oil compromised our efforts to stop terrorism. Or another way to look at this is to say that the CIA and the US government in general failed to make an effective transition from Cold War intelligence operations to the so-called War on Terror.Oil companies conspiring to increase supply and profits, Arabian princes vying to become the next emir, CIA agents sleuthing in dangerous lands, board meetings and cocktail parties with wealthy and influential international players, bombs going off, fear and torture, and a very nice precision rocket launch in the desert to hit exactly the fourth car in a queue are featured. Unfortunately it's the sort of movie that looks a lot better than it plays.Director Stephen Gaghan who wrote the script for Traffic (2000), a drug war thriller in which several story lines are meshed, uses a similar technique here with the unifying factor being oil instead of street drugs. Despite an engaging performance from George Clooney and fine support, especially in the smaller roles (e.g., William Hurt, Christopher Plummer), the formula doesn't work as well mainly because the story goes nowhere. Plot less movies tend to bore the audience since there is no rising action leading to a climax and resolution. Although people die and fortunes wax and wane, the linear story fails to engage our sympathies. I think this might have worked had the focus been on Clooney's character and his struggle to warn the US of the danger of terrorism from the Middle East, a danger that we didn't fully awaken to until 9/11.See this, if you must, for George Clooney who won a Supporting Oscar for his performance.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>Everything is Connected... And Complicated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Syriana" tells many different stories that overlap. George Clooney is something like a CIA officer who goes to foreign countries and makes things go smoother for America by eliminating problems and people. Matt Damon is a broker for an oil company, who negotiates with Middle Easterners. We have the story of two brothers (one who was Dr. Bashir on "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine") who might grow up to be king -- one pro-American and the other not so much. And we have Arab youths who discover a rocket and are unsure what to do with it.This movie is well-acted, well-scripted and well-directed. The plot is deep and thick, and the actors all do their part to make it as wonderful as possible. Even supporting actors (like Amanda Peet) are amazing. This is also the movie's downside, because it is next to impossible you will fully understand what you're seeing on the first viewing: so much depth and interwoven plot lines. (But, again, if a film make you want to watch it again, perhaps this is good?) George Clooney's character (Bob Barnes) is relatively minor in the first half, but he plays a much bigger role later on. You see how torture and terrorism works up close (from both American and Arab points of view) and what the government will do to you if they feel threatened. Very gripping, very emotional -- and one scene which is disgusting (but crucial to drive the point home).You might wonder, "can I sit through such a long movie?" Well, can you? I guess the movie was originally even longer, and I wish they would release a director's cut (maybe they have). The average viewer won't want anything beyond two hours, but I'd take three... just to get more story from this well of goodness.If you like great directing, acting, writing... rent this movie. If you care about the Middle East or America's role in it, rent this. If you care about the politics of oil, rent this. I think it is safe to say this film has something of a liberal bias, but there is nothing shown that (to my knowledge) isn't completely factual -- and sometimes we need the truth blunt in our face like this, like a boot to the crotch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mess!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Syriana has atmosphere to spare and some good performances, this is one terrible mess of a movie. A lack of exposition or any attempt to explain what is going on and very little about just who is who, the viewer is left to figure out for himself what is going on in all the disparate threads of the story. The dialogue is so sparse, and often so deliberately evasive, that I could never put all the pieces together. My wife totally agreed, which is not that usual for us. How messed up is it? This much: In the scenes spoken in Farsi (or Arabic, or whatever), the subtitles are farcical in their disjointed manner. Often, sentences are not completed, i.e. someone will start a sentence but fail to complete it before beginning another one, or before someone else responds, so that much of the meaning is lost. The wife suggested that this was a defective disk that Netflix sent us, but I doubt it. They're all mass produced after all. It's the movie that is defective. But this method of making movies that leaves too much to the viewer to discern the plot seems part of a modern trend that I find deplorable. It's one thing to give the viewer credit for some intelligence, but quite another to present a puzzle with few clues. This only distracts the viewer from giving full attention to the nuances of the story. I long for the old days of exposition, often by voice-over, to help move the story along without showing everything. For example, take the famously convoluted plot of "The Big Sleep," with Bogart. Compared to "Syriana," that film was a model of comprehension.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read the book that this movie was inspired by. The movie is a work of fiction, but tries to show the complex world situation regarding oil and its supply. It says that America has such a dependence on oil that the US government will go to any length, including covert operations, to ensure that those remain in power what are favorable to the US oil needs. Even if it means getting a key figure killed.Much of the story has a base in Washington, DC, where one character comments, "here you are innocent until investigated." I suppose there is a kernel of truth to that, although I suspect (and hope) that the story included major exaggerations for dramatic effect.George Clooney was awarded Best Actor for his role here as a sort of journey man who speaks Arabic and can navigate his way through the mysterious family and political vagaries of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and such countries. And, by the way, he has contacts for getting rid of those who may cause some threat to the oil supply needs.I found it interesting, but perhaps preaching in its base message. It shows the political power in various governments. It shows the poor Muslim young men who have little to aspire to, so they become willing to strap a bomb to themselves to fight what thous see as evil. I found the movie "OK" but not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has been described by many as "a thriller for people who read the Financial Times". While that may be true, this film fits into a description that labels it "a sign of the times". Corporate greed is at an all time high. How it destroys people's lives and the backlash that follows is a classic example that says for every action, there is an equal re-action. It also demonstrates how those involved in international crimes don't even care about their own foreign operatives and that their lives are disposable in the long run. George Clooney stands out as a CIA operative who realizes he may have been on the wrong side of the fight his whole life. A well written piece by Stephen Gaghan that is extremely difficult to follow in detail. It's not for those with short term memory problems or short attention spans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading so many user reviews that complain about the complexity of this film, I want to say that I am eternally grateful to those who are willing to put forth the effort to show something this complex. With about 95% of movies today catering to lowest common denominator, it's so refreshing to have someone courageous to take a chance. Once I saw that there are guys in Denver, Colorado, dropping bombs on Afghanistan, using computer programs that manipulate drones, I figured there is no place to be safe. This is not anti- American or anti-oil company. It just is. It's so scary to realize that there are people on both sides of this issue who have so little regard for human life. I found this film utterly captivating. I will watch it again and try to pick up on the details that went by me the first time. I see cinema as an art. There are painters who do mediocre copies of peaches in a bowl and there are those who do masterpieces. There are those who do Adam Sandler movies and those who make an effort to do something significant. "Our reach should exceed our grasp, or what's a heaven for?" (Robert Browning) I love to puzzle over these films, even if my knowledge or my basic intelligence isn't enough. It's still worth the effort as we approach all aspects of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pot of Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Punning on the Biblical story of Esau, who sold his birthright for a mess of pottage, the science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon said of H G Wells, whose novels were often marred by heavy-handed propaganda, that he had sold his birthright for a pot of message. I sometimes get the same feeling about George Clooney, who in recent years has used his influence as a Hollywood star to produce and direct a number of films which act as vehicles for his own left-wing opinions. Like "Good Night and Good Luck" (about McCarthyism) and the recent "Men Who Stare at Goats" (about, among other things, Iraq), "Syriana" is a good example.The movie's title (meaning, roughly, "things Syrian") is a misleading one, as none of the action takes place in Syria; indeed, that is one of the few Middle Eastern countries not to be mentioned. (Scriptwriter/director Stephen Gaghan did come up with an explanation of the title, far too convoluted to be repeated here). The film is essentially about petroleum politics and deals with political, economic and social effects of American government policy and of the American oil industry on the Middle East.Roger Ebert described the film as an example of hyperlink cinema because of its use of multiple, parallel story lines, jumping from locations in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East. This type of film-making is nothing new (the late Robert Altman was a noted exponent in films like "Short Cuts"), but it is one that has become increasingly popular in recent years; "Crash" and "Babel" are two other well-known examples from the middle of the last decade.There are essentially four interlinked story lines, centred upon a fictitious oil-rich kingdom in the Persian Gulf. One concerns a proposed merger between two American oil companies, Connex and Killen, which has given rise to misgivings among antitrust regulators at the Department of Justice. The second concerns Bryan Woodman, an energy analyst based in Geneva, Switzerland, whose young son dies in a tragic accident at a party being given by the king of the unnamed country. The third concerns some unemployed Pakistani migrant workers who become involved with an Islamic fundamentalist terrorist group. The fourth deals with Prince Nasir, the king's liberal-minded eldest son, who aims to introduce democratic reforms upon his succession to the throne. For various reasons, the Americans would prefer Nasir's more conservative younger brother to succeed his father, and Bob Barnes, a veteran CIA agent, is sent to the area to organise Nasir's assassination."Syriana" originally had five story lines rather than four but one was cut when it was feared that the film was becoming too complicated. Nevertheless, the plot is still excessively complex and difficult to follow. I am far from being the only person to have remarked upon this aspect of the film; indeed, some have even seen it as a positive virtue, arguing that because the film deals with murky conspiracies, the audience's confusion mimics the confusion of the characters, who find themselves involved in those conspiracies without understanding precisely what is going on. In my experience, however, a film which confuses its audience is also likely to end up alienating them.Another reason why I did not like the film was that I found it too heavily didactic, in common with a number of Clooney's other productions. (Here he stars as Barnes and also acts as executive producer). That does not necessarily mean that I always disagree with his opinions. I share his opposition to the Iraq war and would agree with the viewpoint put forward in "Good Night and Good Luck" that Senator McCarthy's actions were actually damaging to the democratic freedoms he claimed to be defending. Too often, however, he seems to forget that the cinema exists primarily to entertain rather than to lecture.In this case, moreover, the film's basic political thesis seemed over-simplistic and flawed by anti-Americanism. It is essentially arguing that all the problems of the Middle East, from authoritarian governments to terrorism, can be attributed to an American foreign policy driven by the needs of the greedy and corrupt American oil industry, and ignores the many complexities of the real situation. It is never really explained why the Americans want Prince Nasir dead; contrary to what some inveterate America-haters might think, the US government has no objection to democracy per se, and those countries in the region which have introduced democratic reforms along the lines suggested by the Prince, such as Bahrain, Kuwait and the UAE, are often both more stable and more pro-Western than autocracies like Saudi Arabia or Saddam's Iraq. The idea that unemployment and poverty always lie at the root of terrorism is also an oversimplification when one considers that many societies plagued by poverty have not spawned terrorist movements and that many terrorist groups, such as West Germany's Baader-Meinhof Gang, have been made up of university-educated intellectuals who, had they chosen to do so, would have had no difficulty fitting into the affluent bourgeois society they affected to despise.The "hyperlink" style of film-making can be an effective one; "Crash", which won the "Best Picture" Oscar and "Babel", which was nominated for it, are both excellent films; indeed, I would rank "Babel" among the greatest of the present century. It is, however, a style which needs careful handling if the film is not to become over-complex and confusing. "Syriana", which is in nothing like the same class as "Babel" or "Crash", struck me as an example of what can happen when it goes wrong. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decided to give it a second chance, but only found it more agonizingly self-absorbed and preachy.It's not that I disagree with all of the (obviously) liberal views presented here, but they are just so painfully obvious and unnecessarily exaggerated. Also, do we really need a film to tell us not everyone in the Middle East is a terrorist, that many terrorist organizations draw young people in because they offer assurances that other organizations don't, that government is corrupt, and the current war is very much over oil? Well, some people might not know that, but then again, those people probably get excited over the latest "Scary" or "Epic" spoof movie.The only aspect of this film worth any real praise is Clooney's performance. Although it may not have been as Oscar worthy as some of his others, he is the only character that we actually feel is real and not simply a stereotype. Clooney makes Bob a sad, lonely figure who has a need to know what is happening and why. I only wish I new what was happening, since Gaghan seems to pile on story after story while "interconnecting" them in ways only slightly more meaningful than those in Paul Haggis' overrated "Crash".Ultimately, Syriana not only fails as a thriller, (because it is too confusing and complex to have a tight ending or focus) or a drama (some of the situations these characters are in seem artificial and a few of the actors are not to the task of creating meaningful and relatable characters), but also as a message film because you really won't find anything in this film about Middle Eastern culture or the oil business that you either didn't already know and have opinions about. No doubt the filmmakers had good intentions when making the film, but ultimately it feels over-elaborate, showy and pretentious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't watch this movie if you are a person who has no interest in current events, the future of the world, or pondering how we got into the mess in Viet Nam, Iraq, etc., etc., Do watch this movie if you have a hunger for a more mature form of entertainment, such as an evening discussing politics, history, or foreign cultures with your sophisticated friends. The message in this film, at least the message I got, doesn't pound you in the face like one from an old Schwarzenegger film. It doesn't have you clinging to the edge of the seat like one of the multitude of bloody, camp horror flicks. It also doesn't warm your heart like a silly romance. What it does is sneak up on you. When "Syriana" ended, I said to my husband, "Okay...So what was THAT about? They sure didn't put much effort into character development." But, half an hour later, my mind was still tugging at what I had seen as loose threads, pulling on first one and then another. An hour later, my mind had put together the message which I took from the movie, which was: "There's so much talk about the Middle East and their martyrs. We talk about how nutty it is to sacrifice yourself for a cause. Yet, we all have martyrs. Bob Barnes, Bryan Woodman, Prince Nasir, and the actual martyr all have beliefs that they are willing to put themselves on the line for. Some risk their own lives. Some risk the lives of their families. Interestingly, even the most committed of us usually see the other guys cause as being the one not worth a sacrifice; we don't believe "they" are as committed to their principles as "we" are. For the last three days, parts of "Syriana" have popped into my thoughts, helping me to see how the forces at work in the plot of "Syriana" are modeled after real life forces shaping our politics today.As for the actors, I've been a Clooney fan since "Roseanne" but I think this was his best work. I actually forgot he was George Clooney and began thinking of him as Bob Barnes for a while. After growing up in LA, it takes some doing to overcome my cynicism and transport me into the land of "Hollywood." Way to go, Clooney! Bryan Woodman would have been my pick for the least developed character of the movie, but when I "got it" the next day, I realized this was actually part of the character. There are some questions in the audience's mind at the end of the movie about Woodman and had Matt Damon overplayed this part, they wouldn't have been there and the movie wouldn't have been as suspenseful.Prince Nasir, a man of integrity, interested in advancing his countries industrial and societal future won my heart. Alexander Siddig put across a sincerity that made me fell in love with the Prince. (If I was only 20 years younger!) If I could only tell you how many times I yelled "Get out of the car!" I thought it was quite the accomplishment that Siddig's acting showed that the prince loved and respected his father, but had a strong enough character not to back down when he knew he was right.I can't list all of the actors and their accomplishments here because there were so many. I was totally lost by the middle of the movie because there were so many characters and several subplots. My husband, who watched it twice, was able to keep up with it better the second time around. But, he DID watch it twice, which is an indication that it is a movie worthy of watching again and again.So, as I said, if you are interested in current events, politics, history, and/or cultural values, this is a must-see movie! If you only enjoy airhead entertainment, this one isn't for you. But, if you are in that latter group and miss "Syriana," you've missed one awesome movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brave effort. But no cigar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago now, John Reith said what he figured the mission of the British Broadcasting Corporation to be: "to inform, educate, and entertain." "Syriana" doesn't bother with the last of those ambitions and, given its subject matter, there's no reason why it should.As for the bits about informing and educating though, it's in a muddle from the get-go, never able to manage both and, sometimes, unable to manage either.Its strengths are that it remains resolutely apolitical throughout. And that it shuns showbiz in preference for the cerebral.But its weakness -- and it's a huge weakness -- is that this pretty awesome display of cinematic brain power is ultimately only comprehendable by its creator.The separate story lines are not a problem in themselves. The story lines as and of themselves though. . . Let's try this: what connection did George Clooney's character have with Christopher Plummer's character and why did he confront him and threaten the murder of his family -- no, don't answer that yet; what was Clooney doing, flailing around in the desert with a road map prior to being zapped by a US missile -- no, don't answer that yet;what was the reason for the antagonistic relationship between the law firm investigator and his father, a relationship that culminated in the door-closing coda -- don't answer that, either;who was responsible for, and who died, in the exploding car after Clooney's character did or did not sell US missiles to, well, whoever? Answers can be made now on the basis, but ONLY on the basis, of the on-screen narrative.Not viewer presumption.Because if we're going to enter an era of cinema when every viewer has to spend most of a movie attributing to characters motives, actions, back-stories and relationships which have never been furnished on-screen then I guess it's time to stay home and do crosswords instead.Much is made of the movie's strengths in many a post here, but the generosity of spirit shown can hardly do anyone any favours. I've yet to see answers to the questions raised above -- questions asked deliberately, too, because they mark the convergence, rather than separation, of story lines, the points at which the intersection of characters provides illumination and explanation.Bottom line: the oil business is dirty, the geo-politics that enshroud it are impenetrable, and terrorism's recruiting ground is to be found in terrain where the young are left without roots, without hope, and without a future.Unfortunately. . . we already know that.So although 'Syriana' was brave to tackle all three issues, at the end of 2 hours running time, the oil business is still dirty, geo-politics are still opaque, terrorism is still terrorism and all that's happened is that cinema has somehow managed to make everything even more, rather than less, impenetrable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like movies that challenge my intelligence, but this thing was too hard to follow. Clues to the identity of each character and what agency, company, country or kingdom they were aligned to were way too sparse. Yeah, I got the general idea, but it was frustrating not knowing exactly who was who and exactly what was their role.And then there's the political message... Yes, the US government supports US corporate interest in the middle east. Yes, the CIA has in the past, and maybe still does, engage in covert operations that American people are not likely to approve of. Yes, lack of opportunity and religious extremism in the middle east fuel terrorism. It's all true. But the message of this movie still bothers me. Maybe because its so one dimensional. Its all black and white. The message is: US government is evil. The CIA is evil. Oil industry is evil. Come on. Give me a break. Show some more complexity in the message, not in the confusing story line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I knew a fair deal about the oil business, having analyzed the subject for years since I'm a bit worried about how the Western world would react to a serious shortage of it. Well, the movie "gave the message" that I expected it to give - in short "the oil business is filled with corruption and unfair deals." Having read those words I see no real need for you to watch the movie. It simply feels like a bad compilation. At many scenes I would ask myself "what on earth does this have to do with the previous stuff I saw?". Your short-term memory is also literally SPAMMED with the names of corporations, cities, people and organizations, many of which are only mentioned once, I think. Didn't get a feel of any character personalities either, since even the main characters were badly introduced if at all. Very, very tedious to grasp.Putting this under the "thriller-drama" section of IMDb seems a bit weird to me. There is no action or adrenaline raising scenes, except for a 0.5 second explosion and some torture.Anyone not extremely interested in a fictional tale about the underlying politics of "big oil business" should keep away, I think. Given decent acting and that it actually in a way filled its purpose, I give it a 3 of 10. But keep in mind: I was bored, risk is you will be too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with the preconceived idea that it was going to be another anti-Bush, anti-Republican, anti-Big Business smear campaign. To some extent it was, but it was much more; anti-corruption, anti-everything! For me, the plot and character list was far too complex with too much going on to too many people. Who was manipulating whom? Who was on which 'side'? In my opinion, the best part of the movie was summed up by 'Danny Dalton', the oil man, when he implied that corruption?read bribery or backhanders?was what greased the oil bits. Too true?if we don't do it, somebody else will and there goes our oil supply. But as a piece of entertainment?not for me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>topical important subject matter but not really a very good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a filmmaker cuts out the scene which explains the title to his own film you have to know perhaps the eye was not on the ball in other departments as well.Too many characters to really understand them all, not really much characterization, a number of good actors showing up for a good cause and really being given mostly expository and on unclear intrigue in bland looking film that remains interesting but also confusing and slightly at a distance feel all the way along to its doesn't-really- all-make-sense-and somewhat pat ending.Clooney and Damon do well with what they are afforded to do, Damon actually has a bit more to do, while Clooney who perhaps should be more the center of the film, isn't explored in the depth he should be. Though Clooney and Plummer have one great scene together that sets the bar far higher than anything else in the movie.As drama it's not very dramatic most of the time, the behind the scenes in Washington sections of the film are the weakest and the "building of a terrorist" section seems like it is missing all the key scenes to make that really powerful.Perhaps it will be years from now, when and or if, the Middle East is less of a hot spot (would be nice to live to see that day) that really good fiction films can be made about the area. In some ways Lawrence of Arabia still sets up the whole situation best.What a film wants to say is important to its success and many films say nothing, but this film just forgets to put the drama and thriller elements successfully into gear. Location hopping movie gives it the feel of a failed Euro production of the 70's.Over rated movie this one, sad to say, once the topicality wares off it will look pretty dim. Music and photography don't add anything either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hands down the best movie I have seen in the last 5 years.What an incredible story. I am so glad movies like this are being made again...to open our eyes to how big oil companies (rich white men) control so much of who we are.This movie is very fair, though. Honestly, I understood why the suicide bombers felt justified. I understood, and even related to, the oil company executives. I sympathized with the decisions the US government made.In the end, this movie really brings to light how corrupt things really are. To paraphrase what one character in the movie says "Corruption is necessary -- it give us the warm fuzzies. Without corruption, we wouldn't have anything to fight against".George Clooney's performance was the best of his career, I think. This movie doesn't have tons of dialogue (a lot of the movie is in several non-English languages). Facial expressions get the point across most of the time.This is not a movie for people who like to sit back and expect everything to be explained to them. This movie is for an active audience. You must engage yourself in it. Syriana will provoke some amazing dialogue between you and your friends...it may even provoke some sort of dialogue between policy-makers in America and the Middle East.Lastly, it just might get you thinking about your own consumption - of power, and natural gas, and oil. And I hope you makes you think about all those faceless Arabs who live and die a culture that may not even want to embrace democracy in the first place.The saddest thing is that, on the whole, not too many people are going to see this film. Does the average American really want to sit through a little over 2 hours of in-your-face politics as it relates to oil and the Middle East? Probably not. But it's their loss, man. Ignorance is bliss. Arrogance, though, is what gets you in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about nothing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's what I felt after waisting 2 hours and 4 bucks on this rental.Syriana thinks it's has a plot, it's apparently 4 stories that are somehow connected, or so the promotional tagline would make you believe that.We have a lawyer who investigates some shaddy business with a merger, a CIA operative who sold some guys missiles but it all went wrong, a financial expert who gets a job as a consultant for an arabian prince, especially after his son dies from shock while plunging into a pool who just happened to be from the father of said arabian prince. Then two workers who become unemployed because of the merger and turn to Islam after one of them forgets to comply with a simple(and huge) sign that just says "no talking" while in line...This is what I could gather from what I've seen at the start of the movie, after that it feels like an enormous conspiracy that's wrapped into an even larger conspiracy that seems to take it's pot shots at the oil industry and takes into account some popular myths and, dare I say it, fantasies about terrorists.The mere idea that a person that mercilessly plunges himself into a crowd and takes away his own life and other several hundreds innocent men, women and children with him, because greedy and sleazy evil American oil companies took his job thus making it justifiable is almost laughable and seems like something out of Batman Forever(also released by Warner Brothers), where Edward Nigma becomes a super villain, because his boss just happened to dislike his ideas.Of course, in this case terrorist plunge themselves into rich, evil capitalist executives, thus making it, at least in the minds of the writers, perfectly justifiable, though for some odd reason actual terrorists never seem to do that. They seem happy to just blow themselves up in the nearest civilian market they can find, kidnap random civilians, torture them and tape their beheadings just for fun, so this is a movie about actual events, right?Next point, in the storyline of the young lawyer who wants to iron out the ins and outs of this merger, here's the way to make an oil executive seem evil: just change the tone of his voice, so everything he says sounds sinister, especially when you make him say the most vague, empty and meaningless remarks about business, the world, oil and financial accountants. This is what best describes the boards meetings and conversations between executives in this movie: empty. I confess I don't know how the oil business works, but then again, neither does the movie. It also doesn't hurt to make a senator do a cringe-worthy "corruption keeps us warm" monologue just for kicks. The lawyer also happens to hang out with a nameless character that seems a drunk who confronts him with often silent stares, which lead to nothing.Then the CIA agent(played by George Clooney who seems to be overweight in this movie, because that the only thing I noticed from him), who screws up after making a crucial mistake in losing precious missiles, wow, surprising how such a veteran agent gives away two missiles and gets tricked by a dealer who was apparently such a big friend of his, while suspecting any possible backstabbing. But that doesn't happen until he's back and the other CIA uppers want to cover it up by sending him on another mission, without the chief's consent or approval. He's apparently going to take a hit on an arabian prince(who just so happens be the boss of the financial expert... so everything is connected, except that it's called a coincidence), this attempt which also fails, leads him to be beaten and tortured by a double-crosser, after he contacted Hezbollah. And then he goes back yet again, to warn the prince...o...k...Syriana works as far as cinematics go, music's fine, acting is acceptable, though I find it puzzling that Clooney won an Oscar for this as best supporting actor... 2005 must've been a pretty crummy year, worst then what I remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good comprehensive look at oil industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to write The Definitve Movie About The Oil Industry. There are so many angles one can take and if one has an inquisitive mind, one might not be able to limit oneself to discussing one part of the industry and its effects on the world. That has never been a deterrent to Stephen Gaghan though. He wrote "Traffic" which took a similar look at the very complex issue of immigration. He did that very very well, in my opinion, and he's done a comparable, if somewhat more generic job, with Syriana. I don't think the meaning of the term Syriana is ever given although, as a guess, it would seem to be a fictionalized term for a fictional, universalized Arab republic. This gives the movie an accessibility that allows for a simple canvas on which to pain an image of a world gone mad, largely defined by the vicissitudes and anomalies of the oil industry. Gaghan wrote "Traffic" based on work by former CIA agent Robert Baer but, distinctively from "Traffic", he also directed this movie. He addresses the question of accessibility to oil via two Saudi princes, Meshar Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha) and Nasir Al-Subaai (Alexander Siddig), and who stand to rule the country and might decide the direction of large supplies of oil. Perhaps somewhat overly simplistically in this film, one of the Saudi princes, Nasir envisions a more equitable distribution of, and ethical use of, oil. His reckless younger brother Nasir seems like a conniving, irresponsible party animal with only money and little responsibility, in mind. For me, the contrast between these two characters seemed a little pat and simplistic. It is as though one side of Gaghan's brain was telling him show how the world COULD be with a more equitable energy policy (even if it's as unlikely as Paris Hilton partying with Stephen Hawking), and the other side is telling him, no, tell the truth-or at least the much much much more likely outcome (like the certainty of a losing season for the Kansas City Royals every season). That said, the other threads in the film I found very interesting and intriguing; indeed, the thread about the brothers, while their characters may have seemed a bit too sharply drawn, reveals possible differences in how oil revenues might be apportioned and suggest a more equitable energy policy in the world.The story is also told from the point of view of an oil analyst named Bryan Woodman (a typically accomplished Matt Damon) and the toll his close ties to the industry take on his ostensibly objective TV analysis. There is a rather feebly constructed sub-plot also in which the (at least according to the tale woven by the film) good father Woodman is held accountable for seemingly unconnected family tragedies, supposedly on account of his busy schedule working in the oil industry. The film does not establish that he is a poor father, indeed, he is depicted as a model father, if somewhat busy. Therefore it seems a little unreasonable to attribute blame for some things which do not seem related to his work in the oil industry, or even likely for him to have done. Any person in any industry can become too ensconced in work and fail to meet their obligations at home.Also playing a prominent role in The Definitive Movie About The Oil Industry is the government bureaucrat (George Clooney as Bob Barnes) who becomes aware of improprieties in the US Defense Dept. As a result of his assertiveness, he is assigned to a less politically sensitive matter where his conscience is tested. Also covered in The Definitive Movie About The Oil Industry to a more minor degree are the workings of company politics at a large oil company in scenes very well played by Christopher Plummer as a sleazy oil executive and Christopher Cooper as a high-powered oil company CEO. Perhaps distinguishing himself above all the other performances in this movie, however, is Jeffrey Wright as a government lawyer who is supposed to be settling an oil lawsuit on terms more favorable to consumers but has sabotaged the deal to be more favorable to big oil companies. He is playing both sides of the fence very well and his subterfuge seems to have slid under the radar. Wright portrays a character so bland, so seemingly dull, that one would not sense his tendency to wrong people. Yet he does so, and very confidently. He has concocted an image which is almost beyond reproach and seemingly very honorable.In speaking facetiously about this being a definitive movie, I am not criticizing the movie but merely having a bit of fun with it. It is a very good movie, very well directed, and Gaghan does a fabulous job at weaving and connecting some quite disparate threads. With fine performances in particular from Damon, Cooper, Plummer, and Wright, this is an intriguing and complex reflection on the intricacies and far-reaching effects of the huge influence of the oil industry in our world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt that "Syriana" is a difficult movie to watch. You have to keep paying attention at every moment in the movie if you don't want to lose track of things. But those who have the patience and will to keep watching this movie will be rewarded with a thought provoking and effective movie that will leave you thinking afterward.Best thing about this movie is that it basically follows four different plot lines and characters but it really doesn't feel like four separate and different stories at all. The movie feels as a complete whole and is consistent during its entire running time. All the stories have one thing in common, they are more or less about one and the same subject; oil. This might be the reason why the movie feels like one. The movie is called "Traffic"-'light' for a good reason. It's made in the same style and terms of realistic storytelling- and character treatment. No wonder, the movie is directed by Stephen Gaghan who wrote "Traffic" and one of the executive producers on this movie is Steven Soderbergh, who directed "Traffic". It sort of sounds strange to call this movie a 'light' version of "Traffic", since this movie in my opinion is far more complex (even though it focuses on far less character and plot lines) and focuses on a even more difficult and delicate subject."Traffic" taught us that the war on drugs can't be won, "Syriana" shows us that the lust for oil can never be stopped and the movie shows the direct consequences of it. The movie is about the Western and mostly American corruption and naivety. The movie shows how this affects the Middle-East and its population and how that more or less directly hits back at the Western world. It's a sort of vicious circle. We want more and more oil for lower prices but we eventually pay a far higher price than just money for it.Kudos to Stephen Gaghan and the rest of the cast &amp; crew to have to guts to make such a politically sensitive but relevant movie.The movie gets carried by its excellently playing cast. This probably the best role of George Clooney I have ever seen him in. He deserved his Oscar for this movie, even though his role was far smaller than I expected. Matt Damon might be a bit out of place in this movie. I don't regard him as 'mature' enough yet to play such heavy and serious roles. I would had preferred an older or a totally unknown actor for his role. Among the supporting cast are Christopher Plummer, Amanda Peet, the always great Chris Cooper, William Hurt and Tim Blake Nelson. Not all of their roles seem relevant enough but nevertheless their presence still adds to the class of this movie.A sort of an essential movie to watch, at least if you're open for a complex but confronting and direct movie, about a sensitive and not much lighted subject.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Don't take this to mean I need immediate action ... many of my favorites are foreign films that introduce intriguing characters and then slowly tell their story. But I need to KNOW what the heck is going on and who the people are.After 37 minutes of this movie, I still didn't understand anything. The editing was so choppy that the story jumped from one unrelated scene to another in what was far too rapid fire for this ol' brain to absorb. I still only had a vague notion of who the main characters were, and cared less.I rented this film because I believe wholeheartedly in its message, but I just can't give a 'thumbs up' to the way that message was delivered.I'm sure if you are more patient and can deal with such disjointed story-telling, this might be a great film for you. But if you enjoy your films to be more linear and comprehensible, you might want to pass on this on.One other point: A film like this takes hundreds (thousands?) of people and tons of equipment -- all transported to various locales via ... you guessed it ... gas guzzling vehicles. Somehow it seems ironic to me that good-intentioned people add to the problem while purporting to publicize it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the new current events thriller "Syriana" (**1/2 out of ****) is like attending a graduate level foreign affairs seminar and listening to the professor drone on in monotone about the myriad Machiavellian machinations of U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East. Mind you, this kind of complex, global, political, and socio-economic history might make fascinating fodder in the right hands. In the wrong hands, however, it is like having sawdust stuffed into your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. Ostensibly based on real-life CIA agent Robert Baer's 2003 memoir "See No Evil," this well-intentioned but muddled George Clooney &amp; Matt Damon pseudo-documentary examines an unsavory Rubic's cube of intrigue between greedy a Texas oil corporation and shady government nation building in the Persian Gulf with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Anybody who has studied American diplomacy in the Middle East since the 1950s, or for that matter Central America, won't be shocked by writer &amp; director Stephen Gaghan's sensational expose. Best known for his Oscar winning "Traffic" (2000) screenplay, Gaghan tackles subject matter considerably more controversial than he handled in his freshman effort, the ably crafted 2002 Katie Holmes thriller "Abandon." The only thing surprising about "Syriana" is the artful way that Gaghan dodges attaching odium to either Democrats or Republicans.Writer &amp; director Stephen Gaghan tries to shoe-horn too many characters and too much plot into this R-rated, 126 minute melodrama that covers a variety of themes: Middle Eastern terrorism, torture, suicide bombers, American corporate-level mergers, cultural disparities, the CIA at its villainous worst pedaling illegal arms and assassinating foreign nobles, the death of an innocent child, the global struggle between the U.S. and China over ownership and control of oil. Four characters stand out in this abundance of intrigue: world-weary, veteran CIA operative Bob Barnes (George Clooney of "Ocean's Twelve"), preppy energy analyst Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon of "The Bourne Identity"), idealistic Middle Eastern Prince Nasir Al-Subaai (Alexander Siddig of "Kingdom of Heaven") and scheming corporate attorney Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright of "Shaft"). "Syriana" opens as Clooney's portly CIA agent has just sold two elite weapons to terrorists, but learns to his horror that one winds up in the hands of a splinter group that Barnes knows nothing about. When he reports this revelation to his superiors, the CIA shrugs it off with little concern. Meanwhile, after the accidental death of one of his two sons at a party hosted by a Middle Eastern nobleman, Bryan becomes an adviser to Nasir Al-Subaai. Nasir wants to usher his backward country into the 21st century with equal rights for women and pays Woodman for his advice. In yet another subplot, Bennett brokers a deal between Prince Nasir's father, Emir Hamed Al-Subaai (Nadim Sawalha of "Sphinx") and a prominent Texas oil company that plans a merger with another oil company. Before the Texas oil corporation can cement the deal with the Emir, Bennett has to negotiate with the U.S. Justice Department, so that the merger receives the Attorney General's blessing. Predictably, bodies pile up along the way as everybody struggles to obtain what they want for their own selfish ends. The conflict that lies at the heart of the oil merger is an anonymous Middle Eastern kingdom where the good guy Prince (Siddig) refuses to court American interests and the bad guy Prince Meshal Al-Subaai(newcomer Akbar Kurtha), more engrossed in his own jet-setting lifestyle, wants to accommodate America interests. Again, Gaghan leaps back and forth with dizzying rapidity among these multiple subplots. We watch two minutes of this and two minutes of that, all lensed with hand-held cameras that impart a persuasive newsreel authenticity. Indeed, "Syriana" drums up a lot of potential but is so swamped with cynicism that only super na?ve people will be shocked by its revelations. For example, the slimy oil company tycoons claim that they have everybody's best interests at heart when the only heart that they have is their own wallet. The U.S. Attorney General's Office refuses to condone an improper corporate merger unless it can indict a couple of sacrificial lambs in the process to make itself look good. Of course, the CIA strives to keep the Middle East destabilized enough so that the oil rich countries will have to rely on U.S. support. Another plot shows renegade Islamic terrorists preying on suicidal simpletons to fulfill their own murderous agenda. Essentially, the average American moviegoer is supposed to wade into this morass of amorality and walk out crying foul. Sample any foreign affairs books by distinguished historians such as John Lewis Gaddis, Michael J. Hogan, William Appleman Williams or Walter LaFeber, and you'll discover the unsavory realities of American foreign policy since the Eisenhower administration through to contemporary presidents. Some people will applaud the producers of "Syriana" for making an ambitious thought-provoking film that doesn't pander to lowest common denominator interests. Admirable as their efforts are, the "Syriana's" producers seem to have forgotten what makes a good film.Gaghan's chief problem is his obsession with message at the expense of compelling drama. Hopelessly preachy as it is, "Syriana" is going to stump the average moviegoer rather than stun them into a sense of consciousness about the corrupt amoral world around them. Indeed, we do need more movies like "Syriana" to expose the evils that our government engineers in the name of national interests. Unfortunately, the problem that "Syriana" has is the problem that afflicts too many typical or atypical Hollywood products--of alienating more often than involving audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GOD DAMN what a boring movie. Half of this movie is in Arabian, with no subtitles. This is really stupid considering that the movie is playing here in Canada and the US where nobody speaks Arabian!! Get a clue! Get subtitles!! There are two ways you can go about making a movie about the corruption of the oil industry: Either make the movie a documentary, or make the movie interesting. "A real eye-opener" one person said. I can't believe that pretentious BS. First of all, the only people that would say that are people who already know about corruption in the government and the oil industry and their views of this dull excuse for a movie are swayed by their political agenda. Hey, I'm on your side! But I don't think this waste of time and film helps your cause one tiny bit! Secondly, a fictional movie proves nothing. Lastly... some people actually LIKED this?!?! WHY?? I've read some of the positive reviews and I still can't figure it out. Do you think you will be betraying your political viewpoint or something if you say this crappy movie is anything other than crappy? If you pick a movie randomly in the video store with a blindfold on, chances are it will be better than this movie. Reading the blockbuster comments on the movie I read that "It's not about good or evil... as everyone is evil... it's about how far they will go!" Pretty much any movie that has any type of villain in it will be better than this. He could be rubbing his hands together and tying puppy dogs to railroad tracks and it would still be a better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good fiction has one major advantage over documentary - it allows us to say, "What if . . ." Documentary may allow us to challenge 'facts', but fiction creates hypothetical scenarios of endless ingenuity that can free us to explore the sense of right and wrong from myriad points of view. One of the characteristics of the mature intellect may even be the ability to encompass many perspectives, to use multiple paradigms, before attaching great weight to any particular position. For fiction to work in this way, it needs to encompass realistically many sides of a dilemma, and ask more questions than answers. As a modern day global thriller, Syriana, rather than trying to push home a particular agenda, ekes out justifiable reasons behind the actions of a multitude of differing individuals, governments, cultures, corporate bodies and institutions that all have one thing in common - the high stakes and power plays flowing from the procurement and availability of oil. Its interweaving stories in many locations force us to try and make sense of an international tragedy facing our planet in what President Bush has described as the 'addiction to oil'.Using facts from a work of non-fiction, 'See No Evil', Syriana starts in Iran with George Clooney almost losing control over the movement of some armaments (although not essential, a mental map of the world and some familiarity with relevant world affairs will greatly enhance enjoyment of this movie). A few minutes later, in a street in Tehran, there is a casual and almost unconnected explosion that destroys any illusion of this being a nice, comfortable spy movie. It was at this point that I decided Bad Things were probably going to happen in the film. Repeatedly. It already had an almost clinical realism suggesting no storyline would be sweetened.Writer Stephen Gaghan takes a similar multifaceted approach to the one he used in his award-winning Traffic, empathetically tracing the lives of people from very different worlds as they interconnect and converge on a single theme. Clooney, as a veteran CIA operative, confronts various dilemmas in trying to do his job well in the face of interference, as well as personal crises, survival under torture, and trying to make a positive difference in a messed-up world. His bosses look at a more global picture but are frequently hampered. Potentially sensible, civilised developments in the tradition-laden world of the Gulf princes could alter the world balance-of-power in a damaging way. The free enterprise and profitable (if questionable) merger of two oil concerns creates apprehension in Washington and among energy experts, but also impacts the lives of migrant workers in a way no-one considers in the face of more pressing worries. Traders meanwhile look at instability premiums.Clooney's son has typical university student angst, righteously (if simplistically) accusing his parents of being professional liars. Energy consultant Matt Damon and his wife Amanda Peet find their relationship increasingly strained as his professional commitments become more dangerous. Their son provides a rare moment of comic relief at a family vegetarian breakfast by demanding 'pig bacon'.Approaching hefty problems on every level but also reminding us of the human commitment, energises Syriana in a way few movies dream possible. We can identify with most of the characters or at least admit their reality. None are perfect, and all are prey to the greed or corruption of others, whether it is a conflicted businessman or an uneducated and penniless youth living in the shadow of a Middle-Eastern oil-field. Whatever your politics or beliefs, Syriana is sure to cast doubt on them, but in not taking sides it makes us aware of aspects we might not otherwise have considered.Minutely researched and executed, the film poses stark questions that are too uncomfortable generally to even ask, and then only offers inescapable geographical facts or hard truths that politicians might genuinely want to shield us from. Deputy National Security Adviser (Viola Davis) tries to simplify it: "India is now our ally. Even China will be an ally. Everybody between Morocco and Pakistan is the problem. Failed states and failed economies, but Iran is a natural cultural ally of the U.S. The Persians do not want to roll back the clock to the 8th century. I see students marching in the streets. I hear Khatami making the right sounds. And what I'd like to know is if we keep embargoing them on energy, then someday soon are we going to get a nice, secular, pro-Western, pro-business government?" Agent Clooney, from hard experience, tries to disabuse her of such wishful thinking but is dexterously sidelined in favour of People Who Have Answers.Syriana is a venture of Participant Productions, a company that aims to make socially relevant films, which also have broad appeal, and it is the most accomplished offering of the company to date. An action-packed but critically intelligent thriller, it doesn't take sides or offer solutions, but the effect is both breathtaking and harrowing. Its main source material, 'See No Evil', could suggest not only a hiding from unpalatable truth, but even a desire to see good in all actions ('everyone believes they are doing the right thing when they do it') approach that lends credibility to diverse points of view and, although George Clooney is a self-confessed left-wing liberal, his film, ironically, might even suggest that Bush's memorable truism could be the most revolutionary policy statement of that presidency. Our imaginary country of Syriana is a place where we can all let our imaginations run free to plumb the quagmires of human tragedy associated with the oil industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I understand what the maker's of this movie were going for, trying to educate Americans on how corrupt big business can negatively effect US foreign policy with dire consequences, among which is our current struggle against Islamic terrorism. The movie is based on Robert Baer's book, "See No Evil", a book written by a disenchanted former employer of the CIA. I contend if you want to understand how big business has effected foreign policy, read the book and avoid the movie.Let me say this straight out... the movie is fictional. For me to try and understand, truly understand, how corrupt business and politicians have hijacked our foreign policy by watching this movie, would be like trying to understand the dogma of the Catholic church by watching another work of fiction, "The Da Vinci Code".Are we Americans so stupid in our understanding of international history, and the currents and eddies behind world events, they must be explained to us through fiction? If so, we deserve our current predicament, which should only worsen our ignorance.I challenge filmmakers to educate us with accurate portrayals of history. OK, so these movies may not have headliner opening weekends. But truth will educate throughout the years, and a movie true to history will continue to teach even when it sits on the DVD shelf of your local video rental store, or dusting next to the Harry Potter movies in your video cabinet.You want us to see how corrupt businesses tarnish national politics? Give us the names of true companies, real politician's and CEO's, their human motivations based on greed and selfishness. Don't give us impressive shots of huge oil refineries with computer generated fictional company names and then expect me to undertake the enormous task of understanding and battling the real corruption which robs our country of it's ability to establish fair and just policy.I would rather watch movies like "The Insider" a hundred times than this Syriana drivel. Hey, when can we expect the substandard sequel based on Baer's book "Asleep In The Light"? You know, it could be the revelatory sequel where fictional countries and leaders and politicians and companies are shown which will miraculously pull back the veil of our ignorance and lead us to understand how big business and a corrupt America inspires simple Muslim believers to conduct acts of international terrorism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really disappointed in this film. The premise was interesting enough but in order to engage, a certain amount of tension is required. Most of the scenes were tedious; the only scene I can really remember is the rather excruciating torture sequence which momentarily wakes the audience from their slumber. The film introduces a succession of bland and uninteresting characters and a bewildering array of sub-plots to no real effect. Clooney's character had the potential to be terrific in the 'reluctant hero' mould but he was involved in so few scenes of any substance that this was never really fulfilled. I would like to say that Syriana was at least a well-intentioned and thought-provoking film but frankly, I was too bored to care much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film does a couple of things VERY well... it does not take sides and is honest. After that it goes downhill. The convoluted and sometime ambiguous direction of the plot was maddening. I could not, for the life of me, get involved with or care about the people in the film. The characters actually felt secondary to the plot. There were moments in which I felt narration would have been more effective than some of the hollow characters paraded in front of me. Matt Damon's relationship with his wife, Clooneys relationship with his son, The prince's relationship with his father... all of them related to oil... and all never fleshed out completely. Not one of them evoked a response from me emotionally. They did, however, make me look at my watch a couple of times, to see how much longer I had to sit there. So here is the upshot as I see it:OK - America has a love hate relationship and is addicted to oil - no surprise there. OK- America (and the rest of the developed western world) will take advantage of a foreign resource that they need and want and will take it. Particularly if it is profitable-- Ummm... No kidding. OK- so big giant businessmen and lawyers are corrupt. Jeez, tell me something new.Overall, I would not watch it again and I am glad I did not pay much for it. Even I, a tree hugger, Kyoto accord supporter, biofuel using, ex hippy, who has lived overseas could not remain involved in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first 45 minutes or so, I was wondering, "what the heck is this about!?", yet I was fully intrigued and involved. Then, smooth as silk, the premise and deep subtleties of the plot became abundantly clear -- a fantastic reward for moviegoers who have intelligence, and know how to think for themselves. For those who expect a big bang Hollywood piece of bloat, prepare to be disappointed. This is a very unusual movie, in that it literally submerges you in multiple story lines, lives, and issues, and does not tell you how you're supposed to process them, which is disarming and sometimes confusing at first. Instead, it slowly seams things together in a brilliant, subtle way, until you are right in the middle of the blast point. I've never seen a filmmaker do this with such skill. The actors are all fantastic, except for one very old and evil man, who is over the top and typecast. This frightening and depressing commentary on our modern world is intertwined with the actual lives of those involved, in a very real and honest way. Moving, in a way that nothing else I recall seeing in the last few years can touch, besides Capote, perhaps.Absolutely brilliant. What a relief to see a movie like this, that gives me credit as a film-goer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Jumbled Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was probably a good story in this clutter somewhere. There were good questions put forth in the plot. The scenery was enjoyable. The corporate characters were cast as the typical ravenous merchants we, the public, assume there are. The government agents were also stereotyped in the mold of secrecy, subterfuge and the "cover my own booty at all costs" pattern. The acting was fine other than the Clooney portrayal of the haggard and betrayed CIA agent. His character was really unnecessary and distracting from the rest of the movie after the early events. The direction of the film was lacking continuity and jumped around too much to get a feel for the characters or the scene that was unfolding. And it's also too bad the editing team who pieced it together made such mess out of the story. It was a jumble of short clips that left me unsatisfied and asking, "where's the beef?" If I got a message at all from the movie, it was one I already knew, that sometimes it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys and often they are both just polarizing ends of the problem. It certainly didn't live up to all its fanfare. Thumbs down.</fullReview>

The fact that the creators deal with such an important subject is very commendable, namely the oil business, the relations between the west and the middle-east, the corruption of the US corporate politics and so forth. Thus this is an important film. But it is not a GOOD film. In this it joins the likes of a number of equally important films undeservedly praised and hyped by the media. I mention A History of violence, and especially Traffic, by the same producers, that was an hugely disappointing experience. The latter was however more comprehensible for the viewer. Syriana is packed with subplots and characters, and I found myself struggling trying to place them and connect the dots. Finally I gave up. Also George Clooney did an OK part (and showed dedication through gaining 20 kilos) but this was far from Oscar material for his part.</fullReview>

Sadly, I've never seen so many people walk out of a theater. The defense that its a complicated issue doesn't hold water. Thats the point of making a "statement" film ... to uncomplicate the issue, or at least shed some light on it. This is simply bad story telling. Want us to "get it" that it's confusing and multifaceted? Then create cogent story telling to make your point. This is a great cast, a great look, great acting, with a script that is too lazily constructed to make sense, and editing that did nothing to clarify. Want a great movie that makes a statement?

But, in a nutshell, this movie simply sucks. While we could sit and discuss the fact that the US is in bed with the Saudis is beyond the point. The storyline is so convoluted that the point is nothing but a drop of food coloring in a swimming pool. This film is a prime example of what happens when producers spend millions on great talent and then waste that talent on a story that a big brain thought is "important." The thing that bothers me the most is the fact that it is "important," but the handling of the subject matter was amateur at best. Syriana is a film that must have had the editors in a frenzy ... 5 hours of film and a hell of a time trying to condense it. Overall, this is barely a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana (2005): Dir: Stephen Gaghan / Cast: George Clooney, Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Peet: Compelling thriller about Middle East danger and the life threatening struggle of a C.I.A agent. It is a complex screenplay about oil, corruption and various individuals that figure into well placed subplots. Director Stephen Gaghan does a fantastic job of creating a documentary type feel and is backed with terrific casting. George Clooney delivers one of his greatest performances as a C.I.A agent who falls under betrayal and is nearly killed. Matt Damon plays a trader sent to the Middle East and brings his family but consequently his son dies in an accident. This causes an emotional tear in his family as well as his mindset during the remainder of his mission. Christopher Plummer plays a lawyer at a firm in Washington hired to handle political implications and seeks global merger. Jeffrey Wright plays an investigator sent to dig up dirt on the oil company only to learn that the firm he works for has made dishonest deals. This places him in a difficult position professionally. Amanda Peet is featured as Damon's wife who is caught in this sh*t storm reality where chaos is not on the TV screen anymore. This is all somewhat complicated, but then again, perhaps that is the point. It demonstrates human greed without shame in spite of the innocent that suffer. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting geopolitical thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the murky worlds of the oil industry and Middle Eastern politics this film follows various characters caught up when a US company fears losing a vital contract in an unnamed Arabian country on the Persian Gulf. The Emir is preparing to hand power to one of his sons; the elder, Prince Nasir, wants to make their country more liberal and believes that selling to the Chinese at a higher price will make this possible; his brother is more interested in his personal fortune and will happily sell to the Americans then buy US weaponry with the profits if his own pockets are sufficiently lined. Into this situation we see CIA operative Bob Barnes who is concerned when a missile sold as part of a sting operation goes missing; his bosses are more concerned about the state of the oil industry and wants him to assassinate Prince Nasir? a plan that doesn't go well and nearly gets him killed. Meanwhile Geneva based energy analyst Bryan Woodman gets a job working with the Prince as he plans to create a post-oil economy for the country. Back in the US lawyer Bennett Holiday is given the task of making the oil company's activities seem legal? even if it means sacrificing some senior people to the law. The final plot thread follows a young Pakistani migrant who gets radicalised after losing his job in the gulf.As the film progresses it switches between these plot strands; each part of the larger picture but almost totally separate as far as the characters are concerned. The idea of having protagonists who are for the most part totally unaware of each other is interesting although it does make it imperative that you play close attention to what is happening. If one does that this is a gripping thriller which manages to provide some surprises although as the end approaches most viewers will be fairly certain that it won't end well and business will progress as usual. The cast do a solid job making us believe in their characters. These notably include George Clooney who plays the less than glamorous Barnes, Matt Damon who plays Woodman and Alexander Siddig who plays Prince Nasir. The film does not shy away from depicting Western actions in the Middle East as self-serving and hypocritical; something that can be uncomfortable viewing at times. Don't expect lots of action; what action there is is fairly matter of fact or disturbing rather than exciting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Written and directed by Stephen Gaghan, "Syriana" stands among one of the top political thrillers of 2005. This complex tale features the trials and tribulations of the oil industry between the Texas oil conglomerates and the Gulf emirs, Middle Eastern terrorists and smart lawyers, the CIA Agents and the Iranian liberation organizations, the fear of China uprising economically, the disdain of regulation, shady business dealing mixed with botched missile attacks, it has everything you would expect in an enthralling political drama.From the guy who wrote the 2001 Oscar winning film "Traffic", Gahgan wrote the script inspired from the memoirs of former CIA Agent Robert Baer and the title derives from the representation of a reconfigured Middle East. Sure it comes as no surprise that Gaghan thinks that the oil trade is synonymous to selling dope. There's shady deals mixed with exciting thrills and if one error is made, it'll be that one error that you wish you never had committed. With the huge ensemble of talented thespians, the international globe-jumping, and the scintillating film's depth stands alone like no other. Much like the ever powerful film "The Interpreter", "Syriana" is surely going to make your brain active. Running just over the two hour mark, this film had enough fortitude to have lasted a half hour longer.Looked pudgy and bearded, George Clooney is Oscar material and has that bear-like instincts in him as grizzled CIA Agent Bob Barnes who's mission is to go to Iran and put a stop towards illegal trafficking in the Middle East. Matt Damon is equally poignant as a giddy young energy analyst named Bryan Woodman who reluctantly cashes in a family incident to form an alliance with a Persian Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig). Jeffrey Wright has an engaging subplot as the debonair Washington DC attorney Bennett Holiday who has his hands full (in oil that is) as he's about to propose a monstrous merger with a top oil company while shutting out the Gulf, while Jimmy Pope's (Chris Cooper) oil company Killen has been bribed to get drilling rights in the country of Kazakhstan.Not one subplot conveys any kind of bias towards Americans just like not every Middle Eastern civilian is entirely evil. So therefore it refrains from having some sort of Republican agenda going for it. In a unbiased perspective, I'm given the impression that Prince Nasir is the incumbent good guy while Mr. Holiday's superior Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is a merciless antagonist. The morality between the characters in this story are not set in stone. What truly embodies "Syriana" is to try to decipher the sincerity with the three leading stars (Damon, Clooney and Wright). But even though your brain is getting good exercise the confusing subplots is also its main liability. The points of view depicted in this movie are so varied it is enough to give anyone a migraine and we have very little time to decode it.There are times when the characters were under-directed. It's hard to understand whether Barnes was a decoy or a hardened operative or a bit of both. Is Woodman a glorified opportunist or an incentive idealist? And what does Bennett Holiday have on his agenda? Is he a shady attorney with a passive-aggressive demeanour, or is he just corporate human puppet just out to make a huge profit and to please his superiors? And sure like most political thrillers, character development outweighs action, the activity is virtually micro. Agent Barnes is an enigmatic intellectual for hitting the narratives worldwide."Syriana" can be both depicted as both provocative and at times a bit out of place. However, Gaghan is less interested in heroics and more focused on the system as much as it can be unraveled. His visions are more philosophical than they are obvious. We do feel that at any moment, one country will be bombed and that sooner enough the big story will finally materialize through the more smaller subplots.From Gaghan's skewed framing, awkward editing, and overwhelming Stedicam, add more salt to the wounds of the movie's jilted narrative. And while underneath the chaos, never once does Gaghan ever try to insult its audience. Gaghan assumes we'll get the historical gist when names a Mossadegh comes to mind or the conspicuous self-serving Zen monks certain characters come onto the scene.Even though this movie has moral feelings to it, its intentions are at times quite superficial. But no matter what this movie is anything but glib or flaky.</fullReview>

Good effects. evens locations and shooting scenes resemble actual site of evens quite well.events and story are well put together.Cons:using Indian actors as Arabs is a repeated stupid mistake by this same director. actors set to speak Arabic do not speak proper Arabic and seems it was transletarated for them. This is a must see movie for those who seek to know facts about our world and the way it runs. Answers many of your questions. money well spent when you watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been reading some of the reviews here. Those who are critical of it seem to think that the movie portrays USA too negatively and it is the ARABS who are to be blamed for the current oil crisis. I think this movie actually shows how America, at the behest of American companies seem to think that they can do anything to anyone just because they have the military power. This movie shows how corrupt Americans are destroying the Middle East. The movie in itself is very good. The characters are well built. The character of the young suicide bomber has been portrayed very responsibly. This is a certainly a movie which forces you to think. If people find it difficult to follow the story then it is their fault.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A landmark film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lasting Impression: Every now and then a film arrives that demands that it not merely be watched, but studied.Stephen Gaghan's effort is astonishing in it's breadth and depth. The Source: Based on ex-CIA operative Bob Baer's heartfelt autobiography "See No Evil", Gaghan embarked on an extensive research, accompanied by Mr. Baer himself, to meet the real people in the geo-political game of energy security (read Arab Oil). Those who have read the book will realize that a small part of the book forms just one strand in the film. The Outline: The major strand is the purported merger of two US oil giants, after one is kicked out of the Gulf, in favour of a Chinese consortium, by the ageing Emir's ambitious son, and the other, smaller company that has acquired lucrative oil fields elsewhere. This politico-legal-corporate strand of the story is led by a lawyer of a reputed firm that is providing legal advice to the merger. The next strand is a young immigrant Pakistani worker in the Gulf oil fields, who is out of a job because the Americans got kicked out. It portrays his gradual radicalization, for lack of a job, by a wily local Imam. The third strand is of a successful Industry Analyst(Matt Damon), based in Europe, who ends up tragically working for the Emir's son and is unwittingly involved in his power struggle. The final strand is the CIA operative(George Clooney), a dedicated field agent who gets trapped in all of this, by his own side. The Technicality: Each strand is fleshed out convincingly, and through some really smart editing, the film connects keeps pace with all the strands. Alexandre Desplat's score is haunting and evocative in it's simplicity, and very appropriately employed. The Takeaway: Essentially, it is a timeless parable about how smart/powerful people will use situations, systems and underlings in a matter-of-fact way to achieve their aims - whether personal gain or the greater good or both - there is no moral squeamishness about it. At the same time it is a poignant fable about the universality of "a decent chance at life" and lengths that ordinary people will go for it, before losing their way, maybe.The Impact: This film will not shock you like a Spielberg, or make you squirm like Oliver Stone - but will embed itself deeply within your psyche as a disconcerting shard of truth. For all the privileges we enjoy - someone, somewhere pays the price - and it's more than it should be. But then, there is no other way!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney, Matt Damon and many more famous and great actors collected for a Movie based on a plot that criticizes oil-industry and capitalism economic. For me it sounded like one of the best Movies in the century. That I got badly disappointed can be already seen at my voting 5/10 points.What did go wrong? Like I already said: Great story, very complex and (for me of course) also very interesting. But why do you have to create such awfully complex and complicated relationships between the characters when the theme the Movies' about already that deep IS ? Mostly I disliked the whole story as it was messed up by the relations between these characters - I didn't understand who and why broke up with whom, what it all had to do with George Clooneys son, and the death of Matt Damons son - there natuarlly was a connection; the war in the family history of Emir and his two sons, the government of the united states, their favorite employees etc. pp. . As you can see I still don't get the whole situation.But still 5 points for the well set plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, disjoint and not particularly enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever seen a movie that left you feeling very, very cold? Well, this is certainly the case for me and "Syriana". Now my problem is not the film's politics. I don't care if a movie has a far left or far right bent--if it's a good film, it's a good film. So the film's criticism of US foreign policy, paranoia and the oil industry didn't bother me. What bothered me was the film's style. Again and again, the movie could have been emotionally involving but wasn't. Even when a terrible tragedy occurs to a child early in the film and someone is tortured, I felt oddly disconnected. Because of the VERY sterile style of the film, I just didn't care about the characters. And, because I had no idea who were the good guys and who were the bad (I suspect there were NO good guys in this one), I also didn't care much about the film. It's sad, as there are a lot of good actors in the film--most of which are given very thankless and dull roles (such as Matt Damon who seemed to almost be sleepwalking at times through the role). One of the only ones who came off well was Chris Cooper. While a nasty character, at least he had character! Most were just dull automatons. And, this made we wonder how George Clooney (an accomplished actor) got an Oscar for this! He's done so many deserving roles--but here he isn't all that interesting--just another automaton. I don't get this film--and can't see how they could have made a potentially interesting topic less interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana does not contain the action scenes you might associate with George Clooney or Matt Damon and its split narratives do not lead to a life-affirming conclusion. Nor will it cut any ice with patriots wedded to the idea of America's role as the liberator of the Middle East. But none of this makes it a bad film.True, it can be a mite confusing. It took me a while to work out what, or who, George Clooney's CIA agent was meant to be doing when he is sent to Beirut. But momentary confusion does little to obscure the function of the film - a masterclass in American foreign policy in the Middle East.The film, wisely, does not mention Iraq. To do so would enter a debate that has become so polarised as to be meaningless. It gives a broader picture, and by doing so exposes the paradox in American (and British) policy towards the Middle East. While we in the West do believe that democracy is a way of stabilising countries and bringing them into the global economy, it is a double-edged sword. If Arab leaders are elected, they have legitimacy in the eyes of their people. The more legitimacy they have, the less they must rely on Western military support to prop up their regimes.What Syriana illustrates so eloquently is that when it comes down to a choice, America would rather have despotic Arab leaders it can push around than liberal-minded reformists who would be free to negotiate oil deals with, say, China. It is not a choice without consequences, the film argues. Which leader, the despot or the reformist, is more likely to preside over a society that fosters terrorists? The film lets you make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it should have been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was recommended to me by a political analyst. Since I love political thrillers, without any doubt I took the DVD and saw it. Maybe my expectations were too high, but a movie with superb actors and a genius director should have been a lot better. This movie has three different story lines. If we observe all of them separately we will find great political/social/crime stories. Put them together and the result is not so pleasing. Why is that so? Every story tried to present a complete sociological structure of it's main character. While concentrating on one (story/character), we are (in a lack of a better word) violently shifted to the next one, and this little problem repeats itself throughout the movie. I found myself constantly trying to keep up with the movie, thinking: "Where did we leave of in this story?" "What happened here?" etc. In this constant focus shift, I did not receive the complete image of some crucial characters. Another problem with this movie is that it has almost no music. It gave the movie a dull and even more slow-paced feature than it actually has. Apart from these big flaws, the acting is superb, certain scenes are so powerful that they stick with one long after the movie is over, and it has a great message. It's not easy to watch, it's complex and at times difficult to understand, but it really is worth the time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dramatic thriller, Syriana, is a telling story of how the power of the oil industry?particularly, the United States' dependence on it?affects the world and many lives. The story provides an account of the interrelated lives of key people/groups: the Emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), successor to his father's position as Emir, gives drilling rights to a company in China, which takes the supply away from the United States; a major U.S. energy company, Connex, loses this oil connection in the Middle East to China and enters into a shady deal with a smaller U.S. company, Killen, which has ties to oil in Kazakhstan; a lawyer, Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright), is assigned to investigate the Connex/Killen merger only to discover a hint of corruption; the Pakistani immigrant, Wasim Khan (Mazhar Munir) who loses his job at the oil company once Connex is outbid by a Chinese company; the energy analyst, Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) becomes Prince Nasir's economic adviser to bring reform to Nasir's country; and CIA agent, Bob Barnes (George Clooney), who is familiar with the Middle East from previous missions soon realizes the shadiness of the U.S. government.The film's theme?the oil dependency of the United States and the social problems it causes, which creates a ripple effect?captures the greed, the corruption, and the deceitfulness one natural resource, oil, poses on those who come in contact with it. These factors all stem from the removal of oil supply to the United States, which was believed to be extremely detrimental to the U.S. economy. From Prince Nasir establishing a business relationship with China down to Wasim being introduced to a powerful weapon, no one knew how significant their actions would be to the world. At certain times, the theme often reminds you of another of Writer/Director Stephen Gaghan's films, Traffic, where social problems?the war on drugs?connected independent stories and involved corruption and exploitation.The different film techniques?lighting and rough-grain film stock?were used appropriately throughout the film, and helped compliment the film's theme by providing depth, dismal moods, and a quick capture of reality. For example, the low lighting used in the meeting between Connex and Killen representatives sets the scheming and somber mood of the scene, as well as the dark lighting set in the debrief meeting between agent Bob Barnes, his superiors, and the CLI?Committee for the Liberation of Iran?which creates a more dramatic image for the importance of the meeting. Finally, the rough-grain film stock created the rough and grainy image with harsh contrasts for the bomb explosion set off by Bob Barnes as he swiftly walked away from the scene.In conclusion, Gaghan effectively communicates the theme of the United States' dependence on oil and its effects by focusing on the intertwined lives of its characters throughout the film. His gritty filming techniques and character development are successful in making Syriana a complicated work that draws the viewer into its focus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Syriana' is an interesting watch, that works for it's innovative &amp; progressive story-line. Also, the performances, especially by George Clooney, leave a terrific impact. 'Syriana' Synopsis: A politically-charged epic about the state of the oil industry in the hands of those personally involved and affected by it.'Syriana' works for many reasons, the first being it's innovative &amp; progressive story-line, that truly catches your attention. Stephen Gaghan's Screenplay is razor-sharp in the first-hour, in fact, each chapter &amp; it's characters are wonderfully penned &amp; explained. Though the Screenplay does dip in the second-hour, the culmination again takes a giant leap &amp; leaves a strong impact. Gaghan's Direction, like his Screenplay, is inspiring. Cinematography &amp; Editing, are fine. Art Design &amp; Costume Design, are worth a mention.Performance-Wise: George Clooney, in an Oscar-Winning Role, delivers marvelously. The Acting Giant is in top-form and steals the show. Matt Damon is superb. In fact, this performance is amongst his better works. Amanda Peet is first-rate. Jeffrey Wright is restrained. Chris Cooper, as always, is flawless. Mazhar Munir is fair, while Supremely Talented Actors like William Hurt &amp; Christopher Plummer, are hardly there. Others lend support. On the whole, An Absorbing Tale, that demands a viewing. Go For It!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was watching this film, I was at first,a bit confused and in a way I still am which is why I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in political thrillers. Since I found this movie a tad bit confusing, it would be worth a second viewing. Academy Award winner George Clooney stars as CIA agent Bob Barnes who is assigned on a mission to assassinate a "rogue" prince named Nasir Al-Subaai( Alexander Siddig) as well as all the politics about oil companies occurring simultaneously. Since there is a plethora of well-known faces in this movie,you would think that it is hard to pick out the best performances because you have a mix of leading men such as George Clooney, Matt Damon and William Hurt mixed with character actors such as Mark Strong, Tim Blake Nelson,Jeffrey Wright,Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper as well as some unrecognisable faces such as Alexander Siddig, Mazhar Munir and Kayvan Novak,etc.If I had to choose five top performances, it would include George Clooney, Alexander Siddig, Matt Damon, Mazhar Munir as a Pakistani migrant worker and Christopher Plummer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Syriana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the biggest reason I wanted to see this film was because of the leading actor winning a supporting actor Oscar, I had to see if he deserved it, and if the film was any good too. Basically in Iran a missile has disappeared, but the CIA is more concerned about the heir to an Emirate giving an oil contract to China, and a firm has landed a Kazakhstani oil contract. The Department of Justice suspects bribery, and there is a scapegoat, and the CIA need one when they fail to kill the Emir-apparent. Agent Bob Barnes (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated George Clooney) is the one that sorts out the double cross, but then his son is killed and things spiral out of control. Other stories going on in the film are Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) going to another country for important reasons taking his family, and Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) getting involved in some important matters. Okay, I'll be honest I didn't understand all of what was going on, it was pretty much the same amount of understanding as with Michael Clayton, another political film. Also starring Chris Cooper as Jimmy Pope, William Hurt as Stan, Mazhar Munir as Wasim Khan, Tim Blake Nelson as Danny Dalton, Amanda Peet as Julie Woodman, Christopher Plummer as Dean Whiting, Alexander Siddig as Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, Nicky Henson as Sydney Hewitt, Max Minghella as Robby Barnes, Thomas McCarthy as Fred Franks, Viola Davis as CIA Chairwoman, William Charles Mitchell as Bennett Holiday Sr., Akbar Kurtha as Prince Meshal Al-Subaai, Nadim Sawalha as Emir Hamed Al-Subaai, Mark Strong as Mussawi and Fonejacker's Kayvan Novak as Arash. Clooney does have some good moments, I don't know if he deserved such a highly coveted award, and being in a leading role as well, but he was good, and even though I didn't get it all, this political thriller had its moments. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Alexandre Desplat. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Gaghan's film 'Syriana' is certainly ambitious, offering us a complex, intelligent and ultimately unhappy view of the politics of oil. In a large ensemble cast, George Clooney is perhaps the lead in an atypically unglamourous role, playing an overweight, rogue U.S. government agent. The story seems complex enough to fill an entire television series, and is at times confusing; rather than spelling out every incident of plot, the film instead samples each strand at key intervals, conveying a sense of development without telling us exactly how it has happened. By the end of the movie, one is finally involved enough to care; but it's a slow process, and what is sacrificed is the chance of real sympathy for any of the characters; while I normally dislike heroes of pure motive, there has to be an "in" to a story; without one, the take home message fails to amount to much more than "it's a bad world".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly convoluted political thriller that has too much dialogue about who is more socially aware, but also gets some points across</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is most definitely not for anyone, I usually don't like political movies for it being a bit too complex and this one is no exception it is really really complex and thought provoking especially the dialogue, which sort of also gets annoying after a while since it comes off as people bickering amongst each other about who is more socially aware. This film is like watching a race to take control of the oil in the Persian Golf, in anyways possible a death race. Some may say the plot is a bit far fetched but it's somewhat close to how desperate the US is when it comes to oil and take control of it in anyways possible even sticking there nose in other countries business in doing so and how that can majorly effect those countries. This is a film that the audience needs to watch multiple times to grasp the concept of the plot, I just wished the dialogue wasn't as complex cause it has a tendency to turn some viewers off. The plot also has multiple subplots but they somewhat intertwine in something that is common, than what it shows. Each and everyone of the cast did a fine job with the role they are given, even if the number of cast members are pretty huge. Bob Barnes(George Clooney) is a CIA operative who falls from his status and favor after failing his last mission and speaking his mind to the wrong people, he is sort of a plot device but keeps the film in motion and plays a part in the climax. Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst based in Geneva, Switzerland. Who is also ambitious even after the loss of his son in a accident, and helps and advise Prince Nasir with his revolutionary views to change his country for the better. Bennett Holiday(Jeffrey Wright) who plays a lawyer for a oil company and a negotiator and does a fine job for the company, unfortunately I didn't find his subplot to be all that interesting. Despite the plot being somewhat of a race, it also shows the flaws of global economic and the US system. It's a well told story with a not so satisfying ending, which will turn some audiences off especially when the audience has to go through a very convoluted plot to get there and despite the beginning the movie is a bit dry. To be honest I didn't enjoy watching this film, it was like watching the news, but for what it is I give it a 7 out of 10 even if a lot of it is black and white and gives info in the most complex way possible of the stuff a lot of people already know about while being one dimensional.6.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film if you hate America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, there are a lot of America-haters out there -- and of course, a lot of them are Americans. They're the ones who applaud this film, since it confirms and caters to their liberal prejudices.Beneath its extremely complicated plot, stylish direction, and cynical in-the-know script, it's actually a pretty standard left-wing Hollywood political thriller -- which means that the archvillains turn out to be, you guessed it, the U.S. government -- specifically the CIA -- and greedy corporations, specifically Big Oil.By Big Oil, of course, I mean those horrible Texans (ugh! Texans!) with their booze, their backyard barbecues, and (just to complete the stereotype) their love of what's known as "canned hunting." (What a great way to make sure we hate someone: Have him shoot a captive antelope!) That the head oil-company exec is played by Chris Cooper, with his hair slicked back and his cowboy accent and those nasty little slitty eyes of his, tells you all you need to know. (His next project was playing the traitor Robert Hanssen in "Breach.")And to have the CIA extras -- I'm thinking specifically of a scene near the end, involving some sort of missile or drone attack -- played by a squad of ugly Waspy-looking guys in suits, all of them with blond crew cuts, all of them looking like mean overgrown frat-boy bullies -- that, too, tells you all you need to know.As does having the movie's good guy played by a handsome, sensitive-looking matinée-idol type who wears cool clothes. This good guy is an Enlightened Arab Prince, educated at Oxford and Georgetown, a humane, idealistic type who Wants to Do What's Best for His People, who supports Democracy and Women's Rights, and who would probably, given enough time, come out for Solar Power, Gay Marriage, and MoveOn.org.Needless to say, this Enlightened Arab Prince is blown to smithereens at the end by the evil CIA so that his shallow, greedy, more compliant brother, i.e. the Bad Prince, will ascend the throne -- and will presumably remain in the pocket of Big Oil. (Yes, it's worse than Mossadegh; the Good Prince literally becomes a CIA missile target, blown up while the frat boys follow the action on their TV screens, like a video game. Hollywood libs probably take it as an article of faith that the CIA assassinates enlightened Arab princes all the time.)The final thing you need to know is that the movie's Muslim suicide bomber is -- as I think one of the IMDb commenters here described him -- a handsome doe-eyed waif, shy, dutiful, hardworking, a loving son who becomes a suicide bomber mainly because he's out of work, hungry, and desperate. He's a Sympathetic Suicide Bomber, you see. At the end, when he and his bomb are in a motorboat, speeding toward a big ship -- not a U.S. Navy vessel like the real-life Cole but rather an oil tanker, a symbol of evil exploitative Big Oil -- the movie encourages you to root for him.Think of that! This piece of lefty propaganda actually wants you to root for a suicide bomber. That's the real message of this despicable film.</fullReview>

Unfortunately what I saw was the worst film I have ever viewed in my entire life, I was with people so I couldn't walk out but if I was on my own or maybe with just one other person I definitely would have.First off you don't ever care about any of the characters, not only do you not care, you don't even want to know them or their story line because its too stupid. This has similarities with traffic in some ways, grainy film, all star cast, the difference is without Soderbergh at the helm it falls to crap. The guy who wrote traffic wrote AND directed this. He is not a director, and it shows, in this sloppy mess.What makes me hate this film even more is how it ended up on some critics top ten lists. Nothing is worse than a horrible movie mistaken for a work of art. What elevates this film from the term "one of the worst films" to "THE worst film" is George Clooney's bearded fat guy performance. He seems to be saying the whole way through, LOOK AT ME act I got a beard and I am fat now!!! Hooray for me! And of course he won an Oscar for it.The camera is shaky and grainy, you breeze through about 6,000 supporting characters, all who look relatively similar. And you are supposed to follow this and be entertained by it. This is cinema at its absolute poorest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie attempts to document a fictitious attempt by the combined forces of the US government and a giant US multinational oil company to manipulate the politics of a Middle Eastern country (presumably Saudi Arabia) in order to ensure the supply of oil to America. Essentially, the Emir is preparing to hand over power, but his eldest son, who would normally succeed him, has signed a deal to sell oil to China. This son is a political moderate (even modern and democratic, favouring an elected Parliament and votes for women) but the US opposes him because of the China deal, and instead seeks to arrange (through a variety of surrogates) for his less competent and less democratic (but pro-American) younger brother to take power. The story is fictional, but plausible - which is the greatest strength of the film. It's believable pretty much all the way through. From what I had heard of the movie I was expecting to find a slam of some sort against the Bush administration, but that wasn't really evident here. It seemed more to be making the point that - whoever is supposedly in power in Washington - it's really oil that rules. That point is well made, and the complexity of doing business in the Middle East is also made evident. The problem with this is that it never really seemed to hit its stride. At one point, Bob (George Clooney) - apparently a CIA agent - is told that his experience is "narrow but thick." In other words, his whole career has been spent focusing on this one part of the world, so he knows a lot about this issue, but little about anything else. I'd describe the movie as the opposite: wide but shallow. It introduces too much. It jumps from Washington to Beirut to Spain to Iran to Saudi Arabia to Switzerland and back and forth, but - to me - there seemed to be little depth offered. We just get a bare sense of the behind the scenes machinations going on with little substance. Add to that the rather dull, lifeless and passionless flow to the movie (which matches my general attitude to George Clooney's acting in pretty much everything I've ever seen him in - I'm not a fan) and what you end up with may be a believable story, but it's a believable story that really isn't that interesting to watch unfold. It's no better than a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too complicated to understand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theme is interesting, and, even if this is not a completely true story, the things of this sort might have often happened at the oil-producing countries.But, because I saw this film at home by DVD, doing the chores at the same time, I was lost at following the story and had to see it twice. I concentrated on it for the second time, but the structure is a little bit complicated to understand.George Clooney deserves the Academy Award, and Matt Damon acts well enough to make us forget his image of Bourne. Jeffrey Wright looks like a real lawyer to achieve his duties and be concerned about whether he is doing right or not.I recommend this film to those who are interested in political/economic conspiracy and, more importantly, who can concentrate on it at home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the back of the DVD a critic said something to the effect that this is an action packed movie that will leave you at the end of your seat. That's not what it is. I'm not saying I want a mindless action packed movie, but I thought it was boring. Very boring. It is a very slow movie. After watching an hour of this movie I realized that nothing has happened yet. If I were to summarize what I have seen I would have little to say. The second half of the movie was no better. I really thought that the big actors in this movie would have been bought for a good reason, because a good movie needed excellent actors, that was not the case. I have read many other reviews and I agree in what was said, but does not make for a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Big oil means big money. Very big money. And that fact unleashes corruption that stretches from Houston to Washington to the Mideast - and ensnares industrialists, princes, spies, politicos, oilfield laborers and terrorists in a deadly, deceptive web of move and countermove. George Clooney, Matt Damon and Jeffrey Wright lead a stellar cast in a lightning-paced, whip-smart thriller written and directed by 'Traffic' Academy Award winner Stephen Gaghan. From its very first scene, Syriana grips your mind and nerves with an intensity that doesn't let go for an instant. What is the price of oil?" Although it has something very worthwhile to say, Mr. Gaghan's "Syriana" is too densely plotted; and, it leaves a few essential political dots unconnected. It is rather difficult to follow all of what is going on, during one sitting. The "shaky camera" technique distracts, but the film is generally well-produced, and nicely performed. Mr. Clooney (as Bob Barnes), Mr. Damon (as Bryan Woodman), and Mr. Wright (as Bennett Holiday) are top-billed, but there is no traditional leading player. Clooney won several "Best Supporting Actor" awards for his role - well, the "torture" scene wherein a surprisingly fat, shirtless Clooney takes a beating is certainly memorable.***** Syriana (11/23/05) Stephen Gaghan ~ George Clooney, Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an expose of power politicking around the oil business, the movie is only mildly successful. But then, I don't believe the film was intended as an expose. That would have required a more coherent, more focused narrative than the fragmentary mosaic we're confronted with. Instead of a judgmental result, we're presented with a dark panorama of bits and pieces that catch the characters on the fly and refuse to draw conclusions about what they do. The screenplay appears to say that in the amoral world of power politics there are only far-flung interests and the people promoting them, and nothing else significant enough to include. In this case the amoral cast includes the CIA, an oil analyst, a high-powered law firm, Hezbollah, suicide bombers, oil sheiks, Texas wildcatters, the Chinese, corporate oil men, and a motley assortment of other shady characters. If this seems unwieldy, it is. And so is the movieObviously, the intensely allusive style where little is explained forces a viewer to pay close attention, that is, if he doesn't give up first. Now, I realize that this is a highly sophisticated way of sketching an international panorama that likely defies traditional narrative, and further, that intellectually inclined viewers are likely impressed with the unyielding approach. My reservation is that the movie succeeds, but only within a narrow intellectual frame. More importantly, the topic shapes up as simply too important to be confined to an esoteric frame. I don't mind filling-in some dots, but I don't want to lose the picture because the dots are too few and too scattered. The movie ultimately suffers from trying to do too much with too little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I had known the writer of Traffic had penned this I would have avoided it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been described by one commentator here as ponderousness under pretense of profundity and that pretty much describes my feelings toward it. I had actually seen Traffic in the theaters and came away with the same feeling but with Netflix I tend to queue movies willy nilly and this movie came and went with both no increase in knowledge on the subject and a feeling that good actors are used to hide what is in essence a meandering bore fest. If you have no cynicism toward government and corporate America you will glean insight on the robber baron mentality of both as they exist in the world but shame on you for being so naive in the first place. Calling both Traffic and Syriana two of the best films in the last decade is a bit of a stretch but will grant respect for someone's opinion even if I do not share it. I gave it five stars basically for some of the great screen presence of actors Robert Foxworth and Christopher Plummer and even George Clooney was fascinating in parts but Matt Damon was poorly cast and never convinced me that he even believed his own character. If you have to watch preachy films the last one I saw that actually worked for me was Babel so I would heartily recommend that title over this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murky, but effective thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe there was one sub-plot too many, but this film is gripping right up to the conclusion. One would have to think that this film was almost intentionally murky in order to show just how complex the extraction of oil can be on a world-wide scale. Syriana is about a lot of things, and a lot of different people. But above all else, the movie is about the effect of the world's dependency on oil.The two biggest stars are a puffed-up George Clooney and Matt Damon. Clooney is a shadowy CIA agent who gets in a bit over his head while trying to take out a foreign leader. He is then cut loose by our government and the blame for the incident falls on his shoulders. Matt Damon plays some sort of international investment guru who through an act of tragedy becomes the chief financial adviser to an Arabic prince who may or may not be about to take over his father's country. These are just two of the many pieces of this thriller which also involves corrupt oil men in the U.S., poor Muslims who eventually have to become terrorists since there is no work for them, shadowy law firms, even more shadowy bureaucrats... the list goes on. The message of the film seems to be that oil dependency creates chaos, misunderstanding, and corruption. Most of what we see borders on pandering to our most basic fears and beliefs about every one of these types of characters, but the film really doesn't seem that preachy when its all said and done. Of course the movie takes a jab at the U.S. and blames our country for the lack of infrastructure in the Muslim world while at the same time these Shieks bask in luxurious high-rise hotels and palaces around the globe.There is some violence, and it is unsettling. Only George Clooney could take a beating like the one he takes and still look like a movie star in the next scene! The acting is exceptional, and the locations used for filming look incredibly realistic. The film was a commercial dud, though, and it isn't hard to see why. It is a little long, not exactly action-packed, and maybe too confusing for the average viewer. And when was the last time George Clooney headlined the cast of any profitable film that wasn't an "Oceans" film? I suppose I could pounce on Mr. Clooney all day if I wanted to, but his performance is one of the strongest aspects of Syriana. And Syriana is a film with a lot going for it. See it, but don't expect to completely "get it" on the first try. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

It has a complex plot, following several individuals scattered around the world. As a result, the film gets confusing and is hard to follow at times.A character says that he is proud that a certain country is not growing as fast as it could because of a lack of oil. Such a thought is chilling. Coupled with the highly disturbing ending, Syriana is an eye opener to those who have no idea what is going on behind the scenes. What price would we pay to get oil? Clearly, people are getting unscrupulous and selfish. Syriana is an intelligent and thought provoking drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Smart, dismal trip through the frighteningly complicated world most of us can't fathom but all of us live in. Stephen Gaghan directs exactly as he writes - no thrills, just a series of little jolts. Exceedingly credible, passionately unsensational, it is a downer of the first order. Still I find myself able to watch it repeatedly, not for revelation but to enjoy the craftsmanship. There's very little wrong with it structurally, or on any technical level, and such consistent competence is rare enough that I like to linger over it. Although its general description of the oil business and collateral economies is undeniably accurate, still this is a film that leans a hard left. If you disagree with its liberal politics, I imagine it is pretty hard to take. And if you got lost along the way, may I suggest that you need to practice paying attention. If you can't follow a movie that spells it out for you, I wonder how you make the decisions in your average day. Faith?Could you accurately identify 5 parties financially interested in selling you gasoline, beyond your franchise owner and the corporate name he leases? Could you name one of the ten lobbyists most directly responsible for your automobile safety legislation? Name the guys who sign off on food, air, and water quality standards in your county. I can't either. The point is we should know.When we relinquish responsibility for our lives, we reap the whirlwind. You want to know why people fly airplanes into skyscrapers? Go talk to them. See how they live, see what they want. Figure out what it is you're doing that's pissing them off. But it's all so mundane, and there are so many players to keep straight. I'd rather watch a movie about it and support public radio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some films are more difficult to watch than others and this certainly fits high on that list.America's insatiable need for oil driving a complex maze of wheeling and dealing,corruption, assassinations,politics and religious fanaticism is the crux of this film which becomes clearer in the final scenes but still leads you to say, "I'll need to watch that again." A very satisfying film which shows how the Economic war is played out in all its facets in the Middle East and the interconnectedness between oil,politics,greed,madness and the trade of weapons in a process that has obviously become very dirty.The inevitable connection between terrorism and people who feel disenfranchised and marginalised is very well done and humanises these people in a way I have not seen before.A stellar cast do a great job and the piecemeal direction technique we have seen in many recent movies suits well in the end, though difficult to read at times.My only criticism stems from the total lack of redeeming features in this film.Bar the murdered Prince, no character is likable though we can still identify with many.Some aspects of the web are poorly explained.For instance, I cannot see how Middle Eastern countries whose Sheiks spend their money on Castles, yachts and racehorses instead of infrastructure thereby disaffecting their people in such a way as to embrace extremism is in Americas' best interests. Indeed, the American political/economic/CIA alliance even recognises the benefits of a Committee to free Iran as in their long term interests.Hence this contradiction was passed over for the benefit of the most sinister motives. It would follow that the writers' would have us believe that present attempts to free Iraq are motivated purely by self interest rather than mutual interest which I believe many in power sincerely believe,even if strategically a disaster.This aside,Syriana is a powerful film for thoughtful people which well demonstrates a complex but crucial topic for the whole world in these critical times.

		<fullReview>Last night i watched Syriana. I did not know too much about it. I remember the commercials and I could tell it was probably a well acted and written movie. I am pretty sure George Clooney won best supporting actor for his role in the movie also. Besides that stuff the only other thing i knew about it was that George Clooney had a beard in it. Not only did he have a beard but he looked great with a beard. I am a huge fan of beards and I think it is safe to say that i have a beard for at least 6 months out of every year. My mother doesn't like it because she says it hides my handsome face. I have also been told that I look like crazy person or a serial killer when i let it get big and bushy. Despite being told i look crazy or gross with a beard it always gives me more confidence. Its like a protective mask or shield that makes me say things to people i normally wouldn't say. So yeah, George Clooney with a beard? Count me in!Later i found out that Syriana was written by the guy who wrote Traffic. I loved Traffic and I loved Syriana. It has the same style of hectic writing and intertwined story lines but instead of drugs Syriana focused on the oil industry. It covers the lives of oil executives, the leaders of countries who have oil, the leaders financial advisors, a government worker who gets leaders of countries assasinated and young Islamic students. Each persons actions indirectly and sometimes directly affect one anothers life for better or worse. Though none of the story lines are "fact" the movies gives you a feeling that the events that take place are not far fetched. To see lives ruined for profit gain and the many levels of corruption that could take place is scary. Its probably not a good movie for patriots because the overall message is not anti-American but definitely does not make the way the country look to favorable the way it puts profit before people.What won best picture last year? hmmm. I don't remember, but I think this is better than whatever won. Plus it has a bearded George Clooney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing is as political as oil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana - a film that is as complex as the situation itself.It is within our nature to try to draw a straight line to events and find the solution as clearly as possible, but Syriana shows that while instances can and do connect, there is hardly ever a straight line and final reasonable one-time, all encompassing explanation to anything.I liked Syriana, just as I liked "Traffic" which explained the road to drugs and drug smuggling is not clear cut, you cannot assume who and who is not a part of it because it comes from and is used in the scourge of the earth to the most wealthy and top educated. Syriana does accomplish showing the complex and constantly changing road to the control of oil and it's pricing and distribution. Just as in "Traffic", Syriana shows the causes and effects on each piece of the puzzle it features.This is a cerebral and complex movie and deliberately done so for the whole idea behind this film IS cerebral and complex. Not following typical Hollywood movie convention as in not trying to up tie everything nicey-neatly together, but obviously trying to provoke dialog, awareness and discussion after wards. This is not a film that was placed together to "entertain", but a film to review and consider the situations laid out before you - regardless of your beliefs and background.You are watching a game of pursuit of control and dominance of a globally needed commodity through several different avenues: a working family, several world governments bucking to stay or be the superpower, power struggles within a family, religion and interpretation of it, human survival, hierarchy succession, co-op operations, betrayal, life and death; how the world continues on and the probability of the whole thing to begin again - but this time, with different players in the same faction.What's the goal? What's the ambition? What's the Agenda? Why should I watch, and what does it have to do with me? Everyone seems to have hidden agendas and the like but the foundation is all about one thing: control. And the biggest control factor the entire world identifies with is the control of oil. Oil is a part of one of the biggest things the world uses and trades with at this point - and he that controls this, controls the world - at least, that's the thinking and motivations.Syriana takes on several of those avenues, ideas, concerns and lays them out for you to view and draw your own conclusions. You can't help but think and talk about some part of this film even if you didn't follow it all. It's that disturbing of a piece.</fullReview>

If only it were some 30-35 minutes longer, then it would become a true, deep, mesmerizing work of real art. George Clooney is a perfect actor, and again, he shows excellent mastery as a main character. But, still, the most unforgettable and breathtaking part of the film is the line of those two Arab men, who slowly become the ferocious fanatics and adopting the teaching of warlike Islamic groups, they finally decide to commit a suicide bombing, by attacking a large oil ship in their small steamer boat. The final scene, where we see them riding the boat, behaving so casually as if they are not going to die now, is so horribly realistic and true, that makes you cry. And then, the whole way of their coming to this decision is a real winner of the film... Many people got this film wrong. Pity, it is worth better opinions.</fullReview>

This film does an excellent job of illustrating just how politics and big business conspire to preserve the status quo which also protects their power and profits. The global interaction depicted in this film shows how all actions have consequences. The thirst our nation has for oil drives the kind of political and business policies that cause anger and hatred towards our nation. This oil addiction has led to an unjust war that was started on lies and disinformation. The result has been the deaths of over 2000 US servicemen and women, thousands more injured and tens of thousands Iraqi dead and wounded. This act has been the best tool Islamic terrorist groups have ever had in attracting followers and money to their cause.

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie; it challenges the American vox populi in terms of our politics and overseas policies. In order to understand Syriana on the third time of viewing you need to have a Bachelor's Degree. In order to understand it the first time, you need to have a J.D. It is pretty complex, so I had to open up the encyclopedia a few times to research mergers and due diligence, after that everything fell into place. Its own complexity saves it from widespread negative criticism and maybe even a nationwide ban. It tells us that Americans kill people because of oil, which we do, and that capitalist greed is the cause of terrorism, not Islamic morals. Since the average American is convinced that the United States promotes freedom and democracy all over the world, he or she would find this movie offensive and insulting, but fortunately the plot is way above his or her intellectual level, so Syriana is deemed as 'boring'. Unlike the Lord of War, which is not a Hollywood movie for obvious reasons, Syriana doesn't make such a direct reference to how the United States is the cause of much death and suffering in the world. Perhaps that is why Warner Brothers produced it. I'd recommend this film to everyone, but it's *not* for everyone. Like I said, you need to have some degree of higher education in order to follow the plot, and it does contest the "official" reason for American involvement in the Middle East. So if you're a devout fan of WWF, NASCAR, NHRA, NFL and/or have an American flag billowing proudly on your porch, then don't bother renting this flick, because you just won't get it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has a complicated plot, or rather a number of plots. For more clarity, and for people who have seen the movie already, I recommend the message board for this movie: check out the thread "Can someone explain this mess to me!", which contains an excellent summary (containing spoilers) by the user "dalati".It's a long movie, and I was not bored for a minute. Every scene was somehow dense with interesting dialog, interesting characters, action, or some other tension. The sound track added to the effect. Although the main characters had to fill the typical roles of the oil business (The oil businessman, The lawyer, The CIA agent, The MBA in the finance industry, The emir, and others) they were not stereotypes but all interesting human beings, and the movie kept me interested in them personally. This goes down to the minor roles: e.g., I found the middle-aged CIA lady who is one of George Clooney's bosses quite captivating.And I like movies where I can learn about the world. This movie takes you across the globe and back (with some wonderful landscapes, city sceneries, ocean views,...) and across social and cultural boundaries. Fascinating! Does the movie tell us The Truth about the oil business? Or are some of the features of the movie's oil business way off the real world? I have no idea. Probably more than half of the movie is true, but which half? Before passing judgment here, I would need more independent research. Thus, I do not think you should take Syriana as the final word on how the world works. But as a movie: great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie demonstrates the relationships between industrialized nation's thirst for dwindling oil supplies, the Middle Eastern emirates, and the clash of civilizations which results. Actually, the movie may serve as a precursor of real-life events to come. The middle east (and the world in general) is currently in desperate need of a leader who is a true people's advocate. How will such an individual survive within the current system of pay-offs, corruption, civil strife and war?Technically, the scenes were well shot, and really gave a feel for their locale. The pace of the movie is like reading a book with very short chapters ... meaning a lot of jumping around from one locale to the next, with no distinct relationship between characters until later in the film (similar to Traffic). I thought it could have used an additional 1/2 hour to more deeply develop the characters, especially those of the terrorists, who's story I think was abbreviated and oversimplified ...The most annoying part of the movie was the lack of balanced volume level throughout. Viewing it on TV (pay-per-view), I found myself constantly changing the volume up and down when scenes changed from whispers in conference rooms, to explosions and screaming. I wound up rewinding the film many times, in order to understand it better, especially the sub-titled parts. Even then, I wound up re-watching parts that weren't clear the first time around. This film is definitely better viewed from DVD or PVR with rewind feature, than all at once in a movie theater.Apart from that, this film is well worth watching. It enriches whatever knowledge you may think you have of Middle East politics.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but a bit too confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not know what to make of Syriana when it was released late last year. It looked engaging and looked to be much akin to Stephen Gaghan's other political film, the Academy Award winning Traffic. But, as that movie proved, you need to watch it at home and allow for the images and content to sink in order to fully understand and enjoy the film. So I waited, and after finally getting the chance to watch it, I am glad that I did.Syriana, at its heart, is all about the oil trade and what many companies and organizations are willing to do in order to get it. It tells various parallel stories, specifically lawyer Bennett Holiday's (Jeffrey Wright) search to ensure everything is legal in the merger between oil tycoons Connex and Killen, market analyst Bryan Woodman's (Matt Damon) financial and political advising to Middle Eastern Prince Nasir Al-Subaai (Alexander Siddig), and Bob Barnes' (George Clooney) continued work for the CIA. It has varying subplots, and has more than a few moments where the three story lines converge or intertwine.In one respect, Syriana is interesting and thought-provoking. Based off a true story, this fictionalized account of the oil trade and the terrorism involved in it is at points horrific, and at others, downright frightening. It is totally political, and while not being the same call to action that Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck. was, it still aims to be informative, and to shed light on the truth of what our governments are doing, and what they are continuing to do even as I write and you read this.The performances are all top-notch. Clooney's Oscar-winning role is very well played out, but in my mind, is no better than Damon or Wright. They equally share a grand charisma and finesse in their roles, and all feel deeply invested within them. All handle their almost equal screen time well, and work great with their many co-stars including Christopher Plummer, Amanda Peet, Chris Cooper, Good Night alum Tom McCarthy, William Hurt and Tim Blake Nelson. Although, of the co-stars, I'd say that Siddig, best known as Dr. Julian Bashir on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, is the stand-out. He outdoes Damon in every scene they are in (and that's a pretty tough job), and has a great intensity that almost makes me feel that he should have won the Oscar, and not Clooney.But while Traffic basked in its many intricate plot lines and genuinely fabulous screenplay, Syriana has a few problems. In some instances, it becomes so boggled with things going on, that it becomes downright confusing. I had to hit the rewind more than a handful of times in order to grasp it all, and more than a few times I needed subtitles in order to understand what people were saying. It does this way too many times, and it takes away from its lasting appeal in the process. We understand that Gaghan wanted to make a vastly political film, and wanted to make a clear statement about the current state of the world. But in his depiction, he really has a lot of trouble focusing, and a lot of trouble not making it a confusing and non-understandable mess.Even for the most political of film fans, it proves an arduous task to find this film to be anything more than good. It is packed with great performances and a great storyline, but it is way too confusing at times. Too much is going on, and there is never too much focus on anything in order for the audience to fully understand it. It is good, and is a frightening portrayal of real-world situations, just do not expect to watch it once and fully comprehend it.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I look forward to watching this film again as there was just so much happening it really is difficult to absorb it all in one viewing. Having said that, this is one of the best movies I've seen of late. It's only let down by the fact that it feels like they had to cut a lot out of the film to make it only two hours long. It jerks along in parts, at times too quickly and I often felt like going back over a scene with the remote control to see what I must have missed. It asks a lot of the viewer, but overall it is brilliant. This is the way to make a film with a message. It doesn't hit it's audience with a sledgehammer and although there is some quite disturbing violence, it is very realistic and makes many valid and disturbing points.There is a array of great actors in this film and George Clooney does stand out, but overall the cast were outstanding. I found some of the reality in the film was unconvincing. For example, underwater pool lighting is always low voltage, not mains voltage.Unfortunately, I'm convinced that this is probably how it really is amongst business and government and it shows us all how little influence we have on our own lives, although the ending offers us all a glimmer of hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply greedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Gaghan's complex tale of the oil business will leave most viewers scratching their heads. Other reviews are accurate in their criticisms. The camera jumps from seemingly unrelated scenes with out a clear purpose. The storyline, at times, can be hard to understand. There is little character motivation to be gleaned because a scene rarely lasts for more 2 minutes. However, Syriana is one of the best films of 2005 and deserves a spot in any serious DVD library.Syriana's focus is the oil industry and Gaghan's script brings this complicated beast to life. The players range from the royalty of an oil-rich Persian gulf emirate to the comparably plebeian millionaire futures trader. Some where in the middle is the U.S. government and the powerful special interests at its nervous center. Be forewarned: there are no protagonists. Greed tinges every character with the exception of the CIA officer played by Clooney. However, Clooney, as he later discovers, is merely an instrument employed for his middle eastern expertise to eliminate any obstacle hindering the delivery of precious crude.We are reminded constantly through out Syriana that oil is ESSENTIAL to growth. To this end we are pitted against other economies (China) as well as against our own ideals of spreading democracy and empowering the common people of developing nations. Blinded by greed, we ignore how the oil revenues are dispersed in the Persian Gulf, often funding the Madrasas in which fanaticism is instilled in Muslim youths. So it comes as little surprise that the film culminates in a spectacular terrorist act negating all the scheming of the oil barons and plotting of the CIA to prop up a pro-U.S. government in the Gulf. In the end, you almost want to root for the terrorists because they are ultimately working against the forces of avarice. This sense that there is nothing worthy of salvation, that despair is the only option, generates a stirring realism that is only complimented by the hysteria observed outside the theatre as the price of gasoline climbs above $3 a gallon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thought-provoking eye-opener with superb performances by the actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Gaghan's "Syriana" is a multi-layered political thriller about the US' dependency on oil, centered around the giant company Connex losing its grip of oil fields in the Middle East. Connex then merges with another oil company, Killen, to gain access to oil fields in Kazakhstan, of which Killen has gained the drilling rights despite qualms at the Department of Justice. Meanwhile, a grant by a Middle Eastern Prime Minister Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig) to a Chinese company for natural-gas drilling rights raises disconcerted reactions from the US government.Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned by the Washington legal organization headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) to ensure that the merging of the two oil companies goes efficiently. Because of the merger, several workers have been given the pink slip and their unemployment brings with it the prospect of poverty and deportation.Meanwhile in Spain, energy analyst Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is providing analytical services for his company to the emir who hosts a private party there. He brings his family along as his older son celebrates his birthday, but a lapse in security costs the boy's life who was electrocuted in a pool. In return, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig) asks Woodman to be his economic adviser while granting his company US$75 million worth of interests and invites Woodman to become his economic adviser. Woodman then learns that Nasir wants to establish democratic reforms to his country by using the profits of his nation's oil and seceding itself from America. Unfortunately, the conservatively intransigent government of his father is supported by American interests, and despite voicing out his desire to succeed the emirate, his father chooses his younger brother as the successor. He attempts to start a military coup but Americans arrange an attack to thwart his plans. In another related storyline, CIA agent Robert Barnes (George Clooney) is tasked to stop illegal arms trafficking in the Middle East. After arousing complications in his latest assignment in Tehran involving stolen missiles, his superiors propose Barnes to stay off from field work, but is sent back later to assassinate Prince Nasir. He goes to Beirut and links with a contact named Mussawi to carry out the assassination plot. But Mussawi turns out to be an Iranian agent, who tortures Barnes to force him to talk about the assassination and is about to be beheaded until a Hezbollah imam frees him. Barnes soon discovers the reason behind his assignment and why the CIA is investigating him, and tries to warn Prince Nasir.While the film switches back and forth the different yet connected story lines, Gaghan manages to keep the action going seamlessly and sets the audience into the middle of the action. I admit that there were some instances that generated boredom, but it helps that here, Clooney probably gives his best performance. He is compelling as the agent he plays, and he truly deserves the Oscar nomination. Damon and Wright also both effectively give low-key performances for their roles. Particularly, Wright's unassumingly taciturn character fits him well. Amanda Peet does well as Woodman's wife, Siddig brings likability to his role, and Plummer, Chris Cooper, and William Hurt shine through despite their limited screen time.I won't declare "Syriana" as a perfect movie, but this is the kind that demands a viewing, whether you believe its message is the truth or merely a propaganda. It's a riveting and tense film, creating an image that should stay with the audience for some time while delving on the issues in an intelligent way; forcing you to think and open your eyes while tautly keeping the proceedings engrossing. This is raw film-making told in a sequence of riveting layers that tell the message on all fronts of oil trade. And judging from here, Gaghan has made up for being behind "Abandon."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's nothing dirtier than a big ball of oil...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never having met George Clooney, I can't comment on his personality. He did once show up at a high-class restaurant, where my then-girlfriend was a hostess, and proceed to call her "doll," which admittedly has the assholish reek of someone acting like it's the 20s. I'm not inclined to look for reasons to dislike the guy, though, when he's made such a concerted, and mainly successful, effort over the last decade to appear consistently in good movies; such deliberateness has an endearing affect. "Syriana," incidentally, is no exception. Clooney's dumpy CIA operative Bob Barnes is but one element in writer/director Stephen Gaghan's remarkably layered and complex look at the contemporary geopolitics of the petroleum industry.Gaghan here uses the same approach as "Traffic" (which he wrote), following a cog in every level of an intricate machinery that, far too powerful to be controlled by any one, ruthlessly disposes of them when they get in the way. As much as the execs of the future Connex-Killeen, whose proposed merger is being investigated by the Justice Department, or the young Saudi royal, or the CIA, try to exert control over arguably the most important industry on the planet, the main character here is oil itself. It dictates the terms of the creation of the world's 29th largest economy out of a business merger, determines royal lines of succession, and even ultimately decides who lives, and who dies.Yet "Syriana" isn't ENTIRELY cynical; Matt Damon's energy adviser and his client, the possible future Saudi ruler, talk excitedly about the potential for oil rights to modernize society and help its downtrodden. Clooney's Barnes allows himself to be thrown back into the struggle in part to atone for a deadly mistake from an earlier assignment that still haunts him. But these are individual flashes of idealism and conscience, and are no match for the profit and power potential of the industry.The message is that alternative energy movements will never be fully successful until every last drop of oil has been burned away. It's no secret to "Syriana"'s players that the global oil supply has begun to dwindle, it's simply irrelevant. Oil is power, and as long as it's there, someone has to control it. Better us, thinks everyone in the film, than the other guys. "Syriana"'s portrait is a depressing one, but it's hard not to think that it speaks a lot of truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realpolitikal "Nashville," though harder to follow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I grasped (integrated and understood) about 30% of this movie, yet felt it was still worth watching.This is "'K' Street", but international, involving business, power, culture, and oil. The only difference is that I could more readily follow 'K' Street. The bits fit together more readily. The problem with Syriana is that 1) the bits I *could* pattern-match (in terms of my admittedly sketchy prior geopolitical awareness) had flaws, and 2) the parts I *couldn't* pattern-match are lying inertly on the cutting room floor of my mental screening room.For instance, Damon's character was a little hard to believe. This guy knows the higher mathematics of the energy business, but can't put 2 and 2 together when it comes to the U.S. foreign policy implications of a new Mossadegh. Give me a break! But one big problem for me was this: There was just too much material in this oily "Nashville" review that I couldn't place within a tangible, meaningful context of real-world power plays. On one hand, it may simply be that, as a person who does no wheeling-dealing on the international oil markets, I have practically no context upon which these floating molecules of dialog can align themselves to produce a crystallized understanding of the big picture. On the other, it may be that, even if I had a deep understanding of these things--the power jargon and the institutional framework though which this power courses--I have to say I do wonder if I'd find the dialog laughable. But for reason of my ignorance I have to remain agnostic.The last observation relates to the key power play leading up to the rather explosive penultimate sequence--which I think most people will be able to understand within a power context. It worries me a little, because it reminds me of a danger lurking in such depictions. This hazard is addressed brilliantly in, of all things, the movie THX1138. In that movie, we see Duvall's character flipping around on his TV, and he comes across a channel that plays 'round the clock footage of robocops beating up citizens; a kind of porn for the victimized. That was a particularly genius moment in the movie, and highlights a danger of breaching the limits of aesthetic distance. When you depict outright official skulduggery--in short, when you soapbox--you threaten to desensitize about the very thing where heightened sensitivity is the most important thing to be preserved. I think this movie does a disservice in that I can see it producing a mindset of a kind of "elite-of-the-powerless" resignation in the face of power. I'm sorry if this analysis seems to imply that artists are powerless to tell the truth, lest they intimidate the truth-seeking, but there has to be a way to make people aware without pushing it over the edge. I think this movie ultimately goes over the edge.All that said, I still feel this was a noble effort. Don't forget; much of the forgoing criticism is predicated on the overriding fact of my ignorance, so take it with a grain of salt and do consider checking out this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought "Syriana" was extremely well done. I think it was as good as Gaghan's "Traffic" and explored similarly complicated issues in a deft way.My wife liked it OK, but was confused by several things -- some of which the filmmaker could have handled in a more expedient way. The best examples of this are the studies of each of the main characters' family lives. While I understand that he was trying to flesh these people out, it made the overall plot confusing because you expected these extraneous people to be part of the larger picture, and largely they weren't. I think if Gaghan had just touched on these -- the Clooney character's relationship with his son is a good example of a scene that just touched on it -- he would have been better off.I was put off by a particularly violent scene involving torture. I wish it hadn't been so graphic.But, that being said, I found myself going over and over the plot points in my head, really thinking about the policies, policymakers, the players, the innocents. It is quite the thought-provoking film.Sometimes you wonder if films like "Traffic" and "Syriana" affect public policy. I know it's played well in the D.C. area; I wonder if the people it's about -- the real ones -- see themselves in it.The movie was disturbing in its realistic portrayal of how the world works. It also shows that evil is a relative term, yet that even evil people "love their dogs," so to speak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Political intrigue mixed with a little bit of oil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and directed by Stephen Gaghan who earlier scrubbed with Steven Soderbergh, Syriana wallops at a fast and furious pace. Based on Robert Baer's book, it spins about the life-strands of no less than 5 separate characters: a Swiss-based energy analyst and his family, a CIA agent up to his ears in mid-Eastern arms smuggling, the 2 sons of an Arab Sheik involved in a succession fight, a Washington lawyer and his perpetually drunk dad, and a Pakistani teenager laid off from his job by the merger between two oil giants.Although their individual trajectories propel nicely, when they finally intersect, its not quite the end of the world at all. Of course, there's the customary CIA air-to-ground missile strike, the suicide bomber (its shallow to think that a mere layoff would drive him to join a Madrassa) kid that slams his boat into a ship, etc. But the whole thing comes off as somewhat too cynical and a decidedly Western take on the geopolitics of Big Oil. Thats not to say its not a very well-made film -- it is. It would have been nice to reveal the opposing view as well: why the mid-East is so crazy about the West and craves its influences, despite all of the repression by their dummy governments.Syriana doesn't try to hide behind the thin veil of leftist propaganda. Nonetheless, it isn't for everyone. The movie had a limited theatrical release and from the number of IMDb reviews, an even limited patronage. The heady mix of globalization, international politics, petro-terrorism and the clever machinations of powers-that-be, are all somewhat beyond the grasp of the average movie-goer.In today's globally interconnected world, the truth really doesn't need a widescreen berth for it to be "Seen". Or "Heard".</fullReview>

Syriana seemed to come out at a very appropriate time. It is amazing to think that much of our foreign policy is engineering around oil. Although the movie is fiction, it felt very real. Perhaps that is because the U.S. government HAS carried out assassinations and attempted to influence foreign governments in order to "protect" American financial interests.At the beginning of the movie the audience sees several seemingly separate plots, but by the end, it becomes apparent that everything is connected. Stephen Gaghan does a masterful job of tying everything together by the end.</fullReview>

If you are interested in politics, the oil industry, or thinking movies, see it. It'll put an interesting twist on your thoughts about the oil dilemma that were previously shaped by the media and the government. It depicts how the oil oligopoly controls the middle east and how a war on "terror" was brought about due to America's high dependency on foreign oil. It sheds some light to the views of big business, Iraq's leaders, the average oil worker, etc; views that average American's will never see or really think about.</fullReview>

I could probably figure out the movie if I watched it a few times in a row with rewinding and fast-forwarding and a notepad. But is that really worth it? Don't get me wrong, I love complex movies, with strange timelines and convoluted plots and twists, but not this one. It's like a Guy Ritchie movie but without action. Or interesting dialogue. Or nice shots. To put it shorter, that is the only movie I have ever seen in theaters that actually put me to sleep, despite the huge screen, the powerful sound, and the general excitement about watching a movie - and I've seen plenty of boring ones. I slept through the middle of the movie after being hopelessly confused by the torrent of the characters to wake up to a seemingly meaningless ending. I had to read the plot when I came home to even figure out what it was about (and I did watch like half of it). If you do feel like you have to see this, go ahead, you've been warned, keep your notepad handy. And a lot of caffeine.</fullReview>

The world of oil is corrupt from the supply side not the user side. If liberals were smart they would understand that we NEED OIL. We will need oil until there is a different solution. These problems are the fault of the liberals that won't let us drill for our own oil. Thinking that a magic solution will happen because they wish for it is ignorant.

		<shortDescription>Challenging, but ultimately unrewarding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The structure of Stephen Gaghan's complex downbeat political thriller offers a challenge to the viewer without offering the reward successful completion of such a challenge deserves. Individual scenes work incredibly well, but the film fails to mesh as a whole. This might be deliberate, a pointed reference to the disparate strands that contribute to the political, business and ideological skulduggery that lies behind the sensational headlines we are all growing far too used to, or it might simply be an indication that Gaghan's ambition outreaches his ability as a storyteller.George Clooney, hiding his matinée idol looks behind a thick beard and a bulky frame, successfully sheds his glamour image to make his dogged CIA agent a believable fall guy, while Damon plays on those very attributes Clooney disguises as the large cast each represents a different aspect of (mostly American) society/ideology. Watching films like this, you can see Clooney struggling to wrestle free from the image upon which his career has been built. I hope he succeeds ? he's an intelligent actor and works hard. Sometimes, though, you get the impression that he's operating right at the limit of his abilities, and that can sometimes be a distraction.The underlying theme of the film isn't exactly news to anybody, and comparisons with Gaghan's Traffic are inevitable. Ultimately, however, if you're like me, you'll end up wondering why he chooses such a convoluted method to tell his tale. I thought I must have missed something, that there was some deeper meaning to it all, but I now don't think that's the case. I suspect instead that Gaghan is trying to dress up a rather ordinary corruption tale as something far more grand and important than it actually is? Unless, you're incredibly astute and attentive, you won't figure everything out in one sitting. It's worth seeing once, though, before perhaps checking out the films FAQ's on this site to get a thorough run down on what's going on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave "Syriana" a 7 only because I thought it could have been a little easier to follow. And I love complicated plots. Other than that, this is an excellent movie about how absolute power corrupts absolutely, and what people will do to control the oil situation and profit by it. In the film, which is based on a book by an ex-CIA agent (the Clooney character), we are shown many different stories that eventually come together - a CIA agent who infiltrates the other side, an executive and his family, two brothers struggling for a country's power, a young man who is seduced into a fundamentalist cell, and fat cats who want two huge oil companies want to merger and will do just about anything to get the merger approved. Probably the most sobering thing in the film for me was the fact that the emir had two sons ready to take over the country, and the U.S. wanted to make sure that the son in power was the one more in tune with them than the other son, who wanted to do things for his country and his people.The point made by George Clooney on one of the DVD features is that there are no good guys and no bad guys - the oil people, despite despicable actions, feel completely justified doing what they do because we need oil. As a result, other countries hate us, we're at war now, and with so many Iraquis killed, terrorists have been able to raise money for their cause. I told you the most sobering part. The saddest was a young man, before a suicide mission, approaching his father and asking for money for the bus. The father is playing baseball and stops and gives him the money. The boy impulsively hugs him and holds him tight. It was heartbreaking and frustrating - they believe in their cause and are willing to die for it, and I can't understand how that can be. But it is.The performances are all excellent with many stars, such as William Hurt, in cameos. Chris Cooper, Christopher Plummer, Jeffrey Wright, Robert Foxworth, Matt Damon, and Amanda Peet are all wonderful as part of this intricate story. Clooney is great - his eyes are haunted, he's scruffy, flabby, and conveys terror and his sense of isolation beautifully.You see "Syriana," and you think, wow, that was pretty complicated, I'm not even sure I knew half of what was going on - and then you can't forget about it. "Syriana" and its thought-provoking messages will haunt you and make you wonder what on earth is going to happen to all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On watching and re-watching this film a number of times i still cannot see the point of it. There are a number of different groups of characters within the film all of which have little point or show very little in-sight into the lives of the people who are mainly affected by the use and trade of oil as the film advertises itself to do. However i do believe that if this film had been written purely based on one group then it would have gone into more depth and shown a true insight rather then a poor summary and therefore would have been a more worthwhile film. Starts slowly one explosion drags on a lot in the middle of the film then ends abruptly. Very Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say that this film repays a second viewing is an understatement and true in the usual, complimentary sense, but it doesn't make clear just how stingy the film is on first viewing. The fact that the DVD contains so little sound signal seems to be a challenge that intentionally intensifies the fact that most of the dialogue is muttered, slurred or whispered beneath or behind sound effects, music or chatter. I admit that Ken Turan's review acquits the film's coy strategy, but jeez louise! I had only the slimmest tendril of an idea of what was going on the first time through this (and while I know I'm not the brightest person in the world, I do have some graduate degrees and a hoity-toity career that suggests I'm not in the bottom half of the population IQ-wise).Anyway, give it your full attention as you watch; it's worth working at. But plan to watch at least the first half again when you're through.And then go trade your SUV in for a hybrid, and stop voting for oil industry executives for high office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Bad Guys in This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't say that I got the idea of the movie because I didn't but what I can see that this story is not pointing any fingers to anyone (or maybe it points the finger to everyone). I find this very realistic and true because everyone in this world works for what they believe is the right thing to do. That doesn't mean that all of us don't make mistakes because everyone does.The characters are so alive and each one has a reason to continue his/her path, the movie actually shows that. The conflict of interests is what makes these characters cross each other and sometimes try to eliminate each other. Believes are major drivers for each one in this movie which I liked a lot about the story.As an Arabic man, I liked that a lot of the characters either Arabs or speak good Arabic language. The accents are not really perfect and in a lot of spoken Arabic scenes the version used is the Simple Arabic rather than the local accent spoken Arabic. In one of the scenes, George Clooney as Bob Barnes spoke some Arabic and the guy in front of him said that his Arabic is good, I tell you that I couldn't understand a single word out of George Clooney's mouth and it was obvious that he was joining the words into each other but still it was good effort spent from the actor and the producers.I guess that deferent people can come up with deferent conclusions after watching this movie and to me this is a big plus for it but still it is not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex, but rewarding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Gaghan isn't new to multiple-story films: he (deservedly) won an Oscar for the screenplay of Traffic, Steven Soderbergh's drug thriller, and was nominated for his work on Syriana, which he also directs (Soderbergh is credited as an executive producer, as his company Section Eight financed the film). For simplicity's sake, people tend to dismiss Syriana as "Traffic about oil". That definition is unfair. They both follow the same narrative pattern, that's true, but if viewers stop comparing the two they might notice they're seeing one of the finest films of 2005.Trying to summarize the plot is difficult, since this movie is even more complex than Traffic: more people are involved, and this time, we're never sure which side they're on. The only thing they all have in common is they're linked by a war fought to control the Middle East's oil wells. Among the people involved I can mention Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), a Geneva-based trader who's dealing with a powerful Arabian family; Robert Barnes (George Clooney), a disillusioned CIA agent stationed in Iran, whose role in the game might even get too dangerous; a series of lawyers (Jeffrey Wright, Christopher Plummer) and businessmen (Chris Cooper) concerned with the merger of two major oil companies. There are other people I haven't mentioned, but that doesn't mean they're less important.Gaghan probably knows his movie isn't audience-friendly (as in: this film actually requires some thinking), and therefore makes sure we're hooked from the beginning, keeping the story suspenseful and compelling. A lot of the fascination derives from Syriana's moral ambiguity, underlined by Tim Blake Nelson's "Corruption is why we win" monologue (echoes of Wall Street's "Greed is good" are apparent here). Take Matt Damon's character, for example. He looks like a nice guy, yet we see him accept a large sum of money as a compensation for his son's accidental death, and, in a truly shocking scene, ask how much he would get for his other boy. Why? We never find out. Of course, Damon is only a part of the magnificent ensemble that provide some of the movie's most memorable moments. Special mention goes to a bearded, overweight Clooney (who won an Oscar for the trouble), as well as the ever-reliable character actors Cooper and Plummer (and let's not forget William Hurt's brief but intense appearance).Syriana may not be your average Saturday night movie, but those who give it a try will feel immensely rewarded after watching this gritty gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie had a lot of good actors in it. No doubt the acting was good especially George Clooney. However the movie really dragged. As soon as something exciting was going to happen, it would switch to another scene. There was often long lapses with little or no dialog with one waiting for something to happen. There was also a surprising lack of emotion from most of the minor actors in the movie creating an even duller situation. It is a shame this movie was so poorly written, since I loved the idea for a movie. I do agree that the topic of this movie is very important. Hopefully some director and screen writer will run with a better script in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Guess We Deserved It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally watched this movie along with the extras, which included interviews with George Clooney and Stephen Gaghan. It was not confusing or difficult to follow, and it was well made. The performances were excellent. Unfortunately, the movie was trite and more than a little self-important. In the Clooney interview, he effuses that the screenplay is the star, that the cast was devoted to the story and its urgent relevance. But that's not quite accurate. It's the message that is the star of this movie, at the expense of the screenplay, which isn't nearly as compelling as Gaghan's Traffic script. Essentially the movie's message seems to be that America is the root cause of Islamic terrorism, generated out of our oil industry's boundless wealth and power, willing and eager to commit any act in order to perpetuate itself. Suicide bombers are just kids like any other adolescents anywhere, prompted by the byproducts of big US Oil's actions in the world to sacrifice themselves in the name of religious devotion. It's all just that simple, so we really shouldn't be surprised to have these idealistic innocents flying airplanes into our buildings. And, based on the interviews with Clooney and others, when all is said and done, it's up to us as citizens to alter the behavior of our corrupt executives and public officials by "reducing our footprint" of energy consumption. Gaghan agonizes over reconciling that duty with his personal pleasure at driving his gas-guzzling GTO around LA, but Clooney doesn't address personal footprint reduction. I'm wondering if he reasons that producing movies like Syriana excuse him from the obligation the rest of us apparently should feel to use public transportation and fly commercial. It must be something like that -- the kind of hypocrisy that might actually catch the eye of Edward R. Morrow if he were alive and working today.I can recommend Syriana as an example of talent wasted in putting message before story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bloated, bobbling plot winds its way to nowhere. The only thing more bloated than the plot is Clooney's unnecessary gut he gained for the movie obviously in an effort to give it some much needed gravitas. The Director's shameless rip off of the cinematography and directorial style of Soderbergh in Traffic lets you know from the first minute that you aren't going to see an original film. As audience members we have been trained that whenever actors are whispering or speaking in hushed tones in a wide shot that they must be speaking about something important and, therefore, the scene must be suspenseful. After the fifth scene of Clooney whispering into some clown's ear you want to jump into the TV and tell them to SPEAK THE HELL UP!(yes, I did not see this junk in a theater) The plot is so meandering that once you get to the half way point you've given up trying to figure out all the different plot lines and could give a crap about putting them together - you just want the movie to end. Thank God I had fast forward on my Tivo or I wouldn't have even finished watching the film. Wreaks of the Constant Gardiner - another film I had the unfortunate experience of seeing, yet paid to see in a theater. We left the theater on that one and would have on Syriana. So I figure Clooney had two great films last year (according to critics) - one of them has got to be good so I rented 'GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK' and Clooney stole another five bucks out of my pocket. Another self-important snoozefest that I was smart enough to turn off before it was half over.Message to Clooney - WHISPERING AND GETTING FAT IS NOT ACTING - unless you're directed by Soderbergh - if you're not in the future? Then God help you. Avoid this dog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana is a thought-provoking and dramatic tale about political troubles and the oil industry. Quite unfortunately, however, it will put the majority of its viewers to sleep.Unlike Steven Spielberg's tragic classics, such as Schindler's List, Syriana fails to draw its audience into the film. You seem to get to know some of the characters too well, and others, too little.But, the film has the redeeming qualities of good acting and a good plot. George Clooney's and Matt Damon's roles (Clooney play a CIA agent and Damon portrays an oil industry worker) do not, however, scream for their presence, but the actors do an excellent job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched a movie....I think. I sat through one anyway. If I had to choose any movie in the video store, I MAY be drawn to one that had won an Academy Award. Well I may have been before I watched Syriana. With George Clooney and (one of my least favourite actors) Matt Damon, this film would have to be one of the most dull and disjointed films I have seen in a long time....I mean, even BloodRayne had a bit of structure for crying out loud.This film appeared to WANT to have a plot and structure but seemed to also want to appear more intellectual than it had scope for. It struggled to reach a depth of meaning that it just did not have the capacity for and therefore, to those intellectuals that the film may have been trying to impress, it just seems to be a bit glib, while those who may watch the film for it's entertainment value (who may not WANT to have to think too deeply about the film) would be severely disappointed.To top it off, it is NOT a film that you can knit to. Unless you are knitting something that you really don't have to think about or look at (like endless rows of stocking stitch) in which case the lack of challenge from both the movie and the knitting might just make you die of boredom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good intentions but messy screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One common complaint about this movie has been that it's hard to follow. This is not true. What is true is that the screenplay is deliberately written in a style that refuses to tell the story in a comprehensive fashion. Even if one watches this movie ten times, one will never understand exactly why Bob is tortured or who is torturing Bob, or how or why much of what is done. It is like we are watching shadows of characters, never really seeing them in full sunlight. While the writer clearly did this because Bob is a cloak and dagger type of guy, this is still the movies and as a story-telling structure, I found this technique to be unsatisfying, as did everyone I spoke to about this film. In addition, the characters lack depth, compassion, or interest. And then we have the Clooney interview in the bonus materials to conjure. For Mr. Clooney and the producers to say that the film is apolitical, with no villains, is simply laughable. Talk about spin. This film has good intentions and certainly the political issues are of concern, but the story is too convoluted and so the film is tedious and at times boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not say that everything in Syriana is 100% true because I just can't do that, but it will certainly make you think. It has the feel of someone writing an essay on their views on the oil industry and how it affects everyone, and then taking that essay and putting it onto film. I was kept interested almost all throughout the film and kept me wanting to see more, which is all I can really ask of a movie. Most of the characters were well enough developed that I cared what happened to them and those who didn't have a lot of explanation I wanted to see more of. I have seen many reviews describe this movie as an "eye opener", I think that is pretty accurate. I really wonder if this is how governments do business and if they will really go to the lengths in Syriana to protect their interests. I can already assume that some companies, especially oil companies, would go that far to make a profit it isn't much of a stretch. I particularly liked how the 3 or 4 stories inter wined and smashed together. Syriana does not have really any action, gun fights, anything like that. It is a thinking mans movie, that might bore some and i'll admit it did drag ever so slightly at a couple of points but it is one movie that is worth seeing by just about anyone. I wouldn't describe it as left wing or right wing, it has elements of both believe it or not. If you are looking for a movie that will make you think about it, and make you want to discuss it after wards, I recommend it. If you expect action, gunfights, I would look elsewhere. I give it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An earlier reviewer really summed it up for me when he said that one should not mistake importance for quality. I can only second this by stating that one should not mistake a fictional movie like Syriana for a documentary. Syriana may make many important points, but that doesn't magically transform it into a good movie. Ironically, as a bangs-for-your-buck thriller it wouldn't be half bad -- it has great, groundbreaking visual style, first rate actors, and it doesn't give you time to think -- always a boon in that genre. However, that latter aspect also means that as a political movie, it doesn't give you a chance to understand it, either, unless you are a boy genius and a seasoned beltway pundit rolled into one. When I stepped out of the cinema I felt like Socrates, in that I only knew that I knew nothing. In addition, I also felt that some points didn't pan out, to wit:*a shortcut in the swimming pool should merely blow a fuse, and I'm not even sure how dangerous a 220V current in a large swimming pool would be to a swimmer*unrealistically, the electricity is cut within seconds after the danger is detected, and just before the Matt Damon character dips in; the reason for this being that the script wants him neither dead nor a coward for not coming to his child's aid immediately*the younger prince may be a prat and a meanie, but the fact that an underwater light is broken doesn't automatically disqualify him as a political leader; in fact, at the time when his elder brother bitterly remarks that "Idiocy requires an idiot" it looks to us as if the remote control merely had a flat battery or something*the usage of the "mysterious bazooka device" against the LNG tanker ship didn't make any sense: if you are willing to blow up a tanker in a suicide attack then you don't need any high-tech gadgetry, a dinghy packed with lots of TNT will do nicely, as was demonstrated by the 2002 attack against the Limburg; next, the device is described as a shaped-charge by the cleric, and those are not necessarily that difficult to come by in the first place, secondly wouldn't be required against an unarmoured ship, and thirdly wouldn't be effective if merely driven into the traget rather than fired at it; however, if the bazooka was a Stinger-type portable rocket with the electronics disabled then it would be completely useless against a tanker, or at least not more effective than a simple hand grenade</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Chinese image has changed in US main media. Those who speak Cantonese cooking with a big pan have changed to those who speak Mandarin declaring their ownership of a newly occupied gas resource foundation.That's the change of the main stream of US people thoughts about China. They are suddenly not a kind of amusing kongfu or a secondary choice of food, delicious by the way, but a smart, foxy and strong rival in the frontier of competition for strategic resources.We can smell the growing "China-fear" of the main media in US especially after the successful acquisition of IBM PC by Lenovo and the ambitious bidding for Unocal Corporation which at last failed by US congress though. As a Chinese, being proud is way far not enough to cope with the changed projection of our existence to the western world. It needs some necessary alertness of the game between two giant countries. We are in front of it whether you sense it or not.In the private party of Arabian Chiefs, the bold-head, Arabic-speaking Chinese met the King by himself and signed the contract of oil base while the man coming from US is gently rejected by cool-face Arabian secretaries. In the desert of Persian Gulf, the short Chinese man took the ownership of the oil base and dismissed the workers from Pakistan. China is the major component mentioned in the summit of US oil companies for the bidding in Kazakhstan and the casual topic in a family picnic of senior executives.The US media projection of China, once again I do have this concern, is not longer the topic of Chinese chef or restaurant discussed in Friends but the bold-head, short, not that talkative but just-don't-know-how-to-deal-with Chinese with a rapidly mounting ambition for energy, and the world.By the way, as usual, the movie saves no energy to criticize the Chinese policy against FLG, with the bloodiest images and most horrible lines.Just some quotes: "Bob, how much do you know about how Chinese tortures those FalunGong?" "Method No.1 Water dungeon; NO.2 wrist the arms and push the face to the stool. No 3, pulling nails from fingers. Which one do you like? No.3?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SYRIANA Written &amp; Directed by Stephen GaghanAs human beings, we are able to detach ourselves from injustices and hardships taking place throughout the rest of the world. Disassociation is not merely a capability, it is often a necessity for survival of the mind. Film going is often thought to be a primary means of exercising this need. Escaping into the dark of the cinema to avoid the world's problems is both common and effective, even when dealing with more personal problems instead of the global variation. The whole theory is threatened by films like, "Syriana", a film that makes sure you've been punched in the stomach and spit on while lying on the floor recovering before exiting the cineplex. The realism of the oil industry, from the US government corruption trickling all the way down to illegal workers on the verge of becoming suicide bombers in Iran is difficult to completely grasp, even more troublesome to digest, yet still a topic that needs more awareness brought to it. What becomes easy to forget when you're trying strongly to focus on how vast this particular reality reaches is that this is actually not reality; it is still a movie after all. It is a reality shaped by the vision of director Stephen Gaghan. Gaghan is the Academy Award winning screenwriter of "Traffic" and the construction of this new story comes together much the same way. There are three separate story lines that intersect each other throughout while becoming clearer as the end draws closer. As a director, this is only Gaghan's second project and a definite step up from his previous effort, the Katie Holmes thriller, "Abandon". He keeps the viewer engaged and affected throughout, showing as much strength and control as "Traffic" director, Steven Soderbergh. The difference between the two is Soderbergh's ability to better balance the time spent on your toes and the time spent clutching your chest in pain. The scope of Gaghan's script is too vast to be fully absorbed, leaving the viewer moved but not clearly understanding why. I respect Gaghan's ability to pick up a scene at any given time without pandering to explanations or spending too much time contextualizing the viewer but this can leave the viewer feeling removed ? not the desired effect when your hopes as a director lie in educating the viewer on this poignant topic. Thank goodness for home theatre and multiple screenings.What is missing is a more human element while at the same time, most of the human elements involved seem unnecessary. Again, going back to "Traffic" (as you will find yourself unable to resist comparing the two as well), the majority of the drug-related threats were personalized, tying the string between the drug lords mass-producing their product to the street kids and upper class privileged buying the junk. Here, the players' humanity is incorporated to give them some characterization, depth. With so much happening in their professional lives, their personal lives seem superfluous and consequently lend nothing to their motivation, eventually being ignored and mostly unfinished. The most personalized focus comes from George Clooney's portrayal of Bob Barnes, an agent with the CIA who seems just as lost and caught up in this cyclone of corruption, greed and power as we are. Clooney's performance begins so quietly, so passively, and builds like a rumbling beneath your feet before a natural disaster strikes. Getting on in years and always well intentioned, Barnes no longer knows who controls his life, only that it is not himself. He has much to say but cowers when given the chance to say it. To a large extent, he has given up trying to make change. Clooney plays Barnes as exhausted, apathetic and frustrated without having the drive to change that. He has been telling the same lies and making the same deals for so long, he no longer questions to what goal they contribute. He has not been corrupted but he turns away his eyes to every command he executes under the moral armor that his decisions are not his own. Only they are.Gaghan's camera is constantly positioned either very close or very far from the action, sometimes within the same scene. The effect is a varied degree of understanding, that we are closer to the problem than we think one minute and then detached and removed, lost the next, with numerous obstacles obstructing our view. We try to piece together the connection between the American government, the Saudi monarchy, the corporate control, the legal whitewashing and the resulting racism that instills fear and lack of understanding of everything Arab and hatred of America by the Arab people. I walked in with a vague understanding of the interconnectedness of all these issues and left "Syriana" with the concrete knowledge that it is oh so much more complicated than I originally thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comrating: 3 out of 4In reviewing political thrillers, critics often use words like taut, gripping, thrilling, edge-of-your-seat, and suspenseful to describe the films. But with Syriana, I'm reluctant to use any of these. For as much as the film's marketing blitz promotes the "thrilling" parts of the film, Syriana, for the most part, is slow-moving. In fact, the first half of the film doesn't even lay out a discernible plot line. We're presented countless threads of information for this first hour, with numberless characters and different countries and representations, varying government agencies and motives, and all without any sense of a linear foundation. But the tagline reads, "everything is connected," and essentially with this statement come words of comfort. "You'll be confused and lost," the tagline says, "but in the end, your efforts will be made good." Syriana surrounds a fictitious merger between two oil conglomerates, Connex and Kileen. Jeffrey Wright plays Bennett Holiday, Sydney Hewitt's (Nicky Henson) stooge sent to look into the merger to dispel any corruption before the Department of Justice finds it. Clooney plays Bob Barnes, a CIA operative originally sent into Beirut to snuff out Prince Nasir Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha), the possible heir to the Iranian throne. And Matt Damon plays Bryan Woodman, the financial adviser to Prince Nasir, who's married to Julie, played by Amanda Peet. To explain the dozens of other, more peripheral characters and their connections to these primary three would take many more pages of explanation, and would ruin the fun of being utterly lost for Syriana's entire first act. Also, these three?Clooney, Damon, and Wright?are the only fully-dimensional characters of the film. They occupy the only roles capable of thoughtful and provoking performances, save Tim Blake Nelson's thunderous speech on corruption. All three actors do well, pulling in possible nomination nods, and accentuating Writer/Director Steven Gaghan's method of understated storytelling. Syriana isn't drenched in moody, colorful hues or rambunctious up-tempo scores; but, instead highlights the reality of the story's situation. Fernando Meirelles' late summer film The Constant Gardener worked on the drama of a similarly controversial situation, but did so with operatic conventions. Where The Constant Gardener is a theatric, Syriana is a documentary. And Gaghan is really the star of this film. The camera is hand-held, and is shot seemingly without post-production color correction. We're often given drab colors and over/under exposure. Gaghan strives to understate the drama of his situation, choosing instead to heighten the reality of it. He relishes this understated approach, and often slides in little bits of impressive style. For example, he has the tendency to overlap unconnected segments of audio and visuals. One scene puts Jeffrey Wright's character, Bennett, on a street walking towards camera, while the audio plays another character's speech spoken about Bennett's actions. Similar tricks are played with the camera's focus and perspective. Gaghan clearly has a hold over this film. From his fiery, cynical script to his muscular grip over the film's direction, Gaghan's character is palpable with this first directorial outing. I think my opinion of Syriana would benefit from a second viewing. Gaghan drops us head-first into this complex political situation, and forces us to not only piece together the loose ends of its web of stories, but also figure out where each character's motives lie. It wasn't until 90 minutes into the film that I finally understood what Damon's character actually did for a living. It reminded me of last year's puzzle drama 21 Grams, that forced us to piece together its non-linear scenes to figure out who was exactly who. Now imagine playing this same directorial game, but simultaneously also trying to untangle a knot of political intrigue. These puzzles work, but on one level disappoint. By handling dozens of loose plot threads in the opening act, without any hint of connections, the film gives the impression that each of the numberless characters is simply spinning their wheels. We don't see any progress of plot until it finally kicks into gear at the second act. But the advantage of such a method lies sneakily in our confusion; we pay more attention to these loose threads, desperately trying to find the connection; so when pieces finally do start falling into place, we have an extremely deep understanding of Gaghan's story. And now, with this thorough understanding of Syriana's characters, I'm itching to get back to the multiplex to try the film back on. Gaghan's script will finally show its particularly finessed nuances in this second viewing, and show its true, and much more impressive colors. But for this first viewing--which I'm obligated to review--Syriana forces the viewer to work on two separate, but equally trying puzzles. -reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a clear mirror to the way things are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wrote a commentary on "Munich" which I watched again last night. A few days ago I watched "Syrianna" again. They are such different films even if the results are so similar. Syrianna spreads a much wider net and is much more torn out of the Wall Street Journal, CBS Market Watch as much as the evening news on any given day; it is a current time frame whereas Munich focuses on the aftermath of an event in 1972. Not a heck of a lot good has come between the two dates. Since 1972 we saw the rise of Fatah in Israel/territories, the rise of Islamic Jihad and Hamas and Hezbolah. What good has come of these events? The middle east has been a boiling cauldron for a very long time; neither of these films pretends that anything was born at that time. The issues and grievances are old and continue to fester, spread and destabilize the region in broader strokes as time goes by.Syrianna is a very clever film and it takes a few viewings to piece together what on the outset is a bewildering plot. On the first time through it appeared totally disjointed and spiraling all over the place without a central locus. After seeing it again the pieces now appear much more connected and no where near as confusing. But, we have to step back a few steps first. Let us first consider Robert Baer.I have read his first two books, largely autobiographical (See no evil, Sleeping with the Devil). They are written from first hand experience and knowledge and by a very bright but angry and disillusioned ex-CIA operative. Angry at how the very system and agency he put his life on the limb for (many times) abandoned its central tenets (this would be Baer's perspective), succumbing as these organizations sometimes do, to the meddlesome and misguided machinations of Congress and the sharp knives of sub-committees. Having joined the CIA on a lark (his own admission), finding himself enjoying the rush in the risks, even more feeling confident that this type of work helped keep his own country on top of a darkening and increasingly insane and dangerous world. Having seen funding and personnel cut out from under him, Baer finally quit in disgust. His books are the germ from which this film has grown. Unlike "Munich" which is based on a book by George Jonas, Syrianna has more faithfully borrowed big chunks of what concerns Baer. Given access to Baer as a consultant and as the author of these books allowed a screenplay to evolve that would give enough of a taste of just how nasty this world had become.There is little preposterous in Syrianna that could not be true. The level of graft, corruption and greed in the "oil world" is legendary and well written about. Nothing new there. The depiction of the plight of poor and undereducated third world workers is truthfully depicted, right down to the Madrassas where current day suicide bombers are nurtured (for lack of a better term). Unlike the moralizing that Spielberg's film oozes, Syrianna gives you a spinning, whirling view of a world gone mad without pointing fingers, without stating overtly who the bad or good guys are. We are all involved in Syrianna because of our Western lifestyles, because we do not hold to sufficient accountability our elected officials or our crazed warriors in the Pentagon. The checks and balances were worked into our Western style democracies but under the veil of terror, with the smoking Twin Towers as the new Icon of the Ages, too many of us were wooed into surrendering our discriminating faculties when dire choices were being made on our behalf.Just today the former madman of Iraq, Sadaam Hussein was hung, under Iraqi law, by Iraqi's and a chapter of darkness has closed. What remains are many new chapters in that area of the world that borrow heavily from the darkest images of "Munich" and Syrianna. Not much good has come about in all these years and it is hard to feel hopeful when watching these films. Although they are just films, entertainment at a cheap price, what we feel about the world after watching them is a grim experience. They are both thought provoking, well crafted and skillful forms of communication and entertainment. They both glide over painful issues and we flinch in both cases because they frighten us. There are so few answers and so many decisions yet to be taken. Syrianna is well worth sitting still with images of violence, poverty, greed, corruption and chaos. That is the complete reality for so much of this world. That we feel shaken by this vision means that the mirror has shown a clear image.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be the most disappointing of last year's 'big' films: what promises to be a gripping political/conspiracy thriller turns out to be a dull and tortuously-plotted (for no reason, if you ask me!) film with an over-abundance of characters, very few of whom generate any real interest (especially for a non-American viewer); furthermore, the three leads' boring domestic lives are dealt with in some detail - thus padding the running time unnecessarily! George Clooney, naturally, came out best from the cast - though I'd rather he'd gotten his Oscar for GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK (2005) - filled with notables: Matt Damon's boyish looks were unsuited to his role, which didn't really lead anywhere anyway!; Jeffrey Wright was good but his constant bickering with his drunken father became unintentionally hilarious; Chris Cooper, Christopher Plummer and William Hurt (interestingly, he was vying with Clooney for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, playing the deranged mobster in A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE [2005]) offered their consummate professional support. The Muslim subplots, then, were a total drag and really took me out of the picture! In the end, there were all of 20 minutes from this 2 hour-plus film in which I was genuinely drawn into the narrative - namely Clooney's torture scenes and the desert finale...</fullReview>

Hard to believe that George Clooney was voted best supporting actor for this film. What did he do to earn that prize? Please note that his name appears first in the credits. We need rules regarding full and supporting performances. Nonetheless, this picture is a born-loser. We were unable to collectively understand the interactions of the characters in the plot.

After watching this film, I'm almost ashamed to be a North American and how are economy dictates how the world runs. It makes you wonder how many of these so-called terrorists are just that or are they conveniently labeled as such because of their refusal to play along? It makes you recall the saying: You reap what you sow. I am not advocating terrorist activities but I am implying that perhaps we have pushed these people so far that they see no other alternative.

Although not exciting or action filled it is a must see. The movie made me want to cry for the state of the reality around us. This is especially true given what is happening right now in Iraq.

		<fullReview>I avoided this movie, because the posters and the trailers promised a grim, gritty, torture-fest, it seemed. I was a little surprised to find that it was not so 'heavy' as I had feared. It is entertaining, and masterfully done.Funny, I had seen Munich a few weeks ago, and this movie shines very nicely in contrast. I liked Munich. But Munich told one version of the Middle eastern conflict--- from the perspectives of Jews and Moslems. There is undoubtedly a lot of truth in that. And a lot of sadness and tears. But Syriana tells the story, perhaps, from a more pertinent and germane perspective-- not from religious or national standpoints, which some would argue are obsolete. It tells the story from the economic and corporate view, which some would say is now the world we all occupy. That is, corporations are the new nations, the new religions.One funny thing I noticed, as an aside: In the TV commercials being shown before the movie and the trailers --- and yes, showing TV ads to paying movie audiences IS evil, but that's another story --- Matt Damon's childhood pal Ben Affleck, so often in the distant past an artistic partner of Damon, was starring in an ad for spray-on deodorant. Then the Oscar-Nominated, world-class movie starts, and Matt Damon now stars in that. Those two performances show the results of the different paths chosen by the two one-time friends. Affleck chose the glitz, the high profile, the celeb affairs and paparazzi-baiting stunts. Damon chose the art with real soul and real depths--- and now look at them. One shilling for TV, the other putting out yet another Oscar worthy performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When we were choosing a movie to see on New Year's Day, I said (smugly) to my wife that if we were to see "Syriana" at the suburban multiplex 14, we would have the theater to ourselves. Much to my surprise, the 7 PM showing was nearly sold-out, and we had to find our seats along with other adults desperate for an intelligent offering. The movie was never less than fascinating, and admirable for its exploration of serious (but not necessarily ticket-selling) themes. There was a book written in the 1950s titled "The Nature of the Non-Western World", and I couldn't get the title out of my mind when I watched this film. How rare is it that we see characters living their lives not as stereotypical America- haters but as complex, yearning people who are both fascinated and troubled by Western culture.This is a remarkable, difficult, rewarding film. I thought that the golden age of smart, socially-involved movies were gone. There appears to be some hope.</fullReview>

This is a witty and exciting movie which does make a statement about violence and evil without being pedantic or clichéd. All the characters are either naive, morally vacuous, stupid or all three . I was convinced by the plot and the direction. The acting was masterful and on several occasions I laughed out loud at the outrageousness of the story and the original perspective ( almost stream of consciousness without any pretensions). The pace was tight and controlled . The director never allowed the actors or the action to become self-regarding and the humour also avoided parody and the easy laugh. I don't know whether the occasional device of lines of text across the screen is original? But it was certainly the first time I have seen this used and it was always apt, clever and funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Syriana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based loosely on real life CIA agent Robert Baer's experiences in the Persian Gulf, and brought to the big screen by Traffic scribe Stephen Gaghan, Syriana tells the tale of extremely shady dealings, politically and economically, of the oil industry. It takes on the entire vertical chain, from the Arab Emirs, the profit driven businessmen, the corrupt politicians, the clandestine networks, down to the alienated worker, the determined terrorist, and even as high as the top political office of the USA.It's no wonder that many have called this film anti-American, and pro-Arab. But in the way it's presented, you can't help but nod in the film's direction for daring to discuss and suggest what it says at point blank. It's serious, no holds barred, and brilliant.George Clooney won a Golden Globe for best supporting actor as CIA operative Robert Barnes. Yes, supporting, as there are so many characters in this movie, each with almost equal screen time, there isn't just one protagonist's viewpoint, but a myriad of others. So many different emotions of the characters are evoked, and the actors all delivered them well. Much has been said of paunchy Clooney and his beard and all, but don't let that distract you from his performance as the pawn in the entire game, and from noteworthy others.Everything's related, and everyone's connected. You'll have to sit through it very attentively, and pay attention to almost every line of dialogue to appreciate the very rich and complex story. It helps though, with both English and Mandarin subtitles, for you to read what your ears have missed.But perhaps what struck me most, were the sections on the unidentified Gulf country, with the challenge for power in the changing of the guard, and the focus on the individual downtrodden migrant worker, who through misguided teachings, finds himself on the forefront of the war on terror. It cut close to probably what could have happened, and the reasons behind it happening. And with so many suggestions on the wheelings and dealings of the corporate world, its effect on governments, the oil industry in general, the quest for insatiable power, US foreign policy, this film is loaded with political "big picture" firepower.Once you're through with the movie, if you haven't been reading current affairs in between the lines, perhaps this "fictional" story might just spur you to not take things verbatim, and spark that conspiracy theorist in you. Highly recommended stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything is connected.A market analyst for a top notch Swiss firm.An intelligent and ambitious attorney who will sell himself to the highest bidder. A disgruntled immigration worker.A CIA agent.A senator.A king.The claimant to his throne.His brother.Everyone.Everything. Syriana is a mind boggling concoction of the ultimate conspiracy theory, where people from different walks of life, from different countries, from different phases of their life become witting or unwitting participants.Thank the heavens, intelligent cinema is not dead yet. In Iran, the king has played puppet to America, and is about to pass on the reins to his successor.Problem is, one of his sons is foreign educated, forward looking who wants to free his country from the US shackles, and has begun this by selling a lucrative oil-exploration contract to a more efficient Chinese company rather than the US competitors.The other one , however, is someone the US feel they will be able to rein in.Meanwhile, a merger between Killen( which has recently won rights to oil exploration in Kazakhstan) and Connex(the US giant which lost to the Chinese company) is being investigated by the Justice Department.The job of seeing the merger through is in the hands of an ambitious attorney , who is told that the merger is also in the country's interests.Then there is the case of the workers who previously worked before the more efficient Chinese company took over and laid off the workers.Treated unfairly and cruelly, a disgruntled Pakistani worker finds acceptance in a madarsa, where 'self-sacrifice' for the greater good of humanity is drilled into him, making him a jihadi. We then have the CIA agent who in the course of his missions sees a theft of a missile.However, his warnings fall on deaf ears, as the higher ups are more interested in focusing and emphasizing the changing and progressive face of Iran, and what the agent says is both inconvenient and embarrassing.Hence, he is made a scapegoat . A market analyst specializing in the energy sector sees his child die due to an unfortunate incident at a party thrown by the king.As a way of recompensating and making up, he is made the adviser to his son. The movie focuses on so many themes, and leaves one with a feeling of despair and inadequacy as we see how each of these players becomes a mere pawn for the good of a few people.The dialogue is minimal, most of it uttered in whispers,secretive tones.It's the gestures that do most of the work.Some scenes are bound to blow your mind away, as in the scene where the prince points out how US has been milking his country , purposely denying progress ; or the scene where Amanda Peet and Matt Damon quarrel about their son's loss; or the torture scene of George Clooney; or the wordless struggle between the ambitious attorney and his father. Hats off to the makers of the movie for making such a brilliant movie on such a sensitive theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to believe it's fiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviews for Syriana have been mixed, with most agreeing that it's a good film but extremely complex in plot and somewhat hard to follow.With this warning going into it, I decided not to expect that I could follow it right off the bat, but to just go along for the ride and see where it took me. This approach served me very well. Through the first half of the film I observed, took in, made mental notes as much as possible and didn't even TRY to make sense of it--the payoff was worthwhile. Because in the second half it all started to click, and the Ah-Hahs were delivered and satisfying.The story of our government's (CIA) collusion with oil companies and middle eastern countries, complete with lies, betrayal, harrowing torture and corporate corruption is so believable when you back it up with headlines you've already read--it's hard to tell yourself this is fiction. The premise is entirely plausible and believable.Like Traffic, it tracks several different stories at once--Clooney, the duped CIA agent; Matt Damon, the oil industry consultant; Christopher Plummer Head of a powerful law firm that backs a nefarious group called the CIL (Citizens for the Liberation of Iran); Chris Cooper the president of a small oil company that merges with a bigger one.But the most interesting story lines for me were of the two migrant workers laid off in the oil fields after the company merger--how they look for work, and flail about until they meet up with a fundamentalist cleric to takes them in to his terrorist network.A lot of different angles are explored in the film, and I liked that. Of course, having George Clooney light up the screen even part of the time was always a pleasure. (Even with his puffy poundage for the part--which didn't bother me a bit.) I liked the fact that the plot was complex. If it hadn't been the message might have been too pat and heavy handed. Corruption is complex, and this movie portrays that well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Syriana: an Achievement in Post-Modern Film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana's ambition is its most remarkable facet. It took guts to make this movie, not just because of its political nature (notice I said "nature" and not "stance" or "content"), but because it dares to challenge its audience, not merely in their way of thinking, but in their ability to invest in the film?invest their full attention and comprehension skills. The next thing that must be praised is that Syriana challenges its audience without abusing them: the film's characters are human and complex; its story topical and intriguing. (This coming from someone who left the theater scratching their head.) Syriana is as confusing a movie as I've ever seen, with a dizzying array of plots (none of them can be designated "sub"); it's a movie you want to talk about with your smart friend, a movie you want to see again, so you can "get it." Syriana is loosely based on Robert Baer's See No Evil; according to Baer, the CIA is a bureaucracy that has lost its way and is now guided by the politics of the careerist that man it. In that respect, See No Evil is intended as an expose of sorts--a wake up call to the country and powers that be. George Clooney is doing something with his "ER," F-you money; the film was co-produced by him. Clooney (who stars as CIA agent "Bob Barnes") is showing himself to be gutsy, talented, and out-spoken; he is fast becoming a name brand for exciting projects. Stephen Gaghan wrote the adaptation for Syriana and also directed it. Gaghan won an academy award for the screenplay to Traffic (which he also directed). Syriana looks and feels just like Traffic, it is quite obvious his ambitions for the two films were the same: to humanize and reveal the complex, intertwined nature of a hot-button issue. While Syriana is in another league than Traffic as a movie, it is also not nearly as entertaining or "watchable"?that is to say that in comparison, Traffic is an easy view. You just may leave Syriana un-entertained, or with a headache, or with a new concern for the state of things, or furious (perhaps at the film-makers), but you will be talking about it in the parking lot, and depending on how well the movie's magic worked on you, you'll pepper conversations with its name for some time to come after the drive home.Red-State opinions of Syriana are that it is "yet another work of Hollywood propaganda." As foolish as that assertion is in general, it is doubly foolish when applied to the film in question. Syriana's subject is no doubt very political, but I feel there is an argument that the movie itself is journalistic in that it's merely an attempt at an honest portrayal of things as the way they are based on the facts available. It is not trying to persuade us into a way of thinking; it's trying to tell it like it is and leave us to think for ourselves. Baer's book is ultimately a catharsis for himself, a way to work out his personal demons and come to terms with the contemporary CIA, but it is also political in that Baer wants to advance his agenda, his plan, his way of thinking?he wants his warnings headed. While Syriana is informed by Robert Baer's work, it isn't trying to change the way we think to suit an agenda, it's merely trying to inform our opinion with the experiences of a man who was "on the ground" in the Middle East and risking his life to secure his country. This is the genius of Gaghan. He has used Baer for his own purpose and shed Baer's rhetoric thus transcending his source.If Gaghan has an agenda, it is not of the same species as Baer's. I'd assert that there are no villains in Syriana. When everyone is knee deep in the dirty game of controlling the resource that will cause World War III (hyperbole?!), how do you single out a character as "the bad guy"? Syriana tells the story of the oil race from many, if not every, vantage point and does so without drawing caricatures or playing cowboys and Indians.Ironically, for all its complexity, Syriana's flaw may be the sometimes trite, oversimplified, overconfident, and underdeveloped nature of the story's arcs. With so much on the table, no one course has enough room (main characters and entire plots were left on the cutting room floor, and you can see that time wasn't on Gaghan and company's side in what remains). A chief example would be the plot involving a young, laid-off, Pakistani oil field worker, who turns to fundamentalist Islam for answers to worldly as much as other-worldly issues. This part of the story is seemingly stripped and minimized, leaving you desiring a closer, more detailed look into perhaps the films most poignant portrait. It could also be said that the disorienting fog you remain in for the film's 126 minutes is caused by the overall under-done nature of Syriana (what exposition there is feels too little too late, and a little clunky for that matter?William Hurt's entire character, the mysterious "Stan," apparently exists entirely for the purpose of clueing us in to what "Bob" is thinking/doing). The disorientation can be regarded as a substantial flaw unless you prescribe to Roger Ebert's persuasive argument that the fog is the thing. In any event, brilliance inspires forgiveness; the movie's dark charisma, it's astute, intriguing observations wash over its flaws and push them into obscurity.Most people will leave Syriana with only the broad strokes; it is good enough to demand that you patch together those broad strokes to find meaning. Syriana's "message" can be interpreted in many different ways, but it stimulates its audience and has the potential to provoke an enlightening global discourse. Truly a magnificent accomplishment, perhaps the most beautiful achievement a work of art can aspire to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>See this movie. It is visually stunning, but more importantly, deeply affecting and sadly realistic. It leaves you hopeless, but angry enough to want to find hope and do something. George Clooney just keeps getting better. All the performances are excellent, but his is especially so. The movie grips you from start to finish. It weaves together disparate plot lines, and you are not sure where it is going at first, but as they unfold simultaneously you understand. No one is in control and everyone is a puppet. Contrary to the typical conspiracy theory, there is not one overarching controller. Here, no one trusts anyone, and everyone schemes. Ultimately, you are left wondering to what end? It is all a hollow quest for power.Again, see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie - Hollywood without the schlock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very impressed by this film. It's a slick production with excellent cinematography, and at the same time intelligent and well acted. Those four elements don't often come together. Nobody, from the suicide bomber and radical clerics to the CIA hit man to the corrupt oil executives to the Arab princes are portrayed as simplistically good or bad, but rather as people in different places and situations, which is what they are. That's rare for a mainstream movie, and refreshing.The movie definitely has strong echoes of Traffic, but is both more serious: the characters are less cartoonish, and while the cocaine trade is something in which most of us have only a voyeuristic interest, Syriana's subject matter affects us all, and the attitude that this film takes is a reflection of that.By the way, to the people upset because this movie portrays the oil industry and Washington insiders as 'bad', A) you are missing the point, and B) you are living in a dream world.

		<shortDescription>Convoluted and Incomprehensible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Roger Ebert's review of this movie he basically stated that he thought it was a great film because it almost completely eluded him. It didn't make sense to him, but that didn't stop it from being excellent. I wonder...if any of the Pokemon movies had a liberal (albeit incoherent) subtext, would it also merit four stars from Mr. Ebert. Certain few moments in Syriana are powerful, of course, since the actors deliver grand lines that are easily quotable (the whole "corruption" speech, e.g.). Scene after scene works just as well, or as poorly, out of context as it does in, which makes the movie not altogether different from the trailer for the movie. This is one of the most frustrating movies I've sat through in recent years, and it upsets me to see so many people praising it.I don't know very much about the controversies over oil, and I don't know a whole lot about the Mideast. I wanted to learn about these things from this movie. Sadly, most of the conversations in this movie are "inside", and watching them feels like eavesdropping. Now surely, all movies are a form of eavesdropping, but this was eavesdropping in a Donnie-from- The-Big-Lebowski sort of way, i.e. most of us were "out of our element". I didn't learn anything from this movie. The makers of this movie obviously wanted to share some important statements with the world, so why not do everything in their power to make a movie that people can understand?I think some people are praising this movie, because they want to sound smart. And it does give you the illusion that you are smart, doesn't it? With the actors speaking in esoteric terms and the slick look of the film, it's a movie like Mission: Impossible or Vanilla Sky or The Matrix or Memento that wants you to think it is smarter than it is. Kind of like those people who talk quickly to try to cover up their intellectual deficiencies.I also think some people, especially critics, are praising the movie because it has liberal messages, no matter how obscure they may be. Ebert has a quote that I like. Something similar to: "The quality of a movie is not determined by what it is about, but by how it is about it". Pretty well sums up how one should judge any work of art. From what I've read, critics heaping praise on Syriana are not making their judgments on this basis. And that includes the author of the quote, who admits that he couldn't explain the "hows" of the movie if he wanted to, but it's still one of the best movies of year. Without the hows, it's just a bunch of stuff happening. It's staring at the pretty colors. But the colors of this movie aren't pretty. I can't think of anything that is actually good about the movie. The acting was OK, I guess.Do not be fooled. The emperor has no clothes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew going in that if George Clooney had a starring role in Syriana, it was probably going to tick me off. I am frequently in opposition to George and the other Hollywood types thinking that just because they make movies the rest of the world should listen to their whining about how they are right about everything under the sun and anyone who disagrees with them are idiots. However, in this case Mr Clooney, I was wrong. Now I don't admit I'm wrong very often (nor does any red-blooded American woman), but there I said it - I WAS WRONG. Instead of making me angry, all it did was leave me confused. Sure, I get the point that all the world's oil troubles lay at the feet of the big oil companies, but why does that justify making a movie about it? When the closing credits rolled on this one, everyone just sat there - looking confused. The only part that ticked me off was that I actually paid money to sit through it (luckily it qualified for discount tickets so I only paid half price!). Horrible, horrible movie and a big waste of time, film, and my money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film-goer friends, we are watching a new cinematic storytelling form emerge. This is why you should see this, to participate in history. It is not a very good film by the measure of the genres it brushes against. Those looking for a political message (an amazingly large number) will find the message trite. Oil? Corruption? Smarmy men all around? Sure. But if you think this is about oil, you are daft.Yes, the acting is superb and the score as well. But the reason to see it is simply because of the storytelling devices that are employed.For background, you must know that film is always fighting its older siblings. Books and the theater evolved narrative techniques that were uneasily overlain on film, limiting it. It is a lazy thing to expect a story to just unroll before you in an easily mappable way. No matter, people love their genre films because they know precisely what to expect.In recent years, we've seen a rash of films that add cinematic texture to a basic frame by weaving several characters that combine to make one, or several narratives that do the same. Here we have something more sophisticated, though it doesn't play with time like some of the experiments.The dreadful "Traffic" was a simple weaving of multiple stories. There was no mystery in the story or challenge in watching. It was blunt. Now we have a real mystery, in the old school tradition. We as the viewers are tasked with sussing it out, knowing the writer/director plans to stay a half step ahead of us.The thing is populated by a noir-defined guy, Clooney, who is our surrogate sufferer, as all noir heroes are. He remains barely clueless till the end, the man who suffers because we aren't trying hard enough as viewers. He knows far less than we.Next is our surrogate detective. Every mystery needs one, our representative in the story ? someone who knows less than everyone he encounters. He and we together doggedly make sense out of the thing. We both will miss some details but see enough to damn. All the rest of the men are opportunists, some evil, some less so. The master manipulator is played by Chris Cooper.The whole adventure in novel storytelling depends on the unusual richness given this detective character. He is the only character who truly is developed, the only one with some past and present haunts that are not clarified for us. Usually film detectives are underdeveloped, defined with a few familiar strokes so we could fill the vessel with ourselves. Not here, we fill this vessel because he IS familiar. What we have is a talented writer who finally has the confidence to be clever. But he is not a masterful director. So he plays a trick that is effective and cheap. He lets his actors define their own characters and lets his terrific cinematographer get in close. When you ? the viewer ? are in, constantly in, the personal space of all the characters, you get swept up in the complexity of the conflicting urges.When you look at this, see that every single shot that is not an ultracloseup, usually hand-held, is there in the barest of minimums, just enough to have every scene make sense, and no more.Yes, I would have liked more adroit manipulation of the eye. But someone was brilliant to come up with this solution.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the movie critics raved about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it impossible to stay awake through this slow going political drama. Is this really the movie critics raved about and George Clooney won an Oscar for? Wow. An hour in and I still have no clear idea what's going on. Way too many moving parts, choppy subplots, characters and multiple locations which instead of coming together as the movie progressed just remained random and confusing feeling.Described as a "riveting political thriller about the state of the oil industry in the hands of those personally involved and affected by it." I'm just gong to say it, this was boring as hell.The script is disjointed, complicated, and confusing. The acting is dry, although I am seeing a ton of familiar faces from within a huge cast but none of the numerous subplots and characters have been developed enough for me to really care about their outcomes. A couple of explosions woke me up towards the end but too little too late. 6/2/15</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: Big bad evil US corporations assassinating/bribing/running over the poor of the world in pursuit of greed and oil. A US government in cahoots with them using their hit man (Clooney) to further things along unbeknownst to him. An Older Sheik is about to name 1 of 2 sons his heir. The good son wants to bring women's rights to an Arab kingdom and sell oil at a higher price to the Chicoms. He would cut out the US and it's companies privileged position to plunder thus he must be eliminated in favor of his younger brother who is in the CIAs pocket splurging on weapons and letting his people starve.A little side story glamorizing a wide eyed youthful suicide bomber--brought to this holy calling after being canned by the oil company and on the verge of being kicked out of a gulf state (no dreams of bringing his poor Pakistani mother to live with him). Another little side plot has noble Hezbollah leaders who stop Clooney from being beheaded (darn!).This movie has is a multi-threaded plot that jumps all over the place constantly in short bursts. I didn't really understand the story until I read some of the reviews on IMDb after watching it. I am not sure anyone could understand who is who and why after 1 viewing. And frankly the lefty PC over all message turned me off mainly as unbelievable so I would have to be tied in a chair to watch it twice.This won an an Oscar for Clooney. This movie must have influenced Clooney real life inspiring him to tie the knot with Amal Alamuddin (lebanese babe human rights lawyer).Several flaws in this thing....the back drop of a lot of the action is Dubai (hardly lacking in infrastructure and development)--something the good Sheik to be wants to fix along with women's rights.The $50 million (excellent) production values are largely wasted on a multiple story line plot fired at you in brief machine gun bits of story...I had to read other comments to figure out which character did what.I still gave it 1 extra star for travel log/picture book effect. But thinking about it will take that star away so no one else wastes a futile 2 hours trying to follow the plot.DO NOT WATCH.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gaghan's 'Syriana' is one of the most thought-provoking, intriguing and relevant films of recent time. Gaghan both writes and directs and he has displayed an interesting balance of both sides of political issues concerning oil which has become a source for greed, corruption and destruction. It shows how dependent America has become on oil and how far they are willing to go in order to secure its import. It also shows how America has achieved the reputation of being world power because of these poor countries, most of which will never get to experience anything close to what the West have. In a subtle way, the viewer is shown how alike all these people from different parts of the world are. They love their children, work hard for a living and dream of a better life and better world. At the same time, it also displays the corruption in the Middle East, the key sight for world oil and how terrorism is born in such regions. There are no good guys in this movie because every one is 'bad'. It's not a film that bashes America or the Middle East but rather a disturbing portrayal of what people or governments would do to stay in power.Gaghan's writing is solid. 'Syriana' is not told in a linear manner but Gaghan knows how to tell it convincingly. It isn't difficult to follow if one pays attention and the good thing is that it grasps the viewers attention from the very beginning. Yet, it is also the kind of movie where people will notice more detail with each subsequent viewing. In addition, the soundtrack and cinematography are remarkable and the editing is terrific.'Syriana' has a fantastic cast that includes George Clooney, Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright, Chris Cooper, Christopher Plummer, Amanda Peet, Mazhar Munir, William Hurt, Alexander Siddig and Viola Davis. I further admire that most of these actors simply agreed to do the film in order to be a part of it disregarding the length of the role. That said, the characters are very well etched even if many of them are given little screen time. It is the actors who successfully bring these human characters to life.I admire Clooney both as an actor and producer for making such relevant cinema that would scare other actor-producers away. 'Syriana' is a must watch for all because much of it is what's happening in the world today.</fullReview>

In the end, assassinations occur to people and corruption as well as life goes on.Acting performances were good all around but only skimmed the surface and inherently shallow. I merely felt that there was just too much going on to get me emotionally moved by this political movie. Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright, and George Clooney as well as some other actors were just there taking up their divided fragments of performance (though they are all good actors, this wasn't their movie). I just wasn't motivated to care about anyone in the movie, not even the Middle Eastern Prince with good intentions.This is only a movie, I recommend it only if you're into government conspiracies in the war for oil. This wasn't exactly my cup of tea as I may be guilty of expressing my bias against political or anti-political propaganda.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In response to the viewer who says "Clooney's out of nowhere insertion in the payoff scene was the movies weakest link" I have to disagree. In Deep cover operations CIA personnel follow and ground assist the opportunistic technology (in case the drone cameras get lost in a sandstorm) so that the operator can laser designate the target vehicle for "old school" tomahawk sub-to-air or other weapons. As such Clooney is also aware that the targeting cameras CAN see and identify him, especially his "friends" at Langley but to the movies credit at portraying verisimilitude the CIA in Langley sells him out enforcing the enforcer. The Sopranos was less hardcore but I'm glad this wasn't edited anymore, otherwise it would have been a sequel to Patriot Games (which was techno-spy-craft of an earlier era) And as for Clooney as "born again good guy" I offer that "Stan" (William Hurt) as Clooney's NSA contact is feeding him echelon data on the big guys (Chris Plummer) who have always foiled the hard-fought efforts of ground-pounder operatives. Here, Clooney just followed his nose and tried to cancel the contract-to no avail.

		<fullReview>Ambitious statement from writer-director Stephen Gaghan (Traffic) about the ongoing clash between America's oil companies and the Middle East. Gaghan's film incorporates multiple story lines which he is only barely able to hold together in his portrait of what is now called "The Clash of Civilizations," but the film's incoherence may in fact be its strength, as Gaghan correctly refuses to provide simple answers about the oil companies, the US government, and Islamic fundamentalism. He forces the viewer to immerse himself in a chaotic realm, a realm of greed, betrayal, and conflicting values. George Clooney gives probably his most likable performance to date as Bob Barnes, a CIA operative in Beirut who is captured and tortured, and then sold out by the government. Matt Damon is also good as a corporate analyst determined to make a splash off of a family tragedy with a Gulf prince, and Jeffrey Wright plays a corporate lawyer trying to aid the merger of two major oil companies. All of the acting is solid, and the footage of the Middle East is quite beautiful, yet it evokes the danger and uncertainty of the region. Syriana unfortunately suffers from largely poor and amateurish directing (Gaghan's first attempt at filming his script), employing I suppose a cinema verite mode of shaky cam, trying to recapture the feel of a documentary, but its only comes across as contrived and self-aggrandizing. Syriana is a triumph of content not form, and it is probably the most provocative and important Hollywood movie of the year.</fullReview>

Plus loads more.I DID get what the film was about, it was just that I had such a hard time following the story and distinguishing some of the characters, as each segment is very short and nothing really comes together at the end.All in all, rather a mess, so only 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fine movie. Okay, it has an unsettling ending, but life is like that... it goes on and everything isn't rosy. Would it have been a happier ending if Bob (Clooney) had saved himself and the reform-minded prince? Yes. I hoped for that, as I think we were supposed to do, but I was not surprised by the outcome. One thing I found frustrating was an apparent hint that Bryan (Damon) maybe was a CIA agent posing as an oil broker. I also was a bit perplexed by Bennett (Wrignt), who seemed to oddly glide between his law firm, the oil execs, and the Justice Department, with dubious ease. Still, this is nit-picking and it was a first-rate movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without going too much into the politics of this movie i don't think i necessarily agree with it or come to similar conclusion. As a piece of entertainment the movie works, as a piece of propaganda (no that's not a bad thing) i simply choose not to buy it hook line and sinker. I'll leave it at that.The plot in syriana is a complex weave of inter-connected events pertaining to politics, business, the middle east, Islam, and violence. The obvious comparison is of course this movie's twin, Traffic a similarly structured movie about the war on drugs. I think traffic works better for a few reasons. For one there is no real moral center in this film. In Traffic Bencio Del Toro plays an honest cop fenced in by pragmatics. In this movie everyone is something of a slime ball. The drug issue is a little easier to dispel because it's a lot easier to say end the war on drugs than it is to say end dependence on energy. Syriana also tack the interwoven style of traffic and revs it up a notch, but that leads to an overflow of hard to follow plots.The acting is fine and the direction efficient but not crisp enough. the movie could have taken more time and tried to flesh out character and plot but it would have been pushing four hours at that point. It is entertaining trying to put the puzzle together and even though it occasionally delves into cliché' (walking away from an explosion without flinching is hardly inconspicuous but looks cool on film). Multiple viewings may help clear up the plot but it shouldn't be necessary to watch twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excited by all the positive reviews it has gotten, I was really looking forward to watching this film. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. The theme and idea behind this film is somewhat interesting, but in no way is it groundbreaking, radical or original. America and the west is to blame for all suffering on the planet, and poverty is the reason why terrorism exists. We get it. It's basically what we've been fed by the media since who knows when, and what seems to be the general concensus - at least where I live. In other words, Syriana has lots of good stuff for the average pseudo-intellectual.As a movie, however, it fails miserably. It's just plain boring. Yeah, you heard me - plain boring. Sometimes boring is okay, if it's worth it in the end. With Syriana though, I never once felt connected with the plot or any of the characters, and I never caught the non-existent atmosphere of the film (obviously). You never feel Syriana. Like another reviewer commented, it's like watching a movie at a distance. Like being at a loud party and catching glimpses of what seems to be an interesting flick.George Clooney is a great actor, but let's be honest, his five of six appearances throughout the film isn't enough to justify the Oscar. He's like a really really good extra.If you must, read the book.A.T</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies I guess you have to watch several times to see how the pieces fit together. Unfortunately, this is not a movie I wish to watch several times. The acting was fine, especially the part of the oldest brother seeking to succeed his father on the throne. I had trouble with the opening scene with George Clooney. He sells an item, then acts like he has no clue as to what the item is and is wondering what they are going to do with it. What these people did with the item (I'm trying not to include a spoiler)until they finally used it was lame. I guess the most disturbing part of the movie was to know that the film accurately portrays the way certain U.S. agencies try to control other countries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like very complex plot lines, but only when they are resolved in the end. This one is so full of complexity that is never answered, not to mention deus ex machina crossing of characters.In our world where everyone wants to know the inside story and believe in conspiracies, this gives em what they want. Of course, these fictionalized views of the world leak into people's thinking about the real world. It's entertaining and dangerous.On the good side, we know so little about Arab/middle east society, I found the "inside look" intriguing, although maybe it's as distorted as the the plot and the characterizations of the players.Finally, the settings were striking and beautifully filmed.

I said, to all that, "that's a lot of bull****!" really? who are you kidding?, it depicts what many people known around the world, that American policies in the world goes in detriment of their own people, and his beliefs, in a democratic free world.Is not that "syriana" struck a nerve in me, it's subjects I'm familiar, I'm a Venezuelan, I'm a student of international studies, i know oil policies, i study it every single day, from a public way, and a private way, it is not a secret to me.But i also study the international law, and its basics, and politics and their basics. the American interventionism have more that one and a half century in the making, since the Monroe doctrine, and the expansionism, first in Latinamerica and in Asia,and now on the middle east, is just a continuation of its policies.What is the best of syriana? well for a start, they are no heroes here, all people are pieces in that machine, that filthy oil driven, blood consumer machine, and when they think they are doing the right thing, they just are making things in what their consciences, their brainwashed conscience, tell's them to do. the bad thing?portraying the terrorism as a scape to the Arab youth world, is just racist. a slow point in a movie that show is best face in the stupid of the American policies, oil policies really. the theme of the movie is clear. the only people being antiamerican, are working in Washington DC.

		<fullReview>Syriana, despite having it's flaws, was the best movie I saw in years. I could not believe Hollywood could actually produce something interesting. Alexandr Sidding and George Clooney deliver stunning acting performances of very human characters you fall in love with. What I also liked about it is that instead of having one hero the movie has several. And the heroes don't smite the enemy with their righteousness like in your standard action flick, they work really hard, they put everything on the line for truth and justice and in the end they fail(a rarity in Hollywood). It is also about the only Hollywood movie where the heroes are as complex as the villains. In your standard Hollywood movie the villain is a very human character with some fatal flaw that forces him/her to resort to villainy while the hero is just an empty shell of an individual, a coraboration of how a righteous person is supposed to act with no substance or motivation behind it. The movie treats it's villains in a very human way, the same way as it treats it's heroes. Perhaps this is why people found a lack of a character they could identify with... The conflict described is very real and human, the struggle is real, unhuman, and unforgiving. The soundtrack is brilliant, it puts you into the detached melancholy mood that makes the storyline easy to swallow, for if you identify with the events too much you will be overwhelmed with sadness and anger(consider this a warning). Matt Damon delivers a fairly strong performance until the last scene of the movie where in my opinion he seemed a bit weak(he comes back to his wife unchanged as if nothing has happened between the beginning of the movie and the end whilst the story is in a sense from his perspective, he is the witness who lives to tell it all). Amanda Peet looked weak, particularly in the scene when she decides to leave her husband(I did not sense any emotion from her, though on the positive side neither Amanda Peet nor Mad Damon were overacting; and in my opinion it is much better than overdoing it). The movie is confusing and you have to pay attention. I do not recommend to see it in theaters, grab a tape or a DVD instead. I had to rewind the video ever five minutes in order to catch all the dialog(which is the main device that is used to convey the events described). However, if a movie does not make you think and wonder, in my opinion, it has failed. Syriana didn't. Also, I was very happy to see fairly accurate depictions of people belonging to a Middle Eastern cultures(OMG, the director knew the difference between Iranians, Pakistanis, Lebanese and Arabs!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney has chosen this film wisely. He is such a loved actor and it is great to see him choosing to play a character with no redeeming qualities. Clooney always seems to be slightly ahead of the curve and I think that shows in this film also. There were several times in the movie where I was asked to really think about what was happening in the film, something a lot of audiences don't like to do. Clooney has a talent for being able to do films like this scattered in with movies that are just fun romps like the Danny Ocean films.Clooney plays a CIA agent lost in the politics of the now over cold war. He has to find his momentum in a new age. Matt Damon plays a business consultant with an American company trying to get a contract with an Arab company. He doesn't have much luck until a senseless family accident allows him access to an Arab Prince in the company he is wooing. The story is well developed with some very memorable characters. Combined with superb editing, the film is very well put together but the story is so complex with undertones that the movie comes across as too complex. The movie also never cheats itself by talking down to the audience so be prepared to bring your A game of watching and listening.Syriana is a good film and as true as any headline you'll see on CNN. Or perhaps you won't see on CNN, depending on your personal political slant.</fullReview>

All were connected to the oil scams and what not, I knew that from the premise.Them I completely lost touch with the movie. It got boring, confusing, and the problem was there were just too many characters. Despite death, killings, explosion, arguments, and all-oil-related things, I couldn't figure out what this movie was saying OR what it was about.Finally after two dreadful hours I went to watch the trailer on the special features bar to see if it could help me understand what I has just viewed. THe trailer was intense exciting, and had sped up everything to make it exciting. I decided that it was a bad movie with a lot of momentum.

		<shortDescription>Overall good but the director should have done more cutting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film went in too many different directions, I realize it was perhaps the directors intent to keep anyone watching from focusing too much on any one character but the intrigue of the oil companies and their insider trading and mergers was too much to follow at times. And Matt Damon's role struck me as a gratuitous addition by fellow actor George Clooney, who perhaps just likes working with Matt. Why the director attempted to paint the family portrait with this role in the film is baffling, and it seems to have failed, as others have wondered why this was added to the film.But where this film succeeds is in showing the hustle and bustle of busy Middle Eastern cities, the vast stretches of oil refineries and the workers who are seen as little more than disposable aliens, gotten rid of when convenient. The director also shows, very keenly, how this all ties into a ready made reservoir of resentment that religious scholars can tap into and keep a continual flow of suicide bombers at the ready for the next mission.The film concentrates mainly on the wheeling and dealing of corporate oilmen and their back room deals. While this may not sound interesting the actors play their roles very convincingly, and one gets the impression you are seeing how Exxon turned this country's highest ever recorded profit in one year (36 billion dollars) last year. And with gas prices over $3.00 a gallon, the politics of petroleum is too important a subject to ignore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana is very difficult to follow. Its message is superb, but would have been more cogent if the movie had been written &amp; directed better. It is just too confusing. Language translation captions are not displayed long enough to view the characters &amp; scene and still understand what is being said. This is poor direction.Most people blame the oil companies for our "dependence" on oil products and the "cashing in" of higher fuel prices. What most people don't realize is that government is responsible for the distortion of massive road-building, excessive use of cars/trucks, destruction of mass transit by train, consequent urban sprawl, and destruction of neighborhood stores. All of this has lead to our reliance on more oil-produced fuel. We need to hold ourselves accountable.All in all, keep up the good work Mr. Clooney.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe the comment by Danb-4 is the best description of the movie, however he dictates that the final scenes show how no one in the movie understands what's going on or what role they play, and that the finish of the movie by Gaghan is "untidy." This seems like a gross misinterpretation. The final conversation Bennet Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) has with the other lawyers is in reality the "tidy" ending that was overlooked, and this is in my opinion Gaghan's final point. That American consumer's want oil prices lower, so this in effect causes the oil corruption, lets the federal courts get lax in their regulations, let's the oil executives trample over other countries, and let's government agencies assassinate foreign royals. This in turn causes other problems such as the side story of the suicide bomber. In recapitulation, the average American consumer is the cause and the corruption is the effect.Just my two cents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great subject matter but should have been a series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There's a big spoiler towards the end, marked SPOILER!).Syriana deals with it's subject matter very well. It's so refreshing to see a film that portrays the complexity of US/global politics in a relatively balanced way instead of dumbing down it for the box-office or political means. However, this is where it fails, as well.The plot is too complex and interesting to be dealt with in the running-time of the film. The pace was too jumpy and the character development was to insufficient to allow me to really get involved. About a a third of the way into the film I decided that I had missed too much to continue so restarted the DVD with the resolve to concentrate more. This certainly helped but I still had to rewind a few parts where I'd missed important dialogue or wasn't sure who somebody was.I believe it would have been fantastic as, say a TV/DVD mini series. This would have allowed more time to develop the characters, who all had an interesting story to tell and allow things to build, almost in real-time. And, imagine the political discussions, rants and outrages that each episode would provoke (I guess I'm remembering Twin Peaks - I haven't seen Lost!).SPOILER: The final attack on Prince Nasir was a big let down compared to the rest of the film. It was so cheesy and unrealistic. Was it rewritten for the studio or something - it seemed that way? I just could not believe the stupidity of stopping the convey on the way to the coup because of a flock of sheep, however enlightened and liberal the Prince had become. They could have driven round, as demonstrated by Bob a couple of minutes later! And what the hell was Bob doing? Why didn't he just text or email a warning? Why didn't the guards shoot him? I could just about suspend belief for the unlikely way that they were assassinating the Prince, but this was just silly and unnecessary. Why even bother to kill Bob - let him suffer in his impotence to undo the chain of events that he has helped initiate, and find out what happened to his 2nd missile. Also why save through Bryan Woodman luck? END OF SPOLERTo conclude, it's a nice change to see a film that deals with US/global political issues intelligently, without taking extreme or dumb viewpoints (e.g. Michael Moore) but too short-running to tell a good story, and a bit silly towards the end. Definitely worth having on DVD so you can watch it several times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Jigsaw Puzzle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like puzzles you will love this one. We get to see different plot lines that will not impact directly and immediately on each other, but will impact later on a global basis. This is not CRASH so to speak. This is the global oil industry (is there any other kind?) doing its thing with companies merging for control and as CIA operative Bob Barnes (Clooney) learns that its thing includes doing what is in our best interests regardless of the cost and also that corruption is good.The movie is choppy, scenes cut away too fast before you get a chance to grasp what the scene was about, and you wish the story were better told. Here you have to fit the pieces in any way you can. Another problem here is the audio. And, I am not talking about a faulty DVD. Sometimes you cannot make out what a character says and you are treated like someone who shouldn't be privy to that conversation when they see you standing there straining your ears. Hey, we are the audience and need to hear these things. Maybe if the audio was better, we could have put up with the choppiness. We need to hear things. Can you hear me now?I am convinced that you have to watch this movie 2-times, at least. The second-go-round should clear some things up. Some things being defined as "the whole movie."Subtitles should be outlawed,banned, done away with. There are too many, they are too long, sometimes they are too small, and they don't stay on the screen long enough and while you are reading script, the scene changes. I never did take that speed-reading course. Do we really need sub-titles? We know certain people speak different languages, and a story is being told here and it's like watching a 9-iron shot go up toward the green and at the same time watching the spot on the green where the ball looks like it will land in relation to the pin. You need to watch both things almost at the same time. Get it? No, subtitles should be outlawed. We get it. Now, let's get (understand) the movie without them. The movie the 13th Warrior should have taught Hollywood a lesson. Apparently not. Okay, to be fair, if one watched this movie on DVD with Wide Screen, the subtitles here were in the black which was a blessing and their size was acceptable. Still, they should go.The acting was excellent by all concerned for the understandings we had as we watched, but, weren't sure what we were watching or understanding. Maybe by the second viewing we might even nominate someone for an Oscar. Hmmmm. But, in some ways this movie reminded me of FARGO in that William H. Macy was nominated for Best Supporting Actor when he should have been nominated for BEST ACTOR. Same with Clooney. Who did Clooney support? Wouldn't have bothered me if Clooney was nominated for Best Actor. I didn't see anyone who bested him, did you? Now, where does the name Syriana fit in to all this? I have no clue. I never heard it mentioned, but I could have missed it because of the poor audio at times.</fullReview>

I had heard the story was complex, and I thought this would be great, since I have a wide range in what I like in movies and can like a decent complex story that can make the viewer think.I've seen movies where everything finally comes together within the last fifteen to thirty minutes of the film, but when the ending "Syriana" credits appeared, I only had small fragments of satisfaction towards what happen with each character. This movie always gave me the feeling that the director always assumed the audience would know the technical jargon, what was constantly happening within the entire story, and what was happening to each character. Sadly, I still have some questions, and only a few assumed answers that I suspect that "might be" the answers.I think there was possibly a great story within this movie as well as several great characters, but I felt the director wasn't able to easily convey it to the majority of the audience. I didn't have the satisfaction that one gets when a movie story finally ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Syriana" is a movie that should be watched several times to truly absorb it's plot and it's point. Most of the actors do an excellent job with Amanda Peet being the lone exception. She doesn't have the depth to really make her small role memorable. However, everyone else really shines.It's a movie that packs a powerful punch. It doesn't quite finish the job, though. I've heard that there is at least one sub-blot and lots of other scenes that have hit the cutting room floor. Rumored to be because of a preview audience's reaction to, at the time, the long running time of the film. The movie clocks in at just about two hours. This is one of the few times I've thought a film could have used another half hour.Still, you should see it because there's nothing like it out there. It is one of the few films to show the Middle East as it is, without everyone wearing White or Black hats. You can debate the film's politics if you like, but there's no denying that oil is one of the main reasons for the chaos in that region.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana is effective in many ways. The film has a deliberate alienation into a world many of us are unfamiliar with, The Middle East. It captures the players involved in the shaping of the economy of this oil rich area. America is definitely an invader and a grand manipulator in this film. The Muslim Religion is no better as it seduces the minds of youth who wish to please Allah and Muhammad. These young men have no idea who they are as they go with vain pride to stop the beast.The film is frightening in it's telling, capturing a place that exists today and that in our evolution of our existence this is what we have become. Thanks to the fairy tales. It's too bad Frankincense and Myrrh, the once most profitable trade in the days of Antiquity, does not still reign in The Middle East. Instead, we have the black gunk that has polluted our soils, our air, and our minds. We have the Western World to thank for it with it's inventions that have won awards. We wonder why they blew up the World Trade Center? What's wrong with us? The film all comes together even if you don't truly understand what is going on. Stick with it and ponder it. There is a definite parallel with what's going on today while we sit in our Equity rich homes and shiny cars and stare at boxes with pretty pictures. This is happiness? The answer is simple.However, why not show the Middle East running out of oil? Imagine what would happen to those countries if this did occur. We might just invade them to force a democracy so they can adapt to the new world. hello Dubai.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful fictionalization inside the microcosm of America's largest problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Utterly relevant, Syriana was arguably last year's most compelling work of fiction. Stephen Gaghan continues his assault on exposing the inner workings behind closed doors of the bureaucratic soul, a fine return to his "Traffic" scriptwriting form. Taking queues from the book which it is based, Gaghan does his utmost to present realistic characters and scenarios that are ripped from our own Middle Eastern oil warzone of a reality and told in a very complicated, though easy to swallow narrative that interweaves all foreseeable players in a particularly nasty corporate merger. The ensemble cast are fine, and with few exceptions neither expand nor detract one's involvement with the realism of everything. It is only when the inter-cut character's lives occasionally take oversimplified, or underdeveloped thematic leaps that the wonderful plot looses any of it's fantastic edge. Sadly with it's concentration on believability, those who generally are not compelled to be concerned already with our current oil and mideast crisis will likely be less engaged throughout this imperative entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other side of truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies like these comes out only in decades... Consequenlty this movie has followed the criteria of being an entertainer still it reveals some truth. But has not taken the truth as the major concern, because there may be political barriers. At the end of the movie, I was surrounded with emptiness. And it shows how the human is not afraid not to kill the fellow human for his survival, better god had left us monkeys rather than developing us as a perfect human.This movie is not going to change the world... but somehow it has delivered the message, Thanks for George Clooney on his effort and I encourage bring out movies like this in future</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's clear that SYRIANA is a film that causes a heated reaction - either negative or positive - in those that see it. It that respect, it succeeds magnificently and Stephen Gaghan should be proud. After all, the purpose of Art is to provoke a response, and the best artists are often reviled by their contemporaries.If you want to know whether this is the kind of film that will appeal to you, you need only read the comments here. If you can spell and construct grammatical sentences, then SYRIANA is probably the sort of film you'd enjoy. That said, it is a difficult film to follow and would probably take a couple of viewing to fully grasp. I know I'll have to watch it again to get to grips with the complicated plot.For me one of the most striking images was seen near the end on the movie, when Clooney's character is trying to intercept Prince Nassir's convoy and is driving his 4x4 on empty six- lane highways to nowhere in the middle of the desert, built, in all likelihood, by a US-based construction firm.That image summed up for me exactly how middle-eastern countries have been led to squander their oil revenues on entirely the wrong kind of infrastructure. Perhaps we all need to be a little less surprised at the anger of the "ordinary folk" of the middle-east towards their own leaders and ours ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very unorthodox for a Hollywood-movie, both in the story itself, how the story is presented, and the fact that there is a noticeable absence of slick Hollywood characters or glamour.It's a complex action drama, and although it moves slower than the average action drama nowadays, it moves deeper and with 10 times the information and it took me some time to get overview of the film. The acting is of highest quality on all accounts.This movie is a must-see, but comes with a warning: Don't see the movie unless you are up for it. With 4 story lines intertwining, you need to be clear headed and awake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this a really good movie and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen from beginning to end. It was gripping, exciting, scary, frightening and very dark.There were great acting performances by everyone in it but especially George Clooney and Matt Damon for me.George Clooney was fat and bearded which will help people to concentrate on his acting abilities and the character he is portraying rather than daydreaming about the man himself! The torture scene involving fingernails is very believable - made me cringe almost as much as the first time I saw 'Marathon Man'.Alexander Siddig is most familiar to me in the role of Julian Bashir in Star Trek Deep Space Nine but I found his performance as Prince Nasir Al-Subaai credible and enjoyable to watch.Matt Damon is surprisingly good and his character has a twisted side following the tragic death of one of his sons that surprised me.I'm female and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I did hear lots of silly girls complaining straight after the movie that they had just wasted money and 2 hours of their lives that they would never get back watching Syriana but this opinion was solely based on the fact that George Clooney was fatter, bearded and less attractive in their eyes than normal. I can only assume they hadn't seen a trailer or any posters for this movie beforehand!? Other shallow females - be warned!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a didactic story using multiple story-lines.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ever studied the Ottoman history have you ever heard of any diplomatic,political or war-like events including the name "Iraq"? If you ever read something about the oriental clashes of Ottoman empire this was always something that had to do with the Shiite Iran. Iraq is just (or should I say "was" here) an "artificial state" created in the wake of the Ottoman Empire by the British Empire. It is a state that was created for a region by external actors without regards to the region's inhabitants desire for a shared national identity. Syriana is movie that may make us realize this thing. Maybe it does not openly describe this. It seems not like full of action and it has an haltering pace at some points, it has many clichés. It may not even thrill you or even it may sound like "the Arabs are nothing, not even self-motivated terrorists, but mere puppets manipulated by us in the omnipotent US just like Amir Taheri stated but it is a good didactic movie which gives us a little bit insight into the nature of human by using multiple story lines. When you have no job, face the danger of being deported,when you have no hope does it have to make sense to realize a suicide-bombing? When you have lots of money and some petroleum connections will you question your conscience to make more money by down-siding some part of the world as the third world? When you try to be a reformist does it just depend on you or will there always be some power standing in your way? Syriana is just such a didactic story deserving respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but what about its impact?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a well conceived and acted out plot. It had me interested from the first moment and it consolidated my points of view on the oil industry. Of course, I didn't understand all the ramifications of the plot and I can understand people arguing that the film has too many characters. But, besides that, I think this movie is a must see for people who have at least a little political background. The only thing I am afraid of is the Fahrenheit 9/11 effect: Those who are tending towards an Anti-American point of view will enjoy and understand the film whereas those who think favorably of the Bush administration and the foreign policy it conducts will discard this movie as liberal propaganda. I am afraid that this movie will only intensify the dichotomy between Liberals/Democrats and the Republicans. And let's not forget the illiterate or lowbrow masses of American society. They will think of this film as a big bore which was completely unrelated to their private lifes. They'll probably think of the screenplay as some concoction and of the director as some arrogant whizkid who just wants to show off how much he knows about the oil industry, and who just juxtaposes one scary insight after another. One thing is probably clear: Little action will be taken on account of this movie. People will just thing, Yeah, it's a bad world, isn't it, but what can we do. Even if know how corrupt the Americans, or politicians in general are, the whole thing is out of our hands, isn't it? The best thing we can do is to hope for things to get better and to stay away from high rise buildings you can't get out of in case a plane crashes into it. The question that automatically ensued from watching this movie, was: How can we reach the masses? How can we reach people and make them understand that they are responsible for their own actions, and for the actions that are taken in their name. I guess there isn't a way. Some people will always be more concerned with their private lifes and they won't see why it is so important to read books on world politics. What it finally comes down to is to make the right cross when the next election comes up. Ande even these elections are so difficult that many people make their cross haphazardly!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Took a chance on this docu-drama this afternoon and was pleasantly rewarded. For those confused about what goes on in the Middle East today, the oil industry, world economy, corruption etc then this film is a must see. In many ways the film confirms what we think goes on but we're not really quite sure. It resolves any doubts or feelings that we may be slightly paranoid or that we are a victim of the conspiracy theorist journos that some may call Michael Moore. It also confirms what I think suicide bombers are; young men with dreams going nowhere exploited by fundamental groups who, in my interpretation of this film, may have a modicum of justification for what they do. George Clooney does not dominate this film and not being a Clooney fan was pleased about that. In fact my only criticism over Clooney in this film is the pretentious flick of the head he is inclined to do in movies. He does this once at the beginning of the movie and then plays it straight thereafter. Let him off this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They've killed Dr Bashir!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A heavyweight but relatively dry offering about America's middle-eastern oil interests ? tightly scripted and well acted but frequently in danger of becoming a fictionalised version of the corporation just without any added dramatic flourish. Its strength is also arguably its flaw, namely the careful pacing which builds each story thread convincingly, layering the cake as it were until finally, about an hour in, the connections begin to become more obvious. In other words this is a polemic (thriller doesn't really seem to be the right word) that rewards careful attention but as it's a slow-burner, and I'm not kidding, don't even think about taking a urination break or you'll be finished, you must be patient with it. Anyone hoping the wordy exchanges or behind the scenes intrigue will be broken up with special effects, explosions or slow-mo gunfights will be disappointed. Guigan, who wrote Traffic apparently, is a better screenwriter than director which isn't to say that he doesn't coax good performances from the large cast ? he does, and very good they all are, it's simply that its so low-key for most of the running time that, the scene in which Clooney has his nails yanked aside, it never comes alive and it's for this reason that the good never registers as great. Good movie, important movie, indeed relevant movie ? terrific movie? No. You're unlikely to return to it but then you've got the message so why would you need to?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't going to write a review of this and it will become clear later why not. I had tried to get to see it a number of times and interestingly enough, could not get any 'local' feedback, meaning that none of my friends had seen it and none were too enthusiastic, for some unidentifiable reason, about attending a screening.So with the nomination of George Clooney for the supporting actor Oscar, I felt compelled to go. I attended an extremely comfortable suburban theater with huge seats and a big screen on the afternoon of Oscar night. I am getting somewhere with all of this, please trust me.George is good in this, in a lot of the bits I saw and a lot of the bits the other nineteen people in the theatre saw. We all agreed on this as we left the theatre. He wasn't Oscar worthy, we thought, but a good performance, and he looked interestingly decayed and used up with the extra weight and the bags under the eyes.You see, I fell asleep on and off throughout the film as did the other nineteen people who were in attendance with me. We sheepishly looked around at each other throughout the screening as we all took turns to catch a few zzzzs. The script, well, it never grabbed, and while understanding that the film was not linear, well it got really, really confusing, you couldn't quite unpick all the threads, we knew the child died but did he appear again as a ghost? And why? What was that ending? What was George doing in it? Where was his wife? Was she CIA too? I hate movies where you have to work this hard, it gets so exhausting you have to catnap now and again. We took it upon ourselves, we the audience, to rotate our sleep shifts.I can't rate it. Not fair. But if you're a chronic insomniac, this movie could really, really help you. George was not Oscar-winner worthy, that shoulda gone to Jake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana is a good film which investigates the nature of the oil trade and western government's dealings (often Machiavellian) with Middle East nations. With a stellar cast, including the excellent Christopher Plummer, the movie rattles along at a fine pace. The message is certainly left-of-centre and will probably not impress Republicans in the USA. I divorced myself from the issues and watched the film open minded. It raises interesting questions about political morality and will please those who love a good conspiracy theory. The central tenet was that America uses underhand tactics to pursue its interests vis-a-vis oil. This is not exactly new stuff: throughout the ages countries have pursued their aims often to the detriment of others. The film offers interesting comments on what happens in a nation which is on the other side of American policy. The effect on the 'ordinary' people of an Arab country is explored. Overall, the acting is first rate and although I felt the film should have ended a tad sooner, it's still worth seeing. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new generation of US movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before castigating America, people should note what a multi-faceted society it is. A look at the last few months is a staggering demonstration of film after film (and we're not talking about little known 'indie' ones) carrying a strong critical and anti-White House message. In succession, Jarhead, Good Night and Good Luck, Flight 93, Syriana and others are kick-starting a welcome new-era of politicised Hollywood. They may not be quite as easy to follow as American Pie, yet those grey-matter-friendly movies should put in their place those who think the U.S. is merely an equation of bible-belt, rednecks and trailer trash.With the fanfare surrounding it, an amazing cast (George Clooney at his best) and its Oscar nominations, Syriana has a huge potential to preach beyond the converted. Stephen Gaghan's film is extremely intelligent and valuable, as it points out how each single one of our informed choices as ordinary citizens is likely to be connected to some appalling policy carried out by the Government-backed oil industry in that ticking time-bomb that is the Middle East. The movie isn't political propaganda as such, yet the sheer fact that it isn't fiction is enough to convey an extremely brave message, especially when you consider that we're talking about Hollywood. If anything, it makes you wonder how the creators managed to find any producers to back it.Nonetheless, you can't help but think that after penning the bulk of Syriana, its masterminds sat down to a cup of tea and discussed how to make it as muddled as possible for the viewers. The plot can get so disjointed that even the most attentive person struggles to keep up which, frankly, is a real shame as there was no need for that. The idea of having a web of subplots that will come intertwined at the end is an intriguing and admirable one, yet not all of the stories on display in Syriana are as relevant or interesting as others. Its merciless realism, though, is enough to make it recommendable. Unless, that is, it's Final Destination 3 you're after...then you have to consider whether a 2-hour snooze is worth ?5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious and complex, yet slightly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is highly original and thought provoking. It holds attention and demands a lot from the viewer. There are multiple linked plot lines which is nice but at the end you feel that it is meant to mesh together a little better than it does. You have a constant feeling that you missed some snippet of dialogue that would link things together better. I think this may be deliberate on the part of the director, but I am not sure it is a good idea, because without a real reward for the mental effort on the part of the viewer, you feel a little cheated.In the end the main plot boils down to a big bad conspiracy and this is what annoyed me the most. Above all this movie aspires to realism and in the real world, complicated conspiracies don't come off. People make errors, they blunder and miscommunicate, they are no omnipotent puppet masters. Oil, and the economics and politics of oil-depletion are hugely important subjects. It is great that someone has managed to make an movie about it. It is just not as exciting or informative as I thought it could be.I won't go into the details of the plots because there are hundreds of other reviews which do that. If you are tired or lazy then it is probably worth reading a spoiler review, it might actually increase your enjoyment of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana promised a great deal, however, I left feeling somewhat un-filled. The movie is a detailed look at the complexities and the politics of and behind the oil industry. The movie doesn't take any direct shots at either the Iranian royal family or the US government, however, what it does accomplish is to paint a picture of one overally dependant country exerting both its public foreign polices as well as its much darker private practices to main its power of the worlds largest natural resource (or whats left of it).Where the US is weak in the ability to produce its own energy, it is very strong in flexing its ability to exert influence over other countries whilst still maintaining its public distance via its own home-built foreign policy enforcers - the CIA and the state department.The movie goes on to suggest that the American oil companies operate within this "endorsed" framework in their attempt to stop and prevent China from stepping in and signing oil contracts away from the US.The result is an understated but very calculated ending that solidifies the worlds popular belief of US' 'stop at nothing' attitude to maintain the status quo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's no secret that George Clooney is 'mad as he@# and isn't going to take it anymore'. Many of his recent movies and not so recent (ie We Three Kings) have been sending the message: things are not as black and white or cut and dry as we are being led to believe. But Syriana takes this message up a notch. It not only destroys the notion that terrorists exist separate from good God fearing folks, but it also destroys our belief that we are good God fearing folks. If I were to voice a complaint about this movie it would be, it's a bit vague about one issue, although it alludes to it: we, as Americans, with our rampant consumption and horrific waste (cough, cough SUV's, McMansions ...) create and foster the corruption of the oil industry. Our high demand and excessive lifestyles are the wind in the sails of these criminals. This movie was thought provoking and relatively realistic, although perhaps a little over done when it came to the boy's school (this seemed a bit like an American attempt to portray Arab beliefs/Muslims); although I might be wrong. I liked the way the story was presented in, what appeared to be snippets of various unrelated events and then put the pieces together. Very intelligently done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that if you are looking for a big action romp with things exploding periodically, naked people and over the top chase scenes get a copy of the Bourne trilogy or any other Bond film instead. Not to cast disparity on those films, but understanding the difference is crucial. I went into Syriana with no overbearing preconceived notions of what to expect, and in the end that is perhaps the best way to approach this movie. I found the number of negative responses to this film at the same time alarming and not very surprising. This is not a movie for everyone to be sure, if you prefer to switch your brain off when watching a movie then take my above stated advise for your own sake.That being said, if you enjoy thought provoking intelligent film-making then please do see this movie. This is likely one of the best written scripts I have encountered in months. The fact that Stephen Gaghan, who also penned Traffic and Rules of Engagement, was both the writer and director naturally helps to see the film's vision to fruition. Some people have commented that they found the acting stiff, but it is precisely refraining from the type of overly dramatic acting that allows the film to exhibit it's strongest feature: The Script. This is also evident in the directing being very toned down (as in not being from the Jerry Bruckheimer school of directing) and allowing the actors to carry the story with their performances instead.Instead of relying on big explosions or special effects the movie relies on the strength of the story. This movie does not, however, hold your hand and if you are not paying attention you will likely get lost between the multiple story lines and sub plots. One of the elements that I found very rewarding is that it does not glorify any of the characters or parties involved, nor does it choose a side. It merely presents the various situations and people for what they are. Not good or evil instead simply an honest portrayal of people living their lives and doing their jobs trying to achieve their goals in life.It is simply a brilliant and sobering analysis of the impact that oil has on our lives and the lengths that will be gone to in order to control it. As well as the things that greed, corruption and power will lead us to do.</fullReview>

Get your facts straight.Liquefied natural gas or LNG is natural gas that has been converted to liquid form for ease of storage or transport.The liquefaction process involves removal of certain components (such as dust, helium, or impurities that could cause difficulty downstream, e.g. water, and heavy hydrocarbons) and then condensed into a liquid at close to atmospheric pressure (Maximum Transport Pressure set around 25 kPa (3.6psi)) by cooling it to approximately -163 degrees Celsius. LNG is transported in specially designed cryogenic sea vessels or cryogenic road tankers; and stored in specially designed tanks. LNG is about 1/614th the volume of natural gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP), making it much more cost-efficient to transport over long distances where pipelines do not exist. Where moving natural gas by pipelines is not possible or economical, it can be transported by LNG vessels.</fullReview>

The movie is some kind of protest against the use by the world biggest countries of the little but with great natural resources countries all over the world. Murders, pressures, tortures, all in order to gain the power and take profit of the material. The movie has one great plot, as the story is interesting and the actors are wonderful (both Clooney and Damon) and the directing is also quite well. The movie, though weird (it's not usual that there's no good side) is well directed and the scenes, despite the fact that they are quite confusing, are well filmed. THe main problem of the movie is that it is done as a documentary, the style is too much neutral and calm, probably a more spontaneous flavour would have done the movie better. This happens specially at the beginning, that the movie is quite slow (later, as the "fun" begins, the movie is fabulous). Well, it is a good movie to watch calm, with time to think about it. Do not expect James Bond behaviour. This does not exist, real wars happen in bureaus, the rest is for entertain the crowd.</fullReview>

Clooney is excellent as always subtely, as is the entire cast, but Clooney's under-playing of the lead is what most helps make the whole thing come together and so totally believable. Make no mistake the film reflects how the world works and life is like this. The people who run the world are corrupt and we are now less able to make a difference than ever before - that is the message, and this film is letting us know that loud an clear. It offers no answers, just more questions, again just as life does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May need to be watched more than once ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... and the only reason I say that is because English is not my native language and I had to watch it a few times before everything sank in.Despite all the negative reviews from people walking out in the middle of the movie, this movie is not boring and creates a nice mixture of portraying the oil business and the effects corporations have on the lives of those in third world countries. It briefly touches on the subject of why young men (and women, although the movie doesn't mention that) in these countries join radical groups and become martyrs.Syriana also explains how easily we all are slaves to the needs of governments and corporations and how the government can turn its back on the very people who work to save its future. All in all, it is an eye opener for people who are far removed from their government's foreign policy (or domestic policy, for that matter) and how these policies affect people who may not count much in the broader sense of things to the government and its people.The movie shows the corruption behind what it takes to keep a large corporation ticking on top and how the government's involvement assures corporations of their survival needs with disregard to basic needs of human beings.I only rate this movie an eight because it could possibly have been made to be well understood from a single viewing. For instance, rather than jumping from short scenes to far-relevant short scenes that would be explained later, the scenes could have stayed longer on single subjects. Perhaps this was an intentional decision, so that it would need to be viewed more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The makers of Syrianna could not have chosen a better time to realise this film. Giving the current political climate of the world I am pleased to say that someone has the balls to realise a movie like this.As Iraq plunges further into the deep, dark abyss we are told that the United States of America is responsible for the freedom of the Iraqi people and that Saddam Hussain was a brutal dictator that deserved to be hanged and the world is a much safer place and blah,blah,blah..... the Bush Adminstartion continues to lie and dupe so much that it just seems like a badly written comedy every time one switch's on Fox News or CNN. However what one tiny little fact that the Bush Adminstartion I'm sure was happy to leave out was the real reason behind there invasion of Iraq - Black Gold better known to the general public as OIL!Syrianna is an insightful look into what goes on behind the scenes of the oil business and how everything works and nothing is what it seems. We are shown a detailed depiction of from the people who work from top to bottom in this pyramid ranging from the CIA, multi-million dollar cooperations right to the people who work in the oil fields and how their lives are affected by what they do. George Clooney leaves behind his charming features at the door and takes what I feel could a very important fresh turn in his career as well as Matt Damon who performed equally as well. However I personally felt that the best performance belonged to Jeffery Wright who was probably the under dog but managed to sweat it out the whole way. The movie moved along at a rather slow pace but I felt that was required as the viewer needs to follow and take everything in however that can lead to it being a little dull in places.To conclude Syrianna is a very cleverly constructed political thriller realised in a time where the facts truly are in your face. It is exposing the corruption and ruthless exploits of all the big-wigs in the oil game and looking at the consequences it leads to whether it be personal tragedy or the growing presence of Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle-East, it is not the best thriller ever made but worth a rental for fans of this genre.SYRIANNA : 8.1 OUT OF 10EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex, but interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, by Stephen Gaghan, the writer of Traffic, shares many similarities with its predecessor. The film is mostly a series of smaller stories about individuals relating to the overall topic of oil and the Middle East and as the film continues, some connections are made between them. But the concept of the film is less to tell these individuals' stories, but to show the complicated mess that is the Middle East and the overall troubling lose-lose scenario created there.The emotional impact of the film is blunted by its somewhat detached direction and limited storytelling, but it still carries some small impact. The acting is overall solid throughout the effort.Syriana captures complexities but doesn't fully delve into the different characters' struggles and backstory enough (for instance, the due-diligence man's relationship with his father) to fully reward the viewer with a full picture. That said, perhaps the problem with the film is that it was overreaching the US audience, as I'm sure that many scenes were cut from the film due to length and complexity. The film also contains a lot of information and if you're not able to carefully follow every detail, it's easy for things to get a bit confusing. A lot of characters are introduced, some seemingly out of the blue (but that again, might be due to a reduced final cut).In the end, it's a pretty interesting film and one that I still think is pretty good to watch, despite the complex item-heavy dialogue and labyrinthine storytelling. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stephen Gaghan's "Syriana" is a partly excellent political thriller and if you ask me, that's a genre with way too less motion pictures in recent times. Many films have political references, but a film that has corporation politics all over the world as main topic is the exception and in this case, as I said, a very good one. Matt Damon's storyline is very good, as is Jeffrey Wright's. George Clooney's plot was the most complex in my opinion. All I can say is that he got that Oscar deservedly. The only storyline that wasn't very convincing was the one with the suicide killers. I think this has been done much better in "Paradise Now". In addition to that there are some sub-plot lines, everyone of which you will see connected in the end. First of all I think it's a thrilling examination of the corruption in the oil business, but what I really like about "Syriana" is that it shows in only a few, but very strong scenes, that in the end not money, but the people that you love are most important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie requires you to concentrate very hard all the time and expects you to understand complex plots and dialogue very quickly.The intricate webs of corruption in the oil industry could certainly make for an entertaining movie. Unfortunately in Syriana the filmmaker has chosen a complicated language to bring this to the screen and doesn't explain the connections between the plots clearly enough. At least for the average viewer. In spite of the subtle and intense acting, this film will probably fail to engage many viewers because of too many things left untold and to many loose ends.Unless you are willing to study the story before watching it, or spend a lot of extra time rewinding every time you don't manage to understand what's happening on screen, this film will test your patience and probably leave you with the empty feeling you have just heard an important story without being able to understand or enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good film revolving around an oil company's plot to undermine an Arab kingdom's decision to award the drilling rights in their country to the Chinese instead of them. It's filmed in much the same manner as "Traffic" or "Crash." We're introduced to a host of characters whose stories weave together by the end of the film.George Clooney plays a CIA operative in the Middle East. Christopher Plummer and Chris Cooper are the oil men behind the conspiracy. Matt Damon is an investment adviser to one of the Arab sheiks. There are subplots involving Pakistani laborers enticed into becoming suicide bombers, and a power struggle among two brothers to assume the throne of this oil kingdom. It's a complete mosaic of the social strata in the Middle East today.The acting is very good, though it would be fair to point out that the director limits character development in favor of simply telling the story. We're spared the usual dramatic flare too often used in political action films. There's no romantic interest, no hero so to speak, and there isn't a happy ending. What we see is a reflection of modern day reality, and it's plenty scary.If you liked "The Constant Gardener" you'll enjoy this film. I thought it was one of the best movies I've seen all year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the best you can say about a movie is that the cinematography was good and that the death of a child was moving, you know you just finished watching a bad movie. Well, that's all I have good to say about "Syriana." Unfortunately the screenwriter's (and for this film, director's) success with "Traffic" has led him to believe every story should be told the same way. That sad disease has also afflicted Altman ever since at least "Nashville." You can see the desperate need for us to connect with the characters in all of the non sequitur home life scenes, such as the lawyer's alcoholic father, whose character appears to be in there for no other reason than to emphasize that This Guy is Stressed.Sadly, despite all of the added time due to these "context" scenes, there is no payoff. The story does not come together, it just ends. The viewer doesn't care about anything that just happened, save maybe Matt Damon's character's (the father of the dead child mentioned above) home life.Save yourself a couple of hours and skip this wreck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie's heart is so much in the right place. Those of us who detest official US policies and postures - and its murderous blood surrogate Israel's - should see this kind of film, to understand again that there IS another America, of people like the rest of us. The war is not against America, but against rampant capitalism and a certain sort of blind, dull, cruel American, personified these days by their idiot Mickey Mouse president and those who pull his strings. The last 10-odd minutes of this film rank among the very best mise en scene I've seen in US cinema for some years, despite the clunky sentimentality of some of the conclusions to some of the sub-plots (the Matt Damon one particularly, but also the very last one). The one take-out Scene on the DVD - Clooney's character in his office awkwardly - would have helped to contextualise the remaining one of the office being cleared afterwards. Personally I'm also sad that so many of Greta Scacci's scenes bit the dust. She looks wonderfully old and worn down by US spook life in the dropped Scenes. But overall: many thanks to all involved ... Americans would have fewer enemies if Americans managed to make and show more films like this. This is probably a good way to stop airliners flying into tall buildings.</fullReview>

Maybe I just don't get, but nothing seems to happen. The numerous stories which are supposed to be linked jump around constantly. You need to be very quick to follow the complicated political plot, and the director assumes you're completely knowledgeable about Hezbollah, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and all things Middle East. None of this is explained but it all forms an essential part of the story. The movie does not root you to your seat, and you can leave it running while you make something to drink. All you'll miss is subtitled Arabic conversation about baseball and bobsleighs. OK, so I've bashed this title, but I don't believe that 90% of the people who watch it will be entertained. Even if you could follow what was going on (I pieced it together at the end), it's long and drawn-out and ultimately ends on a very flat note. A waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, director Stephen Gaghan, of TRAFFIC fame, has made a confusing and sometimes totally crazy movie with this 2005 flick. He has laced it with some top talent such as Willima Hurt, Christopher Plummer, Robert Foxworth, Matt Damon and an extraordinary performance by George Clooney. Clooney walks away with this one and Academy voters were right in coveting him with an Oscar. He's tops in this.The photography and locations were quite authentic and incredible as were all the supporting actors, both American and Islamic. However, I got lost along the way as to who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. It's a long film and you are really entranced with it, but when it's over you say, "What was that all about?" Maybe that's what Gaghan wanted us to think, for certainly in this day and age, who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? It seemed to me that most of the cast were made up of the bad guys by their actions and their lack of concern for each other.Anyway, I give this a 5 for Clooney and his masterful acting performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Maze That Is Syriana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt lost in Syriana, as if I were a small rat in a huge maze.Told through multiple story lines, the film's focus is on oil addiction and how it affects everyone connected with it, from the hardworking Persians in the oil fields to the glutenously rich Sheiks and American tycoons. The bad thing about Syriana is that the message stands out more than the film or ? unfortunately ? its characters. It's a valid message that we need to (must!) hear. We live in a global economy and that economy directly influences other nations. From Russia to China and Iran to the U.S., each action one takes will send waves through the other.Murder and pushing business are co-mingled in Syriana as we see Bob (George Clooney plus 30 pounds) working for the CIA in the Persian Gulf region. He's never asked why he does what he does. He simply knows that he's doing it for the good of his country. But when the U.S. turns its back on Bob, he has to make a decision, and it's something that will change the course of his life.Interspersed with Bob's actions are others whose deeds end up causing deadly results. No fingers are pointed at anyone being at fault for this (one of the big bonuses of the movie), and it is this that pulls the viewer into the story. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) plays an attorney searching for a way to make a large oil company merger happen without attracting legal problems. His hard work and initial goodness are muddled by the end as he discovers what he has to do in order to affect such a merger.Byran Woodman (Matt Damon) is a high level financial adviser for corporate America who loses his son to an accident (?) at an Arab/American party, only to be sucked into the lives of the people responsible for his son's death.There are at least three other side-stories going on, but I'm not going to bother with them for one simple reason: they're too damn confusing! And that's the big downside to Syriana. It tries to make too many connections in too short a time. Several times I had to stop and ask myself, "Now what does this guy/gal have to do with the story again?" I'm a pretty astute viewer but several of these characters' purposes went beyond my threshold of understanding. For instance, Danny Dalton is played by Tim Blake Nelson (Oh Brother Where Art Thou), but I have no idea what his purpose was in the film. He's got maybe two minutes of screen-time and that's it. And Jeffrey Wright's character (Bennett Holiday) has what I think is a father waiting for him when he gets dropped off at his house and they have some sort of angry altercation for completely unknown reasons. And Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) plays a powerful political figure but how, why, and where he flexes this muscle is never shown nor explained.Making people connections on film is fun and a basic requirement for enjoyable cinematic experiences. But if you overload your audience with these connections, the whole can seem like a bramble of fractured stories that never come to fruition. And that's certainly the way I felt when I saw Syriana.So why the positive review? Look at this: George Clooney, Christopher Plummer, Jeffrey Wright, Chris Cooper, Robert Foxworthy, Matt Damon, Alexander Siddig, Tim Blake Nelson, William Hurt, Amanda Peet, and the list goes on. Now THAT'S an ensemble cast! The acting is excellent.The message of over-dependence on oil is something everyone in the world needs to know about and this movie certainly puts it center stage. The slimy business dealings, the underhanded political tactics, and the jihadists against Western involvement in Eastern affairs are all brought into focus without forcing the issues down our throats. Nice job.With all of the horribly shallow films available for us to watch (DATE MOVIE), this one certainly tips the opposite end of the scale. Just be forewarned, you may feel as though you're in a maze with no reference points and no way out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Syriana' deals with the world of global oil politics, terrorism and corruption within the government and corporates. It's a highly important subject, that impacts the day-to-day life of almost everybody on the planet, and it's a terrific stuff for a political thriller. You can agree or not with the point of view of the authors, but you cannot deny that it's an important theme. However, the film succeeds less than I expected and the reason is that it tries to tell too much.The conflict is complex, and involves at least four parallel threads, that scarcely get together until shortly before the end. Yes, so is our world, but it may be too much for a two hours thriller. Despite highly effective scenes like the abduction in Beirut, and despite the professional acting of big stars like Clooney, Plummer or Damon, I found myself too fast lost in the complexities of the plots, and I found the motivation of the too many characters unclear in too many moments. Such a complex bunch of subjects is better suited for a TV series like '24' but does not fit well into one feature film. Out of the recent productions in the same space I found for example 'Lord of War' much more focused and at the end of the day a better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Syriana" is above all a movie so ambitious and that's been filmed with class. It also has an excellent cast, and will remind you of recent titles such as "Traffic" or "The insider". The story in "Syriana" won't surprise those with the slightest intelligence: the direct intervention of American corporations, the CIA, and the Government in the Middle East, in illegal operations, corruption, etc. in order to protect their interest in the natural resources of that zone and keep those countries away from real democracy. At the same time "Syriana" shows us how this kind of policies condemn the population to the absolute poverty and misery, how they resort to religion and hatred and how many of them become fanatics and eventually they kill themselves in the so-called "terrorism acts".The only negative points about "Syriana" are that tries to cover to many issues, too many points of view, some of the characters are not well defined, and you may feel a little bit lost in some moments. Anyway, Stephen Gaghan proves he's a nice director, and he's made a valiant movie, and so necessary. Unfortunately, this kind of movies won't make things change, for those that can change things don't give a damn about movies.*My rate: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, Ultimately a failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read at least half the comments here. I have come to the conclusion that this film failed its intent, which was to educate us Americans regarding what is really going on in the Middle East. Those of us that 'got it', already knew it. Those of us that didn't get it, and who needed to get it, the real target audience, refused to put the work into understanding this film.It's not really that difficult to grasp the concept of corporate greed in bed with judicial and executive corruption. Not that hard to see how this relationship translates into the suffering of their prey, underdeveloped countries with desirable resources. But the pacing and the quick transitions made it a little too difficult for the average moviegoer to make the connections between the various players and to easily comprehend the particular agendas and motivations of each. Like a good murder mystery all the hints were there, but the script was so tightly woven, so few words wasted, that it was necessary to pay attention to every word spoken.I didn't find the characters underdeveloped or caricatures either. They were barely characters at all and I believe this was as intended. More like the archetypes in Greek tragedy, their function was to deliver truths. A CIA operative can be just a man who happens to be a true believer, whose eyes are opened when he is victimized by those he serves and he realizes that ends are in fact not justified by the means, and never were. Or the accomplished and ambitious black lawyer who earns his father's contempt by applying his gifts to serving injustices rather than the obvious path of righting them. When the Pakistani migrant worker says he is not very religious, he is telling us something. He is telling us that Muslim terrorists aren't necessarily evil crazed subhumans motivated by religious mania, but often simply just people driven by the desperation and hopelessness of their poverty, and worry for their families to extreme acts. These are simple messages, more humanistic than political - so simple it felt like the writer was deliberately 'dumbing down' the script to accommodate my limited American attention span and unwillingness to deal with subtleties.And that is the problem. It's pointless to blame Hollywood. They are simply giving us what we ask for. Simplistic plots and and truly caricaturish heros spoon fed to us with our Happy Meals. This film was probably more generally understood in Europe, where audiences are accustomed to putting a little work into their cinema experience. The writer should probably have considered this if he really wanted to reach more people with his message.I will say, in fairness to those who didn't get it, I watched this movie on DVD with a friend, and we took a break mid-movie and talked about who was who and what was going on. There were a few places it was just a bit too fast. And at that point I was very glad that I wasn't watching it in a theater.I hope that all you who gave this movie one star because you couldn't follow it, give it another shot on DVD. All that is really needed is the pause and rewind buttons. I think you will find that is it well worth the effort.</fullReview>

None of the scenes tie in together, nor do they make any sense. The idea of this movie could have been fantastic and a blockbuster. That idea was flushed down the toilet and ruined the whole movie. Only some of the characters tied in together and only some of the major incidents in the movie were explained. As one user commented "the movie was like a truck driving into a wall and that was the ending". Hit that right on the nose. When this movie ends, both the people who enjoyed this movie and the people who thought it was awful say "what in the world just happened here?" Funny thing is, the movie did keep me on the edge of my bed because I wanted to know what happened next, by the time I realized it was over, I was so glad that I didn't have to spend the money in a movie theatre to watch it. So I was able to just lay down and then it HIT ME..........I SPENT $20 frickn dollars for the DVD and should of spent the $10 in a movie theatre. If you want to see this movie, get someone else to rent it or buy it. Save your money. All in all there was an amazing group of characters and they actually did a great job. What surprised me is that, there were all these well known Oscar winning actors and none of them told Steven Gaghan that his writing and directing skills could use some work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon): "It's running out?. and ninety percent of what's left is in the Middle East. This is a fight to the death." There could not be a better introduction to the film Syriana. Although it is hyped as a 'political Hollywood film' with a 'complicated' message, Syriana is perfectly simple. The United States of America are trying by all means to keep their dominance in the Middle East. The oil reserves over there are much greater than those in for example Central Asia and Alaska. One of the means is corruption, with important consequences for the rest of the world.Gulf-prince-good-guy Nasir Al-Subaai (Alexander Siddig) explains to the Swiss energy analyst Woodman how come that his oil state is remaining so underdeveloped. "Your president calls my father. One phone call later we're stealing out of our social programs to buy overpriced airplanes." That one liner brings the story much closer to us. For one, four years ago, the Netherlands too spent almost a billion dollars in a very risky undertaking, under dubious political consequences: the American military airplane Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). Theo van Gogh got his inspiration for the film 06/05 from this, suggesting a link with the murder of Pim Fortuyn. Syriana is not made of facts and a fictional context, but the exact opposite. However, conspiracy theory lovers can enjoy both films equally.Syriana starts with the decision of the young, progressive prince Nasir Al-Subaai to grant natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company. Obviously, the interests of the Texan energy giant Connex (having long-established business ties in the region) are severely hurt. At the same time the smaller oil company Killen has won drilling rights to coveted fields in Kazakhstan. Because of the unused production capacity, Connex starts a merger with Killen. All of a sudden, Connex-Killen is the fifth biggest oil company in the world. However, the historical merger is far from transparent. A white-shoe (conservative, Republican) law firm is brought in to prevent accusations of bribery and breaking of anti trust laws. They succeed. High ranking Killen manager Nelson is happy: "Corruption is why we win. ? Corruption is our protection." Much is happening in Syriana, at many locations. There is a way different story line of veteran CIA agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney) on a mission in Tehran as the assassin of two arms dealers. Painfully he discovers that 'his' CIA betrayed him. For years, he has been lied to, while the true reasons for his missions were never revealed. He is tortured, rescued just in time by a Hezbollah imam and finally degraded. Later on, he tries to prevent a murder attempt on prince Nasir.Much is happening at the same time too. In this perspective, Syriana is complicated. The ending is familiar. Sacked Pakistani workers hit a Connex-Killen in a suicide attack, pretty much like the USS Cole bombing in 2000. The Pakistani made use of the shaped-charge explosives that Bob Barnes has lost in Iran. All story lines come together again.Dirty and complicated. That is the reality of oil business, according to Syriana. United States expert Frank Verhagen as well as Middle East expert Paul Aarts agree on that too. Syriana is already more complex than the average Hollywood film. But the reality in the region would be several times worse. The choice to introduce a Chinese oil company in the script is typically 'Hollywood', on the other hand. Verhagen: "Yes, for about five years now, China is hot. There's not much sex in this movie - probably 'China' had to make up for it." Syriana does not provide answers, say director and actors. True. But one thing is sure after watching Syriana: in ten years time, the 'Connex-Killens' will still dominate.Is Hollywood getting more political again? So it seems. Well, George Clooney certainly is, as his roles in the recent films Good Night, and Good Luck (about the witch hunt on communists by McCarthy in the 1950s) and Syriana suggest. "Syriana is not attacking Bush and his administration. It is attacking a system that survived for sixty, seventy years now, with oil as its core", says Clooney. In another interview he was proud about Bush criticising him. Already in the first years after September 11th 2001, actors and artists were mercilessly divided into good (patriotic) and bad (not patriotic) at Celiberal.com. Clooney has never been outside Whine Rack, with Johnny Depp, Madonna and others. The Righties are for example John Travolta and (unsurprisingly) Arnold Schwarzenegger.Maybe it is nothing but a change of subject and style. Marlon Brando refused to accept his Academy Award in 1973. He was protesting against the way Hollywood pictured native Americans at that time and sent Littlefeather in his place. But in order to be an 'engaged' actor nowadays, one must be tough - against Bush, or against the terrorists.Please visit www.jasperlaros.com</fullReview>

I can only applaud the maker of this film for making the point that among all cultures and religions there are the good &amp; bad, the fact that western society has been hoodwinked into believing that there are no decent,loving,caring &amp; educated Arabs is a travesty that must be corrected. I do believe this film can only give a very good example of how western society has corrupted the wealth to be raped from the middle east.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching SYRIANA, and I cannot believe some of the comments on this site nor the 7.2-star rating. This is not some overly complicated jigsaw puzzle as many are making it out to be. It is poignant, running a simple theme of corruption and its effect on various peoples, cultures and economies, powerfully combining to transmit the global consequences.The film itself (by the way, does anyone acknowledge the tremendous efforts and work put into great films like these anymore or is it just a two hour watch-and-judge campaign these days because that's the easier path?) is an incredible accomplishment of writing and direction by Steven Gaghan. The subtle, chilling and emotionally involving score by Alexandre Desplat gives the brilliant performances great depth and when this well-blended into the film, usually goes unfortunately unnoticed.I am East Indian myself and did understand some of the Urdu, but the lack of subtitles was possibly the most effective aspect of this film. When I watched the scenes spoken by the Arabic and Pakistani characters, their body language and facial expressions did all the translations needed to send the message.An incredible film, easily amongst the tops of 2005 and the best "political drama" in years. What people are seeing lacking in this film must be out of any preconceived notions they had going into it, but hey, these days people will find things wrong with a baby's smile.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary and realistic view on what the world is becoming...and has already become.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana is a blisteringly, powerful film about the degree to which governments and corporate entities place on the ambition to control the world's oil supply above the well being of their citizens and employees. In this game, there are only bad guys, and what separates the villains from the protagonists is not a question of who's good and who's bad, but rather how bad each is willing to be. There is no point in trying to summarize the film as a whole but rather to summarize each plot thread individually. So maybe Syriana doesn't tell us anything new. But that doesn't mean that it is a dead subject. On the contrary, we need to be constantly reminded of these very real facts of modern life. And although it is complicated, it's not that hard to follow. Stephen Gaghan is an excellent writer, and he provides a nice summary of the film's action in its final the final, and very dramatic, scene. What emerges from this tangled puzzle is a web of corruption and self-interest, all fueled by the need for oil. In one plot thread, the men behind two soon-to-merge oil companies will stop at nothing to make the merger go through, since the new company will be one of the most powerful in the world.In another thread, the law firm representing the company proves that it's eager to cash in on the company's new economic success. Meanwhile, a power struggle between the two sons of an aging king in an unspecified Middle Eastern country (although Saudi Arabia is suggested) has attracted the attention of the American government, operating through the CIA agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney who begins to discover some very undesirable traits about his employers which leads him to be put under investigation. America has a vested interest in which of the king's sons succeeds him to the throne: It doesn't want the reform-minded eldest son, whose priorities will be building a country to benefit his own people; it wants instead the younger son, who will continue to relegate his country to a cosy spot in America's hip pocket and take its orders directly from the president of the USA. Further more, an up-and-coming oil broker (Matt Damon) faces an unimaginable family tragedy and finds redemption in his partnership with an idealistic Gulf prince who happens to be the reform minded elder son, Prince Nasir Al-Subai (Alexander Siddig) of the ageing King. And in the film's most chilling plot strand, we see how the struggle for oil feeds the radical Islam movement in the Middle East, providing young men with a feeling of brotherhood and righteousness in the face of a region they feel has turned its back on them in favour of big business and Western corruption. Syriana is tense, fast and furious. Following it can admittedly be somewhat exhausting, but if you pay very close attention to the first hour or so, as each story is introduced and the relationships between characters become clear, the second half of the movie is easier to digest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film if your in the right frame of mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw Syriana in the cinema whilst on a trip, I had never heard of the film before, but it was described to me as a terrorism based, action thriller, I immediately imagined s.w.a.t teams bursting threw doors guns blazing, bombs booming and people dieing, so I switched off the part of my head that helps me think and went into the cinema hoping for violence.After the first scene or two I began to understand George Clooney's role in the film, but after the introduction of the other main characters (Matt Daemon and Jeffrey Wright) I began to come confused, they seemed to not interact with each other, and it became obvious that there was three different stories going on all at the same time, and without enough time to try and figure out what was happening it was easy to become irritated and start to dislike the film, this may be a technique deliberately used by the director, but can be frustrating if your trying to enjoy the film. I also found it hard to distinguish between characters, which also became quite annoying when trying to link the stories together.But I'm not about to say the film was bad because I wanted to see a action film, it wasn't bad, it was just hard to understand. My advice is if you are going to see this film, make sure you are in the right frame of mind before doing so. As a film (rather then a story) it was fantastic, great use of cinematography, and the confusion placed upon the audience is very clever. I just feel that in the right mood this film can be one of the best. It was hard for me to be shocked by what I was seeing when I really didn't want to be shocked by what I was seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, in spite of many flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite a number of contrived plot devices, and some questionable casting, this film works as a thought-provoking political thriller. It manages to deliver its message, which in very simplified terms is that demand for oil is dictating reckless U.S. foreign policy. It's a lot like the movie "Traffic" but about oil instead of drugs...I particularly thought the death of Bryan Woodman's (Matt Damon) son was overly-contrived, just to set up Woodman as Prince Nasir's economic adviser. That was too convenient, and I almost stopped watching the film because of that.As for the casting, Clooney is very good, as are a number of the other key players. But it seems to me that Christopher Plummer has played the "pure evil" role in about 300 other films, and Chris Cooper's "good ol' boy" act is getting very tiresome. Meanwhile, great actors like William Hurt and Jamey Sheridan were wasted in small roles.There is also surely enough that the U.S. has done in the Middle East to make a great non-fiction political thriller, rather than this fictional -- albeit plausible -- film.Still, the film manages to hold up, and the ending is bleak. Such is the direction in which our foreign policy is leading us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but flawed ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't agree with all of the premises of Syriana; nevertheless I thought it was a fine, engaging piece of film making, which showed the courage to ask hard questions that most supposedly 'topical' films don't. If I have one gripe, it's that the movie needed to work dramatically as well as polemically; for the most part it did, yet the ending undermined it. The film makers wanted a big climax but forget to make it consistent with the rest of the intricate story. The reason that Clooney's character is framed as a rogue operative is that his CIA cohorts don't want it to be suspected that they were behind Clooney's failed plot to assassinate an Arab leader. However, they then decide to assassinate the same Arab leader (Alexander Siddig) in a completely blatant and traceable way by targeting him with a satellite guided missile. Yes it sets up a taut ending: Clooney realizing Siddig is not the terrorist he'd been led to believe tries to avert the killing; but it makes no sense and for an otherwise intelligent thriller this was a let down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many movies dare to show political reality? The last worthy political drama, err documentary was Micheal Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 in 2004 that dared to talk about GWB. How many film-makers actually dare to allow the download of the entire screenplay on its official website giving out the entire plot? Only someone truly gifted like Stephen Gaghan, the writer director of Syriana has proved himself yet again after he scripted the Academy Award Winner 'Traffic' in 2000 can do it.Syriana is an intriguing political drama set in the Middle-East in a backdrop of a High-Profile merger of two US Oil companies Connex-Killen with substantial interests in Oil Exploration in the desert nations. The drama gets complicated with US Department of Justice initiating a Due Diligence into the contract, a succession struggle between two Arab princes, one forward looking and another a US Puppet and a veteran CIA operative looking for a meaning into what he has been doing all along.Syriana had many layers into it, each carefully scripted to ultimate detail and reason. Each character has a reason that's carefully interwoven to affect someone else's life, most evident being that of the Paki youth who lose jobs due to the merger and their meeting with a cleric. Academy Award Winner George Clooney who put on 35 pounds for his unglamorous role did exceptional yet understated role. Syriana is not for those who like happy endings or fantastic surrealism, but recommended for those with a taste for realistic drama, a portrayal of World today which is all about Money &amp; Power.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a must-see for everyone who wants to know a little more about the world of big oil and the situation in the Middle East. But only to find out in the end that nothing is ever what it seems. If you have preconceived ideas about what is the only correct way to go about above-mentioned situation, then you will not see it as it is: a non-political, non-blame movie. Everything is looked at from different perspectives without connecting those perspectives into one, definitive conclusion.This movie requires both stamina and a little insight into the workings of macro-economics, but if you possess both then you are in for an amazing movie, both visually and contextually. I liked the fact that the Iranians spoke Farsi, the Pakistani Punjabi (I'm not too sure, though), the Arabs Arabic, the Swiss French and the American English. It gave the movie a sense of being a documentary instead of a motion picture.The acting on all parts was outstanding, the different sets were refreshing, the lighting was superb and the sounds quality (very soft and gentle for the most parts) reminded me of another "quiet" movie: Erin Brokovich.So, in conclusion, go see this movie, it is worth your time and attention!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great political movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie yesterday not really knowing what to expect and was totally absorbed into the very contemporary script with all of its contemporary political machinations. The first thing that struck me was the extraordinary way the film was shot-the small scenes that were on the screen for what seemed like seconds before a new scene, different in chronology and/or geography took its place. I was completely absorbed in all that was happening on the screen, the avalanche of images just kept coming with hardly a break to absorb all of it. This is in no way a negative comment because this extraordinary pace became one of the signature features of this remarkable movie.I confess my ignorance in most things cinematic here because I am unsure where the director's motivation entered the movie making process and where the editor's judgments came to the fore. Who ever deserves the credit, let them take it because that exceptional pace of the movie was the one thing that remains with me and will remain for many months-if not years to come.As a viewer I think that you will be taxed to follow the unfolding story. I say this because by the end most of the dispirit pieces fall into place but of course viewers don't necessarily realize this while the story unfolds. The actors that carry this unfolding story are brilliant. Their presence is the glue that holds this fast, complicated story together and they keep it together very well. The many secondary roles also hold the story together by filling in the myriad pieces beyond the "big" action by the primary roles.This is a fabulous, taxing movie that should be watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Than Politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Gaghan's "Syriana" is an exercise not only in global politics surrounding oil (and consequently the money and power it creates) but the people that are victims and perpetrators of the game. Told in a series of interconnected stories (think Crash but with something important to say), "Syriana" follows Bob Barnes (Clooney), a CIA agent that is caught up running arms and more, but is given up by the agency after a botched operation. We're introduced to a merger between a large oil company that's lost a big contract to China and a small oil company that somehow has been able to acquire rights to a large oil field that will reap the company billions. Bennett Holiday (Wright) is part of the government's Justic Department tasked with trying to determine whether the merger is legal, and most importantly, who must take the fall in order to ensure that the merger succeeds. Finally, Bryan Woodman (Damon) is an oil strategist who has become the right hand man to an oil sheik after the death of his child earns him the obligation. While oil is the central figure, it is the circle of life that it feeds that makes the movie enjoyable and important. Strong performances across the board. Production value could be better but overall is strong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney deserved an Oscar-nod (and the statue) for his work on this government / capitalist anti-oil drama. With strong performances by almost everyone involved, its not a movie for everyone, but it is an enjoyable piece of work. There are a few slow moments that should have been edited out, but in general the pace works well. The movie follows the lives of several individuals and how they are all intertwined in this global issue of oil and money: Bob Barnes (Clooney) is a CIA operative that's been left / cut-off by the department, Bryan (Damon) is a father who has lost a son and is trying to align himself politically with a man who could revolutionize the oil industry and his own country, Bennett (Wright) is investigating the merger of two oil companies.While many reviews have focused on the nuanced character of Bennett Holiday as the lawyer playing two angles and Bryan as the father who uses his sons death for his own gain, I see these as two different mentalities. I think the critics were overly grandiose in their praise.</fullReview>

Like Rachel Weisz (his 'counterpart': best supporting actress) both won for excellent films with a political relevance.Syriana is a wide-sweeping film, in terms of setting(s), filming, plot and relevance. The film has an authentic feel to it, and this is not only because of the preponderance of subtitles, and the boardroom scenes similar to those seen on the news and other programmes -- it has a familiar feel to it.Kudos on actors, who downplay their roles. Chris Cooper, Matt Damon, Jeffery Wright and Christopher Plummer give good, solid performances which are, if anything, understated.The international cast are good, too. This film may not attract the audience it deserves; the action is sometimes slow and measured, but (like The Constant Gardener) it is rewarding and well worth it. There are characters akin to real live Americans, like Cheney. (Thank you, Michael Moore!)and the film doesn't shy away from political questions.Thought provoking, a must-see.</fullReview>

Syriana is one of those, all too rare, films that not only bears repeated viewing, but probably benefits from it. I also appreciated the neat pre-empting of conspiracy theorists in the random nature of events toward the end of the film. I cannot urge people too strongly to see this film.

		<shortDescription>A good story buried here...somewhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over-complicated, convoluted and quite frankly confusing. Syriana's major fault lies not in not having a good idea, but rather having too many of them. This leads to a rather slow-moving affair, to the extent where after an hour of the film I still felt as if I was waiting for the film to start. There seemed to be at least four discernible plot strands within Syriana, each of which only loosely connected to the others. The story is also rather hard to follow, and halfway through I knew little more than it was something about a conflict of interests over oil rights. It was also hard to identify with any of the characters due to the fact that the majority of them seemed rather morally ambiguous. It wasn't that the characters were untrustworthy, but that their motivations were unclear in the first place.The most engaging performance comes from Alexander Siddig as the would-be heir to the throne of Lebanon, whose most noteworthy role prior to Syriana was as Dr Bashir on Star Trek Deep Space Nine. George Clooney has physically prepared for his role superbly by piling on the pounds and growing a beard that Santa Claus would be proud of, and to be fair to him it is refreshing to see him not playing the suave sophisticated type that is his usual role. Matt Damon though is rather one-dimensional, and Christopher Plummer phones it in. however this is probably the fault of neither actor, as in a convoluted script their characters are given very little development.I came out of the film scratching my head as to what exactly I had just seen. There is definitely a fascinating story buried somewhere under all the narrative, but to get to it probably requires a second, third and probably even fourth viewing - and to be honest, I don't think I could be bothered with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brave attempt which sacrifices entertainment to enlightenment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an art-house film dressed up as a political thriller. It is not easy to watch and demands intelligence, concentration and stamina from its audience. I left the cinema feeling a little disappointed, feeling that the bewildering complexity of characters and subplots had defied the editing process, that the film was too disjointed. It requires a second or third viewing. Yet it does sink into the subconscious and will leave a lasting impression on my psyche. It may become classic. Clooney plays the main protagonist, an experienced Middle East CIA field operative. Fluent in Farsi and Arabic, his knowledge is 'deep but narrow'. He becomes the suddenly awakened pawn and fallguy when a mission goes wrong. The film has a certain symmetry. It begins with Clooney assassinating CIA targets in Tehran. It ends with Clooney trying to prevent another CIA assassination. 'Decent', patriotic American agents like Clooney have become victims of a complex web of corruption and intrigue. There are no rules in this game of power, money and death. Corporate lawyers are as much 'foot soldiers' as the CIA operatives. Corruption and the charge of corruption are instruments of policy to subvert both foreign powers and also domestic competitors. Corporate bigwigs, political leaders and field agents are all potential sacrificial lambs. Knowledge is power and can be used against individuals as devastatingly as the missile which ends the film.The 'military-industrial complex' of which Eisenhower warned has become the modus operandi of the American political system. It now includes the oil companies whose activity is so vital to US energy needs. Governments cannot control oil companies but oil companies can control governments because the oil must be kept flowing at a reasonable price and profit. This end justifies any means. If the oil and gas stop flowing, it is Armageddon. Oil companies have effectively hijacked US foreign policy. All the rest is mere detail. American muscle is used against political leaders who threaten US interests. The CIA and Hezbollah have a working relationship. Iranian emigres and their US supporters are just itching to overthrow the Ayatollahs because 'the Persians are the natural allies of the USA'. The Chinese are now players in the oil stakes. Being a CIA agent in the Middle East is dangerous if you fall into the wrong hands: Clooney is tortured in a very harrowing scene which is not for the squeamish.The best and bravest part of the film is its attempt to depict a worm's eye view of poor Middle Eastern workers and to explore the motivation of suicide bombers. It follows the life of one young Pakistani who loses his oil job because of a merger, gets savagely beaten by the police of a corrupt Arab oil emirate, is befriended by a terrorist, 'indoctrinated' in a madrassa with the simple notion that Islam is a good under which religion and politics should become one, whereas the West is an evil which is poisoning modern life. His suicide attack against an oil installation is carried out with a US weapon which Clooney inadvertently allowed to fall into the 'wrong hands'. This emphasises the fact that the US weapons industry fuels the conflict. Firms that don't sell weapons don't make profits. Where the weapons end up is an impossible thing to control! Much of the dialogue is spoken in various languages of the Middle East with English subtitles. This gives the film both authenticity and also the feel of a documentary. The many characters are given short scenes in which to establish their various personae. The dialogue and acting are both superb. The 'Matt Damon family' scenes slow the film's hectic pace with the familiar and the mundane but a family tragedy echoes the capricious nature of the film's main theme. No one is in control of anything.The Matt Damon character explains how Arab oil wealth has been wasted and the needs of local people ignored. Attempts at reform in the area are usually blocked by the US. (Will the present US administration's new support for democracy in the area bear a less bitter fruit? The masses are not likely to vote for the rich elites whose corrupt and supine support of US interests have produced one of the greatest wealth gaps the world has ever witnessed.)Clooney's film emphasises this wealth gap. The opulent waste of corrupt rulers (one demolishes a magnificent palace in Marbella following a tragic accident) is contrasted with the extreme poverty of ordinary people and, especially, migrant workers. It is fitting that Clooney's other recent film, 'Good Night....' deals with the McCarthy era. 'Syriana' could not have been made then or just after 9/11. It does question the American economic and political system and the seeds which are now being harvested. It could be called 'Communist propaganda' and probably could not have been made if Communism was still perceived as the main threat to the interests of the USA. Political Islam has replaced Communism as the new perceived threat but both have a common origin: economic inequality and injustice. The USA is founded on narrow ideals of political freedom - an 18th Century pre-industrial Arcadia where everyone could have '40 acres and a cow' - Native Americans permitting, of course! It has yet to embrace the concept of 'economic democracy'. It offers 'riches or welfare' and has a Calvinistic belief in its Manifest Destiny under God. Clooney's film subverts this American self-belief. 'Syriana' is a brave film which tries to explore a complex political-economic system through drama. If it does not entirely succeed in what must be an impossible task it is not because it seeks to 'dumb down' but because it tries to tell the full complexity of the story. This is a noble and heroic project. It sacrifices entertainment to enlightenment but the subject is too serious for any other possibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brilliant political thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This great movie is about the network of corruption, policy and its power, almost like writer and director Stephen Gaghan describes it in his academy award winning script of Soderbergh's "Traffic". But in Syriana he focuses on the oil-mafia instead of the drug-mafia.Basically this movie is about the "global players", the men who take the stitches out of the background, but Gaghan does not forget to show the victims who sometimes become the wrongdoers themselves. Guest-workers working hard in producing oil for low wages get fired because the heir apparent Prince Nasir wants to give authorizations for producing the Arabian oil to the Chinese instead of the US-energy company Connex, which had them before. That's why Connex wants to take over the small energy company Killen, which just made a very profitable deal with oil from Kazakhstan. So the department of justice wants a lawyer's office from Washington to control this takeover. But what follows is everything else than neutral control. The attorney Bennet Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) gives as many information about the Killen's activities in Kazakhstan to the department of justice as they need to fool the public with the image of constitutional legacy without putting the Connex deal on any risks.A special character, but just one of them, is the Arabian Prince Nasir, represented by Alexander Sidding in a very charismatic way. He wants democracy and he wants his country to get rid of the economical American influences. Of course Washington cannot accept that, they'd rather like to see Nasir's younger brother getting more power. So they assign Bob Barnes from the CIA to kill Nasir. This CIA guy is played by George Clooney with impressive physical and mental charisma. Like almost all of the movie's characters also Bob Barnes is a mixture of good and bad: on the one hand he's a family father, on the other hand he's the loyal state controlled killer. Last but definitely not least there's Matt Damon, who's performing in his well known, competent way. He's playing the analyst Bryan Woodsman who gets the offer to become Prince Nasir's personal assistant, after his son died because of a very tragic accident at a celebration in honor of Prince Nasir.Syriana is a very special political thriller. The dramaturgy is complex and because of that it seems to be confusing at the first view, but it's totally logical and realistic exciting. The script is fantastic and the actors are in a brilliant shape. When you don't understand everything in the first time, go to see it once more, it's worth it!Syriana is a real cinematographic highlight!And by the way, we can finalize, that George Clooney has become one of the best in Hollywood. He is now in the Bush era, what Robert Redford was in Nixon times: a great, political ambitious and courageous actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one great political thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, first born son, is patiently waiting to take over his dying father's oil company, located in the Persian Gulf. Nasir dreams to reform his country, creating a Parliament, seeking equal rights for his people. Employing energy trading consultant Bryan Woodman, Nasir aims for the most profitable path, increasing the rate of his dream. Bryan starts to question his work, after the death of his son at a party, held at Nasir's home. The mined oil connects with long-time ties to American company Connex. Smaller oil company Killen, plans to merge with Connex, set to reap massive profits. Head of Killen, Jimmy Pope has received rights to oil fields in Kazakhstan. Connex wanting this merging just as much as Killen, able to expand their production capacity. Raising suspicion, the Justice Department investigates this merger between Connex and Killen. Attorney Bennett Holiday is hired by Connex and Killen, to keep the Justice Department happy, till the completion of the merger.Seeking the highest profits, Nasir decides to cut this connection with Connex, planning to deal with China, outbidding America. Dean Whiting, head of law firm Sloan Whiting; which Bennett works for, realises the compromising position this holds for America if Nasir deals with China. Dean attempts to make Nasir's brother Prince Meshal the predecessor; envy of fame and power, cowering easily to Dean's and Connex's demands. CIA agent Bob Barnes, is given his last undercover assignment, to assassinate Prince Nasir. When one of Banres's contacts turns against him, the assassination fails and the American Government turns their heads, using Banres as a scapegoat, to cover their motivations.Screen writer Stephen Gaghan has ventured to uncover the world of corruption on petroleum, like his script for Traffic, uncovering the world of drugs. Using multiple characters and complex story lines, (which is confusing at first), Gaghan shows the political agendas from every side; America, Arabia, the workers and the people pulling the strings from behind the scenes. There has been so much smoke and mirrors surrounding the debate of control over the worlds most profitable resource and who reins control. Based on Robert Baer's book 'See No Evil', Gagher has cuts straight to the core of the situation, revealing the curtain on what is really happening. Gaghan's direction takes a slant towards documentary style; camera shaking between characters and scenes, conjures a realistic manner, you feel that your right in there with these people.While the political side of Syriana can confuse and fly off on a tangent, grounding it are the character's dilemmas caught in the web of this corrupt game; humanizing what could have been a dry political film. Each character fights for their best interest, many taking extreme measures to realise them. While there's corruption in the mild east, the government has control of the regulation, which many profit from and aim to keep this from changing.Putting on a lot of weight for the role, George Clooney brings a such a strong performance. Matt Damon seems misplaced as Bryan, you don't see a lot of grief for a man who has just lost his son. Jeffrey Wright also brings a strong performance, though just falls behind Clooney. Stand out is Alexander Siddig as Nasir, showing such pain and determination for his dream of a free country. In their supporting roles, Chris Cooper, Amanda Peet and Christopher Plummer are all great.While the story and plot of Syriana may be contrived and hard to follow, the core of this film is the real pay off. The story is just a vehicle to pass the message on, and what an eye opening message it is, finally blowing the top off this corporation corruption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complicated, but immensely enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people may look at the credits of Syriana, see Mr Clooney's name prominently on top and wonder why he is only up for a Best Supporting Actor gong. The simple reason for this is that there are so many actors in this movie- over 70 with speaking roles- that Mr Clooney's story, although important, is not the story and so he spends only about a third to a half of the movie on screen.Syriana is about the murky world of oil and how the most valuable resource on the planet's seems to move mountains. The whole plot; and the strands the come off it center on a merger of two oil companies. Corruption, assassination and back door deals are rife. I could go on about all the plots in this movie, but suffice to say that it is a movie that looks at all aspects of oil dealership, and that is what makes it truly unique. From the story of the Pakistani family who find themselves out of work to the political manouvres of the law firm to make sure that the oil merger goes through.This by no means a perfect movie, as there are times where you find yourself wondering more about the characters that sometimes take a back seat and the motivation of characters sometimes gets lost in the epic storyline. But this is a movie that will give so much if the viewer is prepared to put some concentration into watching it. The cast is fantastic, particularly Clooney as a FBI agent and Christopher Plummer as a truly slimly, but somehow elegant law CEO. This is truly a movie that needed to be made, and it has been made at just the right time with just the right points in mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana is both ambitious and demanding; plot is gripping and divided into subplots perfectly combined, screenplay, along with the Middle East setting, is impeccable. Very different than other espionage thrillers, not only because it contains deep reflections on our reality but also for being accompanied by reflections and mind stimulations. Acting's convincing, clarity in telling facts is total and plus it's more detailed than any other geopolitical flick I've ever seen. It aims at showing the marriage of global business and politics, together with US interference in every dirty affair. From top to bottom a must-see movie..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holding up the mirror to show the age and body of the time his form and pressure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hamlet summed it up rather well when he talked about the purpose of playing, "whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own image, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure" Syriana holds up the mirror to the very age and body of American culture and finds much worthy of scorn. The only virtue we see reflected here is that of a mid-eastern emir-in-waiting (Alexander Siddig) who seeks to promote the welfare of all of the subjects he is intended to rule. Of course such notions, that endanger the salary hikes of American company directors, mean that he has to be eliminated. And if good old-fashioned bribery and corruption are not going to attain that purpose, then high tech, government operated killing machines can be pressed into service. The only other virtuous party (read virtue as honour devoid of self interest) is Hezbolah. They are depicted as continuing the traditions of chivalry their ancestors taught to the barbarian European crusaders in the middle ages. This is revolutionary stuff. Think about it. George Clooney plays a government employee who kills civilians (and emirs in waiting) and sells weapons of mass destruction. Think mirror ? think Al Quaida attack on an American ship in port. All his working life he has been used by and he probably never knew what for. If it was for the betterment of his family, his son has him sussed as a liar not worth spending any time with. And when he seeks to avert the evil that is about to take please he is impotent. Matt Damon plays an intelligent and likable consultant, whose employer will make millions from reports that sprout that "consultant speak" like "optimising the outcomes by strategic placement of emerging opportunities." Granted, what Damon's character says seems to make sense, a matter that does not go unnoticed by the emir-in-waiting, whose beliefs and ideals are mirrored in the advice being offered. But it all ends in Damon's character crawling from the wreckage and slinking back home to a child who has not yet picked up on his mother's acceptance of the idea of 'life without dad'. Is this a call for return to the policies of pre-World War Two isolationism? And then there are the government and business company men and women whose actions reflect the line, "Corruption is our protection. It's what keeps us safe and warm. We have laws about it precisely so we can get away with it. Corruption is how we win." And to keep it all in balance, let's not overlook the unsavoury depiction of the recruiter of suicide bombers, or his less than inspiring victim, who seems to be more concerned about employment opportunities than with the grand scheme of fighting against the evils perpetrated by latter day crusaders. The morning after seeing this film, I heard a programme from Colorado's excellent Alternative Radio organization, in which Naom Chomsky expressed with rather more intellectual precision the ideas so stylishly portrayed by Stephen Gaghan's writing and direction. Gaghan's "Traffic" script used a similar approach. Introduce the viewer to the characters in chance encounters, just as would happen in real life. Gaghan turns his back on that appallingly hackneyed, first-half-hour-of-the movie character development parodied so mercilessly by Zucker, Zucker and Abraham's "Flying High". Having big name, charismatic actors alleviates any real problem for the viewer in navigating through the narrative. Like life, this is haphazard. It develops in fits and starts, often with no immediately apparent rhyme or reason. I am tempted to suggest that there must be hope for any culture that can hold up the mirror to its values in the way Syriana does. But then I am forced to admit that America re-elected a president who reflects the interests so scorned by this film, even after the Academy gave the nod to Michael Moore's cinematic antics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crowded, confused, convincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a well made thriller ? Tom Clancy with something to say ? with a multi-track plot and fine performances from many of the huge (over 70) speaking cast. The ending, like "Arlington Road", is rather melancholy. The confusion caused by inter-cutting between the different plot strands and the many characters does resolve itself in the end but it also blunts the message. The assassination scenario and the terrorist scenario have only an incidental connection (the same Gulf state is involved) and there is no dramatic confrontation between terrorist and victim. Stephen Gaghan the director and writer, wrote "Traffic", a complicated but mostly successful expose of the drug trade and he has adopted the same crowded, complicated approach here. There are some nice set pieces eg Tim Blake-Nelson's Gordon Gecko-like oil company lobbyist's spirited defence of corruption ("it keeps us safe and warm"), Christopher Plummer's put-down of the not over-bright younger Arab prince, and Matt Damon's arrogant but regrettably correct analysis of the prospects of desert society after their oil runs out. There is only one significant female role (Amanda Peet as Mrs Damon) - oil is a men's business.It's not really fair to criticize a thriller on the grounds of historical inaccuracy ? it is enough that it be engrossing enough to suspend our disbelief, and this film certainly is. Yet, having recently in the line of duty plowed through a weighty tome on relations between the US government and the oil industry over the last 80 years, I am aware that the oil industry does not always get its way with the government, and vice versa. Also, it is true that the CIA was involved in assassination attempts on foreign political figures (Castro from Cuba and Lummumba from the Congo for example) in the 1950s and 1960s, as a former director put it "with remarkable lack of success though not for want of trying." All this came out in US Senate Committee hearings in 1976 (the Church Committee). But since Gerald Ford was president assassination has ceased to be government policy, mainly because it was seen as ineffective and unpredictable, even with the high tech approach shown in the film which is nearly thwarted by a flock of sheep. The background to all this is set out in another weighty tome "The Agency" by John Ranelagh (1986), a book the Israeli government obviously hasn't read.George Clooney's performance as Bob the washed-up CIA agent is truly wonderful ? I loved the bit where he wanders nonchalantly past the Peugeot (containing two arms dealers) he has just blown up ("who me?"). He's got the Oscar as far as I am concerned. Of the rest, Alexander Siddig as Nasir the reformist prince and Matt Damon as Bryan the energy analyst stood out, the first for his intensity and the second for playing against type. Christopher Plummer always makes a great villain and does so here ? he has the best heartless grin in the business.The editing is pretty well perfect, which is absolutely crucial in a movie with as much pace and action as this one. I'm surprised Tim Squyres was not nominated for an Oscar. Although there is a big bang in the film it is left to our imaginations ? the final motif is the anti-climactic yet entirely appropriate one of getting home after a hard day at the office.There will no doubt come a day when we do not need to fight wars over oil, but don't hold your breath. Personally, I am looking forward to the day Canada is annexed by the US to secure its access to the second largest oil reserves in the world, the Athabasca tar sands. I've always thought the Canadians too smug by half because they aren't Americans. Prince Nasir is blowed if he can tell the difference. But then Bob Barnes isn't really a Canadian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this movie is good, and I'm not talking about the plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm disappointed this movie was not nominated for Best Picture. For those who seem confused about what the point of this movie is, read on. It's hard to fathom a world where things do not appear as black and white, but this is the world we live in. Our current administration has used the tragic events of 9/11 to paint an "us against them" mentality that has polarized our position away from the rest of the world and facilitated Americans to turn a blind eye to what's really going on. The fact of the matter is, our enemies are not a group of psychotically deranged terrorists, hell-bent on killing every man woman and child, they are equally politically motivated as we are. They resort to such abhorrent measures like suicide bombings and hostage beheadings because those are the only means available to them. Furthermore, consistent with their own environment, they do not place the same value on human life that we do and consequently they do not fear death the way we do. Anyway. . . Syrianna strikes at the center of this dichotomy of cultures by showing that the plight in the parts of the world that harbor terrorists is connected with our own country's exploits and opportunism. I agree that globalization is good, but the point of the movie is that our own actions that may benefit all Americans facially do have long term consequences that are only foreseeable to those who have the power to do anything about it yet don't care because of their personal incentives to let someone else worry about it while they profit. It would be no understatement to say that members of our government are part of this effort, as demonstrated in the movie. Bottom line is we all have to be more cognizant of the actions our country takes around the world. These international, foreign actions are how the world judges us; not Mom and Pop operating their convenient store in Anytown USA. It is of the essence that people hold our government accountable, only through transparency can we assure credibility. Currently our government goes to great lengths only to present an illusion of doing the right thing without doing the right thing at all. I am not some flaming liberal, I just have a very firm grip on reality. So, if you didn't "get" the movie, watch it again, and think about how important it is that everything is more than only tenuously connected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The end of "Syriana" says it all. The rest of the film was leading up to it, chopped up vignettes with a bearded Clooney as a CIA hit man.The movie ended with a young, idealistic looking Arab, pointing a motor boat with a bomb aboard, heading toward a huge oil tanker in the Persian Gulf.As the case for the suicide bomber developed throughout the film, it was shown how corrupt were the American oil billionaires and their diabolical relationship with the corrupt oil sheiks, who live in luxury while poor Arab workers, unemployed because of an oil merger, languish on the desert sands, playing pickup cricket on a desolate field with high rises in the distance.The poor, downtrodden unemployed Arab workers are the bottom of the food chain, and understandably are prone to fundamentalist Muslim jihadist rhetoric. Blowing themselves up for Allah is their only chance at glory and redemption.There are two Arab princes. Which one is to become the next Emir? One is scum of the earth, not fit to run a brothel, no less a nation. The other is educated and idealistic, and if he succeeds his father, will use the oil money to build an infrastructure and raise the standard of living for his people.Of course the Emir knuckles under to the oil conglomerate because he prefers to retire in luxury in Europe! He has no use for bettering the lives of his people.Translation--- America IS THE GREAT Satan. CAPITALISM IS EVIL. The suicide bombers have no other choice.If you want to see another Hollywood left wing film, go for it. "Syriana" is yet another of Michael Moore's ilk, Hollywood's disingenuous attempt to turn American politics around, to poison the audience's mind against the current administration, suggesting that this WWIII is nothing more or less than our 'addiction' to Middle East oil.No mention is made of the alternative, the corruption of the so-called idealists, who seek to change human nature by force and oppression. The Soviet experiment speaks for itself.We Americans enjoy our freedom and prosperity. Too bad protecting it involves sordid undercover operations. Considering the alternatives and the lesser of evils, I'll do my share of gas guzzling until energy alternatives become available, as most certainly they will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ninety minutes' worth of story in two hours of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film really wanting to like it. I'd heard great things, and I was interested to see how the film would deal with the very complex topic of politics and oil in the middle-east. I walked out very disappointed.The story is great. There are enough twists and turns and there's enough emotion involved to really propel the story forward. The direction, however, hinders that forward motion. Instead of concentrating on the narrative drive, the film seems more interested in taking a series of detours through the details of the characters' lives. It slows down the momentum of what could've been a great thriller/conspiracy tale. Instead of wondering what was going to happen next, I found myself guessing which character would be the next to preach about US foreign policy, wondering if the actors found this scene a challenge to play, and trying to determine if this dialog would go on long enough that I could get some more candy from the concession stand and be back before the next real plot point.The cinematography, however, did help keep me awake- fingernails on a chalkboard often have that effect. I'm sure the director was thinking, "Let's give the movie a realistic, documentary-type feel! It'll add some immediacy to the whole thing." Heaven knows we need some immediacy with the meandering pace of the film. But this misguided notion led the filmmakers to shoot the entire movie with hand-held cameras, which detracts from the shots, distracts from the action, and at times even disorients the viewer.These two problems, though they did, in fact, ruin the movie for me, don't completely destroy it. If you can stave off drowsiness and motion sickness, the film still has plenty to offer. All of the actors are quite good in their roles. The plot, though it unravels slowly, is fairly compelling, and the film makes its points about foreign policy and greed and all fairly well. The script is strong, the emotional impact is there, and (other than the camera-work) the movie is well-made. It's just boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oliver Stone without the Cartoon Plot and Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ripped from the headlines" is the cliché of the day for Syriana (though Syria never figures into it as far as I could see)but it doesn't require much of a conspiracy theorist to see connections between the U.S. Government, the big oil companies, the Gulf sheikdoms and Islamic radicalism. The story is told in fragments layered on top of one another -- subplots adding up to an explosive, oil-filled cocktail. George Clooney stars as a grizzled undercover CIA operative who divines what's happening and suffers for it in every imaginable way, including in one of the worst torture scenes ever seen on film (outside the home videos made at a U.S. run prison in Iraq). This is not Oliver Stone at his paranoid worst, which is worse than anyone else's paranoia. This tale is more than just plausible; it can be found on the op ed page in most major American newspapers. In other words, guys and gals, it is received wisdom in the homes of a good many blue state Americans (and, increasingly, in the homes of red state Americans). All it lacks is Vice President Cheney playing puppeteer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2005 has been a blockbuster year for George Clooney, who won heady praise for his writer/director/producer role on "Good Night, and Good Luck," and for his performance as CIA Agent Bob Barnes in "Syriana," a collaboration with Stephen Gaghan (who scripted the similar "Traffic"). Clooney isn't the lead actor, by any means, as the film possesses an enormous ensemble cast of actors, including Matt Damon, Alexander Siddig (I loved DS9), Christopher Plummer (it's always terrific to see him), and Jeffrey Wright.The plotting of "Syriana" is murky, intentionally so, although it isn't nearly as difficult to follow as so many people seem to think. Many of the exact details of the international syndicate's actions remain undefined, but their general aim is clear, and motives are easily inferred.While Clooney is getting most of the 'buzz' this awards season, Alexander Siddig's excellent turn as Prince Nasir (his second character of that name this year) is perhaps even better. Nasir is an idealized reformist character, but Siddig makes him believable, and you truly want him to succeed, even as it seems clear that he won't. It's interesting to note the differences between this and Clooney's other political film; GNaGD argued that good men, like Edward R. Murrow, could topple villains like McCarthy if they stuck to their principles; "Syriana"'s ultimate message is that we're probably screwed, regardless of what we try to do, because the problems of the world are beyond anyone's ability to solve. Depressing, but almost sadly realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engaging, but flawed movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The multiple, interwoven plot lines are a bit hard to follow at first, but if you pay attention, by the end of the movie all the connections click and you quickly realize, the movie has fooled you into thinking it's all much more complex than it is. Any confusion the movie throws at you is more the confusion of the characters caught up in the mess of it all, which I'll admit, it's successful at conveying. Oddly enough, the two "lead" characters if you will, of Matt Damon and George Clooney, seem rather underdeveloped and shallow. It's hard to even call them lead roles though, as this movie stars with it's story, not any one character within it.It's kinda slow, but I was enjoying watching it unfold - That is, right up until the convenient and predictable ending. Clooney's character makes a complete and sudden 180 without proper motivation or build-up. I'm sorry but I just can't buy it. Further, despite many liberals (and I consider myself to be) insisting this movie is about the corruption of the oil industry, trying to cast light on a "dire" situation American's aren't paying attention to, I feel quite the contrary. This movie more-so highlights the obvious that we all know anyway: Big oil plays dirty. Woowoo... Well who knew? To the director's benefit, I don't recall him or anyone involved with the movie ever claiming to to deliver anything new or enlightening, it's more the hype that got going around it that got up and ran with this whole informative and liberating fiction idea.Overall, a semi-entertaining, but flawed ride. I'd recommend it half-heartedly for being an engaging espionage plot, but don't expect to be in awe of any revelations and please, don't take it too seriously and read a lot into it. The CIA and mega-corporations engage in covert stuff - This isn't news and nothing presented here is new. I'd have to say anyone shocked by this movie really needs to get out and read up more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that deeply interacts with the OIL disease that infected our world, a disease that makes every wrong to be right, makes raping people minds and souls an easy fact of life that we should do everyday. direction is great, the acting is beautiful specially from the non-English characters although that not all the points of view are discussed in the terrorism matter, but at least it doesn't try to lie on us and say that all Muslims are terrorists the duologue between mat damon and the Arabic prince about what the Americans want from his father (the king) is brilliant and truly summarizes it all. at last i don't really know if the silence of George cloony's character at the end of the film for this whole period which could be used to save him is right or not. but at the bottom end they will get to him one way or another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are no certain words to describe the power with which this movie captures the many levels of the human experience. This movie does not revolve around so many different themes as it is portrayed to. It appears more on the whole as a demonstration of what happens in the world around us. I find this movie to be fiction yet if one were to watch this movie without having any knowledge of the situation in the Middle East for the past 20 years; it would appear as a non-fiction movie.All of the characters involved have a special part to play in this tale of corruption. The basest needs are met here as we follow these doomed souls to show a story of tragedy on so many levels. A son is lost, a family is murdered, and we see the most horrible of sacrifices, suicide. Yet this story stays away from any kind of overtone that corruption only fuels terrorist actions. It instead shows that corruption fuels the greedy and lonesome alike; things that were no longer possible, and of course things that have come to pass.Blood. Oil. Money. Power. Sorrow.Syriana cannot be defined or kept in bounds by any one review or perspective. The best part about this movie is that it can be understood differently by many different people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bob Barnes: loyal CIA operative to the end (an argument)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: Nobody I have talked to agrees with me.My argument is that Agent Bob Barnes deliberately halts Prince Nasir's caravan in order to make it an easier target for the U.S. missile, and in so doing, end his life having served his country and proved his loyalty.The story of a CIA operative who, after twenty years of faithful service, suddenly decides to swap sides, simply doesn't wash, and Gaghan is far too clever a screenwriter to allow such a cliché. Barnes could not have possibly prevented the assassination by doing what he did, and he would have known it. Fuirthermore, when Bob returns home after being tortured, he never asks why he was tortured or even who was behind it. He assumes he already knows the answer: Prince Nasir.Instead he wants to know why he is "being investigated." It becomes his mantra, in fact, and he is never given a straight answer. After years of never questioning orders, Bob becomes desperate to clear his good standing with the organization he has been faithful to his entire life, even at the cost of his own life.His motivations include revenge, of course, and this is the key to the final moment between him and the prince. Had the prince been in any way involved with Mussawi, he would have immediately recognized Bob as the man who tried to have him assassinated in Beirut. But no, he only recognizes him as the Canadian he met in the elevator.In this scenario, Bob's final thought before the missile hits would be, "He's innocent. Oh my God, I'm killing the wrong man."Take it or leave it, the script's ambiguities certainly leave room for such an interpretation, and I can only conclude that this is deliberate. After all, it ties in quite nicely with one of the film's primary themes:Never assume you know who's working for who.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good story but too much motion to watch comfortably</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you do not have a problem with motion sickness, you will enjoy the movie. If you do, be prepared to look away. The film is shot very close up with a lot of motion. Both of us left the theater feeling sick. Sort of like the first 10 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. The story is well done and all comes together as the movie develops. George Clooney is a convincing CIA special agent and the message of the movie is easily understood. I would have rated the movie higher if I was able to watch easier. Also, since there is some subtext, you are forced to actually look at the screen even if you are trying to take a break from the instability. I do not know why directors do this to their audiences because I do not find it effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oil Is Not Well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If "oily Arab" was once an insult referring to a Middle Easterner's complexion, nowadays it should truly be considered the highest compliment, pertaining to certain Arabs (via birthright and political wolfing), controlling the fortunes of the planet Earth via oil.If there is an overarching message to this movie's madness, it is that everyone else on Earth, in their methods to obtain that oil, displays a savagery no different than the sociopathic desert-dwellers in *The Road Warrior* who would sacrifice their lives, loved ones and integrity to get their hands on "the precious juice". (To wit: the American military is shown identifying a vehicle from an orbiting satellite and blowing it up with pinpoint accuracy, in a government-sanctioned murder, to retain a corporate stranglehold. Does no one else find it extremely disturbing that not only do they have the capability and impunity to do this, but that our knowledge of this crime in no way brings those culpable closer to punishment?) Whereas the *Road Warrior* wastrels targeted small supplies of gasoline for the short-term resources they yielded, now we deal in whole nations of subterranean crude, corporate decimation of livelihoods and premeditated killings the dialect of political *coups* that guarantees the black gold flows into the pockets of those with ? as in *The Road Warrior* - the grandest killing technology. Blink once ? and the plot of *Syriana* will tear by you like a bullet-train. But the plot is a McGuffin. (I imagine the Real World's corporate collusions work in much the same way. Left hands not only do not know what Right hands are doing, sometimes Left cuts off Right to spite the Torso.) Inspired by Robert Baer's book, "See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism", Director Stephen Gaghan uses the neck-snapping plot line ? crash-cutting across numerous scenarios that play out very separately, marginally inter-relating - to illustrate how oil machinations on a global level affect lives on a personal level.George Clooney - unrecognizable beneath hermit-friendly facial hair, a cultivated paunch and an absence of comedic head-waggling - is Bob Barnes, a government contract killer miles above your average mafia hit-man, who has never cared to question the reasons or motives behind his job ? until now ? when a hit he is assigned goes awry and his employers try to discredit and discard him, inspiring in him a cause for living - or dying, whichever comes first. (A torture scene involving Clooney rivals the level of discomfort ? for the audience ? as that of Dustin Hoffman's "Is it safe?" scene from *Marathon Man*.)Matt Damon (playing dead straight as Financial Analyst Bryan Woodman) lands a hundred-mil contract with Prince Nasir (played with grounded sympathy by Alexander Siddig) under the most inauspicious of circumstances: as recompense for the accidental death of his young son in the Prince's palace pool. Jeffrey Wright (as lawyer Bennett Holiday) is assigned to forage for evidence of corruption in an oil-related corporate merger. As obvious a joke as this may seem - the word "corporate" these days being tantamount to "corruption" - the reality is darker than Bennett or the audience can fathom: as a shareholder accounts to Bennett (paraphrasing his monologue): "Corruption isn't just a way of life ? Corruption is what makes life in the First World possible!"William Hurt, fast becoming the Christopher Walken of cameos, here supplies a Deep Throat presence for Barnes.Intersticed between the clam-chowder-thick political meandering, a human resonance is defined in subplots involving father-son relationships with each of the main characters, and how the Oil trade decimates those relationships; particular poignancy in the motivation behind young, disillusioned Muslim, Wasim (Mazhar Munir), jobless due to the corporate merger, and inured to his father's empty promises of a better life, latching onto a holy reason for living (or dying, whichever comes first). As he relates in a recorded video testament, "Let it be known I died pure in spirit."As it happens, Barnes also finds the same peace in the climactic finale, the movie wrapping with reconciliation for many of the characters. After the challenging, disjointed plot line refusing to infantilize its audience with pat expositions disguised as character dialogue, the ending itself became too pat. The tragic reality is that this unholy plotting and sanctioned high-level murder goes on at all, under the veneer of reciprocal altruism, religiosity and supposedly intelligent bureaucracy. And it continues even as you read this, unresolved, unceasing. A two-hour movie cannot even scratch the surface? We ultimately reach a quandary of ideology: if both sides (American and Middle Eastern governments) are prepared to forgo their religious and political beliefs to conspire in assassinations that eliminate business obstacles, then why exactly are they on opposing sides? Because both sides somehow idiotically believe that in the long run they may somehow tilt the balance of power in their favor. How they would manage to achieve that in a closed supply-and-demand system is anyone's guess?And we thought only mohawked, leather-chapped, chain-wielding, ambiguously-gay road warriors behaved with such imbecility.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All for the oil...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic, in my opinion was a great film, and many others worldwide would agree with me. This film, however, is indeed worthy of recognition, but reveals the brutal truth of not about drugs, but with an accurate depiction of our own oil companions!First off, the film starts off with a CIA operative named Bob Barnes (Clooney) accomplishing another mission for the CIA. Shortly afterward, he is called on a mission to assassinate a middle-eastern prince (Siddig), who is planning on a coup to take control of his dying father's nation. Little does Bob know that everything he has worked for in his life is withholding secrets from him.Meanwhile, a business analyst (Damon) and his wife (Peet), are dealing with a tragedy in their family, but the analyst is called on a special deal that can make him and the middle-east wealthy. With the help with the prince (Siddig) who has been targeted by the world as a threat can do this, and fulfill his true dreams.Then, a man named Bennet Holiday (Wright), is sent by the government to an oil company that has been under suspicion of giving bribes to the middle-east. As this investigation takes plsce, this same oil company has fired many employees in the middle-east. Two of these unemployed workers fall into a bomb cell, and decides to follow their divine will for Allah.The stories unfold with three, breath-taking climaxes that left me dazed. Overall, the acting was well-chosen and played, even though the subtitles became a pain in the butt, the editing was not too choppy, making the story understandable, and the music made the film more moving, especially at the end of the film.**** out of ***** The film is very important and authentic with the world's oil crisises today. its' true...its all for the oil!-Corruption os why we win!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The latest few reviews that I read, consistently refer to one of the characters as an Arab or Palestinian. The young man who gets recruited into a terrorist cell was shown to be a ex Patriot Pakistani working in what I believe to be a Saudi state. This is clear from their dress, language and accent. Thought I would correct this misconception.I personally thought the movie was good. It had its flaws but rarely does Hollywood succeed at making a movie that so clearly captures what I believe to be a fictional yet accurate portrait of world events and cultures. I think Clony did an excellent job with his character. The main message is very clear like some others have pointed out yet there still seems to be some ambiguity in the purpose of some sub plots. Overall a very different experience from your average Christmas time movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Clooney is not a good actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hear a lot about George Clooney. How well dressed, good person, great actor, etc etc. But I dismiss it. Nothing I have seen him in has made me think of him as a great acting talent. Quite the contrary, I think he is not and this film is but one of the latest examples.Syriana is a political thriller that has to do with nothing but oil. Everybody wants a piece and everybody has a price. No good guys or bad guys. Funny thing is, not everybody wants oil, contrary to what this film says, but that is but the beginning of the end for this movie.Beyond George Clooney, we of course meet Matt Damon. Damon is one of Clooney's buddies and has to appear with him in almost every movie he does. But beyond his family that he has trouble keeping together and his relations with the ruling family, I did not see anything of value in his role.This supposed geopolitical thriller isn't totally out of the park on oil, but missed the mark widely. Yes there are some people like that in the oil business, but not as nearly as much as there used to due to political and popular scrutiny.But the biggest thing of all is that this film is utterly SLOW. I have seen Pokemon movies that move faster than this. It never really developed a plot nor did it even come close to an ending that made any sense.I guess Clooney movies are supposed to be slow, inept, and just plain suck. This one sure does.

At the beginning of the closing credits this statement appears: "While inspired by non-fictional work, this motion picture and all of its characters and events (except for incidental archival footage), portrayed in it are fictional." What is meant by "..non-fictional work..."??? It appears to me that the crew that put this movie together is saying that there is an existing work that has facts that prove that the US Government has approved mergers that otherwise would not have been approved, but were only after senior advisors and higher-ups within the companies are sacrificed to the US Justice Department for their wrong doings (influencing foreign governments). Additionally there are facts that prove that the mergers are responsible for spawning terrorism. Finally, most incredibly, there are facts that prove that the CIA influenced kings to pick pro-American successors and that the CIA has assassinated would-be kings in order to place pro-American kings on the throne. Is this the kingdom of Saudi Arabia they are talking about? Anyone who doesn't no better would believe this crap! Thank God, we are learning not to believe everything movie makers and actors are saying while using what should be a means of entertainment to spread their own propaganda. This is a free country, and thankfully we are free express how we feel when we see crap like this and we are also free to turn these movies off!

		<shortDescription>Clever and thought provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana is an attempt to explain the relationship between the U.S. and the oil-rich Arab countries. The movie presents a world where U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East is mainly about keeping the oil flowing. Syriana is a fictional state, modeled probably on Saudi Arabia, where the CIA and the large oil companies have an interest in preserving the status quo. Syriana is about to get a new leader (Alexander Siddig) who has been educated in the West (Oxford, Georgetown) and wants to end his country's subservience. The U.S. intervenes and uses its influence to replace Siddiq with his younger pro-Western brother. The movie is written and directed by Steven Gaghan who adapted the movie Traffic from the British mini-series. It adopts a similar quasi-documentary style with several competing and inter-related story lines. George Clooney plays a hard-bitten CIA operative who has an epiphany and wants to do the right thing. Matt Damon is a brain for hire who helps and advises the trouble-making prince (Siddig). Jeffrey Wright plays a lawyer who faces a moral dilemma as he confronts corruption during the merger of two large U.S. oil companies active in Syriana. Mazhar Munir is a Pakistani worker who falls prey to the recruiting efforts of a militant Islamic cleric, and is told he will go to paradise if he becomes a suicide bomber. The movie is complicated and you need your wits about you to follow what's going on. The message of the story is that U.S. energy companies,law firms and government are in collusion. The movie implies that Arab leaders are corrupt and installing puppet regimes is likely to turn encourage anti-Americanism and militant Islam. The movie shows the nasty ark secret things that are done in our name to keep us in the style to which we have become accustomed. However, as long as the U.S. remains addicted to oil we are probably stuck with the current policies and the movie doesn't present any plausible alternatives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie although I really like George Clooney and Matt Damon just got me a bit lost. It had some good messages about the greediness of oil companies and America but just didn't link the story line together enough. I was left wondering throughout most of the movie - "What just happened then" and "who is that and what are they doing?" I prefer a movie that is a little bit clearer rather than being quite vague. It wasn't just me either as we heard several people after the movie questioning what actually happened and who particular characters where and what were they actually doing. Matt Damon plays his usual type character and George Clooney is good although I am left wondering for most of the movie what role he has in the story line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So oil is a powerful political tool?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gary was in town, so thought we'd go eat some burgers and catch a flick. He suggested some movie with a pretty vague description, which is normally a worry. I suggested "Munich" which he wasn't keen on, then "Syriana", to which he said "yeh, that might be good". So we headed to TGI Fridays, had some burgers, and then went to Jam Factory.The movie is done by the same guy who did "Traffic", and from what I'd heard this was a similar movie, except swap the drugs theme with an oil theme and the gangsters with white collars gangsters and a few terrorists. The movie seemed to have about 12 stories going on, focusing on about 12 characters, so it was pretty damn confusing for the first hour or so, but there was enough to hold my interest.Eventually the stories intertwine and it all starts to make more sense....but where's the point? I'm no major political buff, but don't most people know oil is a tool of great political influence? Don't we know there's corruption going down, workers are getting shafted and terrorist groups are exploiting this? I'm all for movies being used to make us think, but this movie to me stated the bleeding obvious. "Traffic" was much more thought provoking, maybe the oil thing should be lef to the Michael Moore's of the world. My friend Gary may have some quirky movie tastes, but I generally trust him to know if a movie is solid or not, and this bored him, so.....A few other points:-What is the directors obsession with laying present audio over past tense imagery? It just got crazy? -What was the big deal with Clooney putting on 30lb for the movie? (A) he didn't need to (B) I was more focused on why he wore that jacket the movie, especially when he was in the heat. -Matt Damon's best performance since "Stuck with you" -Movie would have been way better if Clooney's character wore disguises, kind of like "Fletch"</fullReview>

Who's right?* Did you notice that the older son of the Emir, the one who was looking to the long term life of his country, was setting up for a coup? And that the United States took him out? And, if we speculate, the US would have likely painted him as a tyrant dictator if he had succeeded. So, he gets assassinated, the US gets the younger son, and the Middle Eastern goes back to killing each other for food in a hundred years, like Matt Damon's character predicted.* We never saw the mastermind behind the terrorist mullah in the work camp. But, we didn't really need to, did we? We saw lots of other power players.* Is US policy really the best policy?* You did see that the missile launcher used at the end of the movie was the one sold by the US at the start of the movie, didn't you?* The aphorism about a story having three sides, his, hers, and the truth, assumes only two players in the story. The story in the movie had at least 10 players. The stories in the Middle East have at least 30. What is the truth there, really? Does the US know? Iraq? Iran? Israel? Kuwait? How many oil companies are fighting for a piece, world wide?* So, my take on the movie's message, is that the situation in the Middle East is not nearly as clear as many people, including many people in the US government, would like us to believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fiction Not as Horrific as Truth Where Greed for Oil is Concerned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who is the biggest terrorist in the world? George Bush et al. What is the largest terrorist nation in the world? My country, the U.S. of A. This gives you just one window into the corruption at the top of our government and reveals what anyone with some intelligence knows: that the corporations run and have ruined our government. I thought of Pres. Eisenhower when the C.I.A./Army/Oil executives all get together and kill a few Arabs and Americans with a very clean surgical missile strike. What makes this movie less horrible than reality is that we do this weekly, and have been doing it for 5 years. Remember, we were bombing Iraq long before Madman Bush got around to declaring war.....something by the Constitution he is not allowed to do. But since our sheeple don't learn History or Civics, they don't know that it's Congress who must declare war by stipulation of the U.S. Constitution.Acting great and so real. Having worked for Raytheon, I've watched the corruption of the sweet-faced young engineers, as they jockey for position in the climb up the corporate ladder. Just as the Cosa Nostra requires a 'hit' before you can be a good fella, same is true here. The well-dressed good ol' boys with their sweet family life and great family values are every bit as lethal and cold-blooded as the Mafia dons.Beautifully depicted by the Nelson actor, who I last saw in the Clooney convict comedy with the great country music. Together again. The Colin Powell/Condosleezy Rice Uncle Tom is well depicted also, although I don't understand yet the part of the older suit-clad black man, hanging around his Georgetown apartment. Maybe he symbolizes his deadened conscience. As SEn. Heflin once told me, "A senator isn't bought at once. In fact, he might have been elected on a reform ticket. First you take the small gifts, then the large ones, then the trips, then buy the house for way below market value thanks to your lobbyist buddies and voila: you're bought. When did your conscience get so bruised, it became totally numb, then died? No one can tell.Watch a similar transformation in this movie. The coincidence of the American and the Arab dying at the same time makes for great theater and good reason to consider the difference between a good American and a good Palistinean, both soldiers. Be sure and immediately see "Munich" for an idea of the ties connecting murderous acts universally and in time. What goes around does indeed come around. Or as some of my favorite authors stated, "Whatsoever ye sew, that ye shall also reap." The immutable laws of Nature (aka God) are shown working their inexorable way to the climax.We haven't changed much since crouching over, clutching our clubs. We have just become better at killing greater volumes of people. HEre you see the close relationships between the top movers and shakers of the U.S. and the oil-rich sheikdoms. And similar levels of barbarism, just dressed differently.Some questions still arise. Did Matt Damon innocently give up his seat to the sheik's wife and child? Or was something more malevolent involved? It appears obvious to me that since the 80s, we have trained a large number of killers, American mercenaries who go to church and kill just as devotedly as do the Muslim 'terrorists' do. This movie shows you how difficult it is to draw the line. And why when you first turn on the radio, you don't know whether it is your own country that has insanely killed a bunch of people or the one we're today calling 'our enemy'. Democracy being spread? What a laugh!!! I was wondering when Hollywood would finally get around-- if they could get through the censorship from the corporations that own us--to revealing the savage lethal insanity of the illegally seated Bush junta as being played out in the MidEast. This is one way, stressing that the movie is 'fiction'.Hah!!! Follow this movie up with "Why We Fight", an excellent documentary on our industrial-military rulers, and see if you still think we live in a democracy/republic. At Raytheon, I learned that to stifle competition you buy up competing companies and bury their product. Someone needs to produce the next movie on how all the wonderful renewable sources of energy developments are being similarly bought up and buried so that their greedy amoral pockets can become even fuller. I wish there had been room for some allusion to that in Syriana, but it's already richer than most undereducated Americans could comprehend or value. But there IS a lot of bang-bang in here :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie with blood and brain.an dense plot story with no guide or help , sending you direct to a oil platform and suddenly right away to American usual family day by day,and again another twist put you in the middle of the Persian Gulf.Great history...great actors.....Clooney in a superb work...pay attention to this movie. By the way, i don't think that American will like a lot of this because it shows how some instances of the government can make some thing not quite different from terrorism. a movie to think about... a story to talk about... Oscar chances? Really? i don't think so not because the movie,but because the Oscar...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Clooney Hit, another important film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana is today, it is real, and it is well acted, well written and powerful. It is basically the story of how oil, big oil companies and the US government control parts of the world, people and economies all in the name of energy; mainly oil. And it is about the people in the region caught in the middle with their own agenda ? good or bad.The film is shot in semi-documentary style similar to that which Clooney used in Good Night, Good Luck. He draws on that experience and while not over doing it, does it well. He plays a role as a CIA agent in the Middle East who is going through a change of life, questioning himself, his motives and his involvement with his own country and what he has seen it become. While his is a strong and important role, he is not the main character.All characters play equal and equally important parts in this film. This is hard to do without slighting anyone but Clooney does it masterfully. It is truly a strong work but shy of calling it a work of art. It is brutal, it is honest and is based on events we all see everyday in the news.His friend and working actor Matt Damon plays an important role not unlike his other characters Clooney has had him play previously. This one is much more serious however.This story centers on a small oil company gaining the rights to an oil kingdom's fields when there is no way it could have pulled it off. It had help and from the beginning merges with another oil company to keep its end of the bargain. The deal is predicated on the simple decision the kingdom has made to sell much of what it has to China. China, having an economy growing at a rate faster than any other in the world. It will grow faster only if it gets more oil.Eerily in recent weeks China and India (in real life) signed a deal with British Petroleum to take over oil fields in Syria, thus providing those two hugely consuming nations key access to middle eastern oil. Did someone on the writing end of this movie have some inside information, or just some good insight to what was about to happen? Not likely but it is extremely interesting on the timing.Getting back to Syriana, make no mistake about it, this is a politically charged film with an agenda. The agenda is defensible certainly and I see it as an important film for the new century. The side story of a young Pakistani man working in the oil fields losing his job (because of the China deal) and being led onward by Moslem extremists is frightening in itself. The real life drama being played out in Syriana is most moving and very disturbing.I recommend this film to anyone and everyone. It is intelligent, well acted, very balanced in the story telling and quick paced. It is the quickest two hours you will spend. Clooney has two masterpieces on his hands this year. I don't say this very often but given the choice he is one of two directors I personally would like to work with. The other being Ron Howard.They have become two of our very best. We need more like them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie -I hope to see it again soon...but for now I will read the reviews and chuckle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a great movie, with strong plot lines, good acting, emotional punch and a bit of a message thrown in for good measure. Its themes of greed, nationalism and religious zeal would seem to be the most prominent, yet in truth it is a story of manipulation. The story does a very good job in giving a 3 dimensional picture of a suicide bomber and if it seemed apologetic I expect that is the result of his being genuinely human. I hope to see this movie again soon , but it may be a while. In the meantime I am actually enjoying the reviews here on IMDb more than usual. I especially love reading those by the folks who hated the film. Hmmmm... Some folks complain about it being liberal propaganda and trash, others complain that it was too hard to follow and one even reviewer commented that there were too many subtitles. Reviews tend to say as much ( if not more ) about the reviewer than the movie, so these can really make for high entertainment. I recommend sitting back and reading them for a smile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Syriana" is as byzantine as any film you will witness in 2005. It is also an intriguing maze of interconnecting story lines that all leak into the global struggle for oil. Writer-Director Stephen Gaghan does not pull much of a "gag" order when he wrote up some convoluted political scenarios which most probably will have people talking. Gaghan, who also won an Academy Award for scribing "Traffic", does have his liberal backers that think that this "Trafficman" should be a "gridlock" I mean a lock for another Academy Award screenplay nomination for "Syriana". The film's tangled web of political narratives include a veteran CIA Field Agent who is entrapped by his own government, an Oil Trader who suffers a traumatic personal loss and later counsels a Gulf Oil Prince, and a unbiased Washington Attorney who is unwillingly oiled I mean embroiled in a controversial oil companies merger. The film's cast is stellar. Most notably George Clooney as Bob Barnes, the CIA Agent ; and Matt Dillon as Bryan Woodman, the "noble" Oil Trader. Many filmgoers will read into these "Barnes &amp; Noble" poignant characters. "Syriana" is a seriousana film with political agendas that sporadically oil spills the assumption of the eventual demise of oil accessibility for our world's nations. "Oiliste" bien? **** Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just because there's hardly room for argument, doesn't mean its complicated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once in a while we see a film that entertains and stimulates thought. Not necessarily answering any questions, but perhaps suggesting that there are questions among us that need to be asked. This is Syriana, a film by the creators of the Academy Award winning drama, Traffic (Steven Gaghan and Steven Soderbergh). The film is adapted from "See no Evil", a novel written by former CIA agent, Robert Baer. Syriana reels audiences in through multiple story lines that are convincing and relative to our current social crisis. And for those who would rather believe there is no crisis, the film can present an alternative perspective through it's attempt to express how the arrogance of world powers like the US, can effect people in less developed societies. Syriana is set in an oil-producing country off the Gulf, where its prince prepares to succeed his ailing father. Envisioning his country further developing and moving towards complete independence, the Prince abandons US interest in his country's oil and pursues a higher offering from the Chinese. Connex, a Texas energy plant subsequently looses oil-drilling rights in that region. In efforts to preserve productivity, Connex sets out to merge with Killen, a smaller Texas oil company. A speculative US justice department then sends in a major law firm to investigate the legalities behind the business deal.Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) enters as lawyer on the case. His boss, Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer), head of the firm, is adamant on ceasing the Prince's mission with the Chinese. Whiting begins to convince the Prince's sick father to choose the youngest and less mature of the sons to succeed as ruler. Blind to his father and youngest brother's interactions with the US, the Prince continues to prepare to be ruler and throws a party at his estate. At the party, a tragedy occurs where a young boy accidentally dies. The boy happened to be the son of Energy analyst Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon). The Prince empathetically offers Bryan an astronomical business deal and builds a relationship with him that clarifies where he wants to take his country economically as Prince and future ruler. However, the pact the Prince made with the Chinese consequently terminated the jobs of numerous laborers that bussed daily to the secluded desert energy fields for work.This leaves Pakistani workers like, Wasim (Mazhar Munir) and his father, Saleem Ahmed Kahn (Shahid Ahmed), hopeless. Soon Wasim's anger would elevate to find him in a madrassa (an Islamic school for Muslims, just as parochial schools for Catholics) where he experiences support from those with similar realities. Once there, they are in the cunning hands of a dangerous Egyptian recruiter bearing a massive weapon he surreptitiously received during an indirect transaction involving veteran CIA agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney). Barnes floats through the story constantly on assignment, nearing retirement, and ignorant towards the true motives of the US government, nevertheless, he takes strong pride in serving his country.Syriana illuminates the loom of capitalism, and how it weaves our realities of dependency into something that can leave each of us as both oppressor and sufferer in our social dilemmas. To the average person who pays the least bit of attention to current events while carrying the most basic understanding of history, the film offers nothing new. However, there is a pleasure we receive from just experiencing how things work. In that respect, this motion picture becomes entertaining in its ability to express the intricacies of economics, ethics, and people in a globalized society. Syriana portrays a world where everything is connected and while feeding on ignorance, corruption makes the world go round, leaving viewers with the question: Can my beloved government only be getting better at getting worse?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Bullseye, but hits the board</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 7 of 10 rating is on the mark. This is a good movie, but it is not all that it could be or maybe should be. It weaves an intricate web that for most will take repeat viewing or pre-viewing prep to really get it all. In that sense you are left to compare your version of the puzzle with those of your viewing mates. That is something I liked about this movie. It really makes you think, but it requires that you pay attention and not let the little points pass you by or you will be without the needed pieces. What I did not like is although the movie is complex, it is complicated by thin character development because you can't stay with one long enough to feel them out. We are left to read between the lines if you can remember which lines to read between. And while you are looking for the unifying theme (other than oil) you get entangled in the big conspiracy. But there seems to be a distinct flow in the movie logic - Greed begets corruption. Corruption begets compromise. Compromise begets betrayal. Betrayal begets hopelessness. Hopelessness begets martyrdom/terrorism, take your pick. In general it makes the world at large seem very bleak. Yet, while nobility does get smart-bombed, Hezzbullah has an honor code or political savvy, take your pick, all is not lost?If you like cerebral and suspenseful thrillers, you'll like this movie. But to remind you (or show you) of what they were trying to achieve, take another peek at Traffic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had somewhat high expectations going into this movie and I was for the most part not disappointed. Yes, there were a couple of rough edges (the "corruption keeps us warm at night" speech) but for the most part a very engrossing film. I think to really appreciate it, you need to understand a bit of what life is like in other parts of the world. For example the horrible treatment of migrant workers-- its funny how many Gulf nations on one hand lament the plight of the Palestinians, yet treat them and many South Asians (the laborers who become suicide bombers in the movie) like slave labor. If you understand that context as well as how oil money has a tremendous influence on politics (Robert Baer's book gives a fascinating and unique perspectives on this) I think you will really love this movie. If you don't watch the news and are not up on middle east politics, you might find it confusing as the subtleties will be lost on you.But what about as a film itself? Context aside I think the Gaghan did a pretty good job with the medium and the overall production of a very ambitious 2hr film. In many ways, I think this would have been a better 6hr mini series (much like the original Traffik -http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096716/) but he does do a good job with the big screen. There is certainly enough material for it and would have given him more of a chance to flesh out the fascinating back stories that he just so much wanted to tell-- in some cases too much so. The story of the dead child for example perhaps I would have cut in order to focus more on the principle characters. Despite these minor issues, a very engrossing film, I will for sure rent to watch again when it comes out on DVD-- hopefully with another hour of material that was cut from the theatrical release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess Roger Egbert found this movie puzzling and wants clear-cut bad guys and good guys. However, as a person who grew up in the city where many of scenes were shot, it is a refreshing to see an accurate portrayal of the attitudes and life in the Gulf countries. The premise for the movie regarding oil-deals may seem over the top, but in reality such things do happen. George Clooney's acting was excellent. You are not served up every boring detail and hence keeps your mind occupied. None of the good-guy/bad-guy drama with American cliché's etc. The director/script writer or who ever is responsible for the story is either knowledgeable about the region or researched it well.Watch it, its good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana is a montage of exotic locations, intriguing situations, and engaging characters. It suggests of numerous geopolitical relationships and conspiracies without spelling them out. We get impressions that suggest that U.S. foreign policy follows oil, that assassination is one of the tools of the trade of U.S., that the Agency has no loyalty to its agents, that agents have latitude to engage in many kinds of mischief, and that terrorists can be easily recruited from expendable laborers. The impressions go by faster than we can contemplate them. George Clooney dedicates himself both behind and in front of the camera to a taught, fast-moving drama that becomes cinematic haiku. It suggests rather than expresses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best spy thriller since Three Days of the Condor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most Hollywood spy movies are about as realistic as an episode of Alias. Syriana is on a completely different level. The political situations feel realistic and the matter of fact way in which the complex multi-faceted story unfolds adds to the realism. I have not felt drawn into a conspiracy in this way since Three Days of the Condor.Some reviewers have complained about the difficulty of following the story but this should not be a problem for, say, fans of The West Wing since that is a place where political complexities are dramatized with this level of sophistication and terse dialog. I found the entire story line fascinating and the political points thought-provoking. * Character development takes a back seat. Since no one characters seems to get more than 20% of the screen time, We never really identify with anyone -- with the possible exception of the Washington D.C. lawyer 'investigating' the oil company merger. * The sound track is minimalist. There is no background music to add tension to scenes or to cover up noisy theater patrons.It is interesting to contrast this approach with the first person approach of Three Days or of the recent excellent conspiracy movie, The Constant Gardener. Both methods are highly effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Stephan Gagghan has done an excellent job in portraying the kind of atmosphere in the countries in that region: workers in the oil industry , the Pakistani guys , etc...A story with 4 different story lines is definitely incredibly hard to write. He mentioned that he has spent 21 months, 7 days a week, 15 hours a day on research and writing the first draft. Despite the fact that it's a well written work, there are points that might be clear to the writer but no as clear to the audience. I was not sure why Clooney should relocate to Islamabad, why he should lie about who his wife was to his son, why Matt Damon char should leave his family for the Nasir, why Clooney stopped Prince car...One interesting fact that the writer mentioned was why this movie is named Syrianna.Based on him, after 9/11, there has been plans to change the map of the world by attacking Iran, Iraq and Syria and make all these three countries one on the map called Syrianna.</fullReview>

Clooney and Matt were at their best. Alexander Siddig was great in his role as the sheik. Although Amada Peet had a very less role, but her expressions were lovable. In total if you know the Asian language(especially Hindi and Arabic) this movie rocks. Some small flaws were there, but guess director has his own reasons for keeping them in movie.The movie runs in different bits and pieces and finally glues together.

		<fullReview>Syriana could have been an excellent movie rather than just a very good one by simply adding a few narrative nudges. I was prepared for the difficulty of comprehending it and turned up my attention in anticipation of grasping multiple plot lines but I finally had to give up on a few of them.With that said, I still was able to follow the main themes and appreciated its technical strengths; strong acting, directing and writing. Some may need a second viewing if they want to sort all the plots out - which for me is not a negative thing. Many good films require this.In the end I was wrung out and disturbed for reasons that I am very familiar with so in that sense it didn't break new ground. But the film revealed itself very effectively (and thus was very entertaining) and therefore might serve a higher purpose for those who have not considered some of the subtexts behind our gluttony for oil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since King Kong was sold out I went to see the next one in line for the holidays that interested me. I must say that most reviews are spot on, this movie is not for all. If you have a hard time following the most simplistic plots, you will bug the person next to you until they tell you to be quiet or sit elsewhere. It shines a lot of light on politics and how us Americans basically control the oil industry either from a political standpoint or for the good of a consumer. I did enjoy this movie but would much rather have rented it on DVD. I am not a big movie theater guy unless the production is an absolute must see, on the big screen. This one is not one of those. Plus at home you can pause it and have time for your brain to catch up and also to take a break because if you leave to get popcorn for 2 minutes, you will have missed enough to never fully understand the movie. I recommend it when you feel ready for politics and to put on your thinking cap while watching at home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stephen Gaghan has written and directed Syriana. It boasts a fabulous cast headed by George Clooney (Bob Barnes) and Matt Damon (Bryan Woodman) as a CIA operative and an oil broker respectively. Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Peet, Robert Foxworth and Christopher Plummer round out the multi-national cast. The four major plot lines are difficult to follow and merge in a crashing climax. Along the way the viewer should bring a pad and flashlight to take notes because the film asks many more questions than it answers clearly. Maybe a narration would have helped. I know filmmakers don't like to use that crutch, but it certainly would have helped clear up some of the confusing holes in the plot. The most interesting plot concerns a young Muslim who is brainwashed into being a possible suicide bomber. This was an issue better handled in the film "Paradise Now". Nevertheless, the performances are top-notch and the production values high. One thing is for sure. If you go to see the film with others, you will have plenty to talk about after the film is over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's impossible in this space to lay out the plot for "Syriana," but it is possible to say why this film works so well. Like "Traffic," this film is not so much a single story as a series of interlocking and overlaid stories, all of them revolving around oil and the places where it comes from. And like "Traffic," this film works so well because it's so complex. There are no truly good guys, and many of the bad guys demonstrate at least some redeeming qualities. (There are some exceptions.) And there are no easy answers to any of the many problems raised by this film, so the filmmakers don't offer any. They just force you to think.

		<fullReview>Syriana delves into the inner workings of the oil industry and sets out to illustrate its impact on every level of society.The film consists of many stories that develop throughout the movie and ultimately come together in the end. A young, ambitious economist (Matt Damon) is eager to assist Prince Nasir in his efforts to revolutionize his country, whilst a veteran CIA operative (George Clooney) becomes entangled in a web of conspiracy over a foiled plot to assassinate an Arab Prince. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, a suspicious merger between two oil companies has aroused much controversy and a young optimistic lawyer is recruited to investigate. Amidst all of this, a young Pakistani oil worker is led into a path of hatred and coerced into sacrificing himself.Syriana looks at how the world is connected through the oil business. At its core, it attempts to illustrate the effect that a tradable substance of value, such as oil, has on society. In a world where human life and social responsibility come second to economic security and prosperity, oil is at the forefront of decision making in many elements of society, and Syriana attempts to convey this message through a series of interconnecting stories focusing around one period of time and influenced by one important commodity, oil. Whilst this concept of film making is by no means a 'novel' approach, ("go" and "babel" spring to mind), Gaghan does a superb performance of bringing the multiple story lines together. The film requires undivided attention to fully appreciate the connections between the stories, however viewers are rewarded for the efforts as the links unravel towards the dramatic climax. The film illustrates the profound differences between cultures as men on one side of the world negotiate billion dollar mergers whilst, on the other side of the world, hundreds of employees are left without work and struggle to find meaning in their lives. The performances throughout the movie are superb with Mazhar Munir brilliantly portraying the thousands of workers that are displaced as a result of the greed within the oil industry. An unshaven George Clooney delivers a performance unlike any role he's played before as the veteran CIA agent that is struggling to unravel a web of conspiracy and coverups surrounding him.The music throughout the film is minimal with a simple piano piece repeated throughout the picture. The film begins and ends in a similar fashion as the pace of the movie slows down completely from the roller-coaster ride that we witness throughout most of the picture. Large desert shots work effectively at both the beginning and end of the film to demonstrate both the lack of emotion that the oil companies have and the feeling of emptiness that the thousands of workers that are displaced by the relentless efforts of these companies to achieve greater profits.Syriana is both an insightful look at the profit-driven oil companies and a terrifying look at the impact of multinational billion dollar companies on every level of society. The film has been brilliantly put together and director Stephen Gaghan delivers 100% in a genre of film that he's all too familiar with. However, the film is slightly let down by an overly complex story line, and many viewers will leave feeling dissatisfied and confused.Its unfortunate that more films like Syriana aren't able to be produced. A must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The illusion of due diligence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of things to admire about this film. The location shooting may not be scenic but it's instructive. The goat-herding bedouin seem organic to the tawny and treeless landscape. The bloated oil tanks and the black empty ribbons of highway seem imposed on it.The acting is pretty good. I couldn't find a flaw in the casting. The score is suspenseful without being bombastic. There is a horrific scene of torture and the anticipation of death, involving the most realistic beating I've ever seen on the screen. It doesn't last long, and it doesn't have to. It recalls the cutting off of the captive cop's ear in "Reservoir Dogs," only the director here doesn't seem to take the same kind of glee in the depiction of suffering. The theme is relevant and ambitious -- oil corrupts, and absolute oil corrupts absolutely.The script, though, put me to sleep the first time I tried to watch the movie. It takes a while to sort the characters and their motives out. Novels, including the one this story is based on, can afford complicated multiple plots and subplots. And to be honest, more often than not "major motion pictures" made from novels tend to prune out all the obfuscations that might confuse an eleven-year-old mind. Usually the result is good guys vs. bad guys with a lot of gunfire and explosions in slow motion. Oh, and a nude babe lurking somewhere in the background for when the action slows down.The problem with "Syriana" is the opposite. The subplots are woven together in a way that's not easy to follow, and the motives of the characters are more hinted at except in a few cases of flagrant finger pointing. It isn't that a successful movie can't be made out of diverse points of view centering on an important issue. "Traffic" did it quite well.If there are identifiable "bad guys", they're American oil companies, the law firms that represent them, and the corrupt Emirs in the oil-rich Middle East who sell out to them for personal favors. There's another murderous organizational entity involved too. SOMEBODY blows up the reformist Arab prince and the American who is trying to save him. And the organization is an American one with access to spy satellites and guided missiles. I just can't figure out which organization it is. The American Civil Liberties Union? The Boy Scouts? The Little Sisters of the Poor? It might have made a good mini-series. Or it might have made two or three compact and cogent features. As it is, though, things are so squashed together that we can't really get a good handle on all of it. I don't, for instance, have any idea of what Matt Damon's character's motives might be. Is he an idealist? Or is he, as his wife claims, parlaying the death of his six-year-old into a position of influence. Both? That would be a nice touch, but then we'd need to know a little more about how he handles it.Bonus point for a tense script about conflict in the Middle East in which not a single shot is fired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Citizen Kane of our times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A superb film, and a magnificent introduction to the problems in the Middle East. It does not take sides, it cuts open the political cant with a scalpel, not a hatchet, the film has more finesse than a rant from Oliver Stone, and reveals that there are two sides to every conflict. In this respect the film is a breath of fresh air. Consistent and at times unwatchable, it gives you that queasy feeling that you just may not be on the side of the 'good guys'. Frankly a brave movie to make, especially in the current political climate that exists in the US, every bit as subversive as Citizen Kane.Don't trust the normally reliable ratings here, its actually an 8.8 movie, too many voters here just can't digest the message, and probably voted against it. I confess, I had some difficulty coming to terms with the 'point of view'. A courageous movie, well acted, well scripted, and well made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The messages of the film, along with its elaborate plot will stay with you long after seeing the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of 2005s most important and intricate films, "Syriana" paints a harsh picture of the dealings of oil companies with Middle East politics. An all star cast leads the show with George Clooney playing a disenfranchised spy, Matt Damon as a financial adviser and Jeffrey Wright as a lawyer whose job is to look for problems with a merger between two of the nations largest oil conglomerates. The film starts as fractured short stories that eventually intertwine into the whole film. The complexities of the plot are too detailed to delve into in such a short description; however, the messages are clear. Corporate responsibilities in a third world country where poverty and political unrest reside are very crucial. Also, the film is not shy to show the failure of governments to recognize the needs of their own people. Corruption is the name of the game. As Wright's character soon finds during his investigation of the merger, corruption plays a key role in the winners and losers of any major economic or political battle. As a political insider says to him, "Corruption ain't nothing more than government intrusion into market efficiencies in the form of regulation." While watching "Syriana," I felt glued to the story. The messages of the film, along with its elaborate plot will stay with you long after seeing the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie and I would recommend it. But, if you are going to go see it, I would go to the movie website (http://syrianamovie.warnerbros.com/synopsis.html) and read the plot before you go because the plot is very complicated and hard to follow. It is a very intelligent film and doesn't create the usual ridiculous good guy/ bad guy delineations that most movies create (thank God). It instead aims to focus on the complex interweave of governments, rulers, the proletariat working in the oil fields, the oil execs, and the lawyers who shape the result of the oil industry today. It is a good movie, an enjoyable movie, and a well-made movie with good acting but as far as following the plot--let's just say that if you had a hard time following the plot development in "Glitter" or "The Dukes of Hazzard", you will not enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The world of oil comes full circle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana ****. Stephan Gaghan (Traffic) directs this take off of a book by Robert Baer. The movie tells a story about oil, and those things which are related to oil. From CIA assassinations, to corporate mergers, to corruption, to Middle Eastern Kingdoms, to suicide bombers, 'Syriana'shows the circle of life which has been created because of this black gold we call oil.There are multiple story lines here that are all connected in some way. George Clooney plays Bob Barnes, a seasoned CIA veteran in the Middle East. Matt Damon plays an American sent to propose a large deal for oil with a royal family. That same Royal family is being pressured by the US to make the younger, weaker brother heir to the throne so that they can easier exploit the oil reserves in the country. The older, stronger brother dreams of making his country stable and independent with a strong economy that will be no longer squandered. A deal between Damon's character's business and the family goes down, but only because of an unfortunate death due to a freak accident. Back in America, Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) attempts to get to the bottom of a corruption scandal in the oil companies which are seeking the rights to the Middle Eastern oil. Two young men take to the cause of suicide bombing and we are given reasons why, and what they are thinking to do such a thing.I could sit here for quite some time trying to intertwine and explain all the story lines in 'Syriana,' but it can all really be summed up by saying that it is a story about the effects of the oil business. The story told is jumbled, and sometimes incoherent, but works wonderfully. Life is jumbled and complicated, and even more so in such environments as portrayed here. It only fits that it be difficult. Another reason why the film works so well just as it is, is because of the performances here. Not only are the leads wonderful, but the smaller characters are fantastic as well. Everybody does their job to perfection here, and the payoff is gold. Everyone is their character, not someone playing that character. It gives a sense of realism to the film that is rarely found these days in most blockbuster films. Clooney, Damon and company do some of their best work. William Hurt, Chris Cooper, and Christopher Plummer are also very good here, and they make up some of those actors with smaller parts who came out and gave it their all. Particularly good, as always, is Tim Blake Nelson. He plays a corrupt business man who gives one of the most passionate speeches in defense of corruption you will ever see.'Syriana' has been accused of being boring and leftist among other things. I, for one, was never bored and I was captivated the whole way through. Is the film a bit to the left? I don't know, but everything we've learned about the corruption in big business, such as the oil business, is put on display here in pretty realistic fashion. The story is difficult to understand at all times, but just as in real life, we are not always meant to understand everything we see, but we are obliged to follow it and see it through. This is one of the best films of the year, and it should be seen more than once to grasp it a little better. If you don't like it at first, give it a second shot. A film this good deserves it.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its been several days since I saw this film and find that it not only is receding from my memory but that I also am less in love with the film; so much so that I dropped my rating down two points in the interim. When this tale of the Middle East, oil and the people who try to control both was done I felt that I had a great deal to say and I decided to wait until I found the words before I wrote up anything. The trouble is that days have passed and I find that the words have left me. I find that what I thought was an emotional response on my part was instead emptiness. While I was given much to think about, I find that I really don't feel passionately enough about the movie to explore the ideas presented. Hours after the film ended I no longer cared about it or its ideas. I find it sad that a film with so much important to say can erase any desire to go beyond the screen, or even revisit the movie. Don't get me wrong this is a well made movie, the problem is that when they filed it full of ideas they forgot to put in a heart.5 out of 10, a well made film of ideas that fails to engage your heart</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a complex, intricate, tightly-packed movie with an important message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like a movie that doesn't talk down to the audience and isn't afraid to push forward with touchy issues, this is going to be your cup of tea. However, viewers beware: the first hour is going to require some careful attention to seemingly unimportant details, and whatever one misses early-on is going to compromise overall comprehension of the plot later in the movie. That is simultaneously the mechanism for Syriana's greatest cinematic achievement and the deepest failing of the film. The earlier one figures out who the players are and what's motivating them, the more engrossing the storyline will be as it unfolds.Each scene is meticulously presented and follows reasonably from the preceding material, but many of the characters and themes are introduced exactly once. From then on, you're on your own, and if you missed something because you were reaching for the popcorn, well, you're going to be leaving the theater with some unanswered questions. This potential difficulty is exacerbated by the rapid-fire context switches that occur, which can zoom to the opposite side of the planet with a completely different set of characters operating on events in a way which may seem, at most, tangentially connected to the original topic.To understand the intricacies of the plot, one must be prepared to discard the usual notions of spoon-fed character development through repetition, and accept the job of piecing together, puzzle-like, the backgrounds and motivations from scenes as they occur. The reward for those who successfully undertake this mission is a sense of how people completely separated in social role, geography, ethics, economic standing, and compelling interests may be affected or outright intertwined by shared events and global phenomenon. This interconnectedness occurs whether the characters are aware of it or not, and whether or not they have any control over their circumstances, much as it does in real life. Each person's kindnesses or cruelties can have a far-reaching impact, outside the vision of the initiator, and no film I've seen has been as successful in illustrating this point as Syriana.All the aforementioned tangents do add together, their vector sum forming a clear direction of plot motion in which seemingly minor events are part of a larger web of causality. In order to establish this web in the finite allotted time, Syriana sacrifices some of the developmental conveniences to which many audience members are accustomed in movies for a detailed, densely-filled, far-reaching script. What one stands to gain from this movie will be proportional to the effort one invests in understanding it. When Syriana becomes available as a DVD, there will be greater potential to mitigate the negative opinions of some who didn't "get it" on the first pass but are open-minded enough to give the film a second viewing at a cheaper price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the congestion of big budget blockbusters, formulaic horror flicks, and unnecessary remakes that 2005 was choked with, Syriana is a breath of fresh air. Centering on the oil industry's impact across the globe, Syriana doesn't really tell us anything new, but still tells an exciting and fascinating story. Intertwining stories include a Persian prince's bid to beat out his brother in taking the throne, a CIA agent uncovering the truth about his career and his agency, a lawyer trying to negotiate a merger between two oil powerhouses, an energy analyst trying to overcome a tragedy, and a young Pakistani man who is let go of his job at an oil plant and gets involved with an extremist group. Most critics think the stories are too confusing and too numerous, but each is important to the big picture and if you pay attention, the movie isn't that hard to follow. And once you understand it, you will be rewarded with one of the best told stories in a long time.The cast is top notch with George Clooney giving the performance of his career. Gone are his suave looks and witty lines, replaced by a scraggly beard, beer belly, and an unsure-of-himself demeanor. Scene stealer Alexander Siddig portrays the headstrong and sincere prince with a quiet explosiveness, and Matt Damon is better than i thought he would be as the energy analyst. Chris Cooper, Jeffery Wright, Christopher Plummer, and Tim Blake Nelson are just a fraction of the excellent supporting cast. Writer/director Stephen Gaghan makes an outstanding debut (i am not counting Abandon only because i haven't seen it) with one of the best movies of the 2005, and one of the most important films in years. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall, Very smart and thrilling movie, however, there were a few discrepancies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello, If you are into world politics, Syriana is a movie you'd want to watch. While waiting in line to get into the movie, this girl came and started telling us: Reverse, stupid movie! I was puzzled at first decided what the hell? even if it was not a good movie, it would be interesting to watch and understand what the writer and director of that book and movie wanted to tell their audience. When I came out of the movie, I thought to myself: "Stupid Movie? Hell no! that girl surely didn't understand the whole theme and story." The movie displays the REAL strategies and plans applied in our world. IT'S a FACTUAL Movie. I LOVED IT and is CERTAINLY one of the BEST MOVIE of the year. It shows how the U.S's claims for fighting terrorism and improving the world are very simply, LIES. They're driven by power, OIL, mendacity, they look for nothing but their own interest no matter what the cost would be. It clarifies a point about the Arabs, which is unfortunately very true, and as a Lebanese myself, agree 100%. Those in power and control are people pressured by the U.S government, they serve as slaves while they could really be kings in their countries, Countries and Kingdoms which can be so well reformed and advanced on all levels and domains. Unfortunately the GOOD GUYS ARE THE ONES TARGETTED AS TERRORISTS, THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ALWAYS DIE. Sad but true. As a 20 year old, I still have some faith and hope that things will change one day. Some of the discrepancies I found in the movie: 1- Persians, Pakistanis and Arabs are represented, as an Arab i was able to distinguish which character came from which country, simply because I could recognize the Arabic language. I thought to myself, as Persians were the ones with the cruel intentions, how can people who do not know the difference between Arabic and Persian languages be able to differentiate between the two? I thought it was greatly unfair. 2- When Baers was taken to Hizbullah's leader when he got to Beirut, the director showed men sitting on building roofs armed and others walking and playing with guns in a hizbullah dominated area. THIS PICTURE IS COMPLETELY INACCURATE. I lived in Lebanon all my life, and certainly those past fews years, and i have been in areas dominated by hizbullah, I have never seen a man walk around with a gun or other type of military arms. Adding to all this, it is true at some point after Mussawi was torturing Baer, The Hizbullah leader walked in and stopped the torturing but was shown to be very insensitive to the fact that the man needed to be hospitalized and was left on the floor bleeding. The point I hope people all around the world would understand is that HIZBULLAH is NOT a TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. THEY ARE SIMPLY A RESISTANCE ORGANIZATION who saved Lebanon from Israeli occupation, Liberated the south of Lebanon. Hizbullah is in fact very well known for his hospitality, sensitivity toward Zionist soldiers who were injured in areas liberated by Hizbullah, they were treated just like every/any human being ought to be treated. Another point about Hizbullah: they are exactly the same as Bush, they want to Liberate the world from terrorism, install peace in Lebanon, Middle East and the world. Difference between them and Bush: THEY ARE THE REAL GUYS. When you are attacked, your women are raped, children are killed, land is occupied, you resist, and defend yourself and all of what belongs to you topping that list is DIGNITY. that is what they do exactly. They are not driven by power, and they certainly never strived to turn Lebanon into an extremist Muslim country, they are not extremists themselves! I hope you will enjoy the movie. I did although at some point it teased me and I felt like reacting, defending, and opposing some views. I am glad, however, to write this comment, it's a civilized way of communicating ideas to the world, especially if others keep an open mind and are curious to learn more than what the mass media wants us to learn. I will never tolerate to be used as a tool, or be manipulated. All of us should resist to the brainwashing men and women in power are trying to do to us. I hope I was able to deliver my message, to each and everyone of the people who might read this comment. Regards to all of you. I hope that one day, PEACE will prevail. It's a shame we use our powerful minds which are capable of reforming, creating, loving, to destroy ourselves and others, instead of making the world a peaceful place to live in. A question came up to me just now: Can we be sure that allegations behind 9/11 and the interpretations made by Bush are true? Why would we trust whoever is interpreting such huge catastrophes? How can we be sure US government didn't have anything to do with 9/11? I guess Fahrenheit 9/11 answers all those questions, and Syriana proves it right. Cheers,</fullReview>

What was the chance that he could have had has hands in two brilliant films in one year? The movie is hard to understand at first. Bits and pieces need to be digested to fully understand it's awesomeness. If you have a good handle on it by the hour mark, you are far ahead of many. The key to understanding this movie is to look for the small things, to analyze those and not try to understand the whole picture until you have a firm grasp on those small things. I never saw Traffic (which a now shall greatly regret and will head to my nearest Blockbuster for) and the next closest movie that I can even think of comparing it to would be The Insider or even this year's Crash.

		<fullReview>When I learned that the people who wrote Traffic were bringing another movie to the theater, I was very interested, and even more so when I saw the first trailers for Syriana. Syriana is an extremely broad and complicated film. With five intertwining stories - a CIA agent in Beruit, a financial analyst, a rising prince in a country with a lot of oil, a pair of oil companies merging to get that oil and the problems with that and a young Muslim man who is laid off and falls to a radical sect of the religion. As the tag line suggests, each of these stories are connected, and the filmmakers do an outstanding job making each of these stories fall into place, little by little. Parts of one storyline affect the others in a number of ways. The movie also sports a very talented and outstanding cast, with some in what I thought were some of the best acting jobs that they've done in a while. Directorialwise, we see an outstanding job with the camera, looking over oil rigs, cities, roadways, and moving to some very frantic, shaky camera work. It all falls into place and works outstandingly when and where needed. Highly recommended, although be warned, it's highly political and fairly complicated. I think that I'm going to need another viewing or two to get everything straight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not a thriller. It's a portrait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director and writer (Stephen Gaghan) of this movie is the same writer of "Traffic". Both scripts written in a mini-plot structure to depict an issue rather than resolving it. In Traffic it was about narcotics and in Syriana it's about the American foreign policy in the Middle East.The movie tells the story of four characters: a CIA agent (Clooney), a firm lawyer (Wright), an energy analyst (Damon) and a Pakistani laborer (Munir) in a rich oil state. The threads of the plots run in parallel most of the time and intersect every now and then. But in my opinion the plots are not important as events as much as they are means to expose the complicated realities of the Oil industry and its effect on the American Foreign Policy in the Middle East.There is no question that the movie has a strong political statement. And that might explain why so many reviewers who oppose its message have given the film just one star. Cinematically the film deserves at least 7. Add to that its much needed and brave political statement and it jumps to 8. But I've given it 9 for a reason that will, most likely, go unnoticed by most American and Western reviewers. This film is breath taking in its meticulous accuracy in presenting some of Middle Eastern culture aspects.I was born and raised in the Middle East in a country not very unlike Syriana. And I can attest that I've never seen a movie that captures the atmosphere and dynamics of that culture with such subtlety. When I watched the movie the first time, I was so convinced that the director must be an Arab that my eyes fooled me when I read his name the first time. And after watching the movie for a second time I'm still wondering how Stephen Gaghan was able to do it.If you want to watch a serious political movie about the Middle East you need to go no further.</fullReview>

It is a chilling movie brilliantly acted out by an ensemble cast and a very complex plot.For the first 30 minutes of the movie, I was probably just as confused as everyone else in the theater, but as time went on, the stories started to make sense, feed off each other, and come together. One has to constantly pay attention and think about everything they see to understand the movie. But if you do, it pays off very well at the end. The movie is an intriguing look into the world of corporate greed, politics, espionage, and disillusionment. While the story is fictional, it still chills me to think that something similar to this *could* be what's going on in the world.I strongly recommend watching this movie if you are a fan of a very intelligent movie that requires you to think and analyze every bit of information you gather.

But there are too many plots and counter-plots, most of which don't come together very well and the identity of the actors with the pressure groups they belong to are confusing. The ending leaves no closure and leaves too much up in the air. What starts out to be an exciting film becomes quite average in the process.

I found it difficult to sort out some things at the end - maybe I will see it again to fix that. The movie does convey the idea that US oil companies are all powerful, with exception of some Chinese competition, but in actual fact the foreign oil companies really dominate (as far as size goes) and other countries are doing their best to influence and knock off those who are not compliant. This is standard feature of history, too bad because such behavior leads to wars. The Chinese as the enemy is not focused on in the movie - very good, leave it to Lou Dobbs and CNN to create the climate for war with China over oil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very much looking forward to this movie because I do research on the oil industry's activities in the Middle East. Clooney and his crew are known for being liberal so I was interested to see how biased their film would be. I was happy to see that although the film does depict Americans as being the "bad guys" it never goes overboard in trying to make our involvement in Middle Eastern politics truly evil.I will say that people who know nothing about Middle Eastern geography or politics will be confused during the movie, and the casting didn't help resolve this. Too many white males with gray hair were cast, and I had an awful time trying to figure out who was who. Additionally, the plot moved so quickly that sometimes I felt completely lost.This is definitely a film worth seeing - the acting was superb, especially by Damon and Clooney. The film's message isn't overbearing, but it is an important one that deserves our attention.All in all this was a great film that made me want to donate to firms researching alternative energy sources.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana runs like a hollywoodization of an episode of PBS's Frontline. We get a lot of pieces connecting to the greater puzzle of American obsession with Glob-oil-ization (yah I made up that term).The film moves us in and out of country, back room meeting and family dinner. Our cast of characters looms large and plot complex. Or is it?Lawyers, analysts, emirs, jihadis and covert agents populate the world of Syriana to show the chaotic nature of terrorism and economic development. Based partially on experiences of the CIA operative Robert Baer, the movie looks to the murkier levels of Beirut and even murkier levels of Washington to show how people can and will justify anything, "Corruption is why we win!"I liked a lot about Syriana yet I felt the movie was far denser than it really needed to be. I don't think the plot is as complex as it seems and upon reflection, is quite simple. It is the editing and shuffling camera that lead one's eye to confusion at times over what is going on. Not that anybody will be lost when the film is over, but at times you feel left out and though that may be intentional, it wasn't really necessary.The acting good all around, I think Syriana lacked the dramatic punch of director Gaghan's traffic story. The final "explosive" convergence lacked any real meaning on a dramatic level. On a logical level, the finale could be purposefully hollow on reflection to the helplessness against the drive for oil. But this is a movie and I really didn't feel the impact like I did in Traffic. The end of that movie felt explosive where there was no explosion. With Syriana the literal explosion lacks any aural or dramatic shrapnel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to see a screening of this where the director did a Q&amp;A afterwords. He explained how he had spent months traveling and writing and researching in the Middle East (including the Gulf). He insisted on shooting the film in rarely shown nations like Dubai. I could feel this reality seeping through the film. The actors too were cast from people from Morrocco to India. The director wanted real people who spoke real dialects in the roles. This detail worked for me. I have been to the Middle East and to North Africa a number of times and this film felt right. The people that I met on my travels treated me with a bizarre and mysterious mix of truth and lies, of hospitality and resentment, of graciousness and blame. The film captured this. The performances were well delivered, the story was intricate and clear enough and the end left good questions open. My favorite scene was with Christopher Plumber on the boat when he shows what real power is to the paper tiger prince. I think this is a must see. As an American it must be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie for Grown-Ups</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My test for a good movie is simple - if you're still thinking about it the next day, and discovering things about the plot which passed you by when you saw it, it's worth seeing. Syriana is a dense movie. You need to pay attention to myriad characters, seemingly unconnected subplots and avoid trying to second-guess what will happen. Well-made political thrillers rarely turn out the way the audience expects. The plot twists and changing agendas of the characters are what distinguish the inventive movie from the mundane. It's always nice to have an "Aha!" moment. It happens so rarely. Fine performances and direction make this a movie for grown-ups.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most daring film ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been caught by such a surprise, watching a Hollywood production before. It's true one has to straggle to follow the plot for the first part of this film, but while it progresses it becomes more and more rewarding. And that is the biggest handicap of this film, since plenty of people gave up watching it or had a hard time identifying what it is all about. However, this complexity is very well grounded. This film through a series of events, explores all aspects that finally lead to a terrorist attack. Each of these stories work as pieces of a puzzle, completing the wider picture of this terrorist action. The writers were not hesitant to unveil all aspects of western interference in such a delicate matter in a most direct and daring manner, thus presenting such an execrable crime as if it is the last inevitable ring in a chain of events.Is terror a vicious circle fed by its own victims?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intentionally confusing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with most reviewers here, I came out of the movie theater after seeing Syriana muttering under my breath, "What was that about?" After much thought, it occurred to me that the filmmakers must either be incredibly naive to think that their audience would be able to make sense of this movie, or they fully intended for the audience to be confused. I may be giving them the benefit of the doubt here, but with veterans like George Clooney, Christopher Plummer and William Hurt in the cast, I'm inclined to think the filmmakers knew what they were doing. Which begs the question, Why? I don't claim to know the answer, but it may be that what the filmmakers were trying to get across to us is the reality that there is no sense to be made of the oil mess. When greed, power, fear, blind nationalism and money guide men's actions, logic and morality are left out in the cold. And the webs of entanglement that have been spun between nations, corporations, intelligence agencies, and the wealthy in pursuit of oil are such that it is probably impossible to sort out the relationships. The good guys turn into bad guys, the bad guys turn into good guys (momentarily at least), and everyone is left with an oily residue.This is not a movie for those who like their morality plays cut and dried with an obvious message. This is a movie intended to leave its viewers with bad tastes in their mouths, with the realization that we are all players in this game. With any luck, some of those viewers will buy Toyota Priuses instead of SUVs the next time they purchase a vehicle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark but unfortunately very real view of the way the world works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a factual film based on a book written by a real life CIA agent. It is so factual, that sometimes it seems a bit colorless, gray. However, this is the only way to tell the story, the story of a shapeless gray monster that spreads throughout the world and has a hunger that is insatiable and unstoppable. After you have seen this movie you feel like you want to shout and you also know that no one will hear you. It's like falling into a deep dark hole and knowing there is no way out.George Clooney plays the CIA agent, rather well and grim; Matt Damon plays a naive economic adviser, also well, but not such a demanding role; Alexander Siddig again plays the enlightened Arab, doing a good job. Other known actors like Christopher Plummer (oil tycoon) or Amanda Peet (bitchy mother) play small roles.Actually, all the roles are rather small in this story. This sets it apart from most movies. You don't really have a lead actor and the people involved are not the main characters. Their role in a giant machine makes them ridiculously small, while the machine itself has the lead.It's a must see. I like that it didn't attack a specific regime, not even a specific country, because if it weren't the Americans running the show, it would have been another superpower. One phrase stuck to my mind saying that a country that devotes half of it's budget to military expenses must have a declining persuasive power.Before watching the movie, though, you must be serious and in a calm mood. It is not a short movie, nor an easy to follow one. But it is well worth the view. One in a thousand films, and I rate it high because few movies made me feel like I do now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent in every way, "Syriana" is as vast as the Sahara Desert and as expansive as the deepest ocean. A juggling chess match of near epic proportions in the Academy Award winning style of "Traffic" (perhaps the finest film of the past 25 years), "Syriana" deals with the world's most valuable and important resource---oil. A merger between two powerful U.S. companies reaches not only Houston, but also Washington, D.C. as an ambitious corporate lawyer (Jeffrey Wright) tries to finesse his way to super-stardom. Chris Cooper is the most notable name in a faceless crowd of big business wildcatters who only seem to care about the all mighty dollar. Big name attorneys Christopher Plummer and Tim Blake Nelson also play major roles in the potential merge. Meanwhile, an American power broker (Matt Damon) in the Middle East rubs shoulders with the oldest son (Alexander Siddig) of an elderly king (Nadim Sawalha). Damon finds Siddig to be strangely charismatic and highly intelligent while Siddig's younger brother (Akbar Kurtha) makes it a point to gain his father's kingdom at any cost. Simultaneously Damon has marital difficulties with wife Amanda Peet as the couple suffers an unimaginable tragedy. The potential oil merge in the U.S. leads to a Middle Eastern youngster (Mazhar Munir) finding refuge with a militant religious organization where terrorism appears to be the order for the day. And established CIA operative George Clooney (in his very best role) slowly begins to uncover an elaborate plot that will shake the very foundation that all the key players unwittingly stand on. Writer-director Stephen Gaghan's screenplay is a dizzying exercise that could make your head spin. Taking pages out of films like "JFK" and "Traffic", Gaghan gives the audience lots to digest in a relatively short period of time. Though not preachy, the film points lots of fingers in many different directions and creates an element of understanding with its wide range of personalities. The movie treats the world as a village and not as countries divided by thin lines on maps and globes. Honest, thought-provoking, smart and memorable in every way, "Syriana" is one of those movies that takes no prisoners and makes no apologies. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important juxtaposition of two distinct, yet equally desperate societies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been introducing this movie to friends with the following analogy: recalling the writing adage "Show, don't tell", if you recognise "Bowling For Columbine" as the "tell", this is the "show".By this comparison I am not referring so much to plot as to format and structure: as an effective vessel for political themes, the didactic nature of Moore's work pales, splutters, and dies in the face of storytelling like this. The screenplay for "Syriana" is a welcome throw-back to the 70s and further, back to when cinematic features were not expected to spell out every little detail for their audiences, but instead to throw the viewer in medias res, such that what happens on screen is truly absorbed like a good novel. Yes, the viewer has to do a little more work with this film in order to comprehend what's going on, but even if the viewer chooses not to put in that effort, to let the film wash over him, he won't be disappointed.Moreover, this movie manages to convey our global political environment (the impressions therein) in a way that does not condemn either "side", but simply illustrates (through juxtaposition) the complex differences and similarities between Middle Eastern, "grassroots" terrorism, corporate terrorism, and corruption in two opposing forms of government. "Syriana" is not so much a critique of contemporary global society as it is a call to arms for citizens everywhere to consider how integral propaganda is to our lives, and the tremendous cost these biases can bring to people we don't even know.Some critics disliked that much of the character development in this piece had to be inferred (happening between scenes more often than not), but I personally think this shows they've misunderstood the point of the movie (and also that they probably hated the book "One Hundred Years of Solitude"). Think about it: in a movie that seeks to encapsulate the motivations of whole industries, governments, and classes - and to illustrate how easily individuals (regardless of position or class) become pawns in the larger scheme of things - the conflict must necessarily be external. To demand otherwise, in my opinion, suggests too rigid an adherence to the Western "lone hero" archetype - an archetype that certainly should not apply to movies trying to convey the overarching story of two distinct cultures. Indeed, there are no winners in this movie, for even when an individual does succeed, he does so at the cost of his society.All in all, I found "Syriana" to be a very intelligent piece, with loads of room to welcome back repeat viewers - if less for the viewer who just wants to shut his brain off for a couple hours. Though "thriller" is certainly a misnomer for this piece, anyone with any interest in world affairs will find in this movie a daring and long-awaited means of grappling with the many forces, themes, suspicions and needs that drive contemporary society. At its best, "Syriana" is truly the beginning of a long-awaited cinematic discourse on the world as we know it; my only hope is that the movies to follow in its footsteps will be up to the challenge.</fullReview>

I'm suspecting that some people with specific agendas and a lot of time on their hands are trying to take this movie down, and influence people not to see it. That would be a shame - it's a movie worth seeing. I'm just wondering what these people are afraid of - and why they don't want you to see this film. My original theory on why the majority of viewers were either "ones" or "nine/tens" was that this was a film you either loved or hated.

		<fullReview>Many reviewers and critics cite the complexity of Syriana's plot line, saying it is inaccessible and dense. I agree, it is complex, but I like that about the film. I like that everything isn't spelled out for me. Figuring out the connections between all of the story lines is almost addictive after watching the movie.A few of the sub-plots are unnecessary, in my opinion: Bob Barnes and his son; Bennett Holiday and his father. One of the themes of the film is fathers and sons, so I can see where those minor plots seemed like a good idea, but they've been whittled away to ineffectiveness. The time given to those relationships could have been better used on some of our main characters.The performances are, in general, solid and convincing. Alexander Siddig as Prince Nasir is the stand out of the mix, although George Clooney's against-type portrayal of Bob Barnes is worth of the accolades he is receiving. Matt Damon is the weak link, in my opinion. His performance is pretty much the same old Damon, but at least he makes the technical jargon his character has to deliver somewhat more accessible than it appears on the page.Overall, this falls just a little bit short of excellent, but it is still so worth seeing if only to get Americans talking seriously about our dependence on oil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Corruption. Corruption is our protection, corruption keeps us safe and warm, corruption is why we win." - Danny Dalton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the biggest debates going on in the United States right now is our situation in and with Iraq. Should we be over there? Should we take their oil? Should we be engaged in war? All these are questions 'Syriana' doesn't answer and I admire that. I was very skeptical going into first time Oscar-winning screenplay writer Stephen Gaghan's (a big-time liberal from what I've heard) political picture surrounding the conflicts involving U.S. oil companies and the C.I.A. in the Middle-East. 'Syriana' could have been a whiny Liberal Anti-Republican Down with Bush piece, but it wasn't and I admire that. Gaghan makes the wise decision of not choosing sides but just throwing characters and situations out there and letting you figure out who the bad guys or good guys are. 'Syriana' is a fascinating and extremely accurate motion picture in relation to how US oil companies do business. It should be up for some Oscars come March.'Syriana' plays out a lot like Gaghan's 'Traffic' (the best film of 2000) only with a little less violence and explosions. The story has a complex gang of characters starting with an old but sill strong C.I.A. operative, Bob Barnes (George Clooney) who is doing some espionage work in the Middle-East. During his time over there he uncovers a conspiracy involving the C.I.A., which surrounds a young aspiring oil broker, Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) and an aspiring young Prince (Alexander Siddig) who is anxious to take over his dying dad's throne. Bob gets in-to-deep and is sold out by the C.I.A. That's about all I'll tell you about the plot because 'Syriana' is a film that really needs to be experienced first-person. The film also stars Jeffrey Wright as a sly big-name oil company lawyer, Chris Cooper as a sneaky oil company representative, Nicky Henson as Wright's boss, William Hurt as Clooney's old co-worker and mentor, Mazhar Munir as a young and bright Middle- Eastern boy who is brainwashed into a life of terrorism, Jayne Atkins as Clooney's division chief, Thomas McCarthey as Clooney's co-worker, Amanda Peet as Damon's wife (whose part isn't enticing to say the least), Christopher Plummer as the top dog of the US Oil Company and Tim Blake Nelson as Danny Dalton as a Texas oil tycoon who delivers a powerful speech to Wright's character towards the middle of the film that pretty much sends the message of the entire film.'Syriana' doesn't hold it's punches in being straight-forward and honest, and one has to admire and respect that. Gaghan provides a powerhouse knock-out screenplay that is sure to pick up an Academy Award Nomination. I was also pleasantly surprised with his directing abilities (this was his directorial debut). One of the most stellar aspects surrounding the motion picture is it's numerous stellar performances. Clooney provides what is absolutely the performance of his career as Bob Barnes (who was the author of the novel the movie is based upon). Matt Damon is solid for the most part, while Jeffrey Wright is stunning as a cutthroat lawyer. Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper and William Hurt are excellent in their roles no matter how small, and Tim Blake Nelson is perfectly cast in his tiny but incredibly important role. Mazhar Munir gives us one of the best youth performances in recent years while Alexander Siddig is delightfully seedy and nerve-wracking as the wannabe King. The only disappointing performance is from Amanda Peet which is in part due the fact her role is very unimportant and also in part due the fact that she is a terrible actress. But besides some very minor flaws, 'Syriana' scorches and compels. The film unfortunately drags a lot around the middle which is why I can't call it a 'masterpiece' and award it an 'A'.I highly recommend 'Syriana' for those who want their beliefs and mind to be challenged. 'Syriana' doesn't spell everything out for you and that's part of it's brilliance. 'Syriana' forces and dares you to think and draw your own conclusions instead of being spoon-fed them like most movies unfortunately end up doing now days. I personally think 'Syriana' should score Oscar nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, Best Supporting Actor - for either Clooney or Wright, and possibly, Best Picture. It's not only one of the most mesmerizing motion pictures of the year but also one of the most pre-eminent ones. If you think you're game, catch it while it's still in theaters.

		<fullReview>From a production quality viewpoint, this film was quite good for a relatively low budget independent. Acting, editing, camera work, etc. were first class. However, the film makers try to use some techniques to convince you they know more than they do about the international energy situation. During the film a lot of relevant details go by so fast and are so little explained that the informed viewer who catches a glimpse of them is inclined to give the film makers the benefit of the doubt.I know a great deal about the world this movie purports to address, not as a player, but as an independent investigator with international sources. Whoever wrote the screenplay is only seeing a part of the picture. Many aspects relating to how central Asian oil reserves are being exploited and fought over are utterly missing in the film. The relationship between the US government and Iran is very badly misrepresented (the true story would make a much better movie). All that said, the impression the film leaves with the viewer about the extent to which the various players in the international energy market represent a set of ignorant armies clashing by night is quite accurate. So if you see this film, don't get lost in the details; take home the impression.Added Later:I did not know when I wrote the above that I would have enough space to address details, but it appears I might, so.....One of the things that bothered me about this film was that the plot was over-simplified. (Please don't shout at me like that!) For instance, if the movie is really talking about the oil industry term "Syriana," then a large area of central Asia is involved, running all the way from the Persian Gulf states through Kazakhistan in the North. That being the case, where are the Russians in this movie? The Russians are major players in this business on all levels and they are not even represented. Also, no Pakistani had to go to Saudi Arabia to learn about Islamic Fundamentalism from a Wahabi; there are plenty of madrasas in Pakistan preaching a similar ideology. Where is the Pakistani factor in this film? Where is the reference to the development of terrorists by the Pakistan for service in the Kashmir? Since that story led DIRECTLY to the events of 9/11, it would have seemed of interest to have included it. Also, where is the story of the Unical Pipeline from Usbekistan through Afghanistan and the Baluchistan area of Pakistan to the Persian Gulf? That was a major factor of direct US meddling that led to the current situation which the movie was trying to portray. Also, there is no indication that the film makers knew anything about the looooong-standing relationship between the current government of Iran and certain sections of the US Republican Party. Also, in the name of all that's holy, how can you make a movie that has an anti-Iranian group based in the US and leave out the Israelis? Let Iran get close to having nuclear weapons and you will see what I mean.And finally, you don't need a shaped charge to bring down an LNG tanker. All you need is a charge sufficient to penetrate the double hull opposite a tank; the LNG that begins to leak (at -400 degrees plus) would do the rest. The explosion would be inevitable, enormous, and about 20 minutes later (given the ambient high temperature).I am afraid it would take many movies to tell the story of "Syriana," perhaps more than the average film-goer would care to sit through. However, the continued ignorance of the world to what is really going on there will lead to more events that will get everyone's attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/Director Stephen Gaghan wrote the screenplay to Steven Soderberg's terrific film "Traffic". What is missing here is Soderberg's film-making. The screenplay, while very complex, can be followed by those who want to work at it. The frustrating part is that with all the sub-plots, the viewer never really connects with any character or particular story line. Even Matt Damon and George Clooney have relatively little screen time.The oil industry, with all its backroom wheeling and dealing combined with money hungry lawyers and power hungry politicians, leave little wonder why the CIA is screwed up and often leaves its own hung out to dry (the Clooney storyline). No telling how much truth is in each of the many sub-plots, but they all are interesting. The lack of connection to the viewer is no fault of the amazing supporting cast that includes (to name just a few): Christopher Plummer, Jeffrey Wright, Chris Cooper, Robert Foxworth (think he ever kicks himself for turning down the role of J.R. Ewing on "Dallas"), Tim Blake Nelson, David Clennon and Amanda Peet. The underrated Jeffrey Wright ("Broken Flowers") really shines as the idealistic attorney exposed to the real world and the ugliness of power. Also the story is based on the novel "See No Evil" by Bob Baer, who is credited as a security guard in the film.I have probably rated this a bit higher than I should, but can't help but give the benefit of the doubt to an aggressive, push-the-envelope story, when so few ever reach the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie you will see this year that will not win an Oscar. It is very realistic and hard to classify, and therefore will shamefully be overlooked. In the spirit of movies such as "Traffic", it simultaneously follows several story lines, ranging from the corporate politics of Washington to the immigrant worker struggles in the middle east. Though this style of film has been seemingly overdone in the past several years, Syriana manages to achieve a much more realistic viewpoint without even the use of excessive hand-held cameras or special lighting. It is also surprisingly unpretentious. Before seeing the movie I thought it would simply be a liberal slam against big corporations, but it proves to be much more thoughtful than that. The line is blurred between Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, antitrust law and capitalist patriotism. The movie's real message is that things are messed up because too many individual interests are involved and good, honest people are working for both sides. The movie can move slow for someone who isn't interested in politics, but if you are willing to pay close attention you will appreciate a movie that is way beyond anything Hollywood is currently shelling out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana makes you shut up and think. It's a big plate of spaghetti and you will follow some individual story strands for quite a while before you know why.But it all comes together in the end.Movie buffs will react again and again as familiar faces crop up -- solid and underused actors; actors you can't get enough of... and a few new actors who make solid impressions. Among the former groups, David Clennon, Tim Blake Nelson, William Hurt... Only a couple of the parts were played a bit sketchily, and I suspect, thinking about it afterward, that there were likely more than a handful of deleted scenes. It's not that we're missing any of the story line, but we may be missing some of the character story arcs.A lot happens in this movie. Still more lies under the surface. But the through-line here is the notion of "using." People are used, laws are used, money is used, deceit is used... and under it all, oil is used. Oil is the unstated addiction that drives the actions of Our Hero. But he's not really aware of how high the mechanism of providing for oil reaches until late in the game. Invisible strings make regimes happen, make alliances happen; make death happen. And it's all in the service of the global need for oil. Is the current and future hunger for oil an addiction, or is it the lifeblood of civilization? That's a question you won't find in this film, but it should hit you some time afterward as you reflect on what you've seen. The other thing that should hit you afterward is: if anything is worth fighting and dying for, isn't it oil?Syriana has a moral point to make, but it's a simple one and not steeped in any particular ideology: we pay an (often unintended) price for our actions. The link between our actions and the price paid is a long, tortured, probably even invisible link. But Syriana shows one aspect of the price to us.The secondary moral is that incredible wealth can be a curse --- especially if that wealth is a vital resource.Earlier this year, "Lord of War" seemingly attempted a similar revelation about another industry. but where LoW seemed simplistic and preachy with over-the-top action and acting, Syriana is a great story, well played, and enjoyable just for what's on the surface. The moral components are only there for your personal reflections to uncover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana reveals important truths about American oil companies and their thirst for corporate Power and their relationship with Power to maintain control in the region. It is simply a chess game, albeit dealing with real Kings, Princes and the unlucky Pawns.The movie reveals the relationship our (american) politicos have with middle eastern allies and the "payoff" each receives for the valuation of that relationship.Most importantly, the story reveals the human toll that "advocation at the altar of money, power and prestige" (my quotes) presents and that those who are maneuvering in and making the web of deception usually win. The companies desire to gain power precedes the human toll, and the price we (all people) pay is a loss of our lives, personal humanity and dignity.Think Iraq.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confused, Ambitious and Complex Collection of Clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana is a confused, ambitious and complex thriller of corruption and power related to the oil industry that tells four parallel stories: the CIA agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney) with great experience in Middle East that falls in disgrace after an unsuccessful mission dealing missiles in Lebanese Republic; the investigation of the attorney Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) related to the merge of two American oil companies, Connex and Killen; the traumatic association of the energy analyst Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) with the son of a powerful emir of Iran; and the social drama of the Pakistani immigrant worker Wasim Khan (Mazhar Munir) that is fired by the oil company.The greatest problem with this movie is that it is too complex for only 126 minutes running time, due to the number of plots, subplots and characters; therefore its edition is tremendously confused with the use of many ellipsis. It would be more appropriated a mini-series, or a longer film. Even the title of this movie is very ambiguous, with many non-official explanations. The movie's website states that "'Syriana' is a very real term used by Washington think-tanks to describe a hypothetical reshaping of the Middle East." (http://syrianamovie.warnerbros.com/about.html). In the end, I truly found this movie a pretentious and sophisticated collection of clichés sold in a beautiful "package". My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Syriana ? A Indústria do Petróleo" ("Syriana ? The Oil Industry")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A messy, unconvincing narrative that drags along undoes what should have been a slick and impacting condemnation of oil and politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously it depends on your politics but those who share mine say that we are in Iraq because of the West's demand for oil. They say that top US politicians are in bed with the Saudi Royal family because of oil. They say that corruption is rife within the corridors of power in regards oil dealing and even that those who demand oil for their sports utility vehicles are guilty of funding terrorists by not controlling their consumption. Now, given that this is a subject that we all believe to be swimming in corruption and shady going-ons, you do have to wonder why Gaghan was not able to pull it together into a tighter, more meaningful and more impacting narrative.Many of the professional reviews I have read for this film have complained that the stories are hard to connect and that it gave you the feeling you'd walked in late and missed something; however the same reviews also forgive this by saying "maybe that was the point". Well, maybe it was but that is not an excuse for having a film that is about two hours long that only starts to come together towards the end. It does not forgive the subplots that don't add value or the scenes that don't fit simply because the script doesn't tell us until the end how it is going to work. Of course the film still engaged me because the individual threads were all interesting even if their relevance or direction was not always clear, but it was a problem for me that they were so disconnected ? and that may well be the point but it doesn't make for a great film. Equally disappointing was how simplistic the connection ultimately was and how obvious the point made were; again, maybe it is because we all assume these things to be true that this was not an eye-opener and shocking condemnation that it should have been.Many viewers will struggle to get into a film that seems intent on pushing the viewer away. We are given things that seem to go nowhere, stories that don't seem to connect, characters we are not allowed to understand and we are left wondering when it will get to the place we know it is all going. It is still worth a look though because individual scenes are great and even the individual threads have enough to make them interesting but it is just such a shame that all these little things don't come together very well. As director Gaghan has done a great job because the film looks great, moves nicely and looks really professional. Likewise the cast are impressive in their presence as well as performances (on the whole) if you ignore the limitations the materials serves them with. Clooney is impressive and it is not his fault that his character doesn't totally make sense. Plummer relishes his powerful old man but Wright doesn't seem to know what to do with his and he seems to either have it all going on inside his head or he just didn't understand what he was doing. Damon is good but again I don't think he saw how he was meant to fit in. Support from Peet, Waked, Cooper, Foxworth, Novak and others is all fine but they cannot overcome the problems inherent in the story and the telling.Overall then this is worth seeing but fell way short of my expectations. It looks great and the cast are all good on paper and on screen but the narrative problems just completely undercut it for me. I know that Gaghan was going for a tapestry of stories to all come together but he didn't pull it off and instead of being one impressive tapestry it is a patchwork quilt ? bits of it are good but stand back from it and it all works disjointed and messy. Interesting but nowhere near good enough to be compared to Traffic, which does the same thing but actually pulls it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humdinger of an action film about skullduggery to control oil and politics in Southwest Asia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Syriana" is a vast, teeming, mile-a-minute, kaleidoscopic, whirlwind story about the geopolitical, economic and clandestine military (terrorist and counter-terrorist) forces that are in play in the international race to control oil supplies and the future fortunes and political allegiances of Southwest Asia and the Middle East.Stephen Gaghan, the screenwriter and (first time) director of "Syriana," who previously wrote the scripts for "Rules of Engagement," "Traffic" and "The Alamo," relishes complexity in his narratives. In "Traffic," a film about drug trafficking from Mexico into the southwest U.S., we followed three sizable sets of characters in three locales, flipping, often at a fast pace, among them. "Traffic's" director, Steven Soderbergh, took compassion upon viewers of that film by color coding scenes for the three story arcs. Now, in "Syriana," we have just as many characters to contend with, if not more, some of whom look a lot alike (I'm thinking not only here of the Arabs but also of our own middle aged, beefy white guys), operating in a dozen or so locales, and there's no color coding to help us out this time.Accordingly, the rap on "Syriana" has been that it is too difficult to understand and follow the story lines, that one is snowed by the weight of it all, and that you have to go back and see it again at least one more time to get things straight. Well, I think that view misses the point. I don't think Mr. Gaghan wants us to get the plot details down pat. His point of view, I surmise, is precisely that there is so much going on in the world at any given moment in connection with the issues at hand, so much contradictory activity or at least 180 degree rapid turnabouts by one party or another, so much disinformation and denial of the truth by various government and corporate spokespersons, that the whole notion of "getting the story straight" is in itself absurdly na?ve.George Clooney, as Bob Barnes, who is apparently a high level CIA operative, skillfully leads a huge and splendid cast that also features Jeffrey Wright (as Bennett Holiday, Jr., a lawyer, for the Justice Dept., I think) and Matt Damon (Bryan Woodman, a private economic adviser) in prominent roles, and includes a huge band of cameo players, the most memorable of whom are (in alpha order): Chris Cooper (Jimmy Pope, a Texas oilman), William Charles Mitchell (Bennett Holiday, Sr., a seriously compromised alcoholic), Tim Blake Nelson (Danny Dalton, I never did get his job straight), Amanda Peet (Julie Woodman, Bryan's wife), Christopher Plummer (Dean Whiting, a rich bigshot of some sort), Alexander Siddig (Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, a smart fellow who would lead his Emirate nation well, but because of this, is opposed by a bunch of interests), Mark Strong (Mussawi, a terrorist torturer) and Amr Waked (Mohammed Sheik Agiza, a terrorist leader).My advice to those who have not yet seen this movie is, first, do see it. It's a humdinger of an action flick, based (at least loosely) upon real events and people, contained in the source book, "See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism," by Robert Baer. Second, see it once, but discard your obsessive need to master plot details at the box office window. Think of the film as more of an impressionistic pastiche. Relax into it, if you can, and let the events in the movie just flow through you. Whatever prejudices you've ever harbored about lying, cheating, stealing, duplicity, corruption, profiteering, dirty tricks and every other sort of skullduggery sponsored by individuals, agencies, nations, corporations and guerrilla insurgents afoot in the world will be sharply reinforced by watching this film. (In English, Urdu, Arabic, Farsi and French). My ratings: 8.5/10 (A-). (Seen on 01/21/06). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.</fullReview>

My only dislike was that they claimed a lot of the scenes were in Beirut, and thats not even close to the case. The hotel filmed is not in Beirut, the suburbs of Beirut are not like that and its not even close to the reality. The money paid by George cloony for the sandwich in the "5-star" hotel is only 3000 Lebanese liras. If he was to order that in that type of hotel he'll have to pay at least 10,000 L.L. I know all this since i was born and lived in Lebanon for 21 years! But all in all, the movie is great and that's why it gets a 9/10 from me. Enjoy it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The moral ambiguity of greed - an honest examination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen a film in a theater for over 12 years. It is interesting the two films I have actually gone to a theater to see involve George Clooney. This film is the mirror that the United States citizens might not want to look into. But, once you stare into it, you can't look away. Every sub-plot, every actor gives nuanced, subtle, and powerful performances. The underlying tragedy and sense of doom you feel for some of the characters, actually made me cry. At the same time, it is intelligent, with moments of humor in the midst of all of the ugliness of utter greed, and again a strange sorrow about humanity in general pervade. I loved Good Night and Good Luck, but I would be hard pressed to choose between these two films. Kudos. I haven't seen films like this in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing, Fascinating, and Believable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Syriana' presents a confusing, fascinating, and believable dramatization of the moral and political quagmire of the modern oil industry. Following several characters whose paths rarely cross but whose actions effect each other in unexpected ways, the storyline is a dizzying, expressionistic blur of names, acronyms, organizations, and datelines. Connections and motives are more suggested than stated, though bizarrely, by the movie's end, there is a sense that the narrative has progressed logically and inevitably to its climax.The problem with the multi-thread narrative is that no character is ever singled out as the protagonist. The audience is not given anyone to really identify and connect with. If a 2-hour movie presents six separate story lines, then each storyline can only be granted 20 minutes of screen time. Twenty minutes simply isn't long enough to develop characters, establish their goals, and engage us in their struggle. The structure of such stories will always create an emotional distance, and it's one that is almost impossible to bridge. To Gaghan's credit, he creates as much empathy for his characters as is possible within the constraints of his structure, but not enough to make the climax as tragic as it should be.Filmed in Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, many scenes have an unusually authentic sense of location, and it is refreshing to see an honest depiction of the Middle East in a mainstream movie. There are no real enemies here, just individuals fighting for what they believe is their survival, and it's hard to imagine conservatives or liberals arguing with such a mature depiction of politics, global business and terrorism.'Syriana' is worth seeing, and what it reveals about the hidden connections and relationships between the involved parties is fascinating and eye-opening. But Gaghan's insistence on such a fragmented departure from traditional film narrative prevents any real sense of engagement, and the result is cold and clinically impersonal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Movie Show review - dense, challenging, and brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is dense (to say the least) and necessitates a second viewing ? but that's a good thing! Most Hollywood movies pander to a lazy, illiterate, uninformed American audience, but Syriana does the opposite. This movie demands that its audience step up and critically think about what it's watching.The story starts with oil. Connex, a major oil company in Houston, want to merge with Killen, a minor oil company that just acquired rights to oilfields in the former Soviet state of Kazakhstan. If this merger is approved, the new company will have more money than Denmark and become the 27th largest economy in the world. Meanwhile, a group of poor oilfield workers in Iran have lost their jobs because of the merger, and with no work and nowhere to go, they turn to an Islamic school for food and shelter. One of the students in this school has bought a missile from a CIA agent in Iran.That CIA agent is then sent to Syria to assassinate an Iranian prince and retrieve the missing weapon. This Iranian prince is moderate, educated, wants democracy in Iran, and is first in line to inherit the thrown from his father, the Emir. However, since he has allowed China into Iran to do business, the American government views him as a terrorist and doesn't want him to inherit the thrown. His brother, however, wants the thrown as well, and is more easily persuaded by the American government to allow American troops and businesses in Iran and therefore has the support and backing of the most powerful country in the world.No, it's not easy to follow, but it's all connected. Not one country, company, or character is blameless. Everyone is corrupt and everyone is looking out for their own best interest. It's not all about oil, but it is all about money, and when an American politician tells you that we're invading another country to liberate it, don't be so naive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A biting drama that is more "political" than "thriller"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to pick apart America's strategy in the Middle East without becoming preachy, but this film manages it with an understated finesse. It will not please everyone, mind. Syriana does not contain the action scenes you might associate with George Clooney or Matt Damon and its split narratives do not lead to a life-affirming conclusion. Nor will it cut any ice with patriots wedded to the idea of America's role as the liberator of the Middle East. But none of this makes it a bad film.True, it can be a mite confusing. It took me a while to work out what, or who, George Clooney's CIA agent was meant to be doing when he is sent to Beirut. But momentary confusion does little to obscure the function of the film - a masterclass in American foreign policy in the Middle East.The film, wisely, does not mention Iraq. To do so would enter a debate that has become so polarised as to be meaningless. It gives a broader picture, and by doing so exposes the paradox in American (and British) policy towards the Middle East. While we in the West do believe that democracy is a way of stabilising countries and bringing them into the global economy, it is a double-edged sword. If Arab leaders are elected, they have legitimacy in the eyes of their people. The more legitimacy they have, the less they must rely on Western military support to prop up their regimes.What Syriana illustrates so eloquently is that when it comes down to a choice, America would rather have despotic Arab leaders it can push around than liberal-minded reformists who would be free to negotiate oil deals with, say, China. It is not a choice without consequences, the film argues. Which leader, the despot or the reformist, is more likely to preside over a society that fosters terrorists?The performances by George Clooney, Matt Damon, Chris Cooper, Jeffrey Wright et al are spot on. There is no showboating, just solid, close to the knuckle acting. It is more "political" than "thriller", but if that doesn't put you off then you will find Syriana a rewarding and thought-provoking experience.</fullReview>

Yes, there are multiple story tracks, but they are not hard to follow at all. It is quite clear when each story line appears, and it is really obvious how they interconnect.This movie provides insight to the consequences of our dependence on oil, and how that dependence is a spider web reaching everywhere with consequences. Your view point will be challenged no matter what your political persuasion. I think this movie gives a good picture of geopolitical issues, and how there are no simple answers. Even those who think they are doing the right thing, end up doing harm.The movie made me very angry as there doesn't appear to be anything an individual can do to make a difference.

Also the story with the two bombers is just like Paradise Now.

		<fullReview>"I cannot think that espionage can be recommended as a technique for building an impressive civilisation. It's a lout's game." Rebecca WestI don't think we will in our lifetimes see oil as anything less than the most influential commodity in the world. It will remain a fertile subject for world-wide espionage and the greed that drives it. For a film that devolves into a convoluted thriller, Stephen Gaghan's Syriana is yet a moody, menacing cautionary tale about volatile geopolitics.Once I actually figured out most of the intrigues, but not all, I really didn't care as much about them as I cared about whether or not the US and Saudi governments are so deeply partnered with oil companies that nothing can stop their tyranny. George Clooney's Bob Barnes, a stereotypically rumpled, overweight CIA operative cut out by the agency after years of service, represents the moral ambiguity of world trade as he navigates oil and assassination with equal world weariness. His epiphany as good but ultimately failed highlights the impossibility of the little guy's changing the system.Although the multiple story lines feel like Steven Soderbergh and Gaghan's Traffic, the lines are not as smoothly integrated, even with Barnes as protagonist and Prince Nasir Al-Subaai (Alexander Siddig) anchoring the reform-minded left. However, praise must be heaped on Hollywood for attempting a complicated plot that mirrors the dense underworld of global politics. Syriana is ultimately a figurative and literal nail-biter in which allegiances fade most sadly between parents and children while oil runs through them.The left turn at the film's conclusion shows where Clooney and Company's heart is, although they've tried to be balanced between left and right throughout. Like Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck, the Edward R. Murrow love fest, Syriana is a darkly sobering look at power on a grand scale, power that needs to be contained and directed toward peace, not a piece of the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is not just for entertainment, it has something to say. It makes you think. While the plot takes you around the world and characters flip between Farsi, English, and Arabic it's your job to keep track of what's going on and follow the story line. In truth it took me until the last third of the movie to get emotionally involved in the film because it was so intelligent that I kept getting stuck in my head instead of stuck in the film, but by its conclusion, I was whimpering in my seat, because the director and the actors took me there and I was rooting for the good-guys and booing the bad-guys just like in any other movie.I went to the premier with my boyfriend -- because the movie was involved with NRDC-- the National Resource Defence Council, the country's second largest environmental group. But I was just as excited as anyone else to be there because of the amazing talent that was displayed on screen. At the after-party my boyfriend points to Jeffrey Wright and says "see that's the famous guy who was in the theater, the one I told you about, who must of just been there to hang out and see the movie/ give support." Jeffrey Wright did such a good job with his character that my boyfriend didn't even recognize him when he was 20 feet away from his own image on screen. They were all believable, it was a full talent cast.I would recommend this film to everyone, it's tough, it's hard to follow, it will make you think, and it will hurt-- but it is worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On September 11, 2001, we were all asking why they hate us. "Syriana" looks at why. Taking the same gritty approach to geopolitics that "Traffic" took to the drug trade, the movie portrays several intertwined stories all relating to events in the Middle East. There's CIA agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney), energy analyst Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), CIA agent Bennett Holliday (Jeffrey Wright), corporate CEO Jimmy Pope (Chris Cooper), and some other characters who aren't really good or bad."Syriana" pulls no punches, and I should identify that this is not a movie for the squeamish.

		<shortDescription>Syriana should make Americans think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana didn't start out with the "based on real events" blurb, but minutes into the film, I forgot I wasn't watching a docu-drama. In an interview I saw with Clooney, he described the film as pure fiction, based on fact. Having seen the film, I feel the point is valid. I was so immersed in the intertwining story lines; trying to juxtapose them in my mind, and figure out where they were leading, that I could think of little else. I can't think of any other film that has wrapped my attention like that...at least none I've seen recently. Syriana is as dark as the oil that fuels its fire. It deals point-blank with big oil government, money grubbing, political corruption. The acts of atrocity are presented in a way that is not only believable, but in a manner that left me with a sickening feeling of helplessness. Syriana should make Americans think. In a day and age when Hollywood fluff and TV "reality" are mainstream giants designed to numb your senses to the deterioration of American society, it is refreshing to think; even if thinking is more like having a nightmare. Go see this film, and let it get under your skin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a cross between 'The Constant Gardener' and 'Fahrenheit 9/11'. The Prince Nasir Al-Subaai (Alexander Siddig) heir to the throne of Iran, has a mission to make life better in his country. But Bob Barnes (George Clooney), a deep CIA operative in the Middle East is trying to stop him. The problem is, he does not know he is being used.From writer/director Stephen Gaghan (winner of the Best Screenplay Academy Award for Traffic), this movie is a strong drama of one man being used as a pawn to stop another man's fight to make a difference in his country. When is it moral to put the interests of one country ahead of the well-being of another? This movie really illustrates how big business and big government can be a devastating force when working together. It demonstrates how with the right backing, large corporations can get away with almost anything.I enjoyed this film a great deal, it really makes you think. However, I feel most people might find it slow and hard to follow. If you are really intuitive, you might find it predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>provoking thought can be a very good thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana was fast, thoughtful, meaningful, and disturbing all at once. I have read the remarks of some movie goers who apparently felt this film was "too liberal" or "anti-american" for their taste. And yet if one follows the path of this film, which I feel is very carefully, albeit rapidly, laid out, there are many thought-provoking, poignant messages which call attention the the truths and tragic outcomes of some of our self-serving and inhumane, dare I say "anti-American" political actions - meaning that they represent the antithesis of what we supposedly stand for as Americans.The biggest challenge this movie may in fact have is drawing enough open-minded, intelligent movie-goers who are willing to take the time to exercise their minds a bit, widen their understanding, and enjoy a complex, yet very thought-provoking film. And as for this film being "too anti-American" or "liberal", I welcome the opportunity to view a "pro-American" "anti-liberal" film which so successfully conveys so many truths in such a straightforward manner, about the REAL leaders, i.e. U.S. corporations who are pulling the strings that are running our country - and other countries as well - into the ground. Provoking thought can be a very good thing. Time to wake up and demand change America!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trafficking Oil and Preaching to the Converted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2005 has been a great year for politically charged films, ranging from old-fashioned highly fictionalized throw-back thrillers like "The Interpreter", to searing, romantic and artistically astute literary adaptations like "The Constant Gardner" to quiet and classy period pieces with timely morals like "Good Night, and Good Luck." "Syriana" arrives late on the scene like gangbusters purporting to be the gritty no-holds-bar thriller that will shine light on the shady underside of our current energy crisis.Though ultimately a bit of a disappointment, "Syriana" is still far better than the Stephen Gaghan penned "Traffic"-the overrated, over-long multi-layered intertwining episode about the "War on Drugs." Here Gaghan serves as both writer and director, and given the current state of geopolitics, the subject matter here of terrorism, corruption, and oil trafficking is far more compelling and timely than his previous Oscar-winning effort.Though extremely well acted and marginally well made, "Syriana" suffers because it presents scenarios liberal-minded Americans already know too well thanks to movies like "Farhenheit 9/11" and the continued follies of the current Bush administration. Here we have greedy American oil companies and corrupt politicians putting in place a puppet regime in the Middle East to protect their interests and prevent the Chinese from gaining access to the energy source their burgeoning economy so badly needs. We also have the tale of a grizzled CIA operative (the excellent George Clooney) getting outed, a slick energy analyst (an equally good Matt Damon) looking to cash in on "the winning horse" in a fraternal power struggle for the Saudi crown, and a legal investigator (the underwhelming Jeffrey Wright) pegged to bring down some devious insiders as a PR sideshow designed to give the illusion of due diligence and deter people from seeing the true corruption behind all these overt mergers and acquisitions and covert assassinations.There are some white-knuckle moments, but the film relies on cheap manipulations (failed father-son relationships, a strained marriage, and the accidental death of child) to play on the audience's emotions. Ultimately none of these characters are very sympathetic because of these lame ploys, although there is an interesting side story about some suicide bombers that could've been more developed and should've provided the emotional core the film so badly wanted to create. Ultimately, the film depicts things we all know too well and offers no solutions to the problems. For all its supposed revelations it left me with a feeling of "so what?" because it never tried to make a statement about what we should do to curtail all this evil-doing.Side Note: Amanda Peet, the most underrated and misused actress of her generation, is excellent as Matt Damon's wife. Her brief screen time displays her natural charms and her ability to carry heavy drama. Here's hoping her agent convinces her to do more stuff like this instead of the inane comedies she normally finds herself headlining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>International Politics at its best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a movie that will blow your socks off with the story line alone, then Syriana is definitely the way to go. From the international politics to the acting everything is in place. Clooney shines as a CIA agent in the middle of bureaucratic warfare. Damon is interesting as an economic agent who gets caught up in the whirlwind oil game of a kingdom torn in it's ultimate agenda. From start to finish Syriana shines brighter than it's star studded cast. The story jumps around a lot but in the end everything comes a glorious finish. Based off of the book 'See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism' by Author: Robert Baer, this movie does for the general public what the news used to do, inform us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't find the movie confusing - it did make me think this was based on a very dense book. I found the screenplay to be tightly written and an excellent example of how to give us backstories and set up subplots without a lot of exposition.Are the good guys clear cut from the bad guys? Well, in a word, no. Almost no one in the piece is purely evil, and almost no one purely good.Yet the movie portrays the sacrifice in terms of human lives and dignity in the quest to control oil supplies and the political posturing and butt-covering that goes along with it.Without beating us over the head with it.As heavy as the activity is, the film is not heavy handed. We see the situation from all sides, from how oil can be the key to the self-determination of an emerging democracy - if it has the courage to defy the U.S. - to how shortsighted policies and the uneven distribution of wealth can leave a vacuum of poverty and despair within which fundamentalism - and terrorism - can take root. And we see how greed for money and power defy logic and cause governments to act against their own interests, and people to act against one another.The acting is superb in this film. Jeffrey Wright is always amazing to watch and in this case he hides his character's cards throughout but keeps us looking into his eyes for answers.Okay, I'll say it. Some people you expect to be fantastic and they don't disappoint: Christopher Plummer, William Hurt, Chris Cooper. Always superb.But when was the last time someone gave a rave review of George Clooney for his acting? Well at least not until this year. He was considered a "star" or a celeb or a hunky, funny, charismatic guy, and the key to his success as an actor seemed to be his very "George-ness".And then comes this year. Everything goes into the stratosphere for Mr. Clooney in 2005.There is no George to be found in this film. "Bob" is a complex, layered guy, who walks away from exploding cars like he's just put a nickel in the meter and is headed to pick up his cleaning but can't hide how much it hurts him that he can't be straight with his son. You believe he's fully capable of carrying out the cold threats he makes but he's also weary, confused, betrayed, desperate, helpless.Bob's face will haunt you after the film is over.As I said: Excellent film. Very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>piqued my interest in the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Syriana and found its complexity in plot and character arresting. I have a feeling that the book on which it is based would flesh out some of my questions. I saw the book title and author in the closing credits, but forgot it as soon as I left the theater. I have a feeling that the book is perhaps too dense for a complete adaptation. This is not a criticism of a book that I have not yet read. I have never had the experience of finding the book on which a movie is based to be less interesting than the spin-off movie. I also find the lack of attention to the author and his work to be shameful. Why should the person who originated the thoughts that led to this movie adaptation be relegated to a place deep in the credits and nowhere on this website that I can find? However, I really appreciate that the movie operated at a level of implication rather than taking the usual American movie tack of being too explicit about motivation, character and plot. If anybody knows the title and author, could you please post it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Price of War ala "Traffic"; One of the Year's Absolute Best Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SYRIANA (2005) **** George Clooney, Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Peet, William Hurt, Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper, Mazhar Munir, Robert Foxworth, Peter Gerety, Tim Blake Nelson, Alexander Siddig, Nadim Sawalha, Akbar Kurtha. The Price of War ala "Traffic"; One of the Year's Absolute Best FilmsThe state of the world today is no secret: it's a mess and largely full of blood and oil both equaling out to a quagmire of sand and despair in the Middle East where the geopolitical climate is at the boiling point of madness seeking sanity and in the end starting all over again where you began : a mirage of good intentions.Filmmaker Stephen Gaghan , who garnered an Academy Award for his multi- storied screenplay for "Traffic", incorporates more-or-less the same dichotomy for his pulse-pounding potboiler of international intrigue and human drama. Gaghan, who directs as well as written the intriguingly absorbing and dense screenplay, manages to keep several pots cooking to a fine boil by focusing on a disillusioned CIA op (a bearish Clooney in arguably his finest acting to date and should earn him an Oscar nod); an idealistic systems analyst (Damon at the top of his game); a scruples laden Washington, DC based attorney brooking to make waves and a name for himself (Wright, also in fine form) and an imploding young Arab desperate to make a living for himself (Munir).Gaghan lets all four story lines stray and finally intertwine into a fine tapestry of human turmoil as each protagonist faces the one universal truth: fear is a powerful thing and greed is a close second. Clooney's world-weary, bearded Bob Barnes (based loosely on real-life spook Robert Baer whose book Gaghan has adapted to his form-fitting production) is attempting to do the right thing in bringing to light the underpinnings of a Middle Eastern Emir about to abdicate his ruling to one of his sons, a prince who may have other agendas including monopolizing the world's oil conglomerates including one that Damon's young Bryan Woodman works for who's invite to the prince's palatial digs tragically ends for his youngest child in a horrible pool- related accident at a party the Emir has thrown. To show his respect the prince decides to give Woodman a significant amount of business and money; Woodman's slight weariness is only outweighed by his cynicism ("How much will you give me for my other son?" he sneers at first to the generous offering).Meanwhile Bennett Holiday (Wright) is attempting to find some loose fissures in another oil company in attempting to find a scapegoat for any loop-hole evading machinations that frankly is a tad confusing yet the results are anticipated whole-heartedly (and nicely skewered by a corrupt oilman played by a weaselly Nelson who gives a Gordon Gekko-ian speech that only rings too true for the idealistic Holiday).Munir proves to be the one recognizable Arab stereotype of a young man facing his metaphorically manacled character facing little choice except not resisting a zealotry leading to terrorism that is probably all too likely so true as well.Tightly constructed with a fierce grip on the worldwide pulse of current events, Gaghan and company displays a real social study in harvesting a global communities' dream and curse: attempting to do the right thing in a tempest in tea cup that is only continuing to gain momentum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>simply the best movie of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana is written and directed by Stephen Gaghan (Traffic, Havoc). This is one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. It has really strong dialog, outstanding drama and great thrilling moments. But as I got tangled within the story, there were points in the movie where I couldn't tell a person whats going on yet oddly enough, I never felt lost.In a departure from his usual, cocky roles, George Clooney plays Bob Barnes, a CIA operative who is trying to stop the Persian prince (played by Alexander Siddig) yet doesn't know he is being used. Clooney brings an intensity to the role of Bob Barnes, and its such a complex performance. He is constantly believable as Barnes. Count on an Oscar Nomination for Clooney.Jeffrey Wright plays Bennett Holiday Jr. a lawyer who is trying to uncover corruption between the merger of two oil companies. What Wright does is, without question, OUTSTANDING. Of all performances, I think Wright delivers one of the best, this side of Clooney's performance.All in all, politics aside, Syriana contains GREAT film-making and acting all around. All the actors contribute their best, to get this message out there. The message they are trying to convey is: We're running out of oil, and there might not be enough to go around. The title literally means, "the price of oil" and this movie shows what oil can do to society. This is the best movie of the year, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film - if you can keep up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the end of Syriana, when the credits began to roll and the lights slowly relit the capacity seated theatre, I sat in my seat for what must have been an eternity just trying to process and interpret what I just saw.Now that is not a bad thing mind you. In fact, five or six hours now removed from the experience, I think it was actually a wonderful frame of mind to be in after just this type of film.What exactly is this type? Well, you have the writer of Traffic who goes behind the camera with a $50 million promisary note from the studio and stars with the last names of Clooney, Damon, Cooper and Plummer being attracted to your screenplay like mosquitoes to a blue light. All signs therefore have this film pointing towards mainstream blockbuster potential. You know, asteroid hitting the earth with dialogue that even your 5-year old nephew would laugh at, but done with pretty people in even prettier locations.But not Syriana. Instead, director Stephen Gaghan (who also wrote the very good Havoc now on DVD), puts up on the big screen maybe one of the most complex and interesting stories that the multiplexes have seen in some time. Nothing therefore is typical about Syriana.To tell you the story would reveal that I have figured it out (I am getting closer..) and that would be a misrepresentation. Here's what I can tell you. Through multiple locations and various story lines, we follow the lives of three central characters. First, there is Bob Barnes (George Clooney). Bob is a government operative who finds himself in places like Beirut and Iran trying to bring American justice to the Middle East. His methods and motives are right out of modern day spy novels complete with denial, deception and torture. When an arms deal goes bad that Bob was arranging, Bob is extracted back to the United States to a desk job in Washington in hopes that the story eventually buries itself.Simultaneously, we have the story of Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon in maybe his strongest performance to date) an economic wondermind that finds himself working for an eventual heir to the Emir throne after his son is accidentally electrocuted in the palace pool. Living with the demons of knowing he is working for those that were indirectly responsible for his son's death, Bryan neglects his remaining family to provide financial advice to the Prince in his attempt to bring stabilization to the regions economy.And while all this is going on abroad, back in the good ole USA, Bennett Holliday (Jeffrey Wright) is the hired hand in a firm investigating the backend dealings of a major oil conglomerate merger. With ties to both resources in both America and the Middle East, this third storyline connects the other two ? not directly, but by highlighting the notion that oil is the primary reason why the West has any interest in the financial or economic well being of the region. Holliday's relentless search for fall guys uncovers a world that that only the most in-depth 60 Minutes investigation could uncover. One with corruption leading to some of the biggest heads of corporate industry and where greed is so accepted that Gordon Gekko might even turn his head in disgust.The result of these stories which somehow intersect is as complex and as gripping a screenplay that Hollywood has likely seen greenlit in some time. The result therefore is mixed. You will unlikely be able to refute that the acting is top rate. Clooney and Damon in particular give maybe the best performances of their careers and their supporting cast is no less stellar.But like reading a Tom Clancy novel, this adaptation of a Robert Baer book (See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism) jumps from country to country and storyline to storyline with head turning swiftness where the only way to understand what is probably one of the best movies of the year is to get out of your seat at the end of the film, go back to the box office and buy another ticket to see it all again.www.robertsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inflammatory, confusing, emotional, and Important.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Syriana" is an inflammatory, confusing, intelligent, emotional, and ultimately important work by the writer of "Traffic". That film wove together four story lines with four different protagonists on different sides of America's War on Drugs. This film acts similarly, weaving together the lives of four men as they navigate the consequences that come about as Western interests stake their claims on the world's ever-dwindling supply of Oil in the Middle East. "Traffic" negotiated its complicated story (which took place in the U.S. and Mexico) by walking clear and understandable moral lines to American audiences: drugs are a terrible evil, but family and loyalty are the ultimate good, and the two poles are not necessarily mutually exclusive. "Syriana" is morally hazier than "Traffic", and plays sort of like the next class up in Big Idea screen writing - "Traffic" is the prerequisite, and if you could follow it no problem, you're probably smart enough for "Syriana".Bob Barnes (George Clooney), a world-worn CIA agent adept at getting his hands dirty in fun locations like Tehran and Beirut, is the first of the four (for lack of a better word) protagonists. Thought to be a liability by his superiors, he's given one last assignment, to arrange the assassination of Prince Nasr (Alexander Siddig), a royal from an unnamed Arab Emirate who awarded an oil contract to the Chinese after they outbid an American company. Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst who becomes the economic adviser to Nasr following the tragic death of Woodman's son at the Prince's estate. Meanwhile, back in the U.S., Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright), an attorney for Connex Oil, investigates his superiors in order to get a merger with another company, Killen Oil, approved by the Department of Justice. And, back in the Emirate, a young Pakistani man named Wasim Khan (Mazhar Munir) loses his job at the Connex plant when the Chinese take over, and from his economic hardship becomes seduced into radical Islamic fundamentalism. All of these stories intersect each other as each of these men must make decisions to do the Right thing, or do the most Advantageous thing, in what one character calls "a fight to the death." Ultimately, though, the film has a dark and upsetting message: that it is in the West's business interests not to ignore the hardship and chaos in the Middle East, but to encourage it.Ensemble films often come with their own trouble: not having one single character provides the danger of painting everything with a broad brush. Gaghan twists this by providing all the characters with a moral ambiguity that is at the heart of this film's politics. The scenes between Woodman and his wife Julie (Amanda Peet), as she is horrified at how he is profiting off of the death of their son, are painful and glorious at the same time. The quiet way that Holiday is taken into one-on-one conversations and back rooms and corners by members of the Connex and Killen corporations, each trying to shape the quiet man, complicates what ultimately happens with the merger. Barnes seems to constantly be at war within himself, about whether he's weary of feeling bad for the things he's doing, or just weary of doing the only thing he knows how. The film is also helped by a theme of the disconnect between fathers and sons, reminding me that the best films about business are those in which the young go-getter seeks out another paterfamilias in a world of money when the one at home wasn't sufficient (think "Wall Street").The performances are all very strong. Clooney put on 35 lbs for the film, and hiding behind the weight and the beard allows him to almost hide inside himself, a man who had to literally build a thick skin as he realized how few people could understand the world he lives in. Damon is also strong, playing a character with enough seething energy that, in the hands of another actor, might have come off like a bland everyman or an overplayed twit. Wright and Munir allow themselves a quiet, smart observation--you believe their transformations not because the people around them are charismatic (which they are), but because you can see them being filled up by the new worlds they are entering. There is also fine supporting work, possibly the best coming from Siddig as Prince Nasr, a charismatic leader and tragic hero of the film, and Chris Cooper, the head of Killen Oil, who tears around a Board of Directors meeting reminding everyone why he's the only one in the room who doesn't have to wear an uncomfortable-looking suit.The real central performance, however, is the politics, ideas, and information in the film. At times, the plot points can be a bit confusing as we discover the intricacies of what is going on. This is a good idea, however, because it forces the audience to pay attention to what is going on, allowing them to better absorb the complexities of Oil policy. There are a lot of Big Speeches, but these are people who deal with the Big Picture, and I'd much rather seem smart people making smart points than dumb people talking big for the sake of talking. This film provides an interesting template for films that want to take on complex subjects that affect the whole world. It doesn't just tell interesting stories but opens the audience up to the idea that the world doesn't work in black &amp; white (as it often does in the movies), people do bad things in the Real World, but not always for bad reasons, and people do good things, and the world can be left off in worse shape. With this moral ambiguity and the specificity of the politics and situations, "Syriana" is one of the smartest films I've ever seen. Hollywood should be making more films like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly complex and engrossing political thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Syriana" is a film that will instantly be dismissed by many because of its narrative structure, a majority of people walking out of the screening that I attended were confused and puzzled. If everything you watch on film fails to make sense, its only because a majority of everything that occurs politically in today's world defies logic. It's a film that doesn't exactly explain how every subplot, character, or scenario, is connected, its a movie that works effectively on each and every scene. It's a film that is so vivid, you feel as if the camera is just eavesdroping. With all that being said, writer-director Steven Gaghanhas made one of the most engrossing and complex films you will see at your multiplex.By far one of the most ambitious Hollywood movies of the year, Gaghan has created a bold, intelligent, and rewarding movie that says something politically and equally profoundly.With the hyper-link structure that resembles the narrative of "Traffic",( which Gaghan also wrote the script for and Steven Soderbergh directed superbly). The film explores about a dozen characters in five different stories, which in the end are all connected in the reality of big business. Steve Gaghan has created a brilliant film that should not be ingored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent and compelling movie...well worth the wait!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Syriana" on Sunday, and I have one word : excellent! For those people who were expecting more...first of all this is not an action movie, so if you watched the trailer, and will be expecting some brain-dead action movie a la "The Recruit" or "Spy Games" you can forget it. This is not "The Bourne Supremacy" or "Mission Impossible" or "James Bond...".This is a movie for people who read and think and can put together complete and coherent sentences. This movie will challenge its audiences and offer no answers, except those that oneself can formulate or deduce through his/her own thought process. If your vocabulary consists of using repeatedly the phrases "like","stuff" and "that's hot", then perhaps this movie is not for you. You will better off watching "Doom" or better yet go and rent "Glitter" or "Gigli".I saw somewhere a negative review saying that the movie's major flaw was the fact that it "lacks humanity". Actually, I thought that that phrase encompasses exactly the feel of the movie. It is a brutal, unforgiving look at the means and ends game involving politics, economics and society, a mesh of thirst for power, boundless and unchecked ambition, profit and the calculated process of dehumanization which occurs when those interests collude, the end result being loss and suffering on a personal but also large scale. There are no heroes, alas, in this movie and there is no redemption to be found as it is not sought, save by a few of the characters and that only because they are forced to.I hope I did not give away anything important. Anyways this is my take on the movie. If you want to see something different than your usual Hollywood pop-corn fare, well "Syriana" is that movie. Easily the best movie of the year and of many years and certainly one of the most important. If not, well that is OK also, this is just my own preference, and who is to say its worth anything...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK this movie is perfectly crafted, the production values are the best you can expect. So what?The story itself is quite heavy. Since it's perfectly crafted (waterproof 100% goodwill film-making) it keeps your interest all along, but wait, there are 4-5 main story lines. Sure it's not supposed to be pure escapism, entertainment for the masses, yet this is really pompous. What's the point of putting so much energy in telling us the world is rotting/rotten/absurdly suicidal?Eventually it feels like the work of an elite too self-conscious about understanding some of the World's Big Issues that they absolutely want to tell us, their - perfectly crafted - way, about it. Without creating a more powerful, if simpler, story to take the time to make it resonate further with people. Just like that, because they are so clever, we should just watch and listen. But cinema, at its best, is not about taking stories to put on the Big Screen - that's only half the job: the technical intent, it is about writing for an audience.And what about having a real vision and suggesting a glimmer of hope in a thoroughly depressing movie?</fullReview>

If you can follow what is going on and understand and care about some of the characters you may well enjoy the movie. But don't expect a simple, easy to follow experience.

George Clooney and Matt Damon are tearing up Hollywood with great, social commentaries and truth pieces such as Syriana. This is the only movie Harrison Ford regrets having turned down.Everyone in the military should watch this movie because it reveals the aggressive, offensive nature of the military which serves as a hit-man for the corporate oil boys in the US.</fullReview>

Just because a movie deals with an important and topical subject matter doesn't make it good. So everyone is comparing this to TRAFFIC which won Stephen Gaghan a screen writing Oscar. However, that superior film owes its merits to Steven Soderbergh's far sharper direction and the original source material, the BBC mini-series TRAFFIK, which told a far more fleshed-out and nuanced story than its American "remake". Left to his own devices, Gaghan meanders and flounders. The whole Jeffrey Wright thread of the story is tedious and has been better told in countless other movies. (Try ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM for a far more compelling, truth-is-stronger-than-fiction take on the corruption and abuse of power.) It's the first time I've seen Wright give a dull performance. Christopher Plummer's turn borders on caricature. And William Hurt puts in one of his patented squinty-eyed cameos that almost negates his uproarious work in A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. Ultimately, I think Gaghan is guilty of mistaking a confusing overstuffed narrative for a intriguingly complex one. And his directorial abilities (as evidenced by his underwhelming first effort ABANDON) need honing. The scene with Matt Damon's kid at the pool was so ineptly executed I still don't quite know what transpired, although the tragic outcome was clear. The downbeat ending was realistic but it felt extremely contrived getting there. Where's Alan J. Pakula (RIP) when we need him? And as for why suicide bombers become suicide bombers, go rent PARADISE NOW.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most remarkable commentaries of our world I have seen to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film makes no apologies or excuses. It just tells the story of developed economies' dependence on oil and the lengths people and organisations go to to obtain it and control its flow. It brings together both the economic and human elements of this entrenched commodity and with an even, unhysterical hand tells the stories of all those involved in the oil industry in a manner that is so engaging you are left feeling disappointed that the film comes to an end.Its complex multiple-threaded plot is easy to follow - you know, up front, how these multiple story lines tie in together, but it is in the detail where the film's strength lies. You may know or suspect the connections between the stories but the it is in revealing the details that the film enthrals the audience.If you have ever wanted to understand the oil industry and how economies, business and politics are entrenched in it, this is the film to watch. And learn. The stories are beautifully told, with the right measure of emotional engagement with the characters balanced against enough detachment that you don't find yourself rooting for any one faction. Instead, you watch as the characters move, indelibly, towards an end that is terrible in its inevitability.See this film if you want to understand some home truths about our world and cultures. It is truly remarkable and warrants multiple viewings to catch the subtle nuances of both the story and performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gaghans film about oil tycooning, dirty politics and connections in the MIddle east is beautiful, thought provoking, and everything a political thriller should be. I disagree with those who found this film boring, or not coherent, it makes perfect sense to me, and every single scene is there for a reason. The cast do real well, especially Clooney who plays agent Bob Barnes, the film combines issues between CIA, arab tycoons, oil companies, etc... brilliantly. I thought this was a great picture, one of the best of last year. It is certainly worthy of all its praise, a great screenplay and great performance from the cast.

		<fullReview>Syrianna is a riveting political thriller about a very hot button issue, the oil crisis, that few people really know much about beyond the numbers that appear on gas station billboards. It was released at the right time of year so that its inevitable Oscar buzz considerations will give the material added weight which might have been what the exec producers (including the politically active George Clooney and producing partner Steven Sodebergh) were going for. Still, it's not an overtly political film. It doesn't seek to point fingers at an administration although with our overly polarized political culture today, people are bound to dismiss it as left wing propaganda, and that's unfortunate because a work of art like this deserves to be treated as art rather than politics.The main criticism, as far as I can tell, is that the plot is too complex for the average viewer, but that's partially the point: that the oil crisis is a complex matter and that's why an easy solution isn't in the works. I'll concede that this wasn't necessarily a smart move on the filmmakers' behalf to clutter up the start of the film rather than provide an attention-grabbing opening, but the film gets easier to swallow as it goes along. Matt Damon deals with a strained marriage and the tragedy of his 6-year old son's death but sees an opportunity for an unlikely friendship and business pairing with an enlightened Arab prince. George Clooney plays a CIA operative with an estranged son and wife who treats covert operations and killing like any other 9-to-5 job until he gets betrayed by his government. Jeffery Wright plays a cold and methodical lobbyist hired to find and weed out the corrupt link in an oil merger and he's equally at ease playing a game of racquetball with his suspect as he is calling him out before the board on his corruption. And then there are the two Arab youths looking for jobs who befriend a shady man and eventually become suicide bombers. It's the human dimensions of these stories and the way Stephen Gaughan masterfully weaves them together that make the movie so engaging as the movie moves past a cluttered-up start.Credit director Stephen Gaughan, who is making his directorial debut after winning an Oscar as the screenwriter for Traffic, appears to be a disciple of Stephen Sodebegh's school of film-making, as he copies some of Sodebergh's tricks: showing only parts of conversations to make it appear as though we're coming in midway, on-location shooting with an independent feel, bridging different places together illustrated by text, etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As art, "Syriana" is hardly a great movie. It's slow-paced and borderline boring at times. It strives for understatement and subtlety, but what it offers is an obvious, predictable plot with vague details. It's easy to watch the film and come away not being sure exactly who some of the characters are.Most modern films bend over backwards to explain everything, and this gets old fast. Syriana, unfortunately, strives too hard to go in the opposite direction. It wants to be a cerebral thriller, but the edits cut back and forth between the various characters so fast we never get a feel for who they are.While some viewers may be confused about the details, the basic plot is blindingly obvious and you can see the end coming a mile away. Presumably this film is intended as a criticism of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. In "Syriana", the ultimate villains are the oil companies. Chris Cooper, in a fine performance that far outshines Clooney's, plays an oil company executive and delivers a memorable speech about corruption being the best way to do business.I'm not sure how one could view this film as not being political, since it's commenting on U.S. foreign policy in an obvious way, but it's safe to say that if you're conservative, you will find this movie leftist. If you're more liberal, you'll probably see it as scathingly accurate. As for me, politics aside, I found it mostly dull and uninvolving. Given the hype and its Oscar win, it was a big disappointment.As political commentary, it leaves a lot to be desired. As entertainment, it isn't very compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful movie, but could've been a bit more interestingly told/ 6.5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana is the archetypal movie that had a great message, storyline, writing, and acting, but which could have benefited from a slightly more interesting delivery. While nowhere near as slow-paced as the much-hyped "English Patient," "Syriana" was, surprisingly, a movie that took its time. Part of the problem was with the way the movie had been promoted, i.e., as a fast-paced, action thriller, which made audiences expect more tangible action at the beginning of the movie than it actually delivered. The first time I went to see this movie, the person I was with feel asleep during the first 15-20 minutes, and we ended up leaving the theater. I am really glad that I decided to give this movie a second look on my own.Syriana was the type of movie that delayed gratification a bit, but if you stuck around through the middle and end of the movie, the wait was well worth it. After the initial warm-up period (which was, admittedly, on the long side), "Syriana" evolved into a taught, smartly told international espionage thriller that held my interest until the end. The cast did an admirable job on this film; it was nice to see Clooney try the action/spy hero with a bit of a more serious twist than we've seen in the Ocean's Eleven movies and the like.The only reason why I give this movie a 6.5 is the agonizingly-slow lead-up. "Syriana" is not a movie for instant-gratification types, and you have to be in the mood to deal with heavy subject matter when you watch it. But if you're up to the task, the movie does not disappoint.</fullReview>

It was hard to follow and seems like the type of movie you have to watch a few times to really absorb everything. It's like it was trying too hard to be one of those "hip" movies. The kind where they show you 5 different characters and slowly their story comes together. Well, in this movie their stories really didn't go anywhere. I think a different director should have been used.I would recommend it definitely. Great acting jobs and I really admire George Clooney's skills as well. Not a MUST SEE action adventure, but something you should sit at home and watch on a boring Sunday evening. Something that will give you something to think about the next day while daydreaming at work.</fullReview>

At a rapid pace that may cause some confusion and then what seems like lulls to let your brain digest. The talented George Clooney proves why he is a man to be reckoned with. His role as a government operative and international adviser is strong and compelling. SYRIANA deals with greed, cheap labor, international politics, terrorism, assassination and it all revolves around oil...who has it and who wants it.Matt Damon is a small businessman that becomes the financial adviser for a Middle Eastern prince(Alexander Siddig)who is afraid of not getting to assume control of his father's oil dealings. Jeffrey Wright plays an oil company official that is being swayed by the government to expose corruption as part of questionable oil company transactions. Also in support are: Amanda Peet, Christopher Plummer, Amr Waked, Robert Foxworth, Chris Cooper, Tim Blake Nelson, Daisy Torme and William Hurt. SYRIANA is expectedly big, a bit messy and full of intrigue, tension and flashy entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We get to see pieces of the lives of some people in an interleaved fashion. The main problem with this film that I have is that I hardly cared for the characters. We mostly don't know what their intentions, hopes, and plans are, we only see what they do, and that is either not very interesting or does not make much sense. And unfortunately the film fails to make up for this problem in other ways.The story (or what goes for it) is a little hard to get hold of, given the style of telling it, but after talking with a friend and reading the comments here, I pretty much understood all of it already when watching the film. It's just that there is not an interesting story to understand. As for the political content, this film does not tell me something I don't know. Overall I felt somewhat bored while watching this film.This film reminded me of the book "The Sheep Look Up" by John Brunner, both in it's style of interleaving the story lines of different people, and in the way that this style is used to paint a picture of society and politics. However, I did enjoy "The Sheep Look Up", in contrast to "Syriana"; I think the book made me care for the characters, but I have read it a long time ago, so I am not sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a thriller 'Syriana' isn't particularly thrilling. It has much of worth to say about the responsibility of the West for the continuing crisis in the Middle East, and about the duplicities of the oil industry, internationally, but the overall tone of Steven Gaghan's script is so polemical and the outcome (in broad terms) predictable that it loses momentum.That's not to say it isn't an entertaining film. It is. There are splendid performances from principals Clooney, Damon, the underrated Jeffrey Wright and Siddig, and superb supporting turns from the likes of Chris Cooper, Tim Blake Nelson, Amanda Peet, William Hurt and (at his most reptilian) Christopher Plummer. The film has much of worth to say about the consequences of American foreign policy with regard to the oil trade and the wilful manipulations of Arab states. There are some electric sequences, too, but ? the occasional explosion aside ? very few surprises. It's too damned expository.Part of the problem concerns the three leading men ? the CIA operative (Clooney), the economic adviser (Damon) and the lawyer investigating possible corruption within the US oil trade (Wright). The first is a patriot who manipulates or murders on the orders of his government, and who is surprised when he is in turn manipulated. The interests of the second are entirely governed by profit. The third seeks corruption, but profits, professionally, from selling out one of his bosses to another. This may, perhaps, be an attempt to signal to audiences that these are not reactionary anti-American caricatures ? the characters all have a vested interest in the status quo ? but they are not particularly likable. Neither are they virtuous or heroic ? though a last-gasp attempt is made to turn Clooney's conflicted agent into such a character ? though even his change of perspective is principally prompted by being made a whipping-boy by his agency rather than altruism. Unfortunately this effort is too little too late, and the character's motivations are rather muddled by the labyrinthine plotting.It's an interesting film, but if I didn't share the liberal politics of the film-makers I don't think I would necessarily have thought so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Written and directed by Stephen Gaghan - who wrote the screenplay for "Traffic" - this accomplished political thriller owes a lot to George Clooney who both acts as an executive producer and takes on the key role (for which he put on 35lb in a month but won an Academy Award) of embittered CIA agent Bob Barnes (a reference to Robert Baer who wrote the novel on which the movie is based).There are multiple story lines, characters and locations, so that one frequently struggles to understand what is going on and how each element relates to all the others, but there is fine acting - with familiar faces such as Matt Damon, Chris Cooper, Christopher Plummer &amp; William Hurt as well as opportunities for able Arab actors - and the sort of cinematography that draws one irresistibly into the action.At times the message is thumped home too bluntly (there is a little speech concluding "Corruption is why we win"), but this indictment of the machinations around the American oil industry and its political backers is compelling and challenging cinema - as well as uncomfortably topical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Syriana was one of the most claustrophobic movie-going experiences of my life, so in that detail I can honestly call it memorable: in all other respects it fails abjectly.The film is marketed as a tense, gritty thriller exposing the corrupt and unscrupulous oil industry of the USA, and its links with the Middle East. However, I can report emphatically that Syriana does not do what it says on the tin. To understand and to be able to wade through the plot requires either a PhD in oil analysis or the attention span and brain capacity of a member of MENSA. It says a lot about a film when you come out unable to remember the names of any characters. And I mean that in a bad way.One of the main problems is that writer-director Stephen Gaghan seems determined to cram into one film enough material for ten. The way in which Gaghan's script flits from place to place means that the audience is never with any character long enough to build up a rapport with them. As a result, Syriana never packs the emotional punch that could have given it the extra edge to make it engrossing.George Clooney puts in a decent performance - quite an achievement considering what he had to work with - but in my opinion he didn't do enough to deserve an Oscar. Matt Damon is steadfast and resolutely wooden: although I don't know how much he can be blamed for that given the aforementioned script malfunction.The direction is not brilliant either. In order the accommodate the more than numerous facets and tributaries of the script Gaghan is inclined to dart from one story line to another in the space of minutes. The result is a choppy mismatch; never in one place long enough to actually work out who anyone is: and shaky camera work that left me feeling more than a little motion sick.I appreciate the message of the film and the issue it is trying to expose, but I left the cinema feeling almost numb because I just didn't care. Joe Viewer is by no means stupid, but even he needs a vaguely comprehensible story line to engross himself in a film. It is obvious that the producers behind Syriana feel very strongly about the subject: however if they are hoping to have created a courageous expose of the nasty oil industry then I am sorry to say they will be disappointed.Syriana is not a bad film, but is a testament to the fact that good intentions do not always equate to a good film. Syriana is a testament to what could have been. With a lot less characters and a marginally less complicated plot, the film could have been a very effective insight into corruption and its effects. But sadly, what it has ended up as is an overcomplicated and uninteresting film that is quite frankly headache inducing.</fullReview>

One is left wondering why certain scenes and characters were ever included in the first place - certainly the film would have benefited from their omission. The film's slogan is that "everything is connected." Perhaps it is in the real world, but on screen it comes across as completely disconnected!Syriana also fails to capture the true atmosphere of the Middle East. If either scriptwriter or director have spent any considerable time in the region, it certainly fails to come across. The cinematography is at best average and fails to do justice to an otherwise fascinating part of the world.

		<fullReview>Somewhat confusing, sometimes frustrating, Syriana is, for its byzantine entirety a thought-provoking, complex and interesting endeavour. At its centerpiece is the world's most fascinating political and cultural paradox - the world's leading power, largely and ostensibly a liberal and democratic state, and the world's primary energy region, theocratic and inegalitarian, forced by the realities of economics and geopolitics into a scorpion embrace with its immoral counterpart. This is the point we find ourselves in now that fossil fuel production has passed its zenith, and a new ideological battle between Westernism and fundamental Islam has quickly supplanted the brief and ill-defined 'End of History'. What this means for the chess-piece characters of Syriana is compromise, intrigue, each operating in a hall-of-mirrors where, even if the character can see through to his intent, cannot see all its implications, whether it be a military coup, a government whitewash or a missile ramming a gas tanker. The only potential veer towards liberal political simplicity is a perhaps naive portrayal of the Emir's first son - a reformer, but not a Western stooge and therefore subject, Tom Clancy-style to the obligatory Cruise-missile diplomacy which has become a bit of a cliché of American spy films. The CIA is far too subtle to assassinate aspiring heads of state with traceable ship-launched ballistics. The Clooney Lebanon plot is more stylish, and for that matter, teeth-clenchingly entertaining. In the end, we are never quite sure from our suburban perspective, whether this is what spies and terrorists are like, or what the movies like to tell us they're like. But then, bad things are happening to bad people all over the place, so there must be an element of authenticity. You may feel disorientated for the first hour or so, then captivated, and eventually liberated by Syriana.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Gaghan, the scribe responsible for "Rules Of Engangement" (2000) and "Traffic" (2000) confuses us even further in his directorial debut "Syriana" about the vast intertwining tales of the oil industry. George Clooney plays a CIA operative sent to knock off a Persian King-to-be, yet gets more than he bargained for on his journey. Matt Damon plays an energy-analyst mourning the death of his eldest son. Jeffrey Wright is a lawyer sent to investigate the ramifications behind the merger of two oil companies - Connex and Killeen. Mazhar Munir is a Pakistani teenager who falls prey to the recruitment of Terrorism in the Middle East. Each story seems to have a sub-plot involving father/son relationships, and the various struggles each member goes through. As Gaghan points out in the tag line "Everything Is Connected".Gaghan, not the best storyteller in the world, deliberately withholds information from his audience in order to throw surprises at us. There are moments of true shock in Syriana, yet the story itself is hard to follow anyway. To explain the plot in detail would be a futile exercise. The basic outlines are all there, everyone plays a part in the desperation of the USA's dependence on foreign oil. Gaghan is implying that the US is willing to stretch and/or break the law in order to continue it's stranglehold on the middle east. But as a piece of dramatic entertainment it just doesn't work. Political thrillers that overcome their own complexities, Michael Mann's The Insider being a great example, are ones that offer emotional access as well as intelligent design. His heart is certainly in the right place, and he clearly has the talent at his disposal. But trying to figure out the various over-circuitous story lines in "Syriana" gave me more than just a headache.George Clooney won a deserved Oscar for his portrayal of an ageing CIA agent who struggles with his son and is manipulated by his own government. Indeed, the whole cast do their best, but in the end, you are left feeling hollow. "Syriana" relays a message that we already agree with, and does it intelligently and well-played. But it just doesn't involve it's audience enough to truly outrage, or even effect us. An intelligent, weighty, yet ultimately incoherent piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't try to restate or expand upon previous reviews found here for Syriana. Many contributors have offered a better reviews of the content of Syriana than I could describe. But I will point out that whether Syriana is for you or not, has more to do with the movie-goer, than the movie itself. Consider: 1) Can you check your political prejudices at the front door? 2) Are you willing to attempt to follow four "chess games" simultaneously? 3) Have you the courage to feel really upset at the end? If you can answer "YES" to all three questions, then Syriana may just be one of the most worthwhile movie releases of 2005. If you answered "NO" to any of these points, you'd better pass on Syriana.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An undeniably powerful but puzzling liberal lecture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The writer of Traffic, Stephen Gaghan, digs even deeper into corruption with this much ballyhooed political thriller.Like Traffic, there are several plot threads that all eventually weave together into a whole. Whereas Traffic's central theme was the corruption that resulted from drug trafficking, Syriana's is the corruption that springs from large corporations and the battle for control of the world's oil supply. One subplot involves CIA operative Bob Barnes (George Clooney) and his efforts to discover the truth about the whole situation, which brings about rather gruesome results. Another subplot involves the merger of two oil companies, Connex and Killen. Then there's the prince (Alexander Siddig) who has plans to carry out liberal reforms that will help his country obtain full value for their oil. He forms a partnership with a troubled energy analyst played by Matt Damon. On top of all this, Syriana also takes time to focus on the trials and tribulations of a group of Pakistani teenagers, and some laid off Middle Eastern workers.I personally regard Syriana as a brave and complex motion picture, and for those reasons it stands out among 2005's motion pictures.As I hinted in my review of Munich, however, bravery and complexity are not enough when it comes to making a great movie. A film such as this one needs to focus more clearly on what it is dealing with. For a portion of its running time, Syriana is - quite literally - all over the place. (Traffic shared a similar flaw; Gaghan tried to fit so much into his screenplay for that film that the director, Steven Soderbergh, had to fight valiantly to keep it under control.) At times, Syriana plays like a more adult, less violent version of Three Kings (which, incidentally, is no bad thing, considering how highly I regard that film). There are many moments where it is really effective at being the Very Important Message Movie that it wants to be, with regards to not only oil and government, but also family values. Unfortunately Syriana treads a fine line between conveying a serious message and being liberal propaganda - I didn't believe that Gaghan was ambiguous enough in his treatment of the material.At least his cast don't put a foot wrong. Any cast which includes George Clooney, Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer and William Hurt is an impressive one by me. And there are many surprises here. No, I'm not talking about Clooney's weight gain and beard - he'd have been almost as effective had he been slightly less unkempt (although I'm not knocking his performance). Rather, Matt Damon, who eventually won me over as a family man despite his interminably young features. Amanda Peet and Jeffrey Wright (recently seen in Broken Flowers) do their reputations no harm either, and Alexander Siddig (impressive in the underrated Kingdom Of Heaven) continues to enhance his.It's very difficult for me to put a finger on Syriana. On one hand, it's intelligent, it asks questions and leaves plenty of food for thought - on the other hand, it's incoherent, at times blatantly one-sided and occasionally reliant on cheap tricks to keep the audience interested. It's like a lesser Munich, the difference being Spielberg has a better grasp of how to keep the audience involved. However, I admire Syriana's subject matter and general refusal to compromise, and for its artistic value alone, I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are all kinds of things to look for in a movie: casting, acting, story, cinematography , editing, music, etc. The sum of all these parts is what makes the complete movie rating and the better they are the closer to that perfect 10 the movie gets. When many of these are good, and many bad, you get a mediocre movie. The problem with this movie is that in almost all respects each of these values is quite good -- but somehow the sum doesn't add up to a 10. I can't put my finger on exactly went wrong. . .My friend who saw the movie with me hated another movie that was paced similarly, had the same star (George Clooney) and started with an "S" - Solaris. He hated this movie more. I personally liked Solaris. Two totally different movies except for perhaps the star and pacing.There is a lot going on in Syriana, a lot of different characters with different stories, which are all very complex and fit into a much more complex story. Perhaps its just overwhelmingly draining. It takes a lot of energy to keep up with it all, and all of it is relevant to the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes that's right. Another slow movie with documentary approach, praised universally by the critics. Strong cast with excellent acting and global story that affects us all, no matter where on this planet You are set.The story is divided in few sub stories and is unpredictable how it is going to end. Who will win the battle, the rebels or the machinery? Overall interesting, but still ends with an average score. Why? I am not sure, but maybe too slow, too documentary, too soon cut scenes, too political, too many characters with few of them partially unfinished, not enough emotions... so though it had an interesting ending I didn't care too much.Just for the record, one of my favorites are 21 Grams and Babel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grimy look in a plot less film about the rapacious desire for oil.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a nice thing that Syriana directed by Stephen Gaghan (who wrote Soderberg's film Traffic)is a plot less film about the dealings made in the world of oil trade as it avoids the pitfalls of a documentary film. A documentary film about the Macchiavellian tactics employed in global oil business would surely necessitate enormous hard work and since it is a tough thing to do so,it is hardly surprising that not many film makers have decided to work on it.Syriana is the only work of art made in recent times which comes closer to a somewhat meaningful and accurate first hand view of oil trade industry.Syriana is a very relevant statement on the pitiful state of our contemporary world in which policy makers,diplomats decide the fate of our world through their weird corrupt policies which are intended to further their own personal interests.Syriana appears to be fair as no one involved in the greed for oil is spared.To do so the director has taken us on a whirlwind tour of various places where oil dealings take place.Despite its major star cast this film never loses its equilibrium and stays well within its focus.It is definitely one of those films which the policy makers would like to eschew due to its subtle yet explosive content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important, Well Made, Confusing - But You Knew All That</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Syriana" is important, well made, and confusing. But, you probably know all that from reviews.Yes, it is all about America and the West selling our souls to service our addiction to petroleum in the Middle East. There are really rich, really powerful CIA agents, FBI agents, oil men, and lawyers cutting really dirty deals, sleeping with foul enemies, and sacrificing any integrity they or the US have ever had just to get to more money, more power, and more oil.It's about corrupt Middle Eastern leaders who live filthy rich lives and don't much care about where all that money comes from, or how long it is going to last, or what their people will do after the oil runs out, which it will do, as the movie points out, and soon.It's about the poor guest workers, many Muslims, the ones who don't have oil, who do much of the work in oil-rich Gulf nations, and who are treated like dirt by their richer Muslim brothers.It's about madrassas that teach pure Koran and serve as recruiting grounds for desperate young men who can be convinced to blow themselves up for a promise that their family will receive financial, and heavenly, rewards.The plot is not linear; it does not focus on a single character. There are sheiks in the desert hunting with falcons (cool gyrfalcon shot); there are poor Pakistanis struggling to survive in the Gulf; there are CIA agents, Hizbollah members and double agents on the prowl in Beirut; there is a housewife and mother and even some kids.It IS confusing. The movie does not make itself easy to understand. For example, in the scenes where Arabs and Pakistanis interact, IIRC, the movie doesn't communicate to the viewer: These are Pakistanis, from Pakistan, they are speaking Urdu; they are poor; their country has no oil; they've come here for work, and, on the other side, these are Arabs; they are local; they look down on the workers from Pakistan ... and the viewer would miss all of the culture clash and tension at the heart of those interactions.But it's a really well-made, truly movie film. There were scenes that broke my heart, that made me tense, and that reminded me of the high cost of petroleum.I do wish the movie had worked harder to make itself easier to understand. One of the great gifts of film is that complex and world-changing ideas can be communicated with images. It's evident that the filmmakers here wanted to get across an important message. Making their movie so hard to follow did not facilitate that task</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had come into this film with all my guns blazing to be a supporter of it. Clooney had won an Oscar and it had a huge list of supporting actors - it had to be worth a look.I was sorely disappointed to find that the film suffered on many lines. Most of my comments have nothing to do with the storyline "Big Oil Corrupts All". It has to do with the elements of film-making that failed. The most important failure of the director is that the narrative structure was so choppy and lacked any solid sequences. Most scenes were very brief and gave us no time to build the characters or story - and most importantly, CARE about them. I nudged my wife, and told her that somehow the characters and events would all make total sense in the end (a reveal like the Sixth Sense)but they did not.The pacing was painfully slow as well - I have been through many films that had a slower pace, but they kept my attention with strong characters, interesting scenes, and intrigue. I must admit the characters in this did NOT need to be really dramatic, as they came off like real people - kudos to the actors for this. But when you combined these portrayals with the short screen time that each had at one time, combined with the choppy narrative line, these characters were nothing more than sidekicks to the overall story (which was weak!) Clooney did not deserve an Oscar for this. He did a respectable job with what he was given but the character was extremely dull and forgettable.I really enjoyed the director's style with Traffic (which I loved and had some stylistic similarities to this film), but this does not hold a candle to it. All those comments that claim that one has to be intelligent to understand and admire this picture are gravely mistaken. It not what you are saying, it's HOW you say it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I'm sure this movie was good for someone who could keep up with it, for the most part, I found it confusing and direction-less. I think perhaps the greatest problem was that the characters simply weren't established well enough. Each time a character came on screen, I found myself thinking "Who is this, and why do we care about him, again?" The constant switch between English dialogue and English subtitles to Arabic/Urdu conversations was also more than a little jarring.In the end, I got that the movie was about business politics and getting rid of an Emir who would have brought his country into the 21st century, but that was really ALL I got out of it. I have no idea who killed him or why, I have no idea what Matt Damon's character was doing throughout most of the movie, nor George Clooney's character.In short, if you don't have a head for politics and can't keep track of the plethora of minute details that they throw at you in this movie, don't watch it--like me, you'll come out of it wondering what the point of it all was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stephen Gaghan is a master psychologist in addition to being a uniquely creative writer and director. He knows how to take a controversial topic, spread it over a period of time and from vantages that involve everyone who would ever view his information, and pace a film in such away that his viewers must stay glued to the screen and soundtrack so that not a moment of the powerful bits of intrigue he is relating fall out of place. It worked for TRAFFIC: it is stunningly effective in SYRIANA.Syriana is not just a story. Syriana is a conglomerate of stories that have as a common thread the impact the oil industry has on the globe and on every inhabitant. Involving the CIA, FBI, oil companies, Arab nations, common workers in the oil fields, children, princes, parents, spies, China, terrorists, self-martyrdom - the playing field that Gaghan gives to us piece by painfully confluent piece faults global economy, US and Middle East greed, and the pitiful reality of the global dependence on oil that threatens to destroy individuals and countries, if not the planet.Gaghan's method of film-making can be tough to follow, so seemingly dissociated are the elements of the story as it unfolds in different parts of the world, with different sets of characters somewhat tangential to reality at times and thus jolting to the linear mind. To write a synopsis of the plot is counterproductive to experiencing the film. Suffice it to say that every member of the huge cast is right on target: George Clooney, Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Peet, Chris Cooper, Amr Waked, Christopher Plummer, Kayvan Novak, Alexander Siddig, Tim Blake Nelson, and Mark Strong are only a few of the extraordinarily well cast group of characters. And in all fairness the contributions of Alexandre Desplat who gives his usual high degree of excellence to the musical scoring, the cinematography by Robert Elswit and the film editing by Tim Squyres are an integral part of the impact of this powerful and very important film. Brilliant work, incredibly important viewpoint that bears seeing and hearing. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bewitching but bewildering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A visually impressive film that bears many hallmarks of its one of its producers (Soderbergh) in its execution: hand-held cam sequences, bleached location footage. The use of 'Tehran' and the general Iranian vista is very beautiful but also sad - the shiny new office towers springing up out of the sand seem very alien. I thought this might be Gaghan trying to accentuate the incongruity of free enterprise in the desert. In fact it's probably just how it is (a greater indictment).Despite the impressive texture of the film - moments of action and drama in the film are handled as well as the view - it can be quite disappointing. Like so many political thrillers, the plot gives the impression of moving very fast largely due to a cryptic, convoluted script. This can be difficult to follow, especially with so many disparate story lines converging and shady characters double-crossing one another.The acting is quite strong. I rate both Matt Damon and George Clooney who fulfil expectation; Amanda Peet, Alexander Siddig and Jeffrey Wright are thoroughly convincing and a great sleaze double act in Christophers Cooper and Plummer provides some genuine 'bad guy' frisson in a film where it can be hard to tell who is. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's complicated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The phrase 'it's complicated' issues from George Clooney's character at least twice during this film. And 'it's complicated' would certainly work as an accurate tag line for this compelling, intricate movie. It's complicated - rather obviously - because of Syriana's multi-perspectives, interwoven and opaque plotting. It's also complicated in another way. Syriana has a rather obvious critical message at its core. But it is also a film about rationality, or more precisely 'rationalities' and how politics is organised around the intersection and conflict between different logics. On display we have the correspondence between the rationality of US national interests and that of corporate America. We have the largely unthinking (but gradually unravelling) rationality of the American intelligence services. There is the rationality of the law and the messy compromises it must make with the state in pursuit of 'justice' and there is the perverse rationality of the route from degraded oil worker to suicide bomber. In a sense Syriana is about the idea that politics is about making choices between these conflicting logics, and in so doing the film exposes for the nonsense it is the dominant simple story that the neoconservative Bush administration tells its citizens and the world at large about it supposed moral purpose. From this standpoint perhaps the most interesting story line within the film is that surrounding Matt Damon's energy market analyst. Within this character we find two compelling strands of liberalism. As a technocrat, his governing logic is pure economic liberalism. Witness the ruthlessly logical advice he gives to the prospective Emir by inscribing a few simple cartographic lines in the desert sand. At the same time, he is guided by a belief in political liberalism. As these two liberal thought lines converge, so their logic is compelling and yet - of course - they offend quite fundamentally the corporate and foreign policy interests of his home country. Damon's return at the end of the movie from symbolically neutral Geneva to the bosom of his American family is profoundly emblematic of the defeat of his liberalism and the restoration of the hegemonic status quo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good actors, good acting, OK plot, but the content was completely unexciting and completely expected and predictable after the first 20 minutes or so. What was portrayed would not surprise me if it showed up as news on CNN. Special effects were non-existent. The biggest opportunity for an explosion in the movie was filled by a soundlessly simple white-screen and a fade to next scene. The second biggest explosion in the movie could have been old film footage from any convoy behind hit in either Gulf war - and probably was such footage. I guess there was no budget left for effects after paying the big name actors. If the point of the movie was to show us corruption in government dealings with other countries, well, duh - of course there is. I doubt that any American with their head out of the sand expects our foreign policy is all, or even partly, sweetness and integrity.If you got a thrill out of Fahrenheit 911, you might enjoy this movie, too.

		<fullReview>Syriana seem to have all the makings of a great film. It starts out fine, lots of things going on all over the world, tangentially related to the oil business but with no immediate, linear connections. While you had to pay attention, it was not difficult to follow. This is not at all unusual in an independent film or in life. In fact it is what you have come to expect. Crash, Traffic,and Magnolia, to name three very fine films all start out the same way. You assume that the dots will get connected and everyone will have a significant part to play before it is over.We meet all the various people that are going to be involved over the first hour in their home environments and they gradually start crossing each other's paths in the ways you would expect. It is pretty clear that is not an oil-cowboy movie as we gradually find out that just about everyone has some dirty linen, skeletons in the closet, axes to grind, career compromises and so forth. It starts to get serious and people get closer and closer together, start impacting each other's lives in very dangerous and sometimes fatal ways. Yet we are not sure how this is going to play out, which is exactly what you have come to expect and want. But then things take a turn for the worse and we head towards melodrama with a tragic accident that does not seem to affect one of our main players to any great extent. It keeps going downhill, the various characters start playing very familiar roles as corporate and government semi-bad guys and so forth. You see the same scenes you have seen before in Tom Clancy type movies and other films of corporate corruption. We get the denouement which is unsurprising and the movie is over. All the various plot lines have been resolved, everything is wrapped up in a very neat and tidy fashion. There are no loose ends, nothing is left to chance. No one is left out there who might upset the apple cart, make a difference in the future. Though no one rides off into the sunset, it ends with essentially the same result. We end up with a very mainstream movie acting like an independent film. Too bad, it could have been a winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You certainly can't fault writer-director Stephen Gaghan for trying to make an important film about this nation's dependency on oil from the Middle East and the lengths to which our government and Big Oil will go to maintain ties, even with rather questionable governments that are far from democratic.(Wait, I thought we were about fostering democracy throughout the world. Isn't that why we invaded Iraq? Or, was it WMDs? Or, was it to oust a brutal dictator who was once our buddy? Or, was it so we'd be welcomed with rose petals as liberators?)The trouble with Gaghan's film is that he tries to tackle way too many stories in one film and winds up with a movie where none of the characters is given much depth.This film has one too many subplots (about a character's father) and one too many stories. There actually is another film in one of the stories dealing with immigrants working in the Middle East and how easily they can be manipulated by fanatics.Gaghan isn't a very good director, really, as his debut attempt proved. And, frankly, although he won an Oscar for his script for the over-rated "Traffic" (2000), there were more deserving writers that year - the Coen brothers for "O, Brother, Where Art Thou?" or Steve Kloves for "Wonder Boys." The performances in "Syriana" are pretty good, but the characters are so thinly written, that we never find out what makes them tick. And some of the characters are so incredibly mysterious, we remain confused. Gaghan also seems to cop out at the end, not really bothering to explain a crucial plot point involving what very well might be a patsy.Gaghan tries to keep all this stories together and then tie them up at the end, but the characters remain so aloof and impersonal and the story so cold, that we're never truly engaged in what's happening.This film would have worked much better, been more trenchant and could have made a potent political statement about the state of affairs right now had Gaghan concentrated on, say, two story lines and made the plotting tighter. Instead, he bites off much more than he can chew.</fullReview>

I feel a movie should be entertaining and this was lacking in this particular category. You need to unfold the story in a way that makes people wanna stay and not leave their seats for a couple hours...this one made you wanna close your eyes and take a short nap and wake up to see how it ends.The movie was very anti-climatic...I think the best line in the movie to describe how the pacing and the story telling went wrong, was a scene where Matt Damon is looking out the window of the car as it passed through the desert...he was looking at the miles of sand as he says "wow, it looks so beautiful." This kind of summed up the movie for me, a great story that was lacking in a few key functions to transform it into a great movie.This movie could of been really good...it just misfired and I was really anticipating its release. But, I think if you still wanna see this movie, see a matinée and save your all important dollars for some late December releases.(Munich, King Kong etc.) Please see Capote...I really recommend this one, great story, great directing and acting and most important entertaining.Enjoy the movies...The Honest Film Critic from Seattle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A talented film maker, a disappointing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world is a complicated place, the oil business is a big business involving big money, the Near East is a complicated place, and the government of the USA is a big and complicated organization that acts to achieve ends that most of us can only guess at. So any movie involving all these elements has the potential to be very complicated. It follows that any plot-driven or character-driven movie set against these elements as background would have to be carefully written, so that the background complexities don't overwhelm the plot or characters.As will be evident from the other postings to this site, Syriana is not plot or character driven. If I had to characterize it, I'd call it an impressionistic movie - a movie that offers us a collage of vivid events, but leaving us with nothing more substantial than a set of impressions. It's a Traffic clone.But where Traffic presented us with a background that we're familiar with in North America (our children addicted to drugs, unscrupulous drug dealers supplying what our addicted children and fellow citizen addicts want, and the US government at war with both consumers and suppliers), in Syriana the background includes all the elements outlined above. Unfortunately, as most of us don't have the same knowledge of the international oil business as we have of the domestic drug problem, we are mystified much of the time when we are watching Syriana as to what is going on. To make matters worse, Syriana contains numerous very short scenes - fragments, really - in which characters speak in very terse jargon about things that may be important, or not; since they're difficult to decode, many of these zingers escape us.Then there is material in the movie that has nothing to do with anything, and serves no purpose whatsoever. The whole subplot about the young Palestinian who (implausibly) becomes a mass murderer, serves absolutely no purpose in the movie. Even the implausible energy consultant Goodman (played by Matt Damon) serves little purpose in the movie.Gaghan is at his most plausible in his treatment of the rich and powerful, with their casual contempt of lesser mortals. Although this is not exactly a new story, Gaghan presents it well.All in all I find Syriana disappointing. Gaghan is obviously a talented film maker, and I wish he had made a better movie - a movie with a calmer pace, with more fully developed characters, and offering us a more searching look at the global energy business. See it, by all means. But don't expect to walk away from the movie enlightened about the global energy business, the complexities of the Middle East, or the machinations of the American government.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed Syriana, however, it probably is not for all types of movie views. Let me say first of all, I am a bleeding heart liberal, and that was one of my main motivations for going to see the movie. People of opposite political persuasions might not enjoy the movie as much, I think, because the way you take the end of the movie might depend on how you feel about government, not particularly the current American government or even the American government in general. If you are disenchanted with international politics, this movie will probably strike your fancy.Also, it is very hard to keep track of what is going on, mostly because the movie is not directed like most other movies, with a flowing plot. The best example I can think of is Lord of the Rings, because it is a bunch of simultaneous plot lines running together that culminate at the end. However, whereas LoTR only had two real plot lines, Syriana has at least 3, maybe more.Concluding, it is a very well conceived movie, well directed, and very interesting. However, if you are looking for an edge-of-your-seat-Jerry-Bruckheimer type explosion adventure, you will not find it in Syriana. Don't let the explosion in the previews fool you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Syriana; Good if you are smart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana was an overall exciting and interesting movie to watch. Anyone who goes to see it will NOT be bored and will definitely be entertained for 2 hours.People who will enjoy Syriana the most will include well informed people about issues in the middle-east and about the oil crisis. Syriana takes the current oil situation and looks at it from almost every possible angle including: middle-east princes, middle-eastern oil drillers, American oil companies, American government, average American citizens, an energy analyst in Sweden (Matt Damon) and his family, and other foreign countries affected by oil trade.The movie was jam-packed with action and drama. A few disturbing, yet eye-opening , parts of the movie displayed the torturous conditions endured by a CIA agent investigating conspiracy (Clooney's character).I recommend this movie to intelligent and well-informed movie-goers throughout the United States, and the world for that matter (as every aspect is objectively analyzed). In fact, this will be a good one to see in theatres and to own on DVD when it comes out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I lasted just under 30 minutes having seen a high average mark for this film here on IMDb. The movie is totally confusing and all over the place. There are goodness knows how many characters and plots introduced in the time I viewed this picture and as it got more and more complex I got more and more disinterested before finding something better to do: namely cut my toe nails. Don't ask me what the film is about, politicians, oil, Arab's, CIA, desert, etc whatever. When will film makers learn that to make a good movie you need to get the attention of the consumer from the start and hold that attention; those who have given this film a high mark must have extremely high patience levels or an ability to unscramble nonsensical obscurity. 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Syriana: Read a Book Instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By David AxelmanSyriana was among the worst films of 2005. Or perhaps it was among the best. Nobody knows for certain because the film was so tedious that almost everybody had walked out of the theater before it was over.In their zeal to expose corruption in the oil industry (read: President Bush is bad), some notoriously liberal icons like George Clooney attempted to produce an expose of sorts. They apparently assumed that they could simply splice together a few leftist clichés and the audience would, in a fit of rage, call their Congressmen and demand impeachment proceedings against the entire White House. Hopefully the audience would also be moved to purchase some ugly Scions. However, the writers and producers made no tangible effort to tie anything together. Each scene stood on its own, almost as a separate movie, without any congruence. Here is a brief synopsis of what might have happened in the movie. A CIA agent (Clooney) accidentally gives a nuclear weapon to a terrorist (or "freedom fighter"). This occurs at the very beginning of the movie and we are not sure what is happening during this scene. This effectively sets the tone for the rest of the film. Meanwhile, evil oil companies are merging and corruption is everywhere. A prince from the Persian Gulf sells oil drilling rights to the Chinese instead of to the US. This angers the greedy Americans, who in turn pressure the prince's father to leave the throne to a younger prince. The new Chinese management decides to lay off some Pakistani employees. Some of the younger workers naturally turn to a terrorist camp for religious and spiritual guidance. A cleric (the guy with CIA's missing weapon) convinces them to blow themselves up by detonating the bomb in an oil tanker. You see, these youth had no choice. Americans are greedy. They rape the land in the Persian Gulf and take advantage of everybody. The only recourse for an out-of-work Arab worker is to blow himself up. This seems to be the point that the writers were trying to make. Here's hoping that next time Hollywood blowhards try to use a movie as a political vehicle they will at least make it coherent and interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult but worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana tells four stories. George Clooney is a CIA agent with strong connections and history in the middle east. This storyline is very sketchy with Clooney's character remaining a mystery. There is a gruesome scene in which he gets tortured. Matt Damon is an oil broker with wife Amanda Peet and a young family. He befriends the prince who is the eldest son of the ruling emir and in line to become the next emir when his father dies. The prince is a progressive voice in the nation who wants to see his country move in the direction of democracy and women's rights. Jeffrey Wright is a corporate lawyer investigating the merger between two oil companies. Mazhar Munir is a disenfranchised Pakistani teenager who is drawn into the inner circle of a charismatic cleric with disastrous results. This storyline is the most touching because it shows life for these refugees.Besides these four main story lines there are side plots among the characters of the oil company men and various secretive government operatives. Given that the film runs only a little over 2 hours and you have an enormous job of keeping track of everyone. Syriana probably needs more than one viewing.If you are liberal politically you will probably take to Syriana's message of US government corruption and collusion with middle eastern oil producing countries. If you're on the right you might see the film as blatant propaganda. Syriana gets a A for effort. It's a serious film that tries to enlighten the complex relationship between the US government, US oil companies and the middle east. The problem for me was that at a running time of 126 minutes it's simply not enough time to do justice to all four stories. The Constant Gardener, a similar movie, succeeded because it concentrated on the relationship between Ralph Fiennes and his wife with the political intrigue in the background. Syriana has no similar focus. The closest is the relationship between Matt Damon and his wife but it does not have the screen time to develop. I recommend Syriana because it's a thoughtful, serious movie with very good acting and interesting locations. I really wish though that it would have been made as a longer film and the stories were more fully developed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it were possible to vote this movie as less than 1 of 10 I would have. Never have I seen so many people leave a theater in droves like I did at Syriana. Despite Gaghan's best Tom Clancy or David Fincher impersonation, this film was still a huge disappointment. You can tell that 10 minutes before filming this movie the directors had just finished watching Fight Club, Pulp Fiction and/or Boondock Saints. Apparently the main point of this film is that America is basically a huge white Neanderthal walking around with a butchers knife killing innocent children, bunnies and nuns. That made absolutely no sense right, well this movie made about that much sense. The only good part of the movie is at minute 122 of a staggering 126 minutes there is a huge explosion killing George Clooney's character and a couple of other Arabs. The truth of the matter is that I would rather be sitting on my couching drinking a rolling rock while watching The Aqua Teen Hunger Force, its just more entertaining.</fullReview>

Who did what to whom, and WHY?! How did all this come about... and who was REALLY behind it? Was that little boy's death REALLY an accident? The critics are no help. I have read every single review available online and these guys don't have a clue. They don't know. Who knows? Well, I KNOW!!! BEWARE: THIS MOVIE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS! But the message is hidden. It has to be hidden: it's too dangerous to be spelled out in the open. There's a conspiracy to take over our bodies. The drug companies have bought the government ... wait, I've got the wrong movie (that was "The Constant Gardner") ... the OIL COMPANIES have taken over the government, and in their interest the US is buying and selling foreign rulers like monopoly pieces. Here today, gone tomorrow. Whole countries are being bought and sold like Baltic Place. It's dark, it's sinister, it's omnipotent and it is everywhere! Everything you see and hear, everything you think you know, is just an illusion, only what THEY want you to think. THEY are running the world, THEY are running our lives, and we don't even know it. Worse, there's nothing we can do about it, nothing! It's too deeply embedded, too dark, too mysterious, too clever by far , and, most of all, too powerful. Everyone has been bought off, from your senator to the suit spewing the "news" on TV. Thank god for Hollywood ? at least they KNOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Syriana' takes on one of the most important issues of our time: the conflict between American oil interests and the powers of the Middle East. The task proves too much and we are left with a film that buckles under the weight of its own intricacies.I enjoy films that offer complicated plots. The problem with 'Syriana' is that its level of complexity exceeds its capacity for coherence. There are long stretches of unintelligibility, where it is nigh impossible to determine exactly what is going on or how it relates to the movie as a whole.Another of 'Syriana's' shortcomings lies in its ensemble cast. The difficulty is not the ensemble cast itself, however; this is a story that demands the use of multiple characters. Rather, the problem is the size of the ensemble. We are presented with numerous parallel stories whose relations between one another do not become clear until the very end. With this bevy of narratives comes the sacrifice of character depth. The film attempts to add dimension to its characters by providing unnecessary conflicts. The fact that Bennett Holiday's father is an alcoholic is utterly irrelevant to the plot; it is included for the sole purpose of adding depth to an otherwise boring character. Bob Barnes' son exists for no reason other than to illustrate the tension in Barnes' family. The death of Bryan Woodman's son serves a similar purpose: to provide conflict between Woodman, his wife, and the royal family.'Syriana' is not without its positives, however. The acting is first- rate across the board, and the parts that do make sense are quite captivating. It is also unsettling when one realizes that the basic premise is not at all far-fetched. But on the whole, 'Syriana' is a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Lots of spoilers...) I've love to see a good movie trash the oil companies and US middle east policy but this isn't it.It reminds me a lot of Ocean's 12 in that you get part of a scene with little context. The story jumps around a lot there is zero character development. I can't really see how this is an anti corporate film since it really isn't about anything. It's just one cynical scene after another. Maybe if I had read the book some of this would have made sense. It's hard to give specifics since the movie is just a mess. Some questions...Why does Bob get tortured. What is the point of scene with Bob and his son. What does the Chinese have to do with the merger or the rest of the movie. What does the terrorist training have to do with the rest of the movie. Why do they need to get Danny and Sydney in trouble for the merger to go through. Btw who is Danny and why is he in the movie. What do the Woodman's have to do with the rest of the movie. What are there issues, is it a good marriage gone bad or a bad marriage gone worse. The movie looks like it was too long so they cut a whole bunch of stuff out and it got too short and so they added a little back. Things like the terrorist stuff and the Woodman family look like they came from another movie. I wouldn't let my 11 year old daughter turn in an essay that was a jumbled up as this movie.Oh and the electrocution in the pool doesn't make sense, next time check with an appropriate scientist.Pros: Amanda Peete is really pretty (although her legs are a little too thin). Cons: Everything else.</fullReview>

Never boring. Great performances all around. Would sustain repeat viewings. For anyone interested in the art of film editing, the work done here is particularly crisp and fine. Lensing by Robert Elswit is of Academy award caliber. Particularly daring is the portrait of the evolution of a suicide bomber. Plot takes twists and turns that cannot be anticipated. One of the side benefits of the film is the inescapable conclusion that the average American knows little about the Middle East or the forces at work that drove us to war, and there is much we will never know. On the down side, like many Hollywood films, this one presupposes our government and intelligence agencies to be far more clever and co-ordinated than they actually are, but that is the nature of most thrillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a major problem with this film: the storyline are presented in disconnected pieces and flips, with hundreds of characters and names interrelated with intrigue relationship.To be able to follow, you have to be a person well versed with the Middle East and oil transactions, plus a good understanding on how CIA is functioning, OR you have already read the book(all of these amount to perhaps less than 1 % of viewers). If you are no such persons, you'll probably find yourselves completely lost half way through the film , and lost your interest to follow.The film could have been presented in a more easily digestible manner, which should be a better choice for the majority of viewers. Yet the director has chosen to confine the presentation to his own liking, and expects everyone to be prepared to do his homework before coming to see the picture, unaware that most viewers visit the theatre only to search for a pleasant evening, ending up with half of the viewers gone towards the end of this film.Why should we make movies that require viewers to do some homework first before viewing it?

Shame on you Stephen Gaghan (as screenwriter), although if your aim is to be another David Lynch, you are on your way. Again, a dis-jointed collection of stories that went nowhere - slowly. At least this time there was a sort of payoff with some of the leading characters converging in one of the final scenes. I understand that the connection between Saudi Arabia and the USA through oil interests is BAD but in a lucid way, tell me why. I just didn't get exactly what it was the director was trying to convey and was left with the same feeling I had at the end of Traffic - confusion about what it was I just experienced. The acting was good and the actors seemed to make the best of a bad script. It was shot beautifully but all that doesn't matter when the script is no good. If you are curious and want to see it, wait for it to come out on DVD and go to the $1 for a week bin at your local DVD rental store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had put off viewing SYRIANA for a very long time, not because I was afraid I wouldn't understand the implications of this wrenchingly powerful film, but because I would. For the most part, if I had to boil it down to one sentence, it's this: The world-at-large runs on the energy offered by oil, and there is nothing, NOTHING, that any country won't do to seize the power that oil provides, or to hold onto the power that they have.Writer/director Stephen Gaghan, who gave us the award-winning screenplay for TRAFFIC, does very much the same thing he did before with this film. There is no blaming or finger-pointing done with this movie; it holds no such myopic political viewpoint. What it does, if you pay close attention and read between the lines of its multi-layered story telling, is inform us that as we fill our gas tanks, wash our clothes, watch our big-screen TV's and go about all the daily affairs we take for granted that require energy, we give carte blanche to the forces at work that provide us with all the energy we need, who likewise take our ignorance and complacency for granted as well. Well-acted down to even the briefest cameos and directed in the style of the politically-charged thrillers of the Sixties and Seventies by fearless directors like John Frankenheimer and Costa-Gavras, SYRIANA is a stern warning to us all about what goes on behind-the-scenes in the seats of power, whether it's a conference room in D.C., a boardroom in Dallas or a palace chamber in Saudi Arabia. And that whatever does happen, we are all complicit and must eventually face the consequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't compete with the eloquence of many reviewers here. But here's my 2 cents.Oil corrupts all, breeds terrorists, etc. CIA is evil. Oil emirates are medieval in their organization and psychology. Etc, etc.All that may (or may not) be true and worth considering. Bearing in mind that this movie is more about examining "issues" than entertainment.Acting is good. Story is riveting if you're the right viewer. Children and teenagers would get bored quickly. Adults with interest might look for, and expect, a deep examination of the entire "oil issue." Its complicated, of course. We want oil. We need oil. We, the U.S., are addicted to oil. We will strangle anything/anyone to get it. So, call us a "motivated buyer." The mid-east has nothing else to sell. Call them the "motivated seller." Does that alone breed terrorists? Corrupt businessmen? The CIA? What else could motivate Islamic residents of the Mid-East to hate us? The movie would have us believe it is "all about oil." Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Beware of propaganda, however subtle. Sometimes it's not the lies someone tells you that deceive, but rather the omissions.I repeat my question: Does that (oil biz) alone breed terrorists? The Islamic people in the Middle East have never liked Isreal. That's an understatement. Iran is openly committed to their destruction. They're just being open about it. Imagine what Fatah and Hezobollah think about Isreal. Is that about oil? If Syriana is trying to present a dualistic view of how and why violence (suicide bombers) exist in the Middle East, then why doesn't the movie touch on Isreal. And, need I add, our multi-billion-dollar-a-year support for that country! Our contribution of tanks, bullets, guns, helicopters, bombs, etc, etc, etc, to that country! There are many reasons why some residents of the Middle East hate the U.S. Oil issues certainly rank high on the list. But, what about Israel? Is that insignificant? Who made this movie? What is their agenda? Now, Spielberg can launch into the diatribe of how the world has conspired against the Jews for centuries. The Nazis did this. Shakespeare said that. Okay, yes, there are many sins in history.What about now? 2007. What are the Jews (with our help) doing today? Is it anti-semitic to even raise the question? Some in Hollywood would say it is. It's even worth making a movie that completely ignores the effect of Israel (and our committed support to Israel) as a factor.The HEV (Hybrid Electric Vehicle) reduces oil consupmtion. It does not eliminate it. All that means is the Mid-East has 5-10 more years of life before their civilization collapses back into the sand dunes from whence it came. No offense to those from that region. But, like Matt Damon said: their second largest export is second hand goods, followed by dates for which they lose five cents a pound. In a movie that is all "message" and not "entertainment," is it moral to blame the actors for the movie's content? The actor can argue "I was just reading my lines." Did Mr. Damon really NEED the $5 Mil he made for this movie? How about Mr. Clooney? Or, are they just "hires guns?" Like the CIA. Blowing up "Big Oil's" enemies without really understanding why. Damon, Clooney, et al, didn't get where they are today by being dumb. I can't accept that they don't sympathize with the themes of this movie. Just because the conspirator didn't consciously understand his/her role in the conspiracy doesn't acquit them from liability. It doesn't make them innocent. The movie drummed that into my head over and over. In a movie about dark conspiracies, it is profoundly ironic that the movie makers are the scariest conspriators of all. They are the ones who would misdirect you, the viewer, from the hundreds of innocent Palestinian children killed by errant Isreali bullets and missiles in the past few years. What about them? Were those bullets fired from M-16s? Were those missiles lauched from American Blackhawk helicopters? Does Israel design and build their own helicopters? How about exploring THAT angle in the movie? Kinda missed that one. Accident? Not enough time in one movie? Weren't aware of that problem? Don't think so. This movie was made by someone well informed. That kind of omission could only be deliberate. Bush haters will find the movie comfortingly reassuring of their views. Bush is "Big Oil." His dad was the director of the CIA back in his day. He has connections. And, as we all know, he is ruthless and merciless. So, Bush commits terrorism, and under-educated Islamic recruits commit it back. Voila! It's all Bush's fault that the world has terrorists. Oh, and don't forget the Jews have been persecuted for centuries. Gas chambers and so on. They are Hollywood's untouchables. Unless you're a drunken Mel Gibson yelling incoherent anti-semitic remarks. For which he would later apologize profusely (and soberly).Bash away. He's making light of the Holocaust! Get him! No, I'm not. I'm making a point. The Holocaust was bad, very bad. Fine. Let's not forget the 10s of Millions of people who died under Stalin and Mao. We never rescued THEM! If I made light of their demise, who would object? Who would scream "Anti-Ukrain-isim" or "Anti-Kuomindong-ism"! How many movies has Spielberg et al made about those Holocausts? Sin of omission? Just forgot? No profit margin? Not commercial? Bias? You decide.</fullReview>

Perhaps it is taking a stab at grabbing some indie street cred with this sloppy camera technique?The next thing I noticed is that the pace is heart stoppingly boring without enough story development to justify the screen time.The movie picks up a little bit near the end but by that time you will be half comatose and beyond caring.The end is utterly weak.

		<fullReview>Syriana - From writer/director Stephen Gaghan, winner of the Best Screenplay Academy Award for Traffic, comes Syriana, a political thriller that unfolds against the intrigue of the global oil industry. From the players brokering back-room deals in Washington to the men toiling in the oil fields of the Persian Gulf, the film's multiple story lines weave together to illuminate the human consequences of the fierce pursuit of wealth and power.Yeesh. Apparently that's the plot of the movie. I couldn't put it together, and boy did I try. The movie is largely incomprehensible. The screenplay is unremarkable, with an off-kilter comment here or there passing as humor. The direction is incredibly tilted. The director can make an explosion shocking and effective, but as there are only two of them, he spend the rest of the film delving in suspense and drama, and failing at both. I felt absolutely no emotion of Matt Damon as the loss of his son. Also, remember that metallic negative "twang" that was used on the "Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction" show to scream to the audience that something bad was about to happen? Well it's used a whole lot in Syriana, and yet nothing happens. So much, in fact that the sound effect loses it's effect entirely, and I started rolling my eyes. That was a small nit-pick, but it shows the ineptitude of the movie. It tries to be an edgy movie, but at two hours and fifteen minutes (and tries to juggle five complicated stories) it's already bloated and in need of editing. Maybe this was interesting to people who read the Wall Street Journal, and are into World Industry. I'm not one of them. This was boring, and one of the few movies I've seen that I considered walking out of. Some good things. The acting isn't bad. Matt Damon and George Clooney tried hard (and had a few good scenes), but they're both miscast. This needed actors of a different caliber. Maybe the director saw Ocean's Eleven too many times. Boring, disjointed, and largely incomprehensible, Syriana gets a C-/D+ I want my seven bucks back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Porky Clooney not enough by a long shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not an exceptionally dumb person, but sometimes a plot will simply confound me. And if I have trouble following it, then it's pretty much dead to me. Complicated plots are one thing, because sometimes one can just mentally separate the more important story strands from the seemingly inconsequential, but the ones that just aren't too clear do me in.Syriana is one of the latter class. I can see the overarching theme, that Big Oil sometimes does nefarious things to innocent people, things that affect peoples around the globe, but some of the threads that added up to that grand theme were a little tough to keep track of. This made watching Syriana not a terribly enjoyable or rewarding experience. You, as viewer, know you're supposed to come away with a sense of disgust and dismay, of self-righteous indignation, but I came away simply relieved it was over.George Clooney plays Bob Barnes, a CIA operative who's been to war zones in Beirut and Tehran. He's captured and tortured, he's released, he's sent back, and so on. Then there is an emir with three sons, one of whom has been proactive and feels he deserves the kingdom when his father departs (shades of King Lear?). And then there's an energy analyst (Matt Damon) who's helping one of the sons. Somehow all of these little themes tie in together, but it's tough to see that during the first half or so of the movie.Had this been a straightforward spy movie (focusing on Barnes), or even a political thriller (focusing on the emirate and Damon's character), I think the theme would have been better realized. It's not a question of identifying bad guys and good guys, because that's fairly evident; it's that the movie leaps from setting to setting with little to link the disparate scenes.Clooney, who packed on the pounds for his role, is fantastic, but he's not on screen enough. Damon, on the other hand, is on screen too often; even at 35, he still looks like a high schooler. Imagine someone from your senior class acting as an energy analyst! He looks like he's giving an oral book report. It's not bad acting, it's bad casting. On the other hand, Amanda Peet, as his wife, is very solid in a small role - another actress might have been much less noticeable. And along for the ride is the elegant, yet ancient Christopher Plummer, looking every one of his 86 years.Hollywood tends to oversex its movies, adding bombs and breasts to boost box office. I hate to say it, but some bombs might have helped considerably here. There's little action in the movie, although what's there is pretty good. For a movie that should be steeped in intrigue, it wasn't very intriguing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'syriana' is, unfortunately, yet another clever script struggling to discover it's own heart. a brave attempt to unravel the subterfuge and complexities masking the simple fact that oil is the number one strategic global resource, but the film resorts in the end to cliché and cheap shots and leaves one no closer to the subject than when the film began.two examples: stereotypical portrayal of characters precludes their actions thus weakening suspense and empathy. hand held camera-work (in this case) neither furthers the story nor drives emotion, and more often confuses the action. the film also misses an opportunity in leaving out the main character: oil. rather than try and weave different people's lives together (unconvincingly) mr. gaghan might have taken a note from his earlier success with 'traffic' and left the characters to fight their battles alone, perhaps even telling their stories in sequence rather than in a jigsaw puzzle. the central character and emotional pull would then become the mcguffin they are all fighting for (or against) - oil.this is not to say that the film is heartless or talentless but when a film must resort to explication not once but twice you know that the producers' intentions are muddy. better to leave things unresolved and unexplained thus allowing the audience to feel as confused as the protagonists - or at least as confused as the filmmakers. this would be a more authentic experience.perhaps things could have been saved but for one change: delete matt damon's character. unnecessary, even disruptive...but you'll have to pay your $10 to find out why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Syriana clarifications</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Syriana did its job. I enjoyed the film, and as a person who's spent time in the Middle East, found its portrayal of some of the sub cultures in the region quite accurate. However my posting is more to clarify some things about the movie and where the characters are supposed to come from...The main one being about the young 'Palestinian man'. He actually isn't Palestinian. Most expatriate workers in the Gulf come from South Asian countries, such as India and Pakistan. The 'Palestinian man' was in fact from Pakistan, as were his friends.They were speaking Urdu. The man who gave him the missile is the only Arab in that story (about the Islamic school). Yes they spoke Arabic at times (when he was speaking to his teacher), but to his father and his friends, he was not speaking Arabic. Just out of curiosity, how many viewers do you think actually followed that there were at least 4 languages spoken in the movie (excluding French)? Arabic, Farsi, English, Urdu (and maybe some Punjabi?). I think it's important to know these little details because it helps the audience really understand who is being affected (not just young, frustrated Arab men).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I understand it, people in Iran (Kuwait etc) are loving this film. I'm not surprised - big Hollywood names make enormous prats of themselves - and, by following a written story literally, it compounds its crassness. If this film is anything at all, it is the perfect lesson on how to make sure you're on the losing side. Its mistake is to make rationalisations appear logical when in fact they're nothing of the sort. Now compare with Crash - lots of story lines, no singular star, fantastic script, fantastic execution, perfect manipulation of situations that would be slightly different in reality made understandable though fictional representation. Syriana is Crash's antithesis. Syriana belongs in the reject bin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbalanced Self-Indulgent Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie wants to be too many things, and in so doing, botches up arguably its main message, a commendable warning to western societies to avoid mistakes of the past. I found that many subplots were either useless to the story or frustratingly left undeveloped. The sad thing is that they eventually end up, in my humble opinion, destroying this movie, especially when you consider that Stephen Gaghan no doubt had to trim a lot of content to fit this whole adventure into 126 minutes. I am convinced that he left out a lot of material, which could have assisted us, poor viewers in following the main plots of this movie.I don't want to spread the blame where it is not deserved, and I really felt that the cast delivered strong performances throughout, though no actor deserved any specific honorable mention either. I did not understand though the added value in having George Clooney take on this extra weight for the movie - I bet that most viewers of this film won't know/care what the actual Robert Baer looks/ed like before watching it.In a nutshell, we have here a complicated movie, where little attempt is made to vulgarize anything for the uninformed viewer, yet a lot of film reel is wasted on useless scenes. Though I do not feel that I am the biggest fan of any of the parties negatively painted in this movie, I couldn't help but comment that it does paint a rather naive portrait of all the "good guys" being caricaturesque innocent angels, which I doubt is a true depiction of reality. This, I believe ultimately weakens Syriana's message, as it comes out biased. Rent it if you are well versed in history and financial/legal jargon, avoid it at the theaters. I am overrating this movie with a 6/10, but I feel that we need more of this type of historical critical movies, even though I wish they would be better made.The cast - 7/10 - Nothing terrible, but nothing terrific either.Stephen Gaghan - 3/10 - Needs to take the blame for terribly indulgent editing work.Robert Baer - I feel bad for him, I think he would have preferred a more poignant focused rendition of his book, considering the pain he had to go through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long, underdeveloped, lacking in content.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me preface this review with my initial reaction to the trailers. To me, Syriana looked like an intelligent movie concerning the increasing global demand for oil and the unavoidable violence and corruption stemming from such a struggle. Quite simply, it sounded fascinating and even managed to look action packed.I prefaced this so that you can begin to understand my dismay upon seeing the movie itself. What I saw was a long, badly edited movie with so many factions, characters, and plot lines that it was incredibly difficult to follow the movie as a whole, and even more difficult to care about the characters themselves. I was also surprised to see that while the trailer gave the impression of action, the movie lacked horribly in that regard. In fact, nearly the entirety of every single action scene in the movie was shown in the preview.I believe sub-plots can be an effective tool for maintaining interest during a movie, and the way they inevitably tie together often makes for a very good ending. An effective example of this can be seen in the show "24". But just as "24" showed how it can be done correctly, Syriana taught us what not to do. The inclusion of six (possibly more) sub-plots was far too much for the average viewer to follow. This forced them to edit out critical character development time where we become comfortable with the characters and begin to care about their fates. In the end I had to rely on musical cues to detect the importance of specific scenes.During the movie, George Clooney is made out to be a sort of Middle East expert. He speaks the language and apparently enjoys being sent there. Yet for some reason every scene he has there makes him appear awkward, worried, and generally out of place. Jeffrey Wright, the man sent by the government to make sure a huge oil merger was legit, has barely a single line. This hardly agrees with the enormous amount of screen time he received and his lackluster acting. His proved to be one of the least interesting of the sub-plots. On the other hand, Matt Damon and his family came across quite well. His character Bryan Woodman played an intelligent analyst that is initially sent in to negotiate a deal. He came off sincere and interesting and is given enough development to the point where you actually care what happens to him.I give this movie a 4/10. I believe it could have been significantly better and more meaningful had it been directed correctly. Or perhaps there simply was not enough substance to the Middle East oil crisis to make for a good movie. I have a hard time believing that though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Uninteresting Portrayal of an Interesting Topic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very difficult to make corporate intrigue interesting. "Wall Street" was an outstanding piece of film-making, one of the few notable films of this genre."Syriana" is neither notable nor interesting. It's effectively one series of bland back-room meetings after another. After a while the blather of corrupt executives and minor sheiks becomes a simple white noise drone.The writers tried to spice things up with a bizarre CIA subplot that barely has a place in the film except to give an excuse for a couple of explosions.The whole story behind Big Oil and the Middle East connection is undoubtedly a fascinating one ... for Nova or NPR. It does not qualify as material for a major motion picture.There are a few bright spots. George Clooney gives a good performance. The international casting is most impressive (although it would have been better if a real Swiss actor portrayed the energy analyst instead of Matt Damon). The film also makes a good showing of Muslim sensibilities, including the indoctrination of a few young Pakistanis into Wahabism.But these few positives do not save this film. 5 out of 10.Barky</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Add me to the list of Syriana watchers, due to lack of other options at the movies: Kong and Narnia. One couple walked out of the theatre mid-way and I would've done the same if I wasn't feeling so lazy on a rainy Sunday afternoon.The redeeming feature of the movie is a half-intelligent conversation on how "corruption is why (Americans) win." The rest of this movie is neither entertaining nor thought-provoking, though one can have a field day with conspiracy theories. Yawn.There is absolutely no character development. A wooden Matt Damon and a tired George Clooney run around busily in two of many interlocking story lines. The movie does not inspire spending the effort required to connect them.But if you do sew the threads together, you learn the great PLOT: There is a perceived oil shortage that is driving US foreign policy, which enriches some and leaves others dead.D'oh! If that comes as news, hit the newsstand. Now. Even better, go to the library and catchup with the past few *decades* of world news. That is a much better use of a couple of hours.Verdict: Not even worth renting on DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Acting . . . but complicated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking for an escapist movie free of political propaganda? See something else. Looking for a complicated thriller where seemingly disconnected plot lines neatly converge after two hours with brilliant acting by all, this is for you.This may decomplicate the plot weave a smidge:? George Clooney plays a veteran CIA operative on the down-stroke of his career selling explosives and arms to Iran terrorists;? Energy analyst (Matt Damon) is recruited to advise Crown Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig). Nasir, the wiser of two brothers vying to succeed the retiring Emir for his kingdom. Nasir wants to evict the wicked American Oil company so Communist Chinese oil enterprise can step in ( ? yipes!) for the ultimate good of his country.? There's this American Oil company (Connex) which is considering a merger with a much smaller oil company (Killen) that holds the exclusive Kazakhstan oil drilling rights. ? Connex's lawyers send an attorney (Jeffrey Wright) to discover just how Killen "got" those rights before the SEC does. (The SEC, you see, has to approve the merger)? And then we have your Pakistani migrant oil workers suddenly confronting the realities of unemployment after the Chinese take over. They're recruited by a religious fanatic after yet another spell of idle poverty.The film provides perspective on why and how things can get "confused" in this part of the world. Weirder still: that the Chinese and the religious zealots come off as the good guys as the evil US oil companies make prey out of Nasir, justifying corruption for their version of a greater good. It's a well made film. But, man-o-man, for simpler entertainment, check out that Harry Potter and his Fire Goblet. For this one, wear your thinking cap and bring your paranoia defenses. 7 out of 10 . . . for the acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the very beginning, you get the feeling that the producers want you to know how much smarter they are than the audience and lead you on a wild goose chase and never reveal who the goose is or where he is going. The acting is good, George Clooney, Matt Damon are, as usual, cool to watch. Everyone I talked to said they wanted to see it again so they could try to catch things they missed. I'm sure I wouldn't catch things no matter how many times I watched it. Just for comparison's sake. I thought Traffic was excellent. This film has also been compared to Crash, another of my favorite films. The idea of several characters and their own stories carrying the viewer's interest alone and then intersecting is a style I find fascinating and was what I was expecting in this film but was disappointed for the most part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do not see this awful, AWFUL movie. UGH! Okay, I'll admit it, I'm not an oil executive, nor do I have an extensive knowledge of US-Middle East business relations. Heck, I'm not even an American! And yet, the makers of this film expect EVERY SINGLE person who comes to this movie to have a very good knowledge of international oil disputes and how the actual oil system works. No way! It's frail old grandmas and teenagers that couldn't get into Hostel because it was sold out. And yet, they will come out of that movie saying, "Oh, well that was a smart movie, it just passed right over my head!". So that's why it's rating is 7.2, because people thought that it was just TOO good for them and gave it the credit they think it should deserve... Well, except for maybe the teens because you did get to see a guy's fingernails get ripped out.Let me tell you this. Chances are, you are a person of moderate intelligence, who likes getting sucked into a movie and then after it's over say, "Hmm. That was good fun!", right? Well, this movie is hard work. For one, you need to know a lot of background information. What the Islamic religion teaches, how foreign diplomats should operate, where Iran is, supposedly those Hollywood guys thought everyone knows that stuff. For two, you really have to keep thinking about the movie. I actually heard people's What's and Huh's in the movie theater. Stuff flies at you fast, and before you realize what just happened, something pivotal to the plot takes place and you're still talking to the guy beside you. And finally, you need to organize all the information and come out with some kind of conclusion. I'm not going to explain this one, since I'm still trying to work it out.All in all, if you liked this movie, clearly you just didn't want to look stupid. Another smart movie was The Matrix. What! Are you kidding me? No, it was! Sure it was sci-fi, but it was a great idea and made every one think. The problem with this movie was they over-estimated the current events knowledge of their audience. You have to realize that the reading level of the average American is grade six. Really! That's who Michael Moore targets his movies and books to, and they're completely understandable even though they're advanced topics. Anyway, smart movies are supposed to make you think, but not think, "What the heck was that all about?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end doesn't justify the means.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't mind the "over the top" depiction of an evil American corporation. Lord knows the oil industry deserves it. But that's also not to say it couldn't apply to ANY corporation in the World. I can live with the fact that the oil industry has many politicians in their ample pockets. What I can not accept is the portrayal of this fictional, idealistic Middle Eastern Prince who speaks with his male peers about women's rights. That's where the movie stopped being honest.I also found it extremely offensive that this movie attempted to glorify it's suicide bombing by conveniently showing a glimpse of the evil, filthy rich puppet masters on the targeted ship. That's not what happens in real life. Wake up people! Think about the past few major Militant Islamic attacks; U.S. (Twin Towers - Office buildings filled with working class people), the former Soviet Union (a school for CHILDREN), Spain (a subway), England (a subway). In the end, it would have been more accurate to show them blowing up some average working class schleps having lunch at an Israeli shopping mall. The end in terrorism doesn't justify the means! In reading the majority of comments, did everyone miss that scene or simply choose to look past it?! Instead of being honest, Syriana turned out to be nothing more than typical anti-U.S. propaganda. I find it disheartening that so few acknowledged the hypocrisy.</fullReview>

But upon reflection, the message is rather striking. Basically, the movie is comprised of several intertwining stories surrounding the merger of two large oil companies. The writer/director was present and afterwords he told stories that led to several points in the film. Basically he researched a ton and traveled the world to come up with this film. He used connections to several members of Middle Eastern royalty. Although the ending needs some work in my opinion, this movie is a must see for any political thriller fan.

Corruption is why you and I are prancing around in here instead of fighting over scraps of meat out in the streets. Corruption is why we win. (Just ask Tom Delay) That is it in a nutshell. Although I had to watch this film twice to really get it all. Corruption goes on in many forms and it is just the way business is run. It is not in our interests, at least those of the oil industry, to have real democracy in the Middle East. So, whenever progressive leaders rise up, they must be dealt with.George Clooney is fantastic an an over-the-hill CIA operative who dreams of a desk job are crashing around him on his last job.Matt Damon is also very good as a liberal energy speculator who is pushing the progressive agenda, but runs afoul of the greedy oil baron (Chris Cooper).Along with the oil story is the story of migrant Pakistani workers and how they are caught in the middle, and how this sometimes forces them to do things in desperation, You will learn a lot about how oil dominates US foreign policy, but you will also see the struggles within Middle Eastern countries to chart a path away from the rock and the hard place of Western domination and fundamentalist theocracy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?so don't go watch this after an evening at the pub. But if you enjoy a complex plot skirting around the fringes of real life politics and big business, and you are prepared to follow a multi-layered story that requires you to think, then you will enjoy wrapping your gray matter around Syriana. I have seen many comparisons to Traffic on this web site, but personally I think the better comparison is to The Constant Gardener, another complicated adult thriller based around corruption in big business and government. Syriana is to oil what The Constant Gardener is to the drug industry, although personally I felt the The Constant Gardener was a better movie, well written, and making much better use of the "human interest" factor, drawing us more intimately into the lives and motivations of the main characters than does Syriana. But I enjoyed Syriana nonetheless.Wow! Two complex, adult oriented movies in one year! Has the cinema world gone mad? I need to sit down before my brain explodes with all this intellectual effort! What Syriana is trying to do - I think - is to show us that there are many, many layers, complicated repercussions and nefarious wheelings and dealings going on behind business mergers and transactions that we, the consumer, may just hear reported fleetingly in a 30 second time slot on the evening news. When two oil companies merge, the only thing we may notice is a brand new sign outside our local gas station, and, let's be honest, that's all most of us WANT to notice. We want our gas, we want it cheap and we want it now. Syriana tries to show us the other side of that drive for cheap gas, in a world with dwindling oil reserves, fierce competition for what there is, and corruption at every level from the beginning to the end of the supply chain. It doesn't do it perfectly of course, but I would give it an 'A' for Effort, although maybe not for achievement. The problem is that Syriana sees things in rather stark black and white terms. Real life is usually lived in shades of grey.The movie twists together a variety of story lines in much the same way as Crash did. Personally I like this type of storytelling, but it's certainly not linear. There is the old, sick Emir of a small Middle Eastern country, choosing which of his two sons should succeed him, the idealist (Alexander Siddig) who wants to diversify the economy, remove the American troops and sell the oil to China and Europe; or the playboy (Akbar Kurtha) who will maintain the status quo, keep bankrolling the royal family's lifestyle and keep the Americans happy. There's a bright young American lawyer (Jeffery Wright), investigating the merger of two oil companies, who thinks he's a neutral agent, trying to root out corruption, but who may just be another pawn drafted in to give an acceptable face to a dubious deal. There's old CIA agent Bob, (George Clooney), back for one more mission, who thinks he knows whose side he's on and who he's working for; but who really knows anything in this world of shadows and half truths? There's the keen, young, energy analyst (Matt Damon) who thinks he's an expert, but is in way over his head when he winds up as business adviser to the idealistic prince. And right at the bottom of the heap, there are the workers at the "sharp end", the dirt poor Pakistanis working in the production facilities to keep the whole show on the road, and whose life style is in sharp contrast to that of the princes, business men and politicians. Sweltering in barrack style sheds, playing cricket and soccer out in the desert to entertain themselves, they may lose their jobs in a moment's notice when a merger goes through, and can be deported in a trice, and who cares? Still, I doubt many of them truly become suicide bombers.As you might expect from a movie involving George Clooney, the cast is terrific. Jeffery Wright is outstanding as the lawyer. I first noticed him in Angels in America, and I think he has to be one of the best actors around today. He just melts into his character, he's really very, very good. Alexander Siddig also stands out as the idealistic prince. Certainly a movie well worth the ticket price, but not a classic. And you've been warned ? it's complicated!</fullReview>

It could have just stuck with the big picture, (i.e. why are we so dependent on foreign oil?) Excellent acting. Great insight into dirty CIA tactics and Texas oil strategies. The Hezzbollah angle was confusing for me. I'm not afraid to admit that it was a bit too complex for me upon my initial viewing, I'll probably need to rent the DVD. It also did a good job of showing how easy it is to convert indifferent young men in the middle east to extreme Islam. It maximizes it's 2 hour length for all it's worth.

Despite Gaghan's best Tom Clancy or David Fincher impersonation, this film was still a huge disappointment. You can tell that 10 minutes before filming this movie the directors had just finished watching Fight Club, Pulp Fiction and/or Boondock Saints. Apparently the main point of this film is that America is basically a huge white Neanderthal walking around with a butchers knife killing innocent children, bunnies and nuns. That made absolutely no sense right, well this movie made about that much sense. The only good part of the movie is at minute 122 of a staggering 126 minutes there is a huge explosion killing George Clooney's character and a couple of other Arabs. The truth of the matter is that I would rather be sitting on my couching drinking a rolling rock while watching The Aqua Teen Hunger Force, its just more entertaining.</fullReview>

So many reviews discuss the brilliance of this movie, how gripping it is, and the mesmerizing performances. Did we see the same movie? My friend and I both found this movie to be almost impossible to follow. Far from gripping, I felt like leaving about 2/3's through. (I almost never want to leave a film) The director throws an endless stream of characters at you, but never really tells you who they are, what they do, or why you should care about them.Even the big climactic scene (no spoilers) left us wondering "Who did that... Why did they do it? Why should we care?" Sadly, we don't.As for subject matter, we're let in to the big secret that big oil and politicians are corrupt... Hoopie Doo. I thought this movie would reveal something compelling... Go a little deeper.All in all, this movie was an absolute let down... I'd rather watch Dukes of Hazzard (though I actually have no wish to see that heap o' trash either).Ugh... Maybe if I write to Warner Brothers they'll refund my money. I almost feel I need to be compensated for my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much of what is wrong with *Syriana* is what was wrong with Steven Soderbergh's *Traffic* -- both were written by Stephen Gaghan (who takes over directorial duties here as well). Mr. Gaghan demonstrates no aptitude for scene construction or characterization. Once again, Gaghan thinks that if writes a dozen little criss-crossing narratives that (sort of) converge at the end, he can attain verisimilitude. On the broad, policy-wonk level, sure; but the diffusion of focus also surely diffuses our personal investment in the characters and plot. He's good at geopolitics, I'll give him that. Much of what we see in the film seems plausible, despite the fact that the oil-rich Arabic country that is the main setting of the film turns out to be fictional. The scenes outside the U.S.A. certainly carry more interest, to say nothing of coherence, than the board-room scenes on K Street. In the case of the latter setting, I must admit that the movie was more than half-over before I could figure out exactly who the hell Jeffrey Wright's lawyer was even working for, let alone what he was actually up to. The bleak deserts that surround some nasty Middle East metropolis (soulless skyscrapers pointlessly reaching upward to a blanched sky) set the atmospheric tone of the picture. Things threaten to become interesting as we watch the feuding young sons of an aging Arabic monarch scramble for the old man's throne, but the movie doesn't spend nearly enough time with them to make the scenes come alive. (More often than not, Matt Damon as the more progressive prince's "economic adviser" is forced to explain to us what's at stake by way of tedious exposition in the form of cell-phone calls to his wife back home.) The narrative about the young Pakistani émigrés in the fictional Arabic country who end up joining a religious school also suffers from lack of oxygen. Again, the situation is more than plausible, helped along by a smooth, friendly, and devout zealot who recruits the boys into a terrorist cell. And again, the movie skims over the dramatic possibilities inherent in the situation. All in all, the movie is a collection of tantalizing tidbits that don't add up to a satisfying whole. Gaghan is too far-sighted; he needs glasses, so that he can FOCUS.Even George Clooney's rumpled CIA agent fails to connect to us emotionally, which is somewhat surprising since the film is a fictional gloss on the memoirs of an operative named Robert Baer. The only time we really feel anything for Clooney is when he's being tortured by some Lebanese goons. A meticulously depicted scene, this should be mandatory viewing for those 60% of Americans who feel it's okay for us to torture suspected terrorists. Hey -- you want this sort of thing, then you should be able to watch it, baby. Put up or shut up.Movies with converging story-lines -- *Short Cuts*, *Magnolia*, *Traffic*, *Crash*, to name just a few examples -- tend to fail because they don't spend enough time developing character, which is the supreme value in fiction. If I wanted an analysis of Big Oil's impact on our relationship with Islamic nations then I'd go to the library and rent a "Frontline" documentary on the subject -- I believe they've made several. Mr. Gaghan is clearly a smart individual; he's done his geopolitical homework. Nonetheless, he needs to learn how to demonstrate the General by illuminating the Particular. If he can't do this, then he should put his money where his mouth is and make a documentary about his concerns (maybe "Frontline" would hire him). And if the problem is the running-time constraints attendant upon traditional feature films, then he should make a deal with HBO or something and make a mini-series that would give him enough breathing room to build viable dramatic situations and characters. As it stands here, *Syriana* is a triumph of complexity over art.3 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie would have been much better had it either cut down on length or had more character/plot development. What we are left with is a movie that is (for most viewers) confusing and very boring. No less than three couples walked out of the movie at around the mid-way point. I stuck with it till the end only to feel that these topics could have been tied together sooner and in a more entertaining fashion.The acting was top-notch but the screen play was too slow to develop. Only see this movie after a good night's sleep. It's not really a movie I'd recommend as a rental. Overall, it makes the viewer think about the three (?) interwoven topic, but it also leaves you with a feeling that you knew that type of thing was going on anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Major League Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie last night, fully expecting to see one of the best films of 2005. What I got was a major league disappointment.There were way too many subplots. I teach both video production and History of Cinema classes, and constantly tell my students that they simply must put themselves in the place of an audience seeing a film for the first time---they may know the motivations of their characters, but you've simply got to let the audience in on what you know.I would have eliminated the subplots with the young Muslim man and the madras completely, and I probably would have eliminated the subplot with Matt Damon also. I would love to have seen the character of George Clooney expanded, particularly with some added scenes of what had happened in Lebanon 20 years ago (I'm sure they are referring to the bombing of the Marine barracks, but still.....this would have helped connect some of the dots that others have referred to.I will say that one scene had me on the floor laughing....the "Oilman of the Year" banquet where the CEO gushes about how his company employs just the "best people" in the industry, replete with almost tearful emotions. Reminded me of the dozens of corporate videos I have been a part of over the years, where we always had these voice-over lines about how the difference in this company is "it's people"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Syriana: Where intelligence and entertainment diverge.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Stephen Gaghan, the Oscar-winning writer of 2000's "Traffic", comes "Syriana", an ambitious film that shrugs off standard categorization. It's a political thriller that unusually emphasizes the politics over the thrills, with a dense plot that requires an almost exhaustive amount of attention, not just to understand, but to know that you understand.Simply put, the film follows a handful of related stories that merge as the plot progresses. As drugs and U.S.-Mexican relations are to "Traffic", the oil industry and the relations between the Middle East and the Western world are to "Syriana". The multiple threads eventually converge, not into one single arc, but into a tighter overall story.For better and worse, this is a different film than most, a fact that triggers a debate between the two sides of my movie brain, the side that wants intelligent and well-spoken cinema (Ivan) and the side that wants to be entertained (Edgar). Here's a peek at their conversation as they sit on my shoulders...Ivan the Intelligent: What a breath of fresh air! A film that doesn't lessen itself to appeal to the masses.Edgar the Entertained: If by that you mean it doesn't give the audience any reason to care at all, then I fully agree. At no point was I really into the movie, except when I was trying to comprehend what the heck was happening.Ivan: What, you can't handle actually needing to listen to the words? A intentionally deliberate movie that you actually have to watch because it doesn't cut every two seconds bores you? Just because it doesn't have an endless visual stream of fights and explosions doesn't make it a bad movie.Edgar: No, the fact that the entertainment value is almost zero does that. It's about as engrossing as watching a news channel. I'm paying $8-10 to be at least partially entertained, not to learn about one view of global politics.Ivan: I'm just glad that Gaghan and company actually take advantage of the medium. More people not named Moore should use film to explore social issues, and the filmmakers did so here largely without the use of a soapbox. That's a very commendable feat, thanks to a complex script and characters that are more than stock political figures.Edgar: I concede that the script is well written and the story is well crafted. But I object to labeling the characters as unique or interesting. Some of them are multi-dimensional, but ultimately THEY'RE ALL THE SAME! Every single one is selfishly looking out for his or her own interests. There are few redemptive qualities to latch onto. And other than the plot line involving Matt Damon and his family, nothing appealed to the emotions, despite the solid acting chops displayed by the loaded cast.Ivan: Get over the emotional kick. Movies can have different ways of appealing. "Syriana" aimed for the mind, not the heart, and hit that target squarely as it explored the tricky oil issue that dominates global politics.Edgar: If I conceded your point, and I don't, attempts at more cerebral cinema can still have a soul. Look at the Gaghan-penned "Traffic", which featured drama both emotional and intelligent. That film made several good points about the world of illegal drugs, and featured well-rounded characters that allowed for emotional connections. Syriana tried that tack a couple times; but the efforts were forced, mostly ineffective, and lacked a sense of urgency. Those short-comings deprived it of the soul-striking power of Traffic.As one can probably deduce from this head-swiveling argument, the entertainment side won the race to the finish line. "Syriana" is appreciated more than enjoyed, better in retrospect than while viewing. That it was made is as big an accomplishment than the film itself. If you want a Tim Wakefield knuckleball in a cinematic world of Randy Johnson fastballs, you could do worse than "Syriana". But unless you (like me) want to check all the Oscar contenders off your list, you need not rush out to see this movie in theaters, because a smaller screen won't diminish its moderate impact.Bottom Line: Thanks but no thanks. 5 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horrid disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall it felt like a poor copy of Traffic just without the color filter trick. At least in Traffic, I felt for Benicio Del Toro's character. None of the characters in Syriana drew my interest. Furthermore, none of the characters drew my concern. I was even disinterested in the telegraphed death of Matt Damon's son. I should have felt sympathy for the parents, but they had already been portrayed so dryly that I found myself thinking "whatever".The director/writer obviously had a desire to explore a plethora of threads and have them flow back together like Soderberg or Tarantino so often does. Unfortunately the execution was clunky with several threads seeming unnecessary or undeveloped. For example, in the unnecessary category was showing the alcoholic father of the investigative lawyer who sells out. The interaction between them failed to draw a reaction from me either for or against the lawyer, so when he turned I was still neutral about the character. In the undeveloped area is the thread about the suicide bomber, which although it tied in, ate a tremendous amount of screen time with little insight. The film didn't give me an insider understanding of the suicide bomber. The portrayal seemed to be what I would write sitting at home in the US with only passing knowledge of the Middle East. A boy with little options is convinced to do something stupid, but he doesn't fully believe or understand the reasons, he just wants to belong. If an explanation was in there, I apologize because I missed it.Sadly, I am sure there is an interesting movie somewhere in this subject matter, but they failed to make it with Syriana.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crude oil.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was eager to see "Syriana," since it's one of the few Hollywood films to address a big, timely subject?the influence of Mideast oil in the global economy. The film is well shot and, with the exception of callow Matt Damon, who has the most inexpressive face among today's younger stars, well-acted. The writing, as far as one can make out from a soundtrack that muffles much of the dialog, is crisp to the point of cryptic. For an hour or so, I was absorbed. But ultimately, I was frustrated in my efforts to untangle so many plot threads and so many murky motives. Because none of the principal characters is sufficiently developed to become anything other than a piece in the puzzle, trying to figure out who's who and what's what becomes tedious. Admirably, "Syriana" tackles a disturbing, complex subject. But the approach is so complicated that the message of how Big Oil is corrupting America's soul sounds a less urgent alarm than it should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheaper Than Hiring Soderbergh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a pretty film the first time I saw it when it was called Traffic.The writing is decent but the film-making is a bit heavy handed. The kid dying sequence. I thought it was very trite to show Matt Damon walking have and the lights flicker. That twinkle of lights extinguished a kid's life.It's cynical because we never really see what I would call reality. In Traffic, Soderbergh grounds you with different color schemes to help you navigate the story. Here there is no guidance, which I suppose is a cute way of saying we're all equally corrupt or tainted by this whole business. But as a matter of course for storytelling it was hard to figure out who to care for in the stories.Traffic showed you every side of the issue -- and you had a rooting interest in practically every story and you could sympathize with everyone from the Drug Czar to the kingpins.Here you get nothing. Stereotypical butt kicking Texans and spendthrift Saudis.Clooney's wrought CIA goon is fun, nice to see George out of his comfort zone, though I wonder if this film was worth a major spinal chord injury.Matt Damon's wide-eyed, mad with greed analyst is a pendant. His character has to be told to shut up in two separate scenes when he's giving exposition.The most sympathetic character in the whole piece is the suicide bomber, but we only really see the surface -- he bombs because the mosque serves great kabobs and everyone will watch your TRL-styled funeral arrangement video.Gaghan is a very good writer and I can't help but wonder what a more experienced director would have accomplished with this script. Lightened from some of its more plodding elements this could have been a truly transcendent experience.</fullReview>

Its story line infers that the CIA (and of course the current administration) is full of bad people. The justice department is portrayed as the good guys (and probably Democrats in nature). I still haven't figured out why George Clooney ends up where he does at the end of the movie. He had gotten the Justice Department off of his back and was pretty much free to continue his career as he had before.

		<shortDescription>Cool, Intense Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, a confession: I went to see this movie a week ago, the day after it opened here. Well, I arrived in the theatre several minutes late; and left about an hour into the movie after my confusion level started out high and for the next hour remained way above my stay-threshold. I read a few reviews that acknowledged that the challenge to the cerebrum was high and that the dialog-pace was high, but that this was still a movie worth seeing. Movies that rely on appeals to intellectual snobbery and political correctness aren't generally very attractive to me. However, I thought I'd give it another try. I'm glad I did. And saw the movie from start to end with great pleasure. About the "intellectualism" though ... Yes, the complexity and the "talkiness" were definitely there. If you like "cerebral" movies rich in dialog this might well be up your alley. If you like Action movies (like me) and if you can accept the dialog ... and the complexity ... as simply part of the Action .... and *not* as a "puzzle to figure out" ... then hey, I think you'll like this flick. In fact, to me, the Action and Dialog made for a good, intense combo that I really liked very much. Think of the old Mission Impossible type plots &amp; talk. I remember when I was a teen ( a LONG time ago) watching some of the old MI's on TV and half the time I didn't really know what was going on. No matter. MI was exciting, tense, action-packed, cool. So was Syriana.About the "political correctness" ... the movie does follow a general geo-political conspiracy motif .. a motif that sure seems to be popular ... think Oliver Stone ... and more recently, the Constant Gardener. I generally don't like that kind of thing .. again, just not to my taste. But again: if you can put up with that as just being part of the Story, part of the Action, then it's at least tolerable.And what I really did like most was the Action, the intensity, the variety and flavor of scene and setting, the cinematography, and the Story overall. An important feature of the movie was (putative) Realism. That to me automatically leads to considerations of believability and credibility: of plot, scene, dialog, etc. These aren't so important, IMHO, in more stylized movies; and are in fact potentially undesirable in very stylized films, such as most Musicals. But Syriana stands at the strongly Realist (almost Documentalist) end of the formal continuum. Fair enough: but if a movie is going to position itself in this genre, then credibility becomes very important. No credibility means no recognizable Realism: surely fatal in a Realist movie. Regarding credibility, this movie was for me mixed. Not credible, for example: (1) The interaction in which the younger son learns of his elder brother's succession is to me simply not credible. The elder brother calmly shooting pool during a conversation of such personal moment; the younger brother frankly withholding his support from his father's decision and striding out ... followed by seemingly open recruiting of dissent in effect seeking a coup. Please: any emir, or emir's son, not able to deal forthrightly and aggressively with such challenges is no emir who's going to be in power anywhere, much less in the Persian Gulf. Not credible as well: (2) The hectoring by Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) of Prince Arash on several occasions was crafted, presumably, to win the audience sympathy; but this is surely not a very realistic set of transactions. On the other hand, two other features seem to me to be very realistic indeed: (1) the general appearance of Gulf/Arab scenery was very realistic. I lived myself in Libya for about 8 years and have visited Tunisia, Egypt, and Palestine. And believe me, the general appearance was very, very much in accord with my own memory of such scenes. The flavor of Arab culture to the extent I remember it was also depicted very realistically. Also (2) the Islamist madrassah and the process by which young men became recruited to suicide bombers seems to me very credible. I have no personal experience in this area at all (thankfully!) However, the deft depiction of a partly religious, partly material appeal seems at least believable, whether or not this is how such things happen or not. The overall intensity, action, realism, flavor, texture ... all these combine to make this a very worthwhile movie experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must be the second in that inspiring trilogy of paranoia, The Constant Conspiracies. Following the never-to-be remembered Constant Gardener, this one, which I will rename The Constant Gusher, is an improvement, barely? but then, what wouldn't be? The color is better, the camera work less jerky, the acting adequate, and this one actually involves a little suspense. Unfortunately, it also mimics the faults of its predecessor while adding a few new ones of its own. Back by popular demand are the schizophrenic suspicions regarding big business, this time substituting noxious, evil oil for poisonous drugs, but retaining that lovable quality of total ignorance of how real world markets function. There was a rumor that Clooney added a 30 pound "pawnch" as a metaphor for the way his character was manipulated like an innocent servile chess pawn, but I think he just likes to eat a lot. This movie is also a primer on the pitfalls of a contrived murky plot line, one of which is that those few in the audience who can follow it cannot hear the dialogue over the rest of the audience's repeated whispers of "whose side is he on?" and "is he a good guy or a bad guy?" If the storyboard lacked clarity, the moral was less than subtle; bad brother likes Americans, good brother doesn't, bad Americans blow up good brother, getting rotund George as an unexpected twofer bonus. Fortunately, the screenwriter never gave us a chance to invest in any of these characters sufficiently to care about any of this, so this film gets a five as a bungled attempt at both entertainment and persuasive propaganda. I can hardly wait for the next one. Will it be The Constant Shopper, exposing Wal-Mart's wicked scheme to promote capitalism and take over the world? Or The Constant Guzzler, revealing the malicious SUV conspiracy of the automakers to end the world through global warming? When Hollywood delves into politics, it is nothing if not predictable.

Turns out, the guy who directed this movie also directed "Traffic". If you saw "Traffic" for the storyline, you'll enjoy this movie. If you saw "Traffic" to see Katherine Zeta Jones, you'll be disappointed. There aren't any gorgeous women in this movie that have feature roles.I would encourage anyone, left or right minded, to check this movie out.

		<fullReview>The movie is well done, well acted, and purports to portray the oil business and the world "like it really is." But it's mostly complete bullshit. No other word for it. Anyone who has read Robert Baer's books on his life as an agent in the middle east will realize that this movie shows the CIA as the exact opposite of what it has been.The CIA hasn't been running professional assassins in the middle east from Beirut to Kazakhstan. Quite the reverse. The CIA has been hollowed out until recently, with but a handful of field agents in the middle east of any kind. Those deployed now are inexperienced.The oil business does include payoffs, but if anyone can find me an example of a company like Killen that won an entire nation's oil rights, please do. It's ridiculous. Things along those lines happen for much smaller prizes, yes, but the big ones have too many national level players.The portrayal of the CLI (committee to liberate Iran) meeting with Condi Rice had the scent of truth. Something like that happened with Iraq. However, it was run from inside the administration, and was not composed of upper level staffers at CIA with the possible exception of Tenet. I say that because of his famous "it's a slam dunk" statement. However, Tenetwas simply stating what was common wisdom from left and right both at the time. (See "The Greatest Threat" by Butler.) While CIA field officers have been temporarily abandoned who were caught by the Russians in during the cold war, they were not forgotten. The idea that an officer who was tortured on an assignment would be thrown to the wolves so casually as the protagonist is in the movie is a vile distortion. A field agent might be brought back and stuck in an office behind a desk to make him quit, but that's about it. Worst of all, Hezbollah is portrayed as an organization with honor that collaborates willingly with the CIA. This is a ridiculous portrayal, utter fantasy, added for political correctness by some clueless Hollywood idiot who gets his history from his imaginary friends. Hezbollah is funded and controlled by Iran's Pasdaran secret service.This movie has the gall to bill itself in press releases as being based on Baer's work. Hogwash. It's pure fiction.</fullReview>

There was no explanation why they were included in the film. Some of the main characters were not fully fleshed out. The motivation for what happens at the end were not clearly explained.I have not read the book by Robert Baer, but if the film is accurately telling the story, I would think we would have heard more about this in the news. I'm not sure if this is because our press is too timid to take on the subject or if Robert Baer is not considered a reliable witness."Syriana" has good acting and some great dialog.

And the extraordinarily complicated plot, with so many characters and subplots, feels only loosely integrated even toward the end of the movie -- or as if the integration is a little forced.My biggest problem, though, is that I just didn't really understand the point. Showing problems without shedding any real light on them, without providing any insight, and without really making the characters experiencing those problems fully human -- which would make the problems all the more compelling -- just seems empty. It's a movie, after all, not an investigative news article -- and a fictional movie at that. Just caring about an issue doesn't mean you know how to make a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be quite honest I was bored-to-distraction with this movie. With the exception of the Arab actors everyone else could have narrated their lines off camera and nothing would be lost. Clooney looked and acted like he was on dope and if all real spy's are that boring, no wonder we have to invent 007. The plots and sub plots were not that earth-shattering. So many things that happened could not be explained. The swimimg pool scene should have ended up on the editing room floor. And who could not guess the ending. We as Americans who can think at all know how evil all governments are and can see the writing on the wall. But this movie did nothing to push the pen further down the page of knowledge. At least "The Three Kings" made you raise your eyebrows and think. Syriana had nothing to say and the audio part was very hard to hear, Clooney talking into his beard, yet!!

		<shortDescription>I wanted to like this, but it was a jumbled mess, very poorly cut....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really WANTED to like this movie, but it was one of the poorest pieces of film cutting I've ever seen, like they needed to get it to the theaters quickly and didn't worry about making things connect and make sense. A lot of people apparently thought it was insightful. I saw it opening day in a large theater that was almost empty, but there was way more snoring than usual. I kept expecting it to get better. It didn't. The artsy attempt to follow multiple threads just didn't work.It has elements of a Michael Moore propaganda piece, but it moves SOOO SLOW you want to fall asleep, and it proselytizes and manipulates you in a way that I found really annoying. Some movies must be experienced in the theater, this one would be MUCH better on DVD or tape. When they finally come up with something really good (which is about 3 or 4 times), you want to hit the rewind button, but can't. This might have been an interesting movie, but it was just cut wrong, was WAY too disconnected, and had way to much camera shake. It just didn't work for me. And if you're an academic, or just want to know about oil, read Hubbert's Peak and skip this movie, which misses the big picture entirely in favor of a few cheap shots. 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie switches back and forth way too much. You should be in a position to enjoy politics, and understand how America's CIA works. There is no thriller. Clooney does a good job. Amanda Peet as usual has a very little role to play. Matt's good too. Its difficult to understand till an hr, at the end the story becomes clear. The only scene that's worth seeing is how they target the guy via satellite. Overall, its not worth seeing in theater. My rating for the movie 4/10. A big NO NO for the movie. Too many people introduced right at the beginning. So was difficult to recollect how was who? Bunch of Muslim guys were shown and you keep on wondering what role they gonna be playing, but they do a good job and good acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most legitimate complaint about this movie is that it is not a feature film, but a mini-series forced into a two hour running time. I'm hoping the DVD will show us what was cut out to shorten the piece. As it is now, we get hints of what might have been.The plot was easy enough to follow -- there was just too much of it. Each of the film's major characters (at least five, three Americans, two Arabs) deserved a film of his own. As it is now, none of them gets his due, and the emotional power is diluted into a bloodless harangue.Clooney gets the ostensible central role, and his work here is revelatory. This is his best dramatic work yet, but the performance is stranded in a picture that can't commit to a central character. Movies, feature films as we know them, cannot be novels. But as a mini-series, the possibilities for a film like "Syriana" start to brighten.My suggestion: go see "Syriana" for Clooney's performance, then rent "Clear and Present Danger" and notice the parallels. The Clancy thriller is just as ambitious, has a convoluted plot, and critiques American foreign policy with the same fervor. It might even be Harrison Ford's best dramatic work hidden in a thriller. Watch both movies and tell me which one understands the limits and possibilities of political feature film making.</fullReview>

While many people out there want to applaud artistic whatever, this one simply is a blah and dry look (with no substance)at the oil industry and their politics with no insight. I mean no insight, you spend your time waiting for something to come of the characters and it just does not go anywhere with any of them, all the way to the end. Unnecessary characters were over emphasized with no function in the story, It was a turd sandwich with a slab of A Thin Red Line if you can imagine. Oh but without the battle scenes at least offered in a thin red line, and I really hate that movie, so to even reference it in comparison is about as negative a review as I can offer.

		<fullReview>I liked this and respect the heck outta what they were trying to do, but there are times while watching it that you can be forgiven for forgetting who is who, why they are doing what they are doing, and so on and so forth.Take Christopher Plummer. Now I kept on forgetting-was he a lawyer? An Enron-style oil guy? He was also mentioned by Clooney as having been 'in Beirut before', which makes you wonder if he was a former CIA type himself back in the day. That took some getting used to.Then there's Clooney. Now I kept thinking that he was in Beirut to go after whomever it was that swiped his Rocket in the opening scenes. I didn't quite figger that he was out to kill Emir Son 1, which goes to show you how much attention I was paying perhaps.Then there's all the oil guys. You can't remember a name with a face. Sure Chris Cooper played a JR Ewing type, but what was his name? When they start rattling off 6-7 oil bigwigs' names off, Jeffrey Wright does I mean up in that office tower, you can believe I was lost along with the rest of the audience.I had to re-read some of these reviews here to get these things aligned right in my mind.What worked? Matt Damon and his family. Good stuff there. Peet had a small role but she was fine. I liked the 'good Prince's' role. Clooney was good if lower-keyed here. Plummer, William Hurt(!-cameo!), Cooper-all fine. Enjoyed the locales.The Human Bombers/Al-Qaeda recruits who go to their demise on that boat which strikes the tanker at the end--a good storyline too. All too believable.I think a more linear plot line might not have hurt? but it's worthy of your attention just the same.*** outta ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had a message that is evident and broadcast in the media and world around us. It is an honorable goal to bring this kind of thought to the forefront through a Hollywood film, but its presentation obfuscates an already clear message to such lengths we are left with two painstaking hours of waiting for some purpose or further insight. I believe that anyone intentionally watching the film is already aware of the issues concerning oil and energy trades between the USA and overseas, why would we want to spend hours deconstructing a painfully complex puzzle to simply arrive to the same knowledge we had going into the movie?Essentially, the film seemed rather fruitless and inconsequential (incredibly boring). Instead, I was left with the unsettling concern of how much film, money, energy and oil was spent on its production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting a lot out of this movie, especially after seeing the very intelligent and interesting interview on Charlie Rose with the screenplay writer. But the result was a movie full of what cannot otherwise be described as clichés (and a few rather unnecessary story lines). So big oil is bad. Big oil, naturally, is represented by a Texan good old boy. Backroom deals with the government prevent the full disclosure of malfeasance in the domestic oil industry from being exposed because to do so would undermine our strategic national interests. The CIA betrays one of its own to cover up an undercover mission gone awry. The US backs a "business-as-usual" emir over his reformist brother with lethal consequences. Then there's a bunch of unemployed Pakistani migrant laborer youths recruited to become suicide bombers. Although it should be a shocking expose, somehow it isn't. Perhaps I've seen too much Frontline on PBS to be the target audience for this movie, which I suspect to be more of the Farhenheit 911 variety, but I can't help but to feel that there's a straw man being propped up here. The straw man (and the boogeyman) in the movie is the image of American (and big oil's) omnipotency and omnicompetency in its dealings in the region. From watching recent events unfold, I can't help but to think that that image does not reflect reality. The reality is more like America, while big, powerful and wealthy, is wildly flailing about in an unfamiliar neighborhood while getting stung on all sides by agile and cunning foes. I mean, do we really know what Iran is up to? Do we know what Saudi Arabia is up to? Do we know what Pakistan is up to? Do we really know what's going on in Iraq? Each has strategic ambitions in the region, and I think it naive to assume that they foolish enough to merely continue to spend their profits on "$20,000 per night hotel rooms" and other luxuries rather than reinvesting into their productive infrastructure and ultimately degenerate in a 100 years' time to "chopping each others heads off in the desert", as the movie's most memorable line states. I suspect the situation is more complex, with everyone trying to make each other dance to their own music. America (and big oil) just has the loudest band right now. And so if you see the situation from that perspective, I think the movie distorts the actual complexity of the situation by reducing the issue to being more black and white than it actually may be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cynical, Compelling, But Flawed Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike "Traffic" (2000) directed by Steven Soderbergh who took a direct helm over that movie, Stephen Gaghan, took over the reigns of "Syriana," formerly having writing credits for "Traffic." The results are that "Syriana" fails to deliver the same gritty, powerful intensity. Instead, the movie follows one too many strands that don't provide the personal touch, the continuity of action that "Traffic" was able to offer its audience. While the content and premise are commendable and sincere in their assumptions about the power of big oil, corruption, and the limits of government, "Syriana" drags and plods along, unlike even the more low-key "The Tailor of Panama" (2000). George Clooney, seems so over the hill that he's lost his intelligence, fumbling not so much in his performance as the script that lags severely behind such classics as "The Ipcress File" (1965) or even the more contemporary spy thriller, "Spy Game" (2001).The cinematic approach to "Syriana" tried to weave a balance between the more stark, harsh, gritty approach of "Traffic" and the mainstream, polished, big studio photography of mainstream movies resulting in something that didn't seem quite believable or real. There was either too much realism in the script development that would have required a different cinematographic approach than used in this movie or a more tightly, woven plot that would have put more intelligence into some of the scenes that seemed more manipulative or exploitative than reasonable.Six out of Ten Stars</fullReview>

However, if you're looking for entertainment, look elsewhere.There are several hard-to-follow story lines that are present about politics, big oil corporations, Arabian royalty and corruption. If you have a decent global understanding about the oil industry and the complex politics of the mid-east region, you may be able to appreciate this movie better than others.The performances by George Clooney, Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright and others were pretty intense and well-done. I just wish the stories were a little clearer so I could understand the context of the characters better.I don't recommend this movie for entertainment.

		<fullReview>Okay, oil is becoming a scarce commodity and countries are competing for control of that commodity and in the struggle for control it's a free-for-all with no rules. The "bad guy" in this movie is China, which is attempting to corner the oil supply by making a deal that will displace the United States in the mid-east. The premise is interesting, but it gets lost somewhere in this movie. One moment we're in Geneva, the next moment in Washington, DC, the next moment in Lebanon, etc. After watching this movie, I'm convinced more than ever that we have to start weaning ourselves off from oil, not only for economic and political reasons, but so that Hollywood will stop making muddled movies like this one that tries to dramatize complex economic and political issues in the mideast but wind up being simplistic and just plain boring (except for the graphic torture scene which was gratuitous and tasteless).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most disappointing movies I've seen in years. Dull, confusing, whispered dialog, and no reason to care about any of the characters. Sure, it had a point about how sleazy the oil business is, but so what? Unless you really get off on the anti-American and/or anti oil-business vibe in this film, there is almost nothing to recommend it.To several points, there are movies with whispered dialog that are to my liking, such as Godfather II. There are movies about sleazy American business to my liking, such as Wall Street. There are confusing movies to my liking, such as The Big Sleep. And I am a George Clooney fan. But the total lack of action (which is the element that was falsely advertised in the ads for this movie) got to me after a while, and just because motivations are unclear and plot elements are confusing doesn't mean there is some big hidden meaning.In its defense, the ending did tie up some loose ends, and had the solid noir feel of some better anti American movies of the late sixties and early 70's. As a whole however, a very tiresome and boring film. Thumbs way down.</fullReview>

In the end there were 2 portrayals of good - leaving and returning home to the US with family as Matt Damon's character did - or becoming a suicide bomber with a video reminiscent of the Christian burial service "ashes to ashes, dust to dust". I hope this film will not be released in the Middle East. Film has the power to encourage social change and activism, but this is not the sort of activism one wants to encourage.

		<shortDescription>As dumb as "Traffic" and as overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Syriana" is another lobotomized Hollywood attempt at the "evil corporation" movie, and views the worlds of business, lobbying and politics that Hollywood doesn't understand through ridiculously simplistic "Hollywood-tinted glasses." In essence, it is Verhoeven's "Robocop" without the comic relief. If "Syriana" were a person, it would be the preachy, earnest bore we all flee at parties.As a production, "Syriana" is well-acted and well-edited, but very poorly characterized and scripted, thus leading to a kind of character bloat that bored me to tears. There is no suspense or drama here, only a vague illusion of such created by "hiding the ball." There are too many characters for any to be well-developed, believable or sympathetic. This is probably intentional in that the premise is completely untenable without lots of detail holes.An impassioned screed near the end by Tim Blake Nelson about American corruption is both a weak ripoff of Michael Douglas's "Greed is Good" speech in "Wall Street" and Pacino's "defiance" speech in "Devil's Advocate," and a failed attempt to tie up the "message" in this mess of a movie. Nothing original here, move along.Film critics, who don't understand business or politics any better than the people who make movies like this, but love to wave their leftist flag and preach down to us "proles," have let us all down once more by evaluating the movie not on its merits as such, but on its conformance to their almost universally shared ideology (or the mishmash of half-beliefs that passes for an ideology these days). "Syriana" is one of the most overrated movies I've seen lately.Incidentally, I love well-done "paranoia" movies regardless of ideology. Rent "Three Days of the Condor" (an excellent movie) or even watch "Clear and Present Danger" (a decent movie) on one of its infinite reruns instead of wasting time and money on preachy "Syriana."</fullReview>

Overly complicated for the sake of being overly complicated, Syriana will inevitably receive praise from endless hordes of pretentious critics, not because it is entertaining or engaging or has characters you give a crap about, but solely because it is hard to follow. In other words, critics believe that by praising this bore, they will appear "smart". Excuse me while I yawn.Not nearly as clever as it thinks it is (Holy crap--there's corruption in the oil business and in the government? I never noticed!), Syriana is an annoyingly self-indulgent film; the kind where the director decides to throw a bunch of crap at the screen that makes little sense, and expects us to praise how "brilliant" it is. There is a problem, however: one has to actually be AWAKE for the director's plan to work. And therein lies Syriana's biggest fault.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex plot, simple-minded politics...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early in SYRIANA, a small child dies in a freak accident. Though the plot allows the parents to grieve somewhat, the film treats the death dispassionately, seeing it as little more than a convenient, ironic plot contrivance. Likewise, a couple more children die an even more horrifying death later in the film, and again, the filmmakers seem so indifferent to the tragedy that they don't even really recognize the kids as characters. There is a coldness to SYRIANA that renders it totally ineffective as a movie; it wants to play like a just-the-facts documentary, presumably to bolster its effectiveness as propaganda, but the gambit doesn't work. Good propaganda plays on the emotions as well as the intellect. SYRIANA ultimately plays on neither.At the heart of SYRIANA is the notion that, in order to maintain access to and control the flow of oil from the Middle East, it is imperative of the United States to keep the area in a perpetual state of political, economic and social unrest. Why? Who knows? It makes no sense, but the film boldly makes this assertion as if it is so obvious that any fool should understand it, therefore no explanation would be necessary. Likewise, the film takes for granted that ethical corruption is just business as usual in the American capitalist system and that our government routinely resorts to political assassination in order to make sure business deals work out in our favor. Is any evidence provided? Nah -- again, why bother? Just take the filmmakers' word for it. Why would they lie? Now, if this were just another mindless paranoid popcorn epic that Hollywood so slavishly loves, then we could take all of SYRIANA's bombast in stride, because when you get to the heart of it, the film offers up absolutely nothing new. The usual batch of white, male American millionaires and corporate clones and cold-as-ice government suits are, once again, the villains behind all the world's problems. But SYRIANA is an "important" film that insists that it is revealing the "truth," therefore the burden of proof should lie with it. Instead, SYRIANA sings to the proverbial choir, telling those who are on the left and/or anti-capitalist and/or anti-American exactly what they want to hear.The story, which borders on the incomprehensible, is "suggested" by a non-fiction book called "See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism" by Robert Baer, though Baer isn't a character in the movie based on his own autobiography (he became George Clooney's "Bob Barnes"). Nor is the war on terrorism a significant part of the story. Indeed, the terrorists in the film are treated rather sympathetically -- actually with more interest than the doomed children. Meanwhile, the rest of the characters are also fictionalized, the events invented, the location of the action left anonymous and even the title is a reference that is so vague and obscure as to be basically meaningless. Writer/director Stephen Gaghan's notion of "truth" is constantly on shaky ground.Cliché politics aside (which isn't easy, since the film's agenda is so blatant), the movie is just plain boring. Freeing himself of any need to adhere to historical, biographical or political reality, you'd think Gaghan would have great leeway to simplify the story to make it all easy to follow; good guy versus bad guy. Instead, he cuts a wide swath across the landscape, tries to juggle multiple story lines and bombards us with questionable information, which may or may not all come together at the end. Like with his far superior script for Stephen Soderbergh's TRAFFIC, Gaghan gives us three story threads, vaguely built around three characters: Clooney's jaded CIA assassin, Matt Damon's idealistic family man/deal maker and Jeffrey Wright's easily corrupted corporate lawyer. Unlike in TRAFFIC, instead of three complete, compelling, overlapping dramas, we get a hodge-podge of fragmented scenes which build very little momentum.There is an art to telling such multi-character, multi-layered stories, which isn't apparent here. The trick is to render each character as a vivid individual; Robert Altman is a master at this and Paul Thomas Anderson has the knack as well. Gaghan gives us a screen crowded with recognizable actors (Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper, Robert Foxworth, etc.), but you'd be hard pressed at the end to identify them by character name or even their place in the story. Details apparently aren't as important as the number of characters and complications Gaghan can concoct. His logic, it seems, is to throw as much at the viewer as possible, hoping that somehow it will all make sense -- or avoid making sense. But chaos doesn't equal complexity, no more than incoherence equals mystery. Gaghan admits his intent was to leave the viewer confused; was that to disguise his simple minded politics? Whatever, SYRIANA is just a badly made movie.And there is a certain racism embedded in this movie and its politics. By overstating American power (to do both good and bad), the film embraces a perverse egotism that demeans the people of Third World by implying they are mere pawns or puppets -- and not individuals who can control their destinies. Instead of missionaries saving the world from paganism, we're getting liberals who think they are saving the world from corporate greed. Instead of embracing a respect and compassion for those in the Middle East -- including the terrorists -- films like SYRIANA promote a condescending pity.</fullReview>

I was expecting it to be set in the 1980's and 90's when Baer was undercover, but it was set post 9-11 and didn't flow as well because of this.It would have been nice for Soderbergh to show some truth about what these Islamic schools teach to impressionable young minds. It's not all soccer, cricket and Koran as they portrayed it. There is a lot of racism, brainwashing and lies. A lot of "non-Muslims are pigs, they should be struck down for being infidels and unbelievers" that goes on in these camps.Characters like Daniel Dalton are not on screen long enough for one to remember who he his when his name comes up later in the movie. One ends up asking the question, "Who the F*** is Daniel Dalton?"The film just didn't live up to the hype and excitement that has been building since I first heard of it. Some of the supporting secondary characters are poorly introduced, with the exception of Jeffry Wright and Chris Cooper, who was excellent in this film. The basic knowledge of US support for the Arab Prince that allows us to build military bases in their country and sells to USA, not China was nothing new. Clooney's character wanting to see his target face to face at the end is not believable enough for me and was predictable as all of these scenes always are. The ending stunk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honestly, just not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I respect the whole political thing that they were going for and all, but it just wasn't very good. It dragged (editing was crap... it was like they put every bit of footage they had in there).It jumps from character to character at the beginning, which isn't impossible to follow if you pay attention, but its honestly pretty boring and takes some effort to pay attention to. Although the stories tie together at the end its sort of vague and they seem to wrap up each character's story as quickly as possible.It would be best suited for a BBC radio play. There's no reason to make it a movie. The visual element adds nothing to this movie. Its all dialogue, and not particularly riveting dialogue at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what I thought of this movie. I had a hard time following the plot -- if there was one. There were lots of factions, lots of characters, lots and lots and lots of villains, and it was difficult to sort out who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. I don't think there were any good guys -- just relative degrees of badness.American Big Business was the baddest of all, followed closely by American government. But the Arabs weren't good, either. There was an American lawyer and I couldn't ever quite figure out how bad (or good) he was. I think he was relatively good, for a lawyer.The gist of it is, It's a Damn Shame, What We're Doing Over There.I already knew that, and I lie awake nights hoping it's not as bad as, sometimes, I think it is.It's probably even worse.Anyway, it's an engaging, well-edited, fascinating political-intrigue movie, and maybe you will understand what the hell is going on, better than I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have to be kidding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film started nowhere, and ended in the same place. It was extremely difficult to follow the plot, or lack thereof. It is a crying shame that all these actors, including George Clooney and Matt Damon, put themselves through this hunk of mess. The screenplay and order of the film seemed all over the place. The camera was also shaky, a lot like Bourne Supremacy or Alexander. This film was by far one of the worst of 2005, others including The Pacifier or The Wedding Date. The worst part of it is, this film had potential. The plot seemed like it was going places, the only thing is it didn't even start. The only thing I enjoyed in this film was George Clooney's acting, which wasn't even that wonderful. He does have one scene where I thought he deserved recognition, but overall he doesn't and neither does anyone else in this film. Stephen Gaghan's only work that was decent was Traffic, and it is apparent and blatantly obvious that he will do anything to write something like that again. It is like George Lucus trying to bring back Star Wars because that is all he has, Gaghan is the same way but not nearly as obvious. I'm just rambling now, but Syriana is not worth the money or the time. There are a lot better movies considering it is Oscar season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm using this movie as a litmus test. My cousin, his wife and I, despite combined IQs that total around 500 points, could not follow this picture at all, aside from the fact that all the stories had something to do with people whose lives were affected by the Middle Eastern oil business. There was absolutely no plot, and no reason whatsoever to care what happened to the characters. People who call this film "smart" are probably afraid that, if they admit to incomprehension, they'll be found out, that their friends will discover that they're actually stupid. These folks probably also claim to understand Derrida, structuralism, and other silly French theories. But now, if I learn that somebody liked "Syriana," I'll know that I probably should not plunk down ten bucks to see any movie they recommend. Very helpful, in IMHO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Corruption is our protection. Corruption keeps us safe and warm. Corruption is why you and I are prancing around in here instead of fighting over scraps of meat out in the street. Corruption ... is why we win." Is Danny Dalton (Tim Blake Nelson), one of several uninteresting characters in this epic snoozefest, referring to the oil industry or the industry that produced the very misleading ads for Syriana? I'll give 'em credit - they put together a very intriguing trailer. I walked into the theater expecting a fast-paced, engaging, nail-biting, possibly controversial thriller. I walked out of the theater wondering if I could actually sue a movie studio for the worst case of false advertisement I've witnessed this year.I already gave this movie two hours of my life, and I really don't feel like giving it much more, so I'll make this short and sweet: I'd buy Kevin Federline's (what up, K-Fed?) upcoming CD before I ever sat through Syriana again. I know - ouch.Why did I loathe the movie so much? Well, the absence of a discernible story certainly didn't help. The movie basically tells us that the oil industry and everybody involved with it are corrupt and all about money. However, it doesn't bother to tell us this in any sort of interesting or engaging manner.Instead, it bounces around five or six different story lines (there's no way I'm going to the trouble of figuring out the exact number), each as boring as the others, in an effort to convince us that just because it's complex means it's intelligent. It is not. The convoluted storytelling never finds a flow or rhythm, and it will never find your interest. Rather than serving to engage your mind, it serves to force your indifference. It's quite ironic that the movie's tagline is "Everything is connected" when in fact none of the story lines have any real connection to each other (they barely intersect at all), and they certainly don't connect to form one cohesive story.Characters are introduced but relationships are never realized. "Hey, let's show that Clooney has a son who is somewhat neglected, but let's just drop the subject and not go anywhere with it!" "Hey, black dude lawyer has conflicts with his alcoholic father. Should we show any sort of resolution? Nah, we have 20 other unemotional characters to brush over with a broad stroke." Congratulations, Syriana, you continually found ways to make me care less and less about new characters and subplots.This is the first movie this year where I actually became detached and just stopped paying attention. At one point I hopelessly stared at the theater's ceiling and wondered, "What's up with the holes in the ceiling? Did somebody throw pens up there or something?" I'm not joking. The worst moment came when I looked at my watched and it was only 8:45 PM. An hour later when I looked at my watch again it was only 9:00 PM. I could have cried. I would have walked out of the movie if I didn't feel I had to sit through the whole thing in order for my review to have 100% integrity. Consider this an example of me takin' one for the team (you baseball fans know what I'm talking about).I didn't lose interest so quickly because the movie was too complex for me to follow; it was because I just didn't care. Neither the "story" nor the unemotional characters gave me any reason to invest my interest. Clooney couldn't have given a more wooden, monotone performance if he was playing the lead role in The Josh Hartnett Story. If all these so-called "big name" actors are going to sleepwalk on the screen then why should I invest myself? I have no trouble declaring to you, without stutter or stammer, that this is flat-out the dullest movie of the year. It's not intelligent, it's not thought-provoking, it's not engaging, it's not even controversial. It's just ... there. Plodding along with no real focus. I expected this film to be a one-sided affair, but I didn't expect it to side with boredom! You read that right - the film can't even figure out a way to offend people who might disagree with its conspiracy-minded stance. About the only thing the movie will offend is your budgetary sense once you realize that your time and money have been wasted, never to be seen again.I suppose watching the smug George Clooney being tortured provided me with a little perverse joy, even if it was only a fictional beating. But man, I couldn't even enjoy that scene fully because while his fingernails were being pulled out all I could think about was that's how it felt to be sitting through this two hour cure for insomnia.Not to sound arrogant, but I sure envy y'all having a reviewer like me that you trust to warn you against seeing mind-numbing bores like Syriana. I wish I had been warned.</fullReview>

If only the writer/director melded the ingredients with greater clarity and emotional weight. The corruption, double-dealing and greed of governments and individuals, more pertinent now than ever, should have lent itself to a powerful, devastating film. Yes, we leave the theater with our increasingly cynical views of the world confirmed. But the film should have done more for an audience already jaded before the lights went down. This is no MISSING, the absorbing Costa-Gravas film which almost from its beginning, left the audience enthralled and unusually uneasy. That political film both provoked and entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Middle East and Oil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Gaghan bravely attempts to deal with the troubled politics of the Middle East and the oil companies that supposedly dominate the region. George Clooney is a CIA operative who becomes immersed in a plot to guarantee control of a Persian Gulf emirate. Meanwhile, the two sons of the ailing emir struggle to gain control of the emirate by negotiating oil deals with foreign powers, including the Chinese. Another thread of the film is the Palestinian workers who are shown virtually enslaved in the emirate, abused and alienated, and fresh prey for the propaganda of the Islamic terrorists. Then another strand in this multinational and multilingual film concerns Matt Damon as an oil analyst who befriends the more educated son of the Emir. There are many fine closeups of this handsome actor, and Matt makes a believable young father. The film is disconcerting, however, by trying to mix too many intriguing stories at once and by some inconsistent camera work. So, the violence and murder and torture that pervade this film fail to have the impact that such violence usually has in other films. Nevertheless, it is a pleasure to see Clooney and Damon together again in a film. Perhaps there will be a Syriana II that takes full advantage of their superb acting with a more focused script and smoother hand held camera work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet still they avoid the "Israel" question.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will write what Robert Fisk said a bout this movie: Syriana, Clooney's epic of the oil trade which combines suicide bombers, maverick CIA agents (one of them played by Clooney himself), feuding Middle East Arab potentates - one of whom wants real democracy and wealth for his people and control of his own country's resources - along with a slew of disreputable businessmen and east coast lawyers. The CIA eventually assassinates the Arab prince who wants to take control of his own country's oil (so much for democracy) - this is accomplished with a pilotless aerial bomb guided by men in a room in Virginia - while a Pakistani fired from his job in the oil fields because an American conglomerate has downsized for its shareholders' profits destroys one of the company's tankers in a suicide attack."People seem less afraid now," Clooney told an interviewer in Entertainment magazine. "Lots of people are starting to ask questions. It's becoming hard to avoid the questions." Of course, these questions are being asked because of America's more than 2,000 fatalities in Iraq rather than out of compassion for Iraq's tens of thousands of fatalities. They are being pondered because the whole illegal invasion of Iraq is ending in calamity rather than success.Yet still they avoid the "Israel" question. The Arab princes in Syriana - who in real life would be obsessed with the occupation of the West Bank - do not murmur a word about Israel. The Arab al-Qa'ida operative who persuades the young Pakistani to attack an oil tanker makes no reference to Israel - as every one of bin Laden's acolytes assuredly would. It was instructive that Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 did not mention Israel once.</fullReview>

People were leaving the theater as we were watching it. The story is all over the place and it doesn't quite develop into anything. It looks like they sacrificed rhythm and tempo for political facts. Because of this movie I'm not allowed to pick movies anymore amongst my friends. The film makers failed to understand that in the end movies are for entertainment and unfortunately failed to make something out of all the talent on and off the screen. I should say that it had a few good moments of human drama like when the kid dies in the pool and the ending of the film. Other than that the movie was a disappointment and lacked any kind of human drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To much a summary and no deep coverage of terrorist's motives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the purpose of this film was to instruct people concerning the development of a young Muslim terrorist, then I here learned little useful. A young impoverished Pakistani or whoever he was could not find a job, but nevertheless suddenly finds Allah and a desire for mass murder. This seems rather a unmotivated shift in difficulties and the movie never really provides a sincere motive (seems like most arguments in support or definition of modern terrorists, i.e., a person is poor and somehow thinks that God will give him a fairer shake should he himself (said terrorist) explode himself against an oil tanker). Real life never seems so desperate; however, ignorant youth may be persuaded otherwise. Maybe Clooney and friends are right that this is all the motive a young punk kid in east Asia needs to commit mass murder. Nevertheless, the deeper aspirations of such crazies was not well organized and explained in the film.And who exactly was Clooney playing in this film? The scene where he threatens the token white rich man with death seemed rather the cliché, not to mention the finger nail scene and the threats of head removal. Clooney's cliché cold warrior never made any sense in this film. The CIA also plays an intangible role here. And what about the state department or any number of gook squads here or abroad? Where is their part in this film? The concentration on American business people and American hegemony begs the question: where the hell does everyone else in the world live and what do they use to fuel their cars and homes? Where in this film Mr. Clooney was BP (British P...) or any number of other players? Are only American business people bad folk? Do you think the Chinese will feed the world's poor and hungry? Do all Arabs have a strange fascination for the bloody head?This movie really rushed through everything and made no lasting impression on me, except to say that oil is scarce and it takes a little cunning to fight for it. I am not sure that I should feel sadly should some Saudi prince die for my low-priced unleaded or should some ignorant poor teen Muslim blow himself to pieces for God. Neither stories are new or interesting in human affairs even if they comprise some of our transient current dilemmas.My advice for Clooney and friends: next time concentrate on the business people and forget the spy nonsense. What do spies really know anyway? I want to know more about the business people who make the type of deals outlined in the film. I would like to see how they suffer from hurting others, especially since so many of these Texas folks seem so in love with Jesus. Lastly, tells us something about European and Chinese business in the world. Alas, Americans comprise only 5% of the world's population. Dig deeper in one area next time and cover less ground. Maybe we will finally learn something tangible concerning world affairs from film, instead of the typical low brow intellectualism and barely masked whining for some impossible world utopianism that is so pervasive in Hollywood these days.</fullReview>

The people I went with who are 17 and 19 didn't even get it. What was going on? Through the whole movie I didn't even realize that Bob Barnes was a CIA agent and it didn't help either that I hadn't read the synopisis before I saw it. I guess this movie would have been good if you knew about politics. The camera work in this movie was strange. It shook around a lot and made me sick. What was the cinematographer trying to do?What confused me the most is when Bryan Woodman's son got electrocuted in the pool. No one really seemed to care that a little kid was just vaporised and also it didn't seem to make any difference at all in the rest of the movie. Then at the end when everyone was blowing up I was like, huh? Why did he die? What did he do? Why were they all in boats? Was that a rocket launcher he used to ram into that dock? Okay if you're an average Joe or Jane this movie is definitely not for you, even if you like movie with deep plots this movie is still not for you.

The scenery and cinematography drove the film and illuminated the reality of the disparate environments of the characters -- government bureaucrats, oil executives, Gulf state workers, Gulf state royalty, madrassa "students", etc. Negatives: Bad writing, zero character development and stilted acting which resulted in subplots and characters that were neither engaging nor believable. I didn't find the subplots confusing -- it seemed natural that the subject would involve all of these parties. But I did wish that I had brought some alternate entertainment to get me through the 2+ hours. With this subject, director, cast and budget it should have been so much better. I hate to give a bad review to one of the few films that tackles serious subjects -- but the film has the feel of a first cut that no one involved bothered to bring to the next level.</fullReview>

You would also be advised to bring a thesaurus just in case, maybe a world globe, and study the various groups that have come to shape the fabric of international diversity and industry.Obviously I have no idea what I have just said, but my point is that they have deliberately attempted to make this film confusing in an attempt make themselves seem smarter than the viewer.

		<fullReview>Sure, the oil industry and all that stuff is foreign to most of us. Does the movie Syriana open our eyes to what is believed to be going on? Sure. Do I care? No. The movie is nauseating. Cant relate to the characters. It can be followed, its not easy to follow but it isn't fun at all. There is nothing about this movie that makes me want to suggest it to others. The dialogue was terrible. I am not a fan in any way and i am very easy to please. I usually am a fan of Damon and Clooney but i wasn't impressed with what they had to offer with the exception of Clooney's beard. This really seemed like the poor man's traffic, a bunch of odd story lines each of which is unexciting in its own way. You come away wondering what you just watched and then when you read a review hyping it as an eye opening look at the government and the oil industry, one should at least expect something exciting. This is not exciting at all. The music is distracting and takes away from moments instead of adding to them. Yuck</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The equivalent of an interpretive dance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie attempts to do for oil what Traffic did for drugs, and involved many of the same film makers. However, it failed miserably to live up to that challenge. While Traffic bit off a great deal, by covering many complex sub-plots simultaneously, this movie covered many subplots that all lacked any depth or complexity. It was a dance of shadow-puppets, where texture was replaced with innuendo, and vagueness was dressed up as subtlety.Quite frankly, the movie makers seemed to be clearly leaning on the notion that the politically-charged nature of the subject matter would be sufficient to allow anyone who noticed that the movie sucked to be accused of either political bias or a lack of intelligence. Once you get past all of that, what you have left is a movie which really didn't bother to make a point, except perhaps that the CIA works to protect the interests of US oil consumption.In other news, the sun rises in the east. The movie was about as informative or insightful as a commercial for cereal.The gaping holes in the plot were not the sorts of intricacies that can or should be filled in by a grasp of subtlety and context. Rather, the gaps were in the departments of point and plot. Rather than being like a Dogma 95 concatenation of events that could be tied together to a broader theme, the movie was a theme with a bunch of random, short excursions into various minor aspects. The only thing that was clear and obvious was the theme, while the characters and their experiences were vague, unengaging, and asinine.But you have to give the producers credit for knowing that their core audience would laud the film without needing to actually even see it.If you want to see a good movie, go see Lord of War instead. Much greater depth, insight, directing, and character development, and plenty of fodder for the left-leaning dissenters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a must Not_See. It is impossible to follow, there is little to no character development, the ending is stupid. In order to post this comment it needs to be 10 lines long. So to give you a sense of what the movie is like, follow these seemingly unconnected clues. Mary had a little lamb. The swallows file south to Capistrano. Who is Sylvia? "Out of all the gin joints in the whole world, she has to walk into mine." The middle east has a lot of oil. The U.S. uses a lot of oil. The Chinese might get some one day, oh no! Politicians and oil companies are corrupt and use high price law firms. Blah Blah Blah Blah. I hope this was edifying to your understanding of this complex phenomena of world commerce and secret service intrigue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot about nothing ( kinda a spoiler not really, I hide them till end)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*(READ)* To further convey my points I have examples at the bottom of the page so for those who have not seen it, this will not have the movie ruined. *(READ)*This movie was bit of a let down. After having seen and very much enjoyed Traffic, I was excepting nothing great because I had heard little about this movie (aside from it being from the same people who made traffic). I was at least excepting something to Traffic's caliber. But this one fell very short of that movie and left me feeling nothing for what I had just seen. It was well acted and very well directed, but the plot was very dry and empty, along with the editing. I understood through out the movie what was going on, who each person was, and what they were doing and so on. It relies on you to fill a lot in for yourself never telling you simple things. (Example A.) As I watched this movie I felt like I was doing no more then peering into the lives of these people at a certain random moments. (Example D.) Then at the end they try and tie it all together, but it just falls flat on its face. I understand they are trying to convey the birth and growth of each type of person involved in each aspect of the oil controversy going on at the moment. This part was done decently. The writer tended to throw little things into a characters construction to try and add depth to the character, but this came off pointless and it was very obviously done. (Example B. and D.) Also the ending, was very hastily done you could tell. It felt like they had lost direction of the movie somewhere along the way and realized they had made you sit there for 2 hours and they needed to end it. (Example C.) This movie was trying to hard to do too much, and in the end did nothing. I understood it was trying to show that there are two sides to every story and that the bad guys may be good and the good, bad. But there was nothing going on through the whole movie, nothing solid, just a bunch of little things that were half ass-ed that you would hear in a freshman college creative writing class. It has a pretty cover, slick style, and many outlets of story telling, but when you put that aside for a moment and see the bulk of the movie, you will truly see there is nothing there.If this movie was shown to someone, who didn't know anything about the current oil conflict, that person would be clueless as to what the movie was even about.**********SPOILERS BEGIN**********(Example A.) George Clooney's character was never given a title, the only way they conveyed who he was, was by not saying it, and using code words for him. Also they never officially told you who Matt Damons Character was supposed to be until close to the end.(Example B.) Amanda Peets character was pointless; they were trying to convince you that this hard core business man (Matt Damon's character) would marry a vegan naturalist like her. Then at the end he goes back home and they have this awkward family moment. Just you never cared for anyone in this movie enough to try and figure them out or anything along those lines.(Example C.) The way George Clooney's character died was pointless, if he had something to say he was standing there for at least 5 min, and he could have said it, also he worked for the government since at least 1982 as they constantly stated in the movie, he had to have known something was coming to kill the Prince. This just seemed way to continent and idiotic. Matt Damon's return home, there was nothing leading up to this, not his coming home, but the actions that take place there after. They were trying to get more from this then were there. That Matt Damon's character all of a sudden realized how much family truly means, and that his life with oil means nothing compared to his family. But the major flaw is that's not what the movie was about or truly anything to do with it.(Example D.) The investigators father who was always on the steps because he was (and this is never told they just magically accepted you to get who this random guy was) a drunk or they were fighting for one reason or another, and his son didn't respect him until the end. No other reason then the son had a rough day and didn't want to fight with him any more. This is once again subplot, and supposed character development that didn't need to be there and came off annoying rather then beneficial to the character. The whole story about the suicide bomber and how he grew to become one, was interesting to see his growth, but had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. No where in the rest of the movie where there any suicide bombings or terrorist attacks. If you want to show the growth of a suicide bomber do it but make it have some relevance to the rest of the movie, or the movie be about that. Cause if this movie was shown to someone who didn't know anything about the current oil conflict, that person would be clueless as to why that was even in the movie.</fullReview>

And the amount of loose ends that were not tied up was ridiculous. Happily, I'm sure that there is another 3-4 hours of "film" on the cutting room floor that I did not have to suffer through.The political leaning of the film has nothing to do with how i feel about this waste of $10. If you want to make a political statement, you should go out, get in front of the TV camera, and say something. However, don't make hard working people shell out big bucks to watch a pointless film that makes your point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The message is obvious, the story isn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Still in awe of George Clooney's "Good Night and Good Luck," I was looking forward to his upcoming "Syriana," a "very contemporary" adventure story about oil, the Middle East, the CIA, and what have you.Stephen Gaghan (of "Traffic," and supposedly, first choice for "The Da Vinci Code" that he turned down) directed a slick, fast-paced film that's both frustratingly obscure and annoyingly obvious. From the very beginning, it's clear what's being said (corporations are slime, politicians are corrupt, reform-minded oligarchs will be rubbed out), but good luck figuring out what actually is happening... and why.A special mystery: why was Clooney required to put 40 extra pounds on for the film? Do you have to be fat to be a high-minded gun-for-hire? On the plus side: if you don't like Clooney, you will enjoy the extended torture scene.In this new genre of the politically meaningful, "Syriana" is somewhere at the midpoint of the spectrum whose low end is the lamentable Nicholas Cage "Lord of War," and the slightly-flawed high point is "The Constant Gardener."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was anticipating "Syriana" like a fat kid anticipates the ice-cream truck on a summer's day in the Persian Gulf. Only thing is...that ice-cream truck never shows up. Especially not in the Persian Gulf.The same is true with "Syriana." This 2 hour-plus movie feels like eight hours on a bumpy flight. The dialogue is delivered at such a fast pace, and is chock-full of nuances, metaphors, and political innuendos. I'm not an ignorant American like, say, the President is, but this movie was way too confusing. The seven or eight separate story lines that the film kept jumping back and forth through were difficult to follow. And performance-wise, nobody really stands out. Most scenes feel like the director gave the actors a list of statistics and turned on the camera and said, "Now repeat what you just read." I will say that the cinematography was impressive and the soundtrack was slightly less annoying than "The Weatherman" (by the way...what is it with the glitch-techno crap filmmakers seem to be putting into EVERY movie that comes out?). Matt Damon and George Clooney are fun to watch. Everyone else is either too underdeveloped or boring, to put it simply.And in conclusion....we know the oil business is corrupt and evil and blah, blah, blah. If you want to soapbox your point-of-view, then do so. Otherwise, take the time to write a good story and make a GOOD movie about the corruption of the oil industry. If you can't do either...don't waste our time.</fullReview>

Of course, if you are a Clooney fan, then....go see the porky version. Otherwise, I would stay away. Definitely not worth the 8.00 bucks I paid. When I read some of the raving reviews this piece of pretentious trash has been given on this site I wonder what movie these "reviewers" saw. All the discussion and emphasis on conservative vs. liberal points of view, hidden agendas and subliminal messages is pointless. It just ain't there. If it is there it is obscured by the crappiest editing job and a script written and edited by dyslexic single digit IQ amateurs. Waste not your money.

		<shortDescription>Could have been a first rate political thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Syriana is a convoluted story with far too many characters for most people to keep up with. I wasn't lost but my husband fell asleep at least twice. One can enjoy a slow story, one that works it's way up to a good climax. One that strings you along then drops in a welcome and thought-provoking ending. That's the real problem with Syriana it strings you along. It's slow but there is no pay off. There's just the obvious ending. This picture doesn't so much lack passion for the cast, which is sometimes Hollywood contrived as it lacks passion for storytelling. Except for one scene I knew what was going to happen long before it did, that's too bad. The acting was first rate, especially the doomed prince, George Clooney and Jeffrey Wright. It does jump around a lot and since that requires you attention the slowness makes it difficult for some, like my husband. So it was an average movie who's message by the way was not preachy or Farenheit 911ish. One last sad point I sure would have like to know the deal Jeffrey Wright character made for himself, see the Black guy get the top job, the Bentley, the yacht. Where was that scene?</fullReview>

While the acting was fine, I left the movie not having a clue as to what it was about. The action takes place in Texas, Washington, Afghanistan, Iran and elsewhere and has so many characters it is hard to keep them all straight. Evidently the movie was about corruption in the oil business, but you couldn't prove it by me. It seemed as though there were separate directors in each location and none of them knew what the others were doing. The viewer is not given enough information and some scenes seem to start in the middle. To sum it up, it is the worst movie I've seen in many years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw Syriana, I fell asleep. Halfway through the movie, the person I was with leaned over and asked if it made any sense (this was before I fell asleep), and I had to honestly answer it didn't.I thought I should give it another try, so I saw it again. This time, I didn't fall asleep, and I understood what was going on, but I realized it simply was not a good movie. It was a good story, but the director gave us no time to learn who the characters were, what they were doing, and what their connections were with each other, with the notable exception of the Matt Damon character's family. Even they weren't fully realized characters, however.The scenes are too short, and the director over-uses the shaky/choppy pseudo-documentary style of camera work which drives me crazy. I can understand the use in certain instances, such as when the characters are walking, but he even used it while shooting a meeting in a board room, where everyone is seated and there is no logical reason for using this annoying technique. I realize this may be a personal preference issue on my part. The director also gives us far too many close ups, denying us the ability to see body language which is all too important in a movie such as this.The story was good, but the movie was not.The best scene in the movie was when Matt Damon's character's son jumped into a swimming pool. When he emerged from under the water, the look on the boy's face was priceless.</fullReview>

The premise was on target, but the film seemed to have been put together by a 12 year old trying to make a movie. The last real bad movie I watched (Fell asleep), The age of Innocence was bad, but this one took the cake. It seemed to me that the director was trying to fit all this pieces of film together before the year was up. Really bad editing. Clooney was his usual self, but did a good job with the character, and seemed pained that he was doing this picture. The trailer was better than the film. One of the reasons I went to see it. I expected some action, but almost went to sleep waiting. Everyone that asked me about the movie, I told to wait for it on HBO, and maybe not even there. My wife was bored to tears.

The film was made along the same concept as Crash only without anything remotely interesting happening between the first scene and the last 10 minutes. Half way through the movie it is clear where the movie is going and how the story lines will eventually connect. Unfortunately, it takes way to long for things to happen. I was very intrigued by the concept presented in the trailers and based on the reviews on IMDb was excited to see Syriana.

Corperate America is what made this country the most dominant nation in the world.

To top it off Stephen Gaghan decided that going mostly hand-held with an epileptic cameraman was a great addition to this crapper.I left this movie wondering what I just saw.

However, if you have the patience to weather it out, it can have a payoff (I guess). Fortunately, I brought along someone intelligent who explained the finer points of the plot to me afterwords! It turns out one of the main points of the movie is how these countries with oil could be better organized &amp; work together- resulting in the ability to invest what they get &amp; build a stabler society. This, however, isn't in the interest of the oil companies-- they want chaos so they can maintain the control. My advice: drink lots of caffeine before seeing the film &amp; bring along someone else in case you get lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is "Syriana" the most anti-American film ever to come out of mainstream Hollywood?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is "Syriana" the most anti-American film ever to come out of mainstream Hollywood? There have always been, and there should be, movies that take a critical look at American society and foreign policy. I think of Missing, a 1981 movie which asked whether US ambassadors in Chile were aware of, or even accommodated, murders of left-wing radicals in Chile during the 1970's. The best recent example is Academy-award winner Crash, which examines human behavior and racial stereotypes ? on both sides ? in Los Angeles.These movies worked because they were based on actual facts or public knowledge. But Syriana is not just a liberal history ? it is radical, anti-American fantasy. What I am hearing is that Syriana goes over the line and makes hysterical allegations about the methods and results of US policy in the Middle-East. Admittedly I have not seen the movie, but after reading the critics, especially Charles Krauthammer's scathing commentary in last Friday's Washington Post, I would not give the creeps who produced this pack of lies one cent of my money. In Syriana, the CIA fires a missile that assassinates a reform-minded prince and his family, a man who wants to bring democracy and justice to his corrupt nation. (Is it true they fire the missile from CIA HQ in Langley? How absurd ? just goes to show how out of touch with reality the movie is.) According to Syriana, we care only for oil, and will support any dictator that helps us get it. In the movie's climax, a noble hero becomes a suicide bomber. The outright enemy in Syriana is the US government.If this was true, we would have supported Saddam Hussein much longer than we did, rather than turning away from his brutal regime in the late 1970's. If this was true, we would not have helped Hamid Karzai, a gentleman and true democrat, become leader of Afghanistan. If this was true, we would not be sacrificing lives and billions of dollars to bring democracy to Iraq, and so sway the ultimate balance of power in the Middle East away from dictators and oligarchs. As Krauthammer puts it, "On the very night the Oscars will be honoring Syriana, American soldiers will be fighting, some perhaps dying, in defense of precisely the kind of tolerant, modernizing Muslim leader that Syriana shows America slaughtering." So what the hell is going on in Hollywood? Syriana is a disgraceful insult to the American people and an act of treachery against our troops and our interests. I write this asking for your civil responses. If you agree, please do your part to spread the word and stop this movie from infecting minds with its malignant, anti-American propaganda.</fullReview>

There was a comment made that the U.S. would lean on the prince's nation to buy unprofitable boeing planes or whatever....huh? He doesn't have to buy American goods if he doesn't want to. He can invest in his country using America's dollars just as easily as China's. This movie is bad and disjointed. The son of the oil exec dies....for no reason! The terrorists...have nothing to do with the story (and spare me the blah blah blah about how it's all tied in because unjust dictators who are U.S. lackeys which control middle eastern nations create terrorists. The Saudi's can invest in whatever company/currency they want. (Aren't they already doing this as they diversify out of dollars?) And look at Iran. We have no diplomatic ties with them yet they sell their oil to us because we are a good buyer. Excuse me, but America securing our own interests is not comparable to two-bit terrorists. Liberals would most undoubtedly not consider it a crime for the Chinese to deal for oil, but America gets blamed. Hollywood at its best.

The result is a miasma of disconnected plot threads with dreadful attempts to tie them together in a confusing, cinematic climax very near the end of the film. I read Baer's book, upon which this film is supposedly based. "Syriana" has as much to do with Baer's book as Robert Downey's comedy, "Air America" had to do with Robbins' historically researched work of the same name. See "Syriana" if you must.

		<fullReview>I have seen many movies in my life and I can appreciate movies that educate and entertain. This movie was so boring and awful that half of the audience walked out in the middle of it. I stuck it out to see if it got better. I was so upset that for the first time in my life I finished seeing it and still politely asked for a refund. To my surprise they gave me passes to see another movie. This film is a total bore. I go to the movies to be above all, entertained. What a waste of my time. I consider this a rip-off, a total disrespect to the movie loving audience. I pride my self in seeing value when others don't. I just ask to have a couple of hours of fun and enjoyment. Wow,was I and everybody else in the audience disappointed. The only comment in defence of the movie was "but that is true". So what!! I can read the papers or see the news for that. Only the news would have reported it in a more interesting way. Some will disagree but that night in the theatre very few left content all were fuming mad and suggested that we tell as many people as possible so they won't get ripped off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously made by the liberal Hollywood crazies... Horrible movie that is just a use of propaganda to get on the president and government as it is. I have completely lost ALL respect for George Clooney for appearing in this movie. The movie gets on President Bush along with in the same way as that cnn and other liberal groups do. Honestly as a political scientist i am disgusted with the whole movie... I am not Conservative, but this movie just makes me look down on all democrats and Hollywood for trying to put out deceitful lies to the public. don't support this movie. I found that the movie is not even entertaining at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was horrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There aren't too many movies that I walk out of but this was definitely one of them. I still have no idea what this movie was about. I didn't care about any of the characters and quite frankly didn't even care about how it ended. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. Since it didn't end fast enough for me, I ended it myself by walking out of it. There were too many sub-titles and quite frankly I am sorry I wasted my money on it. I am a George Clooney fan, but this movie was a real dud for him. What was he thinking? I am sure it was about oil but exactly what is anybody's guess. The movie was also too dark for me.Save your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is put on very well thanks to a great director, it will keep you glued to your seat and bouncing up and down at the same time. At the same time I believe this movie is a bunch of propaganda. It is another movie, of countless such as "Munich", that has a very twisted plot to make the viewer see the message their way. It is basically another way for Hollywood to demoralize America, and show how evil, self-centered wrong do-ers we greedy Americans supposedly are. Or at least the Republican Party is, and the Bush Adminastriation. So if your an anarchist, communist, socialist, or liberal have fun watching the movie and enjoying the message. But if your a conservative Republican or patriotic, which seems to be a crime these days, and really want to watch the movie, go ahead enjoy. But be warned that you will only enjoy how the movie was filmed, not the meaning behind it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy, not true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clearly a fantasy, this should not be labeled as anything like "the true story of a CIA operative." With Saddam Hussein changed into a benevolent Arab prince, all Americans portrayed as greedy and corrupt, and suicide bombers presented as freedom fighters, this movie is pure fiction with little resemblance to reality.The truth was that the agent was nearly murdered by the Palestinian terrorists from Hezbollah--the opposite of Clooney's story. I don't need to refute the other points of this movie, as they are completely ridiculous. This is an obvious attempt to influence the opinion of the ignorant public to pro-terrorist sympathy instead of showing them as the murderous evil-doers that they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.What a disappointment. We couldn't wait to see this movie, however, the trailers for it were very deceiving this movie has nothing to offer. Not exciting, boring very long and very hard to follow plot.Understand that my wife and I like 99% of the movies that we see, so rating this so low, says something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not an ounce of originality in this movie. An evil US corporation, bent on making money (incredible) is taking advantage of poor natives and keeps them down. The natives are decent and honest people, but the multinational corporation will not let them be. It is just taking advantage and manipulates its government. Uff! And the Hollywood is surprised that people do not go to the movies any more. But the filming is nice, the shoots are good and the actors play well. In fact there is a lot of big names in this movie and Amanda Peet is great to look at. All in all what a waste of talent to do another "propaganda" movie that exposes the evil multinational corporation and evil capitalist system. The understanding of the Muslim culture is naive beyond belief. In this movie, the Arabs think exactly like the people in LA, except that they wear white robes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Souless and Boring Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Syriana certainly covers an important subject its execution is void of any feeling. The film follows the paths of several uninteresting characters involved in the complex world of oil trade. The film begins promisingly enough introducing each characters role, and how their involvement in the nasty business of oil effects their family members. Amanda Peet is especially strong as Matt Damon's suffering wife, but is given little to do. For over two long hours the film becomes a series of sketches of incredibly boring discussions on oil trade and legal complications, with a few scraps of human drama thrown in. There is the subplot about young men who are laid off from working at oil factories and are led into terrorism. Than there is Jeffery Wright, who is wasted, once again playing a supporting role, as a lawyer who seems not to feel much of anything. He has an alcoholic father who he ignores. George Clooney, who gives a good performance, has a son that he ignores. Clearly there is a thread of father-son conflict at work here, but it doesn't seem sincere. The problem of SYRIANA is its compelling material made with no passion. It has a self- satisfied air and seems to care nothing about the audience. It wants you to know how smart the filmmakers are and how sophisticated they are at avoiding human emotions. Yes it's great for a film to make you think and to educate you. But for many going to the movies is also an emotional experience, and this has about as much feeling as an episode of Nightline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Mish Mash of a Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to see the highly anticipated preview of Syriana last nigh with my wife, expecting a great movie after seeing the coming attractions. It has two of my favorite stars in it, Matt Damon and George Clooney, so how could it miss. This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time, starting out the first 15 minutes, we are taken all over the world, with no connection. It was more like a travelogue than a story. Having spent two hours watching it, I still do not know what the story line was and am totally confused. Please, Please don't waste your money on this Bomb, as matter of fact forget about the DVD when it comes out shortly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traffic wannabe. Why didn't Soderbergh direct?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not a thriller. It's not even drama. This is nothing more than a (near) futile exercise in political cynicism, completely void of emotion, characters or story. I understand most posters' enthusiasm. A movie about the interwoven machinations of oil and politics was long overdue. And the film is well-researched, no doubt. Still, I can't shake the feeling that this material would have been more interesting as an article in the Atlantic Monthly. Or a docu-drama miniseries. A good filmmaker/storyteller does not make the plot (ie. his research) the main character. A good filmmaker cares about emotions and how his characters journey can (thematically) resonate with the audience. There is a reason Coppola didn't have his Godfather characters give long speeches about the Mafia and powerful or bad it is... The guy's first movie was ABANDON. Go figure. So. In the end. This movie is BORING. UNDRAMATIC. EMOTIONALLY COLD. And UNEXCITING. And while that doesn't necessarily warrant an F, cynical showing-off of pseudo knowledge does. Just because something is ridiculously complex doesn't make it good or smart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being from the ME I was disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie and was expecting it to be a lot better; however I was very disappointed in the way it turned out. I am from Dubai, the United Arab Emirates and did not like the fact that it was named as "the Persian Gulf" also, most of the film was shot in the worst areas of the Arab world and the movie viewed the whole middle east as if it were ONE country. When they showed the best part of Dubai which is one of the hotels they named it as "SPAIN"!!! That really annoyed me because its NOT Spain, i mean how could Arabs be ruling Spain? that was dumb. The idea portrayed behind all that politics made sense and in some ways were very true but it does not apply to every single country in the middle east and neither to every single American. The movie was disorganized in my opinion and could have been much better because the idea was very clever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many boring subplots and very confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Synopsis) Bob Barnes (George Clooney) is a career CIA undercover operative who has been assigned a mission in Beirut. Things go wrong and he ends up being kidnapped. After he is released, he returns to the U.S. and is caught up in a secret plot against a Persian Gulf Prince Nasir Al-Subaai (Alexander Siddig). Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an oil stock broker, who has become a friend to the prince, after a tragedy hits home. Bryan advised the prince how he can make his country better with the oil revenues once he becomes Emir. The oil companies don't want Nasir to become Emir, because he wants the U.S. military bases out of his country, and he wants to build the country's infrastructure. Nasir also wants to make peace with others countries in the Persian Gulf and not waste money on unnecessary items such as expensive warplanes. Once they are united, they will control their own destiny by controlling their own oil. Then we have a merger of two U.S. oil companies under review of the Justice Department, and the Pakistani teenager who loses his job at the oil field, and is recruited to be a suicide bomber.(Comment) This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. In the first 30 minutes, you are taken all over the world with no connection to a storyline. This movie follows the path of five uninteresting subplots which are confusing and somewhat connected to the world oil trade. All the main characters are void of any feelings or emotions. The film is not a thriller, as the TV commercials make it seem. The movie was so slow and boring that I almost left the show after 30 minutes. I stayed and looked at my watch 5 times wanting my pain to end. Don't waste your precious time and money on this movie. I really don't understand why Clooney gained 35 pounds for this bad part.

		<fullReview>When a complex plot with enigmatic characters serve to draw the audience in and keep it fully engaged, a political thriller is successful.Unfortunately, Syriana appears to have been made by a filmmaker who had forgotten he was making this film for an audience; that the people in the seats were flesh and blood, breathing humans who had paid for a ticket expecting a story and characters who were also made out of flesh and blood.Instead we get stick figures who have been drawn with only slight changes in facial expressions whom Gaghan woodenly moves around the globe, uttering completely wooden, bloodless (yet overblown) dialogue.If his point was to show there is no soul involved in any aspect of the oil industry, I "get it." But did he have to numb my emotions, insult my intelligence and completely bore me to death for over two hours to illustrate his point? Is this my punishment for being a consumer of oil?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie today, it was awful. I expected more of a plot, more excitement, but the movie was probably was of the most boring movies I have seen in a few years. I actually wanted to fall asleep during some of the scenes, but did not, why&lt; i had popcorn to keep me awake. I saw some other people in the theater who were actually sleeping. I have never seen that before in a movie. This was the worst and most boring movie I have seen in years. Yes, I know about the oil, yes I know about corruption, yes, I know this is the worst movie in the last few years. I can't believe you pay these actors money for doing what they are doing, or the author of this movie. I rate it a 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to see the film with two friends, one who didn't really like it, the other who loved it. I myself thought it was very stupid. It just seemed to be a lot of complaining about America and Oil Companies. I was never one to believe anything I saw in a movie because Movies are just that...Fiction, thoughts, or Ideas a writer has. Yet I believe this was just a terrible way of putting the world in perspective, it goes to show how far Hollywood would go to just get their own points across. There was nothing in this movie that was pure fact...Though I'm very sure there will be a lot of gullible folks out there who would believe this film. Other then the crappy plot line, the acting was alright overall. I guess If your into this type of stuff you should watch it...If your a conservative though then this movie really isn't for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gaghan's good technique betrayed by his bias and faulty research</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Traffic (although I thought the original BBC mini-series was better.) I admire Gaghan's technique and his willingness to interweave different plot lines. I like the work of many of the actors here: Clooney, Cooper, Damon, Siddig, Wright, Peet, etc.That said, this movie is undone by the bias of the writer/director (and producers?) I don't doubt that there is corruption in the oil and natural gas industry. Gaghan doesn't want to tell the audience the truth, aside from the Saudis, the US just doesn't get much oil from the Persian Gulf. That oil and natural gas goes primarily to China and the rest of Asia, and secondarily to Europe. Yes, the US has supported non-democratic regimes (like the Saudis), but the real dirty-dealing has not been done by the US government and the CIA. It's been done by some Europeans and the Persian Gulf countries themselves. Witness the whole Iraq Oil-for-Food scandal, which the French petro-giant Total was involved with up to its eyeballs. Witness the revelation in the new Der Spielgel magazine in Germany that Iran has offered large amounts of oil to North Korea in exchange for help in developing nuclear weapons. Witness that Iran's Shahab 3 ICBM is essentially North Korean technology.That's the very real bad s**t that is taking place, NOT Gaghan's pipe dream. Hell, the South Park guys got closer to the truth in a puppet movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a complete and utter waste of time this movie was! I saw it on opening night here in LA. Believe me, the people in the theater were a lot more excited BEFORE the film than they were AFTER it!! The plot is entirely too predictable and they have about 6 subplots that they HOPE are interesting enough for you to want to follow through to the end of the movie. believe me, after about the first 15 minutes of the film, you won't care about ANY of these subplots! They switch back and forth from each subplot so quickly that it gets confusing after a while. The acting, except for Chris Cooper, is second rate and not very believable. Clooney does a pretty good job, but is void of any real emotion or believability. I would ONLY recommend this movie if you are between the ages of 60 and 80 years old, and have absolutely NOTHING better to do with your time than watch some over-dramatic, dialog-loaded, boring waste of film for about 2 hours. I am a huge Clooney and Chris Cooper fan, but this is not their best work by a long shot. I wouldn't even recommend watching this movie on video, unless you are suffering from insomnia!</fullReview>

It looked like it was filmed in Palm Springs. I think the film had a false feel with an erratic plot and no character development beyond the kids wanting real meat.

		<fullReview>Has the movie industry lost its eye on the bottom line. I was dragged into this movie by a friend who paid for my ticket. I hadn't been inside a theater in years, I get most of my movies via DVD and the Dish. Its bad enough paying # bucks for gas, and eat lousy popcorn that is as big a rip off as 3 buck gas. Then I had to sit there and watch this movie. It was obvious that most of the people watching the movie believed the story line and plot, but if you could find anything original or funny, I'll pay for your next pair of tickets. I 'll stay home and eat my own pop corn. I read where George Clooney put on a lot of extra weight for this role, which had some adverse health affects. I was in a couple of plays when I was in college, (one of my cast mates became a TV and Movie bit player). He used to tell me make up does not make up a good actor. Come to think of it, he always looked the same, but was able to play different parts. When I can stay ahead of the plot because it is so predictable, because it can't stray from an agenda, I get upset that I can get my own tripe published.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to his acting, Clooney is at the top of his form in Syriana. Acting ability Clooney has in spades, it's common sense, humility, and a moral mirror which he is lacking. With this film, an espoused attack on the "oil system" Clooney suffers from a severe case of "do as I say and not as I do." Of the film, which was written and directed by Stephen Gaghan, Clooney has said, "It is not an attack on the Bush administration but it is an attack on the system that has been in place for 60 or 70 years - oil always being at the center of it." This coming from a guy who will fly in an airplane more times in a month than I will in my entire life, and in doing so will be using on the order of 100 times the fossil fuel usage of an average person. Stick to acting, Clooney, you're great at it; Just keep your thoughts on world affairs to your self - unless you're willing to assume a good deal of the blame.</fullReview>
