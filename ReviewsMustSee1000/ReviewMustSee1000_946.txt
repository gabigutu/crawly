		<shortDescription>If you think its bad you're missing the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie when i was about seven, and I enjoy it even more on the same childish level today. This is a movie that doesnt ask you to suspend belief or insult your intelligence, because it is so blatantly make believe right up front. I truly believe that the makers of this movie set out to make an over the top hammy piece of cinema. I dont think anyone can argue that, in that respect, they succeeded. I admit that Sam J. Jones is a terrible actor (even dubbed) but it lends it self nicely to the fact that flash just isnt that bright. And whether intentional or not, the bad acting in this film just helps it pull off the cheesiness to perfection. No movie with lines such as "I love you! But we only have fourteen hours left to save the earth!" could be considered a serious dramatic entity. Frankly I find the approach that this movie takes to be refreshing, especialy when compared with some ridiculously plotted movies, that while good in their own right, insult our inteligence by taking themselves seriously (Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc). My advise to anyone watching this movie is to not expect Gone With the Wind or Casablanca. Just have fun! And dont hold the absurdity and cheesiness of this movie against it, because its intentional, and done beautifuly!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It all works in this case</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people aren't too fond of this version; it failed at the box office and many fans hate the camp, which, for me, works in this case. Unlike the Christopher Reeves SUPERMAN and others, the camp makes fun of the heroes, and not the villains (some of us like to take our villains seriously, and do not like them to made to look silly, thank you very much). The filmmakers were obviously aware of, and aimed to incorporate, everything attached to Flash Gordon---from Raymond's comic strip, to the old Universal serials, to the semi-pornographic parody "Flesh Gordon," to even the post-STAR WARS mythology that audiences in the eighties would expect. Surprisingly, for such a diverse melange, it actually works. Unlike the other space movies of the time, this film emphasized sets and costumes rather than visual effects, and as a result its overall look dates less than many spaceoperas of the late seventies/early eighties. For those who dismiss it--and there are many--be aware that there are also many of us who love it and have re-watched more than you. It's deligtfully rewatchable and nowadays is an indisputable example of what is termed a cult film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1930's Comic Strip Brought Perfectly To Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flash Gordon is one of the most perfectly realized films De Laurentiis made, and it is disappointing that so few have recognized it for what it is; a 1930's comic strip brought perfectly to life. The fact that it is so accurate a realization of America's hopes and fears during the 1930's may help to explain why it has been dismissed so readily as, at best, mere camp, and at worst, a vulgar cinematic catastrophe: Today's audiences are too removed from that decade to catch the references. A classic example of America's view of Asia during the 1930's can be found in Dale Arden's confrontation with Princess Aura just prior to her wedding to Ming. Aura is trying to convince Dale to slip a poison into Ming's "Power Potion" but Dale tells Aura she can't because she's given Ming her word to "try to be a good wife if [Ming] would spare Zarkov and Baron. He vowed he would." Aura, shocked at her naiveté, shouts, "My father has never kept a vow in his life!" To which Dale responds, "I can't help that Aura. Keeping our word is one of the things that make us better than you." Flash Gordon is filled with this type of wonderful 1930's fun, and this fun is only enhanced by the decision to use bad actors in roles that would only benefit from the lack of skill, as well as Oscar-caliber actors in the most demanding roles. Max Von Sydow is an obvious example of the latter, but the hidden gems come in the form of Mariangela Melato, Brian Blessed, and Ornella Muti. Melato does an outstanding job as Klytus's reptilian, but beautiful, second in command when she flawlessly delivers lines like, "Confess, and we won't hurt you anymore.We don't like doing this at all!" And Ornella Muti is simply unbelievable as Ming's gorgeous but deadly daughter. Replying to Flash's query as to whether he can use the telepathy machine to contact Dale with a perfectly candid, "If I showed you how. But I'm not going to." Add to these amazing actors the costumes and sets that are obvious homages to the original comic's drawings and you have a movie that is as surprising as it is delightful. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best bad film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are films out there that can be described as a guilty pleasure - you know they're quite bad, but somewhere deep down in your heart you can't bring yourself to admit it. Flash Gordon is, in my opinion, the guiltiest pleasure of them all. Cardboard characters, lunatic script, embarrassing dialogue, trashy performances (apart from Max Von Sydow), and hilarious special effects... yet the one thing that comes out in the film's favour is that, despite its seemingly countless faults, it is still irresistibly entertaining.American football legend Flash Gordon (Sam J. Jones) and sexy babe Dale Arden (Melody Anderson) are aboard a private flight when a weird red-storm forces them to perform an emergency landing. They crash into the back garden of wacky ex-NASA scientist Hans Zarkov (Topol), an eccentric madman who believes the world is under attack from alien forces and who has built his own spaceship to do battle with the enemy. Astonishingly, it turns out that Zarkov was right - and pretty soon, Flash, Dale and Zarkov find themselves on the planet Mongo, battling against its tyrannical emperor Ming the Merciless (Max Von Sydow), with a little help from Ming's treacherous daughter (Ornella Muti), her lover Barin (Timothy Dalton), and the winged warrior Vultan (Brian Blessed).Flash Gordon is an absolutely insane film. The set design is remarkable, as is the costume design, and a pounding rock soundtrack is provided by the group Queen. Performance-wise, everyone seems to be camping it up like an end-of-term pantomime, though Von Sydow somehow seems to give his villain a deliciously sinister edge. Some of the dialogue is so awful that it becomes eminently quotable by virtue of its badness (a few samples: "This Ming is a psycho!"; "That must be some planet you come from!"; and - my favourite - "Freeze! You bloody bastards!") Flash Gordon should be a total disaster - an awful shambles of a film with no redeeming qualities. It isn't. Perhaps we'll never know how or why it works, but it does. So let the dissection of Flash Gordon the movie end here - analyze it no more, just enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knowingly Camp version of matinée sci-fi classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the middle section of this movie, our hero 'Flash' Gordon, accompanied by Ornella "Most beautiful woman in the world" Muti, witnesses ex Bond Timothy Dalton giving ex Blue Peter presenter Peter Duncan the sweet merciful release of death by putting him to the(cardboard) sword (offscreen). "Its an initiation" purrs the shapely Muti, "I just love initiations".This 1980 version of the perennial Saturday morning sci-fi cliffhanger is a feast for the senses. That is, if your senses crave lashings of junkfood. With an eye meltingly lurid palette of colours and rocktastic Queen soundtrack Flash Gordon was the perfectly overblown movie for the start of an overblown decade. The costumes are extravagantly cheesy, the effects farcical, the acting hilarious. Almost every minor character was hammed up to perfection by the cream (or perhaps custard) of character actors of the time including such luminaries as Rocky Horrors Richard O Brien, Phillip "I corrected them" Stone from the Shining and the half-man, half-beast that is Brian Blessed. The only minor flaw in this popcorn delight is the fact that it is, in almost every way - a terrible, awful movie - I HIGHLY recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cardboard, disposable and tremendous fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a plane crash in extreme weather, Flash Gordon and his travelling companion Dale Arden after abducted by Dr Zarkov to help pilot his spaceship to confront what he believes is an attack from space. Once in space Flash comes faces to face with the cause of the extreme weather, Ming the Merciless and is sentenced to death. Saved from death by Ming's lustful daughter Flash sets out to save his friends and stop Ming with the help of the leaders of the kingdoms.Even when this was brand new I suspect it looked out dated and a throwback kind of appeal. More than 20 years later this definitely is appreciated as a laugh by about as many people who genuinely enjoy it on it's own merits. The plot is well known to most people I suspect ? I know it from the 25 minute b/w `classic' series that BBC2 repeated in the mornings when I was only a lad in the 80's. But it is easily nutshelled as above. The story moves alone at a good pace despite the poor effects and is actually pretty exciting.The effects are poor ? even for 1980's the back projection is rubbish and the costumes are silly. Compare it to the advances made in Star Wars and stuff years before and it looks weak. However the vision is ambitious and it works well if you accept the weaknesses from the start. Another weakness is the acting from ranges from wooden to just plain hammy. Jones is perfect as Flash, despite being wooden as a tree. He comes over like a 30's matinee idol type, which is just what the fun mood of the film needed. Anderson is awful but again just accept the weaknesses. Von Sydow is good as Ming and Topol is a little unhinged as Zarkov. Blessed hams it up so much you could slice him and serve him with pineapple but he also suits the film well. Dalton, O'Brien, Blue Peter's Peter Duncan and Robbie Coltrane and several other unexpected Brits turn up which is nice.If you're not sure if this film is for you then watch the first 20 minutes. By that time you'll have seen two key things that sum up the film. Firstly you'll have sat through the extremely cool theme song from Queen. That gets me in the mood every time I hear it! Secondly you'll see a fight with Ming the Merciless' men where Flash takes them on in a form of American Football fighting! Both this scene and the music are a little silly and quite camp but if you like these then the rest of the film will suit you fine.Personally I love this movie and watch it every repeat I see. It is silly and has plenty of weakness, but more than all these things it is incredibly fun to watch! Sing it with me now ? `FLASH! AH-AH! HE'LL SAVE EVERYONE OF US!'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie of All-Time!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dino DeLaurentiis' Flash Gordon is one of those rare movies that captures the imagination of the viewer, and doesn't let go until the final moments. It truly has everything you could ever want in a movie: compelling plot (the QB of the New York Jets has approximately 24 hours to save the Earth from total annihilation), violence, gore, great acting (Timothy Dalton, Brian Blessed, Max Von Sydow), action (the "Football Fight" in Ming's palace), drama, sexual situations (Princess Aura seducing Flash in her rocket, Dale Arden in Ming's bedroom), and babes (Ornella Muti as Princess Aura, and Melody Anderson as Dale Arden.) What more can you ask for in a movie? Nothing, I tell you, NOTHING!!! Actually, having read other comments elsewhere, I am extremely disappointed in the almost universal panning of the 2 leads, Sam J. Jones and Melody Anderson. These two fine actors put forth a masterful performance, and made you really believe the situations their characters found themselves in. I can't speak highly enough of their abilities, as they were never as good in anything else than they were here. Flash Gordon is the greatest movie of all-time- it has to be the greatest ever, because I wouldn't watch a movie over 300 timess if it wasn't. You think I'm kidding, but I'm deadly serious. The first time I saw it in the theater- 18 years ago- I was hooked for life. Please, whatever you do, watch this movie over and over- you'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that the popular consensus has tagged this movie as campy and cheesy, but in the case of Flash Gordon, I don't think that's a bad thing at all. I was like 5 years old when I first saw this movie, so for me, it's not only a great film, it also brings me back to some of the happiest moments of my childhood when my imagination was limitless. Just listening to the soundtrack is enough to bring me back to my own personal "good ol' days," so I'll always have a soft spot for this movie in my heart. However, even viewing it as an adult, I have to say that I don't see quite as much cheese as the harsh critics see in the movie. I mean, yeah, there's that "cringe in your seat" moment when Melody Anderson side shuffles, claps her hands and cheers "Go, Flash, Go!" and her equally embarrassing, "Oh, Flash" when he saves Prince Baron from falling into the abyss, but beyond that, I think it's an awesome movie. I thought that all of the actors were very good in their respective roles, particularly Ming the Merciless, played by Max Von Sydow. He's very convincing in this role and not even remotely campy (IMHO). Klytus is also great. You gotta love his nonchalantly smooth manner of speaking. However, if I were to point out one thing that I believe made Flash Gordon the cult classic that it is today, it would HAVE to be the soundtrack. Right from the first scene when Ming starts pressing buttons that wreak havoc on the Earth, you hear the beat. Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun, then they hit you with that campy-as-hell "Flash! A-haaaaa!" before they break into song. The wedding march was exceptionally evil and just all of the music in between made the movie so memorable. Plus, the music helped freeze the movie permanently in 1980, which I love. If you've never seen this movie, DEFINITELY rent it and check it out. It's just a great flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Star Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not even joking. It's quite possibly one of the worst films ever made, but that is what makes it so marvellous. Loud, cheesy, poorly acted and about as subtle as a pitchfork rammed up the bum. Based on the long- running strips originally written by Alex Raymond, it tells the story of all- American goodie Flash Gordon and his teleportation onto the planet Mongo, lorded over by the eviler- than- evil Ming the Merciless, who has eyes on Flash's lady friend, Dale Arden. If you are a fan of comic books, the sci-fi genre, Queen, or, like me, all three, then this is, simply put perfect entertainment. They should make more films like this- cheesy, camp and stupid. by the way, if you hate this because you think it is too stupid, you REALLY don't understand it!!LONG LIVE FLASH!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hotpants in Hotspace - The turbo-powered love rocket story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A blonde, whip-wielding man in red PVC hotpants. A sultry brunette temptresses in a (red PVC) catsuit. A dastardly skullcapped villain with a penchant for S'n'M. A horny, malevolent robot-man called Klytus (a cross between coitus and clitoris?) with a penchant for young ladies. A phallic war rocket Ajax looking like a model 747 decked out with spikes and fins. No: this isn't a 1990s porn extravaganza; this is Flash Gordon ? the early 80s camp comic classic.What a film! Sorry, I mean what a film? It's impossible to convey the qualities of this film in a short review. Indeed, I'm not entirely sure I understand on what level (or planet) this film works. Mainly I think it works because everyone is having such fun, from the gloriously camp Max Von Sydow (my all time hero) to Queen (who seem not so much responsible for the soundtrack as the spiritual progenitors for the film itself).I should mention that I have fond memories of this film from childhood. I remember sneaking downstairs to watch it late at night aged about 8. From that moment, my childhood fantasies usually came (so to speak) in the form of Princess Aura (Ornella Muti and the now famous red catsuit). I should also point out that the film has very few other obvious things (apart from exuberance) going for it. It is possibly one of the daftest films ever made, only slightly redeemed by the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously ? note the Houdini reference and the casting of Blue Peter presenter Peter Duncan as proof of this, not that you'll need any proof after five minutes of watching it. Indeed, the only ones who don't seem to be enjoying themselves are the humourless Timothy Dalton and the limp-wristed, wet as a haddock Melody Anderson proving once and for all that rampant Euro totty spank the ass (so to speak) of all American girls.Anyway, I digress. Flash Gordon is essentially a pantomime with an all-star cast (for Max Von Sydow as Ming the Merciless, think Sir Ian McKellem as Widow Twanky). Viewed objectively it's a moderately, if not abjectly awful film. If you just unhook your critical consciousness for 90 minutes you are sure to be rewarded by a high camp, high-energy slice of high grade Camembert. And Mistress Muti ? she's still a kind of magic! 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power of a story over a budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1980, science fiction was undergoing a revival of sorts. Some would argue that it is unfortunate that the science fiction appearing on the big screens of the time were more action-oriented than dramatic in nature. Flash Gordon came at a time when audiences were being trained to expect more and more from their films, with budgets skyrocketing and effects becoming progressively more important than the story. It is therefore somewhat disheartening to see reviewers focusing on how camp or low-fi they perceive it to be. Camp, low-budget, low-fi it is, but it has something that Episode 2 of Star Wars in particular didn't. Namely, it has the ingredients of a rollicking good time. From the awesome soundtrack by Queen to the near-ridiculous action sequences, Flash Gordon is almost the last hurrah in an era where filmmakers were expected to spend at least as much time on script and dialogue as they do eye candy. What makes it all the more interesting is that beyond the basic setup, there almost is no story to speak of.Beginning with a POV shot from some distant planet, we see how the world we take for granted is suddenly subjected to all sorts of destructive weather patterns by its Emperor. Emperor Ming has decided to shift the orbit of the moon in order to make it collide with Earth, leaving a handful of days before all life on the planet is destroyed. Not one to take this kind of thing lying down, a scientist by the name of Hans Zarkov is busily building a rocket so that he might go to the source of the attacks and reason with them. Coincidentally, a plane carrying football star Flash Gordon and some girl called Dale Arden crash into Zarkov's lab. Tricking them into boarding his rocket, Zarkov takes them on a brief trip to a world so barren one wonders where they find the liquid to sustain themselves. Taken captive and escorted to the Emperor, our heroes bear witness to a society in which Lords of several moons pay tribute to said Emperor. With their lives, if need be. The real fun begins when Ming takes an interest in Dale.Interest is putting it mildly. In a classic script oversight, Ming decides within a moment of first seeing her that he wants Dale to do with as he will. Flash is naturally not one to take such things lying down, so he begins attacking Ming's guards with a series of offensive football-style strikes. This gets the attention of several Lords who have been awaiting the right moment to overthrow Ming, but the fight is lost before it has begun, for obvious reasons. Overpowered, Flash is sentenced to execution, and thus the first of many bondage-like outfits is seen. I am not one to cry out "gay" when I see two men express a powerful bond, but several people I have watched the film with now agree that Flash Gordon has one of the biggest gay, or S&amp;M, themes going in 1980s film. Not that this is particularly important, but the amount of leather underwear and tights on display would have made the Village People blush. Of course, this is all just one adult subtext that will go right over the head of the children in the audience.One commendable feature of Flash Gordon is the death scenes. Aiming a film at children and dispatching characters in a violent fashion is always a tricky business. This adaptation gets around the issue by showing the alien creatures melting after they are killed. The manner in which this is filmed would probably get Flash Gordon a more restrictive rating if it were released for the first time today. It reminds me in part of a description in Repo Man. Eyes, skin, even bones melt in a manner that tells us how alien the villains are in a way that all the prosthetics in the world cannot. Roger Ebert was right on the money when he wrote that Flash Gordon "is cheerfully willing to look as phony as it is". That he didn't mean it as a criticism shows that he got what the film was about. During action sequences, it assaults the senses and almost bullies the viewer into forgetting that what they are seeing is anything but real. During extended moments of dialogue, it flat out orders you to not take it seriously.Making it all the funnier is that producer Dino De Laurentiis, that famed bankrupt-wannabe, thought the whole story was serious. As director Mike Hodges phrased it, anyone who watches the film will find that factoid "rather curious". Sam Jones is absolutely terrible as the titular hero, and yet it works because a certain idiocy is what the character requires. Really, the whole thing reeks of being rushed into production, and then rushed to theatre screens, which probably sealed its financial doom. Hodges apparently had to work with a crew whose language he did not speak, with a script that wasn't finished, and no storyboards to boot. Having seen the finished product on DVD after all these years, I have to confess that my respect for Hodges has gone right through the roof in light of this. Forget Flash - Hodges is the one who can rightfully claim to be king of the impossible. Anyway, when all is said and done, Flash Gordon is representative of the direction cinema might well have been better off taking.For these reasons and more, I gave Flash Gordon circa 1980 a seven out of ten. Excitement and adventure always beat a big budget, as this film proves.</fullReview>

Fun entertainment that doesn't take itself too seriously and with a soundtrack that will grab you by the throat and force you to have a good time.The fact that the special effects are a bit wobbly, the reconciliation between Flash and Barin is hilarious and the whole macho test of man-hood by Peter Duncan looks like a scene from Robin Hood meets Pricilla Queen of the Desert, are not weaknesses but just add to this film.Blake's 7 would not have been what it is if the sets hadn't of moved and Flash Gordon would never have worked without seventy miles of red and gold satin and lycra.Go Flash!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Music Is As Bad As The Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:You are kidding me. What movie are you people watching? The one with the two worst lead actors in the whole year of 1980? Jones and Anderson, yes I thought it was Hepburn and Tracy. There are some good actors in the cast but the director gets terrible readings out of them. Blessed, Dalton and Topol showed later they were great actors you would never know it here. The worst special effects you will ever see. The kingdoms look like they were made by a four year old. The only and I mean the only reason to watch this piece of crap is Max Von Sydow as Ming; as he showed in Needful Things the man could not give a bad performance. Jones doesn't just tackle Ming's soldiers but every scene's credibility with his terrible acting. He disappeared for a reason, people. He never was lead actor again; this was not a coincidence. The dorky humor that falls flat; do not tell me it is satire. No, Buckaroo Banzai, that was satire this is a crappy film based on a bad serial from the 20s that was actually better than this movie. Buster Crabbe was Marlon Brando next to Jones. One bad joke after another,"tell me more about this man Houdini." You laughed at that?Did you like the matte backgrounds that looked like someone's pastel lesson in third grade art class? How about the Hawkman with the wires plainly in the frame? Yes, that attack on the giant red suppository: how realistic? Look, satire requires intelligence behind it, this movie has none. I grew up in the 80s, Queen has always sucked. This is not the first movie they wiped out. Check out Highlander; they loved, teeth rattling, screeching guitars to conceal how badly they sang. It is the same here; the attack at the end comes with one or two notes played at glass shattering volume. Yes, Flash: He sucks Badly!! King of the Retarded!! Ohhh! They stink, OK, they had three or four hit songs the rest all sucked badly. The realism of three or four hawk-man landing on the ship with thirty ming zombies firing at them; this makes Sly and Arnie look like Alien. It is quite a symmetrical film; perfect balance, the music stinks as badly as the cheese-ball, ham bone crap that comic book movie aficionados think is satire. No, it is just a lousy, poorly acted piece of crap, sorry. It stunk it up so badly that it was taken away from the theaters in about three weeks. See, back then people read these things called books. They came with small print and no big pictures featuring people wearing capes. I have no doubt if it were released today it would make hundreds of millions; it finally found its audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Camp but so good looking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the sci fi films which didn't take themselves way too seriously in the eighties, this is probably the best. Okay, it doesn't have the quasi-religious undertones of Star Wars nor the 'we want to be taken seriously' tone of Lord of the Rings or the cgi'd to hell and back look of nearly every sci-fi film since the 1990s, but it does have one thing: Sam Jones in tight black leather briefs. And that is the whole point of the film. You don't take it seriously.There is also the plot. Quite simple. Ming the Merciless of the Planet Mongo wants to invade/destroy earth. And Flash, Dale Arden and Doctor Zarkov are the only ones who can stop him. However, they must first negotiate the mad, high camp of Ming's court with its highly coloured and very extravagant costumes, the ridiculous dialogue, moments of rather adult (although I didn't know it at the time) humour and, of course, Max Von Syndow as Ming. Who looks perfect.Yes, the special effects are interesting and superseded by better stuff, but the high gloss look of the whole thing somehow makes you think it doesn't matter. And the rest of the cast play along admirably, even Tim Dalton, delicious as Prince Barin and the wonderfully, over the top, Brian Blessed playing Vultan.Its good fun, very silly and makes you feel good. What more is there. This film is why you went to the cinema in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Worst Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Godfather" is one of the undisputed greatest films of all time. The acting, the script, the direction, the way Clemenza drops those sausages in the sauce, the climatic baptism/blood bath -- everything about it is brilliant. Undisputed. Now, imagine everything in a film is made to be bad -- sets, costumes, acting, lines ... Campy, 6-year-old imagination bad. That's "Flash Gordon" ... the greatest bad movie of all time. It's as brilliant, and as a religious a cinematic experience as watching "Godfather." I just saw this gem again last week on DVD, and Lord, it's spectacular. Sam Jones is as bad an actor as Al Pacino is good. But, he's brilliant here, because Flash is supposed to be a clueless hero -- a football star tossed into a sci-fi intergalactic war that he can barely comprehend. He has his name written on his shirt for crying out loud. "FLASH" in big red letters against a white T-shirt. As if he'd forget his name if he didn't look down to his chest. And darn if Sam Jones doesn't look like he hasn't a clue what the heck is going on. Max Von Sydow is the evil Ming the Merciless. Dig the name. Dig his outfit. Dig that performance, he's an evil Christ with the mind of a 12-year-old who just discovered girls and morality. Add in Topol "If I Were a Rich Man" and Grade-Z Margot Kidder clone Melody Anderson as the girlfriend-babe Dale Arden, and ... oh, it's brilliant. Queen provides the over the top music score, singing of Flash as a Christ-like Savior of the Universe. Fred Mercury was a god, wasn't he? The film works on several levels. It's what every child imagines a comic book to look like if it were brought to life. Adults can have fun, too. It's a damn fine satire of law and marriage and live for adults, and religion and Communism and ..oh, just have fun. Some folks here say turn your brain off and enjoy. No! Turn your brain on and enjoy! Flash Gordon is a dream for heterosexuals, homosexuals .. the sexual references are endless. (The seduction-telepathic "phone call" scene is funnier and more out-there than anything I've sever seen. Tim Dalton's character protests against Flash ... a bit too much, maybe) Ming is impaled on a phallic-like rocket tip. The mythology is deep -- Robin Hood, Greek gods, etc, etc. It's trash, wonderful goofy, trash and I love every frame. For every kid who collected comic books, it's heaven. For every adult who wished he still collected comic books, it's heaven. Go ahead, watch the "Godfather." I love it, it's brilliant. But it ain't fun. This is fun. This is Saturday-afternoon cinema at it's best, and it has the gumption to proudly be what "Star Wars" couldn't help but become ... junk. Wonderful, beautiful, enjoyable junk. I love this film. There hasn't been a finer comic book movie then or since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Rubbish Best Remembered For Its Theme Song</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Mike Hodges directed the ultra bleak Brit classic GET CARTER so he seems a very strange choice to direct a big budget fantasy movie , and long before the final credits you do realise that he's almost a bad choice as director , I mean look at the two leads playing Flash and Dale . Is it any surprise that they didn't star in anymore movies that anyone has heard of ? I should also point out that Brian Blessed reverts to his typecast role of being a large shouting man with a beard while Prince Barin is a Welshman who challenges a BLUE PETER presenter to find a muddy balloon in a tree trunk and shouts dialogue like " FREEZE YOU BLUDDY BESTUDS " in a ridiculous manner That's why I said Hodges " is almost a bad choice as director " and not Hodges " is a bad choice as director " because his unfamiliarity of the subject matter works in the audiences favour though perhaps not the director's . Just how much less enjoyable would this movie have been if it wasn't for the loud acting , the garish colour contrasts , the not very convincing special effects ? Agreed it's total rubbish but it's also totally entertaining rubbish enhanced by its very intrusive score by Queen . Dum dum dum dum dum Flash aargh saviour of the universe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1980 version of a 1940 serial and a wonderful guilty pleasure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This a definitely one of my guilty pleasure movies. You know, the movies you secretly love to watch but would be too embarrassed to tell your friends about. People think this is a dumb movie and it really is. But it is not trying to be Schindler's List here. DeLaurentis was unabashedly paying homage to the Flash Gordon of the 40's and he succeeded wonderfully. The costumes, the spaceships, the characters are all strictly in keeping with the golden age of Sci-Fi. So sit back, check your mind at the door, and look back on what kids must have felt watching the original Flash Gordon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>20 years don't make a difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some childhood obsessions stay with you for life, and Flash would have to be one of them. In fact, Flash Gordon, Star Wars, and Battlestar Galactica began a lifelong obsession with science fiction and fantasy in all of its good (and especially) bad forms. The above summary isn't really accurate; 20 years don't make a difference to how much I like this film, but they have changed my reasons for liking it. With hindsight, I've discovered exactly who Lorenzo Semple Jr. is, and now, fully understanding the camp elements of this film, I can still enjoy it, but on a completely new level. As for complaints about the acting of Sam Jones (who did much worse in the abysmal firefighter series Code Red) and Melody Anderson, you hire actors for what they can do, not what they can't. This is why Keanu Reeves was perfect for The Matrix, and why Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfect for The Terminator. Jones and Anderson serve the same purpose for Semple as Adam West and Burt Ward did in the Batman series; who better than someone sadly lacking in acting skills to deliver a completely ludicrous line with a straight face? Unless your name is Charlton Heston, experienced actors have a difficult time with it. Anyways, I digress. The things that first attracted me to this film still do it for me, and that would be the production values and special effects, not to mention the great soundtrack by Queen (I actually had a friend consider using Brian May's arrangement of the Wedding March at his wedding; his mother, of course, ixnayed it). This is still a great looking movie, even by today's standards, which makes me wonder if DeLaurentiis was in on the joke the whole time. All in all, a lot of fun, unless you get offended by less than faithful revisions, in which case I have to wonder about your upbringing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can I say! It is the perfect comic book sci-fie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching those Saturday serials at the movies when I was a very young kid, I was thrilled that the hokeyness and campy style that was evinced by action star Buster Crabbe, was so excellently caught in the psychedelic big budget version of Flash Gordon. To begin with is a dynamite cast with Sam Jones (a non actor but what a hunk) as Flash Gordon, football player turned into galactic hero. Melody Anderson was an acceptable Dale Arden, while Chiam Topol was the perfect Dr. Hans Zarkov. And the always incompatibly Max Von Sydow, seems to have had a ball as the deliciously evil Ming. Timothy Dalton (a future James Bond) was good also, but Brian Blessed as King of the Hawkmen was in rare form. Finally there was Peter Wyngarde who's character oozes the essence of evil with a touch of ennui. To top it all off is the sound score by the rock group Queen, with the plaintive vocals by Freddie Mercury. What here is not to like. Unless, of course, you have had your sense of humor surgically removed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider myself fortunate to have attended the world premiere of 'Flash Gordon' in 1980. Contrary to popular belief, it took place not in New York, but a pub in Maesteg, South Wales. The landlord had acquired a pirate video of this much-publicised new film, several weeks before it went on release. The picture and sound quality were okay, but it did not matter as the din from pool players and space invaders machines was so great one could barely hear the dialogue. I watched for the action alone. I could tell roughly what was going on. The Earth is being threatened by Emperor Ming The Merciless ( Max Von Sydow ) of the planet Mongo, who is bombarding it with freak weather conditions prior to destroying it completely. Professional footballer Flash Gordon ( Sam J.Jones ) and reporter Dale Arden ( Melody Anderson ) are travelling by plane when it crashes into the home of eccentric scientist Dr.Zarkov ( Topol ), who has identified Mongo as the source of the attacks, and using a home-made rocket flies out there to put a stop to them. Ming tries to have Flash executed ( he fancies Dale ), but our hero is saved by the luscious Princess Aura ( Ornella Muti ) and taken to the kingdom of Prince Barin ( Timothy Dalton ). Flash persuades both Barin and Vultan, the King of the Hawkmen ( who else but Brian Blessed? ) to join forces to defeat Ming.The script was by Lorenzo Semple Jr., best known for the 'Batman' television series. Much to the disappointment of Alex Raymond fans everywhere, he brought the same campy mindset over to 'Flash'. Everyone in the movie either overacts ( Von Sydow, Topol, Peter Wyngarde, Blessed ) or underacts ( Jones ). Timothy Dalton, however, plays 'Barin' completely straight, and steals the movie. Ornella Muti sets the screen alight as 'Princess Aura'. The original director was to have been Nicolas Roeg, but he left after 'creative differences' with producer Dino DeLaurentiis. His replacement, Mike Hodges ( of 'Get Carter' fame ) does a good job. A major influence - apart from 'Star Wars' - seems to have been Dino's previous space opera - 'Barbarella' ( 1968 ). The gaudy sets, absurd costumes, deliberately cheesy dialogue, and the lurid swirling colours ( when Zarkov's rocket takes off it looks to have flown into an artist's L.S.D. trip instead of outer space ) are all reminiscent of that Jane Fonda picture. Rock band Queen provided the soundtrack.American audiences gave the picture the big thumbs down, but in Britain it was far more successful, taking more money than 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark'. I think the British enjoyed it for what it was - an unpretentious, splendid sci-fi romp. A pity there were no sequels.George Lucas openly admitted he wanted to make a 'Flash Gordon' movie instead of 'Star Wars', but could not get the rights. Elements from the Gordon strips appear in Lucas' creation though, most notably the floating city in 'The Empire Strikes Back' ( 1980 ). Recently the Syfy channel in America revived 'Gordon' ( with Sam J.Jones making a cameo appearance in one episode ) for television, but it too was not successful. The 'dark, edgy ' approach to superheroes has been overused in recent years. Perhaps the time is right to bring back camp. A new 'Flash' movie, done in the spirit of the 1980 version but with modern special effects, would be worth going to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flash Gordon starts in outer space as Emperor Ming the merciless ruler of the universe (Max von Sydow) decides it would be a huge source of amusement to himself to slowly destroy Earth. With his array of sophisticated technology he causes Earthquakes, typhoons, hot hail &amp; sends the moon out of it's orbit &amp; speeding towards Earth. The plane New York Jets quarterback Flash Gordon (Sam J. Jones) &amp; estate agent Dale Arden (Melody Anderson) are flying in crash lands in the laboratory of ex Nasa space scientist Dr. Hans Zarkow (Topol) who, at gunpoint, forces Flash &amp; Dale into a homemade spaceship which he intends to use to fly to a planet called Mongo &amp; save Earth. Dr. Zarkow explains that he has, for years, anticipated an alien attack on Earth &amp; has been preparing for just such an occasion. Once on Mongo they are taken prisoner by Ming &amp; Klytus (Peter Wyngarde) head of the secret police &amp; sentenced to death by public execution. Helped by Ming's daughter Princess Aura (Ornella Muti) Flash decides he must find a way to escape, defeat Ming &amp; save Earth before it's too late!This English production was directed by Mike Hodges &amp; is very camp, silly &amp; hard not to laugh at but at the same time provides buckets of entertainment. The script by Lorenzo Semple Jr., based on the comic strip by Alex Raymond, is hilariously bad. Some of the dialogue in this thing is priceless, it really is. The character's have all the subtly &amp; depth of a pantomime, they are about as clichéd as you can get as well, the evil Emporer, the hero who brings everyone together &amp; saves the day, the attractive dim female who falls for the hero, the evil character who turns good in the end, the Prince, the rebellion &amp; a whole other host of sci-fi clichés. The story itself is just ridiculous, those wedding vows at the end are funny while despite being ruler of the entire Universe Ming &amp; the people of Mongo decide to pinch our 'here comes the bride' wedding march music &amp; it's convenient that everyone helpfully speaks English. The ending is made me cringe as lifelong enemies suddenly become best buddies &amp; the Hawkmen spell out the words 'Thanks' &amp; 'Flash' in the sky! Everything about Flash Gordon is just so campy, embarrassing to watch &amp; badly thought out but I still had great times with it. The best way to describe Flash Gordon is as entertaining crap.Hodges was apparently the eighth director chosen, which wouldn't exactly fill me with confidence in that there were seven director's ahead of me on a list all of whom declined. The film is an amazing visual spectacle throughout, the garish art-deco inspired production design, costumes &amp; props by the Italian Danilo Donati are the real star of Flash Gordon. The extravagant sets &amp; production design to the multi coloured costumes &amp; I don't know why but I kept thinking that Ming's rocket-ships looked like a penis with wings! There is little in the way of actual excitement, the action &amp; fight scenes are a bit uninspired.With a budget of about $35,000,000 Flash Gordon was a well funded film so it comes as a surprise that the special effects are so rotten, the blue screen stuff &amp; the flying Hawkmen in particular look awful, they hardly flap their wings &amp; some not at all. I mean do you know how much they would have to flap them to even get off the ground?! Personally I hated the music by Queen &amp; especially the Flash Gordon song but someone out there may like it. The campy Brian Blessed as Vultan is an absolute hoot to watch, Timothy Dalton as Barin seems to be taking things too seriously, Jones is awful as Gordon, Sydow as Ming overacts with the best of them while a special mention goes to Mariangela Melato as the evil General Kala whom I though was a bit of a babe until she melted into a puddle of goo.Flash Gordon is not a film I can recommend if your looking for some exciting, serious sci-fi action. Flash Gordon is a film I can recommend if your looking for campy, big budget fun with some of the funniest dialogue in a sci-fi film ever. Mind numbingly bad but at the same time wonderfully entertaining, you decide which one is more important.</fullReview>

Brian Blessed was made famous by this film. And Timothy Dalton was recognised as the future bond. Not sure what happened to Flash though seems to have been a one Hit wonder for him. Maybe he quit after this film Knowing he would never get a better role than Flash. The Savior of Earth.. Hes a miracle..

		<fullReview>Comic book movies these days are so typically dark that it's difficult to remember the initial appeal. The happiest they get is the drunken whimsy of the Iron Man movies but they still come with a bit of weight. Flash Gordon is light as a feather. I'm sure it's not intended to be taken seriously in any capacity but it's probably a more accurate translation of old comic book to screen. It sure is campy though. I can forgive the obvious sets and cheaper production design as part of its charm, but it does feel like a cheap experience. Perhaps we're just spoiled these days. I was impressed by how big the world is in Flash Gordon but it's too bloated and the film ends up dragging in many places, especially where it feels like it doesn't know if it's tongue in cheek or not. I went to a screening with Brian Blessed giving a Q&amp;A and he's absolutely in love with this film. He has a great point that the lead actor can definitely play 'pure' and innocent from every angle. It's still odd to me that Flash Gordon is simply an American football player and nothing more. I thought he had super powers. Something to study in the representation of American sports in cinema. Of course, the most iconic part of the film is Queen's memorable soundtrack and that stands but it is a weird yet typical film in many ways.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you try to be honest, "Flash Gordon" is not a perfectly made SciFi film, and its story is not exactly unique. But with the idea being a lot older than the movie, I excuse this defect. In fact, I felt quite affected by the show. First, Queen's musical score is outstanding. They had the stuff to boost up films (see also Highlander). Second, the Jules Verne like technical equipment and the costumes are beautiful (except for the wings of the Hawkmen). Both also reflect the director's love for detail. If only the special effects had been slightly better, it would have been a clear candidate for my top ten movies. Still, the movie is a good adaptation of a visionary comic series (unlike Doc Savage), and I did miss the sequel which was indicated by the interrogation mark at the end. However, there are audio tapes with a direct continuation, and I recommend them to anybody who wants to know how the story concluded. Overall, I give 7/10 for the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welcome to the awesome yet campy world of Flash Gordon, a big-time quarterback who beats up aliens and gets the girl. Sounds like a film Howie Long would probably take up! Anyway, "Flash Gordon" is played by the equally-buffed Sam Jones, who was an unknown before this flick was shown. He totally eats up his role in a fancy way. Melody Anderson plays Flash's love interest, while Max Von Sydow has a field day as the evil Mongo, who looks like something out of an episode of the "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers!". This Sci-fi movie has all the trimmings of a typical galactic space adventure: laser guns, flying saucers, aliens (How Spielbergian!). And I'm very surprised to say that I liked this film. Even though his other films aren't that great, Sam Jones is exceptional in this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A football player is tricked to travel the planet Mongo and finds himself forging friendships while fighting a tyrant, Ming the Merciless, to save Earth.Lacking the production values and execution of the comparable Star Wars, Flash Gordon retains its comic-strip and Saturday morning matinée serial feel, possibly thanks to a troubled production and&nbsp;Lorenzo Semple Jr. screenplay.Peter Wyngarde plays masked villain&nbsp;Klytus&nbsp;elegantly creepy (possibly and inspiration for He-Man's Skeletor) and with&nbsp;Mariangela Melato&nbsp;Kala's (oddly He-Man borrows another character this time&nbsp;Evil-Lynn) leads the assault while The Emperor Ming played subtly by&nbsp; Max von Sydow&nbsp;takes a back seat. It's this distance between the protagonist and antagonist that hampers the film but on the other hand it's works to its credit allowing an array of colourful characters to line the screen including Brian Blessed as Prince Vultan who's delivers a barrage of classic lines while Timothy Dalton to graces the screen as dashing Errol Flynn alike Prince Barin.Flash's love interest Dale Arden is played by&nbsp;Melody Anderson&nbsp;Dale&nbsp;is the perfect 1950's style every day New Yorker. Flash lacks Charisma, history may have been different should Kurt Russell had committed. &nbsp;Either way&nbsp;Sam J. Jones&nbsp;Flash Gordon does the job. There's tones of familiar faces including UK's&nbsp;Richard O'Brien,&nbsp;Robbie Coltrane and Blue Peter's Peter Duncan. Sultry Ornella Muti is perfect as Ming's daughter&nbsp;Princess Aura nevertheless there's no doubt Topol steals every scene as unhinged science 'genius'&nbsp; Dr. Hans Zarkov.While characters arcs change pacer than Queen's memorable pumping and notable soundtrack amongst themes of forging friendships, suicide, death, sacrifice and resurrection to name a few there's spaceships, poisonous creatures, red-clad guards and enough sequins to start a cabaret show all the things you'd expect from a science fiction.&nbsp; Beneath the bright and lustre costumes there's a dark and rebel subtext.&nbsp;Director&nbsp;Mike Hodges gives us many stand out scenes including a battle to the death on a remote control tilting platform with retractable spikes, an American football inspired fight, a space shuttle assault, gooey spider-monster and girls cat fight. There's also some nice touches during Zarkov&nbsp;and prince escape that stay in the mind.&nbsp; The effects are a mixed bag with projection and composites heavy utilised, again it gives it's that hammy serial feel but hampers Flash's longevity as a rounded work of art. Even so it packs in so many memorable characters, lines and moments that it retains a must seem charm.Flash Gordon is flawed as much as the actor title role, it never fully explores the characters, yet, it's well defined and still is a lot of fun. Gordon's alive!&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American football star Flash Gordon (Sam Jones), scientist Hans Zarkov (Topol), and pretty estate agent Dale Arden (Melody Anderson) are blasted to the farthest reaches of space to fight Ming the Merciless (Max Von Sydow), the tyrannical ruler of Mongo, who has been subjecting The Earth to a series of violent attacks in the form of freak weather conditions and terrible catastrophes.Featuring blond pretty boy Sam Jones in the title role, some of the most garish costumes in the history of cinema, cheesy dialogue galore, a catchy pop/rock soundtrack by Queen, poorly constructed props (and a few rather suggestive looking ones), marvellously hammy performances from a fine collection of cult character actors (including Department S's Richard Wyngarde, Rocky Horror's Richard O'Brien and good old Brian Blessed), and spectacularly ropey special effects (all wires clearly visible), Flash Gordon is quite possibly the most gleefully daft, over-the-top, knowingly tacky, and outrageously flamboyant sci-fi film ever made.Don't be put off by the fact that the film is perfect for a themed night at the local gay bar, though?Flash Gordon might be camper than a row of tents, as the saying goes, but there really is something for everyone but the most joyless of movie pedants: we get fantastical floating worlds that predate those in Avatar by three decades, there's pet dwarfs, crazy laser battles, a whip-wielding dominatrix, assorted sexy bints in skimpy outfits, and even a little 'gore' (both Ming and his henchman Klytus meet nasty fates)?PLUS for every shot of our hero in a tight T-shirt or leather hot-pants, we get several of the gorgeous Ornella Muti (as Ming's sultry daughter Princess Aura) in her figure hugging red catsuit, easily rivalling Buck Rogers' Erin Gray in the sexy Spandex stakes. Melody Anderson as Dale isn't exactly ugly either, and also gets to wear some very revealing get-ups.Hell, even Blue Peter fans are catered for, with '80s presenter Peter Duncan appearing as a tree dweller whose hand is attacked by a slimy vacuum cleaner bag with a poisonous sting in its tail.

		<fullReview>Yep, this old chestnut from 1980. It was recently released on Blu-Ray DVD, though I watched it in a manner more fitting, on a friend's old VHS tape, the movie taped off of TV from an airing in the 1980's. It was fitting because it is one of those grandmasters of camp. It knows what it is, and doesn't hide it, and it's like discovering a box in the attic full of your old toys from when you were a kid. You dust em off, some of the wheels don't work right, some of the joints are broken off, and some of the toys you're not sure why you picked them up and played with them in the first way. But damn it, they're still so much FUN! Fun is the operating word here. If you can't have it with such a bizarre cast put together - Max Von Sydow as the main villain, and Topol (yes, the guy from Fiddler on a Roof) as a Hawk-Man character, and Timothy Dalton as a supporting role as just another guy fighting 'the man' (or the Emperor really) - then you shouldn't watch these specifically campy 80's sci-fi action movies. It's a throwback to the era of 30's serials (or rather what Star Wars elevated to popular art), and the filmmaker Mike Hodges (of, get this, Get Carter (1971)), and all you need to know is Flash Gordon - his name on his t-shirt - gets involved with this other race out in space (he's a quarterback on Earth) and is the only savior around who can stop the evil Emperor (Sydow with the most awesomely comical eyebrows anywhere) from destroying our planet and/or marrying the girl of his momentary dreams.But what about the artistry that should be involved, or like the respect for the genre? This actually has more respect for its source than ultimately other 80's action-sci-fi movies had for their sources. Where it may fall flat is that it is SO campy and SO up on its own bad special effects (and believe me, there are some BAD effects here, so cheesy that you can see every line of demarcation of actor with backdrop or set with painting). On top of this the actor 'playing' at Flash Gordon is not at all good at what he does, except looking fresh and bleached like a clean towel. He makes Luke Skywalker look gritty if you can catch my drift.This movie is ultimately so hammy that Queen's music score has to keep blaring up every thirty seconds or so in the big climax to keep up with what else is going on - the flying monkey-hawkmen led by Topol, the man with the metal face and decidedly awesome British accent, Max von Sydow's eyebrows (sorry, I must mention them again for the sake of sanity), and the moments of outrageous fashion and silly fights and explosions. This isn't to say that some moments aren't meant to be taken completely campy. On the contrary, a few sequences, such as the scientist's "mind-wipe" as the editor goes through about 1,000 shots in a minute going through a man's memory files (some of these almost akin to a similar sequence in The Parallax View with Beatty's mind scanning through lots of images and messages). And it's actually more action-packed and sexual than one might expect out of a supposed "kids" movie, which is still basically is.All of the morals are BIG and COMIC-BOOK like (must use bold there), and there doesn't have to be too much thought involved. That said, there can be some emotional connection, if only on that level like, again, you had as a child. Flash Gordon is a movie proud to be simple and crazy and with sets that look every bit expensive as they probably were for the time period, and it's best to enjoy it that way. I wished I had watched it as a kid; it's made for nostalgia nowadays, but it also hits aim at any kid who likes the goofy and wild and action-packed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema breakthrough....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film that sparked a lot of visual influence in many cinema motion pictures today.The original Flash Gordon in the thirties inspired "George Lucas's" 'Star Wars' franchise.Compared to the technology used at the present this will just make you laugh off the visual effects and costumes used in this movie.But if you rewind to the early 80's and recall how cinema was at the time you will really appreciate this piece of art.The one noticeable major accomplishment of this movie that the audience can't ignore is the fact that a lot of movies were built from this such as 'Masters of the Universe' which was released in 1987 and loosely based on a range of toys and a cartoon series.If you look closely you will see that 'He-Man' or rather 'Prince Adam' is a re-incarnation of 'Flash Gordon'.The only difference being that 'He-Man' is more muscular and less of a ladies man.There are certain traces of 'Krull' released in 1983 and 'Star Wars :The Empire Strikes Back' of which both took off a few bites bite from 'Flash Gordon'and 'Predator' released in 1987 as well .The other remarkable discovery of this film is the fact that the character of 'Leonidas' played by 'Gerard Butler' from '300' was a full impersonation of 'Prince Vultan' played by 'Brian Blessed'.The imitation was to such an extent that the look and feel of 'Leonidas' character was entirely based on the 'Prince Vultan' character complete with the beard, scruffy and commanding voice of 'Brain Blessed' with quotes such as 'let the combat begin,to the death' which made '300' a huge success.'Flash Gordon' hate it or love it, but they are all here and it paved the way for many sci-fi classics of the 80's.Although the plot was not so prevailing and at times too silly with 'Sam Jones' in the lead role as 'Flash Gordon'coming off as rather too cheesy and soft.It almost indirectly displays too much sexuality in an attempt to stir up some romance which was unnecessary and makes the character of the sex-crazed 'Princes Aura' played by the forever stunning 'Ornella Muti' a bit too offensive and annoying.All was not lost and fans were treated to some astonishment by the soundtrack being provided by the band 'Queen' which was iconic rock band in the 80'.The winning factor is that 'Flash Gordon' was a great movie during its time and the filmmakers wanted to achieve something they were not capable of because of technology back then. But they did it anyway and instead of getting an awful disastrous piece of work what emerged was a motion picture that changed the history of science-fiction movies.Audiences may not love it now but if they think back and recall life in the early eighties they will begin to appreciated 'Flash Gordon' for what its worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film ever (end of discussion)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In millions of years time, when the Earth has been blasted to atoms (probably by a 'freak' meteor storm, or something), aliens will come down to our charred and lifeless planet and collect a DVD of Flash Gordon (the movie), in order to preserve it for the benefit of the rest of the universe. It really is that good.Okay, I'm kidding, but only kind of. It's actually a pretty terrible film. The acting is awful (especially the two leads) and the dialogue is even worse. Yet, it's still awesome. If there were Oscars for the best 'So-bad-it's-good' movie then Flash Gordon would win year after year. The sets alone are awesome in their over-the-top colourfulness, plus the costumes are literally out-of-this-world. And you have Brain Blessed spouting some of the most memorable lines ever committed to film.Did I mention they have lasers? Well, they do - LOTS of them - lasers blasting every which way you can see. And all to the soundtrack of one of the best rock bands ever - Queen.In today's world of dark and serious cinema (I'm thinking Christopher Nolan's Batman saga and Daniel Craig's James Bond flicks) most people have forgotten just how much fun 'camp and silly' films could be. Flash Gordon is just that - camp and silly. It never tries to be anything other than great, big, silly fun. And it succeeds.It's worth noting that it's so enjoyable that it played a major part in Seth McFarlane's 'Ted' movie (which I would recommend you check out if you have a 'Family Guy' type humour).Don't expect greatness when you sit down to watch Flash. Just expect great fun. And remember... he'll save every one of us!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 80s, De Laurentis made vibrant, adventurous movies.Despite a "B Movie" feel, the production values are high throughout 111 minutes of retro-driven, sci-fi packed entertainment, complimented by a rocking soundtrack delivered by chart-topping superband: Queen.You can either dismiss Flash as juvenile eye-candy, or marvel in its over-the-top glory. Revisiting the movie, I tend towards the latter. The costumes look gorgeous, the settings have a dream-like atmosphere. The production team go that extra mile to emulate the colorful, original comic books, too.Often criticized for hammy acting: I'll mention Topol, Timothy Dalton and ravishing Ornella Muti who do their best to transform Flash into a classy, trashy tour de force. I think they succeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flash Gordon, girlfriend Dale Arden, and scientist Dr Zarkov find themselves on the planet Mongo, fighting an attempt by evil Emperor Ming the Merciless to conquer the Earth.Back in the 1940s, Buster Crabbe starred as Flash Gordon in two black and white cinema serials based on the science fiction comic strip. They were, of necessity, cheap and cheerful and, to modern eyes, the lack of production value (spaceships dangling from visible wires, for instance) seems amusing. By the late 70s, someone had the bright idea of remaking Flash as a colourful widescreen cinema experience while retaining the cheap and cheerful look.So we have a non-actor in the lead role, deliberately amateurish effects, a script which is outrageously melodramatic and hilariously over the top, and a soundtrack by Queen which is utterly out of step with what is on screen. And yet it all works.Flash Gordon is a hoot - 2 hours of colourful entertainment where the spoof elements work because the players (mostly) play it straight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No other film is like this one, as Sam J. Jones plays the title character, based on the famous comic strip and early Saturday morning serials with Buster Crabbe. Max Von Sydow is the evil Ming the Merciless, ruler of Mongo, who is trying to destroy Earth because he is bored. Melody Anderson is Dale Arden, in love with Flash and coveted by Ming. Topol is Dr. Hans Zarkhov, whose rocket ship took the three of them to Mongo in the first place. Brian Blessed is extremely enthusiastic as Prince Vultan, Pre-James Bond Timothy Dalton is quite serious as Prince Barin, rival of Vultan, and in love with Ming's ultra sensuous daughter Princess Aura(Ornella Muti) All will converge in the exciting finale where Flash must save the day.Crazy film is nonetheless great fun, no point in taking this seriously, since everything about it is intentionally over the top, punctuated by a soaring score and incredible sets and costumes. Not to be over thought or have all kinds of subtext in it, just sit back and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With No "Buster", They Were Fighting An Up Hill Battle. And All Things Considered, They Didn't Do Such A Bad Job! Take A Second, Fresh Look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the story goes, sometime in the mid 1970's, a bright young film maker sought to get permission to do an updated telling of the Flash Gordon as a movie. The comic strip and characters were creations of cartoonist and illustrator extraordinare, Alex Raymond (1909-56) and property of the Hearst Corporation's King Features Syndicate. The answer for whatever reason(perhaps they questioned the sanity of one who would attempt to remake the near-perfection of the 3 Universal serials of 1936,'38 &amp; '40)was "no dice!", and the young movie guy would have to look elsewhere for a movie project.So George Lucas went out and created STAR WARS (1977) and proceeded to remake the face of Science Fiction as well as that of the "Blockbuster Movie". But the success of this new creation could mean only one thing. Every Studio in the business would just have to get their own 'Space Opera' Sci-Fi Film.During this period, we saw the return of the Grand Daddy of all Spacemen. Universal gave us BUCK ROGERS (1979) and followed it up with the Buck Rogers TV Series. The main cast was made of Gil Girard (Buck), Erin Gray(Wilma Deering-Woo, woo, woo,woo!), Tim O'Connor (Dr.Huer) and Henry Silva(Killer Kane).With Pamela Hensley (Princess Ardala-also Woo,woo,woo,woo!) guest starring and giving us twice the Feminine Pulchritude for our price of admission gives the role of the Princess her all.Well, next up was Flash Gordon and this time, the boys in charge over at Hearst/King Features gave their imprimatur to a new film life for their top Space Guy. This time it was Italian Movie Mogul,Dino DiLaurentiis who got the nod along with Universal Pictures, who would also release and distribute.Any Flash Gordon project would require either a courageous or a crazy man. Even if the Flash Gordon Trilogy was completed over 40years before, it would still be a tough act to follow. Wrightly or wrongly, there would still be comparisons.The Serials had one Clarence Linden Crabbe in the lead. "Buster" Crabbe had been a tremendous all-sport, all-around athlete in his high school years and specialized in competitive swimming as a USC Trojan. The chosen sport obviously was the right one as Mr. Crabbe was a medalist at the 1932 Olympic Games.The players supporting "Buster" were very capable and memorable. Lovely ex-model Jean Rogers (woo,woo,woo,woo!so sexy) was Dale Arden*in the 1st 2 serials with lovely Carol Hughes doing Dale in the 3rd film. Charles B. Middleton(Emperor Ming),Frank Shannon (Dr.Zarkov)and Richard Alexander (Prince Barin) all did yeomen's jobs in supporting parts. But it was Comic Actor, Jack "Tiny" Lipson who stole much of the show as a King Henry VIII-like, lecherous, "dirty old man" of a foe, turned ally, King Vultan, Ruler of the Hawkmen.So, now the cast of the new film was very important to getting the new project to "blast-off" successfully. The Leads of Sam J. Jones, Beau Derek's husband in the Dudley Moore sex comedy, 10(1979) made a fine Flash, being tall,muscular and athletic. Melody Anderson's Dale Arden was energetic, convincing and much more of a "liberated woman"than Dale had previously been depicted.But both of their characterizations are saddled with bits of what we have come to know as "Camp" Humor. Most modern Comic Strip/Comic Book adaptations of the period were required to go this route ever since the success of the BATMAN TV Series (1966-68). We can well imagine a conference room filled with the "Suits" who run the Studios demanding the "Camp" treatment.Rounding out the international cast are Israeli Actor, Topol(that's Tevye,himself!) as Dr.Zarkov, top Swedish Film Actor &amp; Star, Max von Sydow (a most satisfying job as Ming, the Merciless),Brits Timothy Dalton(Prince Barin) and Brian Blessed (King Vultan). Italian beauty,Omella Muti (Double woo,woo,woo,woo!)makes one hell of a sexy temptress as Princess Aura.When one tries to look at this FLASH GORDON (1980)from a fresh, objective point of view, it would look much better to us. Just consider all of the pluses. The opening credits are liberally sprinkled with art illustrations taken from original, old Alex Raymond Sunday Colour Panels. Over these beautiful and rapidly moving and changing comic art of panels of celluloid is the original music and lyrics written and performed by Queen. It really is different and does grow on one.And it could be said, without exaggeration, that the Production Team was trying for a look which would be highly reminiscent of the Sunday Comics Pages of Mr. Alex Raymond. Well they did succeed in that.And let's see, that was 1980, this is 2007. I guess it's safe enough to go out on a limb and say there'll not be a sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Jones stars as Flash Gordon, a New York Jets quarterback (So much for a hero)who goes up against Ming(Max Von Sydow), after Ming captures him and his girlfriend Dale(Melody Anderson) and forces her to marry him, however Flash escapes and gets the hawkmen to waste Ming once and for all. Flash Gordon at least for me, makes a great companion piece with Highlander. In that both feature a huge amount of style, great soundtrack and lovable goofiness. Flash Gordon could possibly be one of the greatest guilty pleasures ever made. However there is a flaw in that Sam Jones is terrible and he lacks any form of charisma. Indeed when compared to Christopher Lambert (Star of the companion piece Highlander) Lambert emerges with far more charisma and slightly more acting talent. Still Flash Gordon is a great movie, with a very enjoyable villain in Max Von Sydow who plans to blow up the earth, his answer? Why not! Flash Gordon as far as i'm concerned could very well be one of the coolest movies from the 80's. I love this movie.* * * out of 4-(Good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you decide to watch Flash Gordon, don't be alarmed by the bad grade it gets on IMDB. You just approach it as the early eighties flick it is. If you look at the cheesy costumes, the bad special effect and the hilarious one-liners and laugh at them, then you'll love it. If you can't laugh about that, then you'll hate it.My love for the movie is mainly based on one thing: the soundtrack. All the music in the movie is composed and performed by Queen. The music of the most famous glamrock band in history makes it worth while. If you love Queen, you must watch this movie, there's no doubt about that.Main conclusion, you'll love it or you'll hate it. If you're looking for a Spiderman-like adaption of a comic book, don't watch this movie. If you like retro-style films that you'll mostly find in your small movie house in stead of your large 20-studio cinema and/or if you love Queen, like me then this is a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the plot is silly, yes the dialogue is cheesy and yes, some of the special effects are badly done, but nonetheless it is great fun. Like Rocky Horror Picture Show, Congo and Jingle All the Way, Flash Gordon is a sort of guilty pleasure of mine. The costumes are quite extravagant and the sets are exotic. Then you have an irresistibly killer soundtrack from Queen, who also brought us the classics We Will Rock You and Bohemian Rhapsody. The direction is pretty good and the acting is surprisingly great. Sam J Jones is bad with his cheesiness but he was fun besides, thank goodness he wasn't bland like Justin Whalin from Dungeons and Dungeons, and Melody Anderson is charming and alluring as Dale. Brian Blessed is very hammy as Vultran but he is great fun regardless and Topol, who was so superb in Fiddler on the Roof, is memorable as Dr Hans Zarkov. And while Ornella Muti is a wonderfully witty and sexy Princess Aura, it is Max Von Sydow who walks away with the picture, pantomime of course but sinister as well and I appreciated that. Overall, not perfect and camp personified, but very enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

This movie is fantastic in this way. It's like a space and time machine that puts you into an another dimension of classical comic book story about a hero who saves the universe and representing all the values of real, brave and honest man from the West. This is the kind of story that shows fantastic world of good vs evil, truth and justice, bravery and friendship. It ain't one of the postmodernist movies showing gray world without good and evil that can't be divided. It's a moving comic book with awesome music about FLASH - THE SAVIOUR OF UNIVERSE.

The story is faithful to the first Flash Gordon serial (included in the new DVD). The costumes are some of the best designs ever, as are the sets and props. The space ships could have been right out of the serials. Ming is incredible as is Klytus and the rest of the baddies. I do agree with many that a big downfall is Flash himself. Sam J. Jones just didn't have the talent for this project. Meldoy Anderson is OK with some nice scenes but overall she's rather weak. They both look the part but they should have been dubbed. If anything, I wanted to see more of Mongo, such as Fridgia. The ending was clearly set up for a sequel with Zarkov saying they may never get home and the big question mark at the end. Too bad part two was never made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have waited years for this DVD. It is a masterpiece of restoration. The movie is more vibrant and vivid and the sound is fantastic. I guess watching it in HD helps with an up conversion DVD player.Everybody knows the story..Ming and Klytus are watching intergalactic TV and zero in on Earth as a plaything, which they begin to destroy with burning hail and terrible storms and gales. Flash Gordon meets Dale Arden on the tarmac at a local airport to be interviewed, then takes off in a plane only to crash land outside the laboratory greenhouse of Dr Hans Zarkov.Zarkov tricks Flash and Dale and they end up on his rocket ship which blasts into space. Zarkov is convinced that he has discovered the source of the destructive forces now raining down on Earth. The rocket ship crash lands on Mongo, and the whole bunch is captured by forces of the Emperor Ming.The group is brought before Ming and the other planetary representatives, Hawkmen, Green Lantern Types, and other assorted alien types. Flash plays a game of football to the joy of all present, but is knocked unconscious and ends up in the sexy clutches of Mings daughter Aura who wants to rape and pillage this fine specimen of humanity, complete with black leather shorty shorts. Go Flash Go. Flash is "put to death" with lethal gas, but is actually not really dead. Aura has saved flash for her own pleasures on her personal pleasure planetoid.They crash on Arbor where the Green Guys put Flash through a test, which Flash wins and eventually wins the hearts of all the guys..led by Prince Barin (not related to Ming, but heir to the throne of mongo anyway). Arda is captured by Ming's secret police and Klytus works on her with the bore worms. She confesses and Ming dispatches a ship to pick up Flash, but is thwarted by the Hawk Men led by Prince Vultan. Klytus is killed and the jig is up.Ming decides to marry Dale Arden and a lavish marriage ceremony takes place. Meantime Flash is flying a suicide mission on rocket Ajax and crashes directly into the palace wedding chapel and impales Ming on the nose of the craft. Ming dissolves into pink vapor and all that is left is his gorgeous ring, which a gloved hand mysteriously picks up with an evil Ming laugh in the background.Flash and Dale Arden are united, Zarkov is safe and Barin is the new King of Mongo. Everybody lives happily ever after, or do they? The Queen Soundtrack.. well what can I say. I hum Flash.. ahhh ahhhh all the time, it's so damn catchy.I recommend the DVD release to everybody who has, like me, awaited this campy classic in a modern format. Like Klytus said.. we live on.. An insignificant planet in the SK system, the inhabitants call it "Euth".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The evil Ming the Merciless (Max von Sydow) on Mongo is triggering a series of natural disasters (fire, floods, earthquakes) on Earth that threatens to destroy the entire planet. Quarterback Flash Gordon (Sam J. Jones), Dale Arden (Melody Anderson) and Dr. Hans Zarkov (Topol) are accidentally sent there and battle Ming and his daughter (Omella Muti) from destroying Earth...and Ming wants to wed Dale.Yeah it's silly and Jones and Anderson are good-looking and can't really act but I love this movie. It was a major bomb in 1980 (for some reason) but has achieved a cult following since then. The special effects range from poor to OK but it fits the comic strip plot perfectly. There's tons of campy dialogue ("I'm Flash Gordon, quarterback for the New York Jets"), interesting costumes and a fun, bombastic score by Queen.As I said before Jones and Anderson can't act but the supporting cast is just great. Topol is good as Zarkof, Muti is very sexy, Timothy Dalton (pre-Bond) is strong and heroic but von Sydow carries this. He's obviously having a whale of a time doing this and it rubs off on the audience. Also listen to his voice when he yells--his Swedish accent keeps slipping through! Fun, fast and perfect for kids and adults. I only give it an 8 because of some gaps here and there in the story."Flash I love you but we only have 14 hours to save the Earth."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stalwart football player Flash Gordon (affable Sam Jones) has to stop evil intergalactic tyrant Ming the Merciless (a deliciously hammy Max Von Sydow) from destroying Earth. Helping Flash out are sweet Dale Arden (the lovely Melody Anderson), zany scientist Dr. Hans Zarkov (a wonderfully warm and witty Topol), and hale'n'hearty Hawkman Prince Vultan (a wonderfully robust Brian Blessed). Standing in Flash's way are Ming's luscious nymphet daughter Princess Aura (the insanely hot Ornella Muti), dashing, but jealous Prince Barin (a pre-James Bond Timothy Dalton), Ming's righthand man Klytus (an amusingly droll Peter Wyngarde), and wicked General Kala (a marvelously nasty Mariangelo Melato). Mike Hodges' sprightly and stylish direction, working from an inspired tongue-in-cheek script by Lorenzo Semple, Jr., keeps the pace darting along at a steady clip, stages the action scenes with rip-roaring brio, and deftly maintains an infectiously silly tone throughout. The awesome roaring rock score by Queen further enlivens the enjoyably giddy proceedings to a substantial degree. Gilbert Taylor's sumptuously bright, crisp and expansive cinematography, the funky special effects, and the eye-popping lavish'n'garish production design make this picture a complete dazzling visual feast. A novel variant on Russian roulette involving a poisonous monster in a tree trunk rates as a definite highlight. A wild catfight between Dale and Aura likewise seriously smokes. The exciting climactic attack on Ming's palace really delivers the stirring goods. Plus there's an irresistibly energetic and enthusiastic sense of pure go-for-it wacky fun that permeates every last gloriously gaga frame of this supremely entertaining winner. A real pip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>note: this is written by Liz's Husband I went to the cinema when I was 5 years old to see this and it was the most exciting and spellbinding thing I'd ever seen.Its unique soundtrack and set design made this an instant classic and obviously at that age notions of the film being camp were completely non existent yet I did get princess Aura (possibly my first crush) and was terrified by the monster in the swamps of Auboria and remember being unable to watch the whole sequence.Flash was a role model for me and and when they started showing Buster Crabb on morning TV during the summer holidays I was hooked. The only fault I have with Flash Gordon is that they never made the sequel, oh and there was no Lion Men in it, but maybe they were saving them for the sequel, that would of been cool.Even now 25 years later this is still one of my favourite films, it just cant be topped. Its stays true to the comic and TV series and lets face it just about everything in Star Wars is taken from the Flash Gordon saga, even though you cant compare the two. You cant take Flash seriously and come on your not supposed to - if they had made it all serious and dark it would of been terrible, instead they made something tongue-in-cheek that is exciting and funny and for all the family.So the point I really want to make is that to a 5 year old the film was never camp - it was funny exciting and scary with even a dash of romance "I love you flash, but we've only got 14 hours to save the earth" I mean come on that line itself is funny, romantic, exciting and scary all rolled into one!!!

		<fullReview>This is the Litmus Test of movies. If you don't enjoy "Flash Gordon," then you aren't allowed to like movies anymore. You have no authority on them. Your opinion does not count.I can only think of one word to sum up everything here, and that word is "magical." From Flash *accidentally* launching himself into space, to Flash taking off his jacket to reveal a T-shirt that says "FLASH," to Max Von Sydow being awesome, to the gayest costumes in any movie outside "Paris is Burning," to Flash's linebacker-based fighting moves, to Zarkov getting his memory erased (this part is actually, non-ironically disturbing), to visual references covering decades' worth of pop culture, to the creepy alien forest (shamefully ripped off by "The Princess Bride"), to Zarkov pontificating about the beauty of humanity when earlier he tried to kill people with a gun, to the bore worms ("NO! NOT THE BORE WORMS!")... yes, "magical" is the word, possibly followed by "glorious." Best of all, the movie manages to repeatedly top itself, an amazing feat. You wouldn't reasonably expect each scene in a horror movie to be scarier than the last, or funnier than the last in a comedy, but "Flash Gordon" manages to be stupider with every single scene. It is an accomplishment for the ages. If you watch this and do not come away feeling 10 times better than you did before, then movies as a medium are clearly not for you. I would say something about the reviewers who claim to like "Queen" and yet NOT like this movie, but that's some kind of paradox I can't even begin to wrap my head around, like the unstoppable force meeting the immovable object. This movie gets a solid 8/10 for the sheer joy it has brought me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually and Aurally Dazzling Update of the 1930's Serials</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colorful, silly fun, at times campy, Mike Hodges's 1980 "Flash Gordon" is among those movies that are less than the sum of their parts. Made on shoe-string budgets with C-picture performers and crew for young undemanding viewers, the original 1930's Flash Gordon serials are unintentionally funny to adults today. To recapture the innocence and naivete of those movies with a big budget and trained actors is a difficult task, although Hodges's "Flash Gordon" makes a decent attempt. Lorenzo Semple's screenplay tracks the original serials fairly well; Flash and Dale Arden are taken aboard Doctor Hans Zarkov's spacecraft and flown to the planet Mongo, where they battle Emperor Ming the Merciless to save the Earth. Semple's script has enough classic bad dialog to satisfy seekers of camp; "I love you Flash, but we only have 14 hours to save the Earth." However, the difference between Semple's script and the original series is that Semple knew he was writing bad dialog, while the writers of the serial were unintentionally hilarious.That difference in intention also applies to the actors; Buster Crabbe and company played the serials dead-pan straight, and those in the remake who play their parts equally straight come off best. The under-demanding role of Flash requires the skills of a Razzie Award Winning thespian, and, Sam J. Jones won a Razzie nomination for his work herein. Although not a super hero in the modern sense, the blonde hunk, who sports nothing but leather trunks in one scene, physically fills the role, and Jones manages to deliver his lines with a convincing lack of conviction as the dim, but well meaning Flash. However, the movie's scene-stealer is Max Von Sydow as Ming the Merciless; appropriately garbed and made-up as the evil emperor, Von Sydow plays the role with majesty and menace, which is all the more fun. Unfortunately, Topol as Doctor Zarkov, does not follow Von Sydow's example and winks and smiles as the mad scientist, telegraphing to viewers that he is in on the joke. But Brian Blessed as the winged Prince Vultan, Timothy Dalton as Prince Barin, and, especially, the delicious Peter Wyngarde as Klytus deliver their lines as though penned by the Bard himself. Although Mariangela Melato is a memorable Kala, Melody Anderson as Dale Arden should have been in the running for a Razzie alongside Jones, which is intended as a compliment.Besides Von Sydow, the film's other scene-stealer is designer Danilo Donati, who provided the lavish Fellini-esque costumes and sets. While Donati's work tends to emphasize red and gold, which may not be to everyone's taste, his outlandish designs are as entertaining as anything on display and certainly light years beyond those of the 1930's serials. If Donati or another anonymous designer created the Art-Deco spaceships, he or she too deserves kudos as do the creators of the appropriately tacky and obvious special effects, which beautifully evoke the primitive work of the 1930's serials. As contemporary and important as the art direction is the pulsating score by Queen that punctuates the action and enhances the excitement. While "Flash Gordon" is not the high camp perhaps intended, the film has a cult following and enough outstanding attributes to satisfy main-stream audiences. Led by Max Von Sydow's iconic Ming the Merciless, Queen's pounding music, and Danilo Donati's dazzling designs, "Flash Gordon" may not be to everybody's taste, but should be savored by all at least once, just for the sheer fun of it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epitome of 1980s cheese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As cheesy comic book romps go, this takes some beating. Based on the original comic strip series - images of which are shown over the title credits - this is a film that was dated even when it was first released. The years have lent it a certain nostalgic charm and there's no doubt that it's enjoyable when you're in the right silly mood. There's also the appeal of watching some respectable actors taking part in the chaos that ensues on screen.Bad movie fans will have a field day with this one. The plot is simplistic in the extreme, not to mention contrived, and the film merely seems like a STAR WARS rip-off. The special effects are also very cheap looking, being a mixture of that bad early '80s computer effect and some very dodgy matte work. A hilarious score by Queen serves to date the film even further. Still, at least they try and throw in a bit of everything here; there's plenty of action, from gun fights to fist fights, there's some whipping, romance, glamour (the girls all get to wear shiny bikinis), drama, male bonding, and even a rubbery monster in there too.Sam Jones stars as the square-jawed American hero, and to be brutally honest, he's awful - a really poor actor. I've never seen anybody so wooden. He does have an endearing puppy-dog quality to him though. Melody Anderson is the annoying bubbly heroine who makes stupid remarks like "Flash! Flash! I love you, but we only have 14 hours to save the Earth!". Topol actually comes off pretty well playing an intelligent scientist and doesn't have to embarrass himself too much. On the other hand, Brian Blessed should be crying tears of shame if he watches himself flying about with papier mache wings. Timothy Dalton also pops up to lend some much-needed charisma, while Max Von Sydow goes over the top as the sinister comic book villain. There are also cameos from British celebrities like Robbie Coltrane and Richard O'Brien.One of my favourite scenes in this film, which I've always remembered since seeing it as a child, is the huge exciting fight scene on a tilting circular platform complete with pop-up spikes. This culminates in a Darth Vader-wannabe robo-guy getting brutally spiked. It's a lot of fun. While some bits are excruciatingly embarrassing, like the sad squad of flying bird-men, most of this is fun in a bad way and a couple of bits are surprisingly well-handled. There are plenty of in-jokes to spot and the whole thing is colourful, garish to look at. Besides, how can you hate a film which has evil henchmen who wear red gas masks? FLASH GORDON is the epitome of cheesy '80s fun and should be viewed as such.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music is brilliant but i think the movie looks unfinished.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I finally got watch this late enough last night. The reason why I decided to watch the 1980 version was because, Queen did the soundtrack and people I know seen it, loved it. Adding to that, there were big stars like Topol, Timothy Dalton, Brian Blessed, Richard O'Brien and Kenny Baker appeared on this so it was a joy to see them! This is actually the first time ever that I have seen Brian Blessed being an actor and this is 2016 lol! He was absolutely brilliant and sure he never fails to be funny!I thought the movie didn't look particularly completed because:1. At the end of the film, I read on the trivia that the writers couldn't come up with trying to have a better ending for the movie. Sure, they should've got Flash and Dale Arden married off and living happily after. Instead, Sam J . Jones did the work for them. Seriously, they were so disorganised!2. The redesign of Flash Gordon looked as if it was copied from the He-Man series but gave him no powers. For god sake, hes meant to be a superhero, not a tosser! They should've rechecked the old series of Flash Gordon and not bother changing his appearance!3. I thought Dales Wedding dress to the evil dude Ming the Merciless, looked absolutely shocking! She looked as if she was going to a funeral, it just didn't suit her for the film! What really happened to white, does anyone know?4.Sam J. Jones voice was cut off, the producers and himself should've came to an agreement to make his voice heard on the movie. The voice sounded like it was coming from a poor actor who came out of puberty. It was honestly that great but the whole action distracted me so I won't make a big deal out of it!On the positive note, i thought the soundtrack for this was excellent. I actually nearly fell asleep when the 3 of them on the rocket sleeping and a song from the background was peaceful! I even liked Ming's costume, he definitely looked spot on and bad ass!Even though i wouldn't call it the best movie in the world, I suppose people who love action movies should watch this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's Flash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sure Dino De Laurentiis hoped Flash Gordon would rival Star Wars and Superman as a blockbuster film franchise. The film based on a comic strip and 1930s film serial.The film had for the time very good special effects, some elaborate sets, sexy women especially Ornella Muti in a red catsuit and a pounding musical score by Queen.The screenplay was written by Lorenzo Semple Jr and it was adapted with an intentionally camp style similar to the 1960s television series Batman that Semple had written some episodes for in an attempt to appeal to fans of the comics and serial films.However the screenplay was more than camp, so was some of the acting, costumes and sets. The lead actor Sam Jones as well as others ended up being dubbed and shouty Brian Blessed is known for his shriek of 'Gordon's Alive!' as an example of some of the fruity lines.Max Von Sydow is a delicious Ming the Merciless aided and abetted by Mariangela Melato. Timothy Dalton takes it all too seriously and the result is glorious, marvellous fun with the right kind of silliness and of course the music by Queen is sublime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flash Gordon to the rescue!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flash Gordon (1980) staring, Sam J. Jones as Flash Gordon, and Melody Anderson as the beautiful Dale Arden, is a remake or updated version of the 1930's comic strip Flash Gordon. The film starts out flashing filmed images of a man-made scientific piece of equipment designed to create catastrophic events like Hurricanes, Tornados and Floods. The theme of the movie is focused on saving Earth, from being destroyed, but we are initially led to believe it is from a mad scientist known as Dr. Hans Zarkov played by Topol. Zarkov is viewed as threat by the terrible Emperor Ming ( Max Von Skydow) who lives on another planet in the galaxy. Ming skyjacks the air bus that Flash and Dale are operating, along with capturing them in the accompaniment of Zarkov and here is where the film takes on its major animation.While still focusing on saving Earth, now from Enperor Ming, Zarkov, befriends Flash and together they set in motion the idea of saving the planet Earth from his plan of destruction. Emperor Ming views Dr. Zarkov as a threat to his kingdom, and wants his memory wiped clean back to his birth, but he manages to manipulate the process to keep his own thoughts safeguarded. This is your typical hero type of movie that saves the day, where Flash Gordon is the hero, originated from a comic strip just as Superman or Spiderman are turned into superhuman form in film, so is Flash Gordon. Maintaining the theme it becomes a battle of who will rule the galaxy, as the beings from Emperor Mings galaxy begin to lose ground against the three humans who eventually gain the trust of some of Ming's own people. Ming's galaxy is still divided by the different class of citizens, like the winged citizens, versus the others. Each battles for their own identity within the kingdom to begin with, and now you throw humans into the mix. None are quick to take sides with the humans to overthrow the terrible Emperor Ming but in the end, this is exactly what happens. Earth is saved from Ming's destruction, and Ming's kingdom is turned over to his daughter and her husband, after the destruction of Emperor Ming. The hero is none other than Flash Gordon, as is emphasized in the end, with a human gesture of saying Thanks. The hero saves the day, galaxy and Earth. Not bad for a days work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag... but what a bag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 70s, the geeky and constantly malnourished-looking Northern California film-maker George Lucas tried and failed to obtain the rights to the iconic "Flash Gordon" character from producer Dino De Laurentis. Failing that, the ambitious Lucas went off and created his own version of "space opera." De Laurentis, never a man afraid to make a buck, went ahead and did his own version right away to exploit the new value associated with sci-fi outer space action. And this was the film we got, for better or worse.....Speaking for myself, being a kid born in the mid 70s, this film was my first encounter with "Flash" and "Ming the Merciless" and all these characters. "Queen" was one of my favorite bands and the theme song was all over the radio that summer of 80. I saw the movie with my dad and my brother and while I thought it was just as good as "Star Wars", they were considerably less enthused... just as I have become with time. But nostalgia has a certain power even among those of us who try to look at film in a "serious" way; and why not? After all, we should be glad to be able to have fun with a film, wherever the fun might come from.When I watch it today, I see a film that has many fun moments with its bright colors, elaborate and weird sets, costumes and makeups, and I enjoy seeing all these things done with physical effects instead of computer effects. But the movie's direction by Hodges is bland, full of too many long shots and medium shots to show off the sets. And then when you get right down to it, Melody Anderson and Sam Jones are giving such horrible performances that maybe it's not so much that Hodges shot too much protection as that the close-ups were worthless.Thankfully the film follows the formula of "Star Wars" in more ways than one: surround the young fresh faces with heavyweight European film talent. The supporting cast on this one is excellent, possibly thanks in part to Hodges' solid position on the U.K. scene. Brian Blessed is a welcome presence in any film. When he's got huge hawk-wings, a golden toga, and spouts lines like "Let this day henceforth be known as Flash Gordon's day!", well that counts as a major bonus. And then they got Max Von Sydow for Ming, which ain't small potatoes, and he approaches the role with relish and without embarrassment despite what must have been horrific makeup sessions. Timothy Dalton is fun also as some kind of Robin Hood character. I never quite figure out what he's supposed to be doing at various points or why he's the King at the end of the movie, but who cares I guess, right? He's too good an actor for this movie; you can almost literally see him struggling to lend some weight to his relationship to this princess character played by the impossibly beautiful and apparently talentless Ornella Muti.As for Topol, I enjoyed his performance but I thought it was absurd and actually offensive for the movie to try to somehow incorporate themes about the Jewish Holocaust into the mix during his whole brainwashing thing. That's a good example where somebody involved, probably the writer or the director, had this idea that was tonally wrong for the film but which managed to make the final cut because nobody else cared enough to fight it.Perhaps the most interesting thing about the movie is the way that the music is mixed opera-style with the action in the big climax scenes. It's really kind of exciting, for those of us who enjoy heavy blues chords and "Queen" in general.Ultimately, what can I say? It's a ridiculous movie with horrible dialog, with a lot of bad actors and a couple good actors walking around in sets that look like Fellini's Satyricon on the moon. But I enjoy it for what it is, and sometimes for what it isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as campy as I expected ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 80's flick has a reputation of being one of the ultimate examples of camp. Being a camp-lover (Batman: The Movie, Barbarella, etc.) I was really looking forward to see this sci-fi-flick. Well ... to be quite honest, I didn't think it was that campy. Sure the costumes and decors look funny, the performances are rather laughable and the storyline isn't that accurate, but hey, it could've been much worse (and for once, "worse" should be understand as "better") But does that mean I didn't like this movie? Hell no! Flash Gordon is a wonderful picture filled with sci-fi, fantasy, humor, action &amp; adventure, and even some jokes. Not as psychedelic as Barbarella, but much more fantasy and imagination. This movie is really enjoying and shows me (and I hope; you) that there's nothing wrong with dreaming. Plus, if you like the music of Queen, you came to the right place. Flash Gordon, a true hero. Little children should better copy his deeds instead of Robocop and The Terminator in roleplays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flash Gordon is great sci-fi, with a dash of action and a whole lot of camp. This film literally has it all. From an interplanetary football game to hawkmen raiding the palace (there's also a good chick fight). There are two words that best sum up the movie: entertaining and colorful. This is without a doubt the most colorful and bright movie I've ever seen. It sports a superb cast including Max von Sydow as Ming the Merciless, Timothy Dalton, and Richard O'Brien. With all of the great characters running around, Klytus happens to be my personal favorite. Klytus is the Darth Vadar of the movie while Ming is more akin to the Emperor. I do have one question, what happened to Sam Jones? How do you star as the title hero in a sci-fi epic and your career not take off? Looks like he got lost in the wasteland of straight to video action movies. It's a shame (kinda reminds me of Casper Van Dien). I suppose Flash Gordon was just Sam Jones' moment in the spotlight. But what a moment it was. As great a movie as it is, it wouldn't be half as enjoyable without Queen's soundtrack. "Flash-Aah Aah! He's a miracle, king of the impossible."</fullReview>

		<fullReview> ... think the big gas chamber execution (of Flash, by Ming's minions) scene actually kind of worked on some weird dramatic level? I mean, not just as a joke? The fight or duel between Flash and Prince Beren on the wobbling, rotating, intermittently-spiked platform, culminating in the niftily gruesome death of Klytus (who'd just made a *great* entrance) worked pretty well too.  I actually saw this movie in a theater in 1980, and that made a difference. To me Mariangela Melato as "General Kala" was the sexiest woman in the picture. This movie might be more fairly compared to something like _Barbarella_ than any of the _Star Wars_ pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flash Gordon (1980), when evaluated by ordinary standards, is a terrible movie with its bad writing, Ken doll hero, and dumb moments. But when measured on its merits as entertainment, this is a classic of camp with few to rival its sheer audacity.This film manages to take itself even less seriously than the 1930s serials and comic books. Unafraid to go all out in campiness, it can be off-putting for some folks. Even more potentially off-putting can be the amount of kinkiness on display; I swear one of the filmmakers must have had a major bondage fetish with the amount of trussed up folks in this film, and that's not even mentioning the overt sexuality of the villains.The sets and costumes are amazingly gaudy. The catchy Queen soundtrack is legendary. The effects, when measured up to that other sci-fantasy film of 1980, The Empire Strikes Back, looks incredibly dated even for the time. But it all adds to the old-school, goofy fun.And that best sums up the film: goofy fun. It is a dumb movie and I would not have it any other way!</fullReview>

The sets are really outlandish and over the top, exactly what you would want from an updating of the serial and this kind of spectacle in what is basically a comedy is almost never seen anymore.All the character actors did a great job in this, from Timothy Dalton to Brian Blessed to Topol. Ornella Muti never looked so gorgeous before or after. All the crazy accents and scene chewing makes for a fantastically entertaining movie. I was always disappointed they didn't make more of these but perhaps it is best that this stands as a pinnacle of 70's/80's kitsch done right. This movie is a true classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is virtually nothing like this Movie. It takes you to an Alternative Universe where it seems like everyone is on Hallucinogens. Nothing is remotely real here and the costume and set designers go out of their minds to go out of the box.The vibrant colors are uninhibited inducements and the wardrobe is the same. There is a sexual, barely hidden, subtext that is overwhelmed by the sheer audacity of it all. "Go Flash Go!!". Everything glitters and the Glam is lusciously unabashed.This Movie drips with a liquid landscape and beyond that the dialog is straight faced ludicrous. "Don't take my mind, I spent my whole life filling it...This Ming's a psycho---Who said that?...I like to play before I annihilate". There is so much to admire in this great, gaudy production. It has the most expensive cheap look imaginable, the tin-foil covering and the placidity to it all makes for a glimmering representation of an Art-Deco homage.Part of the appeal must also arrive from the fact that the Producers and Writers, and yes the Director were completely flabbergasted and were winging it most of the time. This results in a delightful distilling of the dumbness. Finally, the Queen Title Song and its use throughout is either bombastically wonderful or "fingernails on the blackboard" depending on your taste.This Arty, ornate, flamboyant Film will forever be viewed by the fab fashion conscious, the Bad- Movie lovers, fans of the baroque, the curious Cinema devotees, the LGBT community. and hordes of funky followers, thus solidifying its deserved place in Cult Movie history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>remember watching this movie back in the eighties when it was first released and years later found it for sale at a video store and purchased it right away. i don't remember much of the plot from when i was watching it growing up as a kid but after viewing it again...there really wasn't much of one. i found myself liking this film which is based on a comic strip all over again, in large part due to the casting ie. 007 timothy Dalton as prince barin, max Von sydow as ming the merciless and here he plays the role for laughs and camps it up for the audience. i'll admit now, the special effects are terrible, the acting is choppy at best and the main score performed by rock icons queen is downright cheezy. but i think that is the charm and appeal of this movie which now stands as a cult favourite. the set designs and costumes are colourful and creative and not easily forgotten. everything just seems so sharp and vibrant. i thought that ornella muti who plays ming's daughter princess aura was incredibly hot throughout...wearing very tight and skin-hugging outfits and her seductive smile and charm that seemed to entrance the men around her. the actress, melody Anderson who played the role of dale Arden got on my nerves after a while. it was her neediness and clinging to flash Gordon that really irked me. all she was given to do in her role was pine and long for flash when he was captured than executed for defying ming's orders. when he was resurrected, all she could do was hope he would come and rescue her after ming selected her as one of his muses and later a bride. still worth a look, though. it's fun and nostalgic and remind of other cheezy, schlock filled cult classics of a by-gone era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flash Gordon will never make an AFI top 100 great films. It was never intended to. The campy film version of the 1930's serial has many of the over the top and unneeded flashy style that existed in the late 1970's and early 1980's.Though Sam Jones lacks the needed emotion to play a comic book super hero, the film is completely saved by Max Von Sydow, perhaps the greatest villain actor of the last 50 years. And it amazes me that the beautiful Meldoy Anderson didn't shoot up the ladder, and become a a list leading lady.What I find funny is that even though Flash was supposed to be a star quarterback for the New York Jets, it was quite evident during the football game he played with Ming's guards that he didn't know the proper way to carry a ball when he ran, and his passing style was completely horrible.The soundtrack is a dream if you're a fan of the band Queen. Though many of their fans have disowned the Flash Gordon soundtrack, With even Queen drummer Roger Taylor poking fun at it in many an interview, the music is as perfect a s a score can get without turning to the clichéd orchestra music. The soundtrack truly showcases even to the casual fan that Queen's Brain May is perhaps one of the greatest to ever pick up the ax.Where the special effects are dated, they aren't as downright laughable as the feeble special effects in Clash of the Titians (1981). However, if one longs for the good old days that laser blast from a space vessel made that "who-mp who-mp who-mp" or zapping sound, this is your dream, whereas it seems that the majority of the special effects budget went to the laser effects.If you want a movie that's a great way to enjoy 90 minutes. One that's not overly preachy. One that is nothing more then a special effect showcase with a somewhat sensible plot tossed in, this film is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think most people who have seen this movie released it was a joke. I don't know if they meant it to be this way, but for me this movie looks like been done bad on purpose. And in this case, it works. The plot is thin, but extremely classic. Ming is fantastic fun to watch. Flash is over played, Yale is fall after 10 min in love with Flash, Dr Zar...Zargto... the smart guy is lovely crazy.If you don't get humor in this movie after 20 min, turn it off. But if you do get it, you gonna love it. This movie is made in the 80's, but made as it was in the 30's. If you are a sci fi fan, I say pick it up. I'm sure you gonna find it amusing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Campy, ludicrous update of the football hero turned swash-buckling space adventurer with gaudy sets, costumes, coloring and a Queen soundtrack.If you like your science fiction with light humor and a cast that knowingly mocks what's going on, then this is the film for you. The Queen soundtrack is fun to listen to, Sam J. Jones (no relation to Tommy Lee Jones) is pretty for the women but strangely sympathetic for the guys despite the goofiness going on around him. Two time 007 Timothy Dalton looks like an evil Clark Gable in an Errol Flynn costume, and manages to be a menacing secondary protagonist who possibly kills more bad guys than the title character himself. Max Von Sydow is kind of slumming in his role as the egg head shaped villain Ming the Merciless.Brian Blessed is pretty funny as Vultan of the Hawk people. Whoever that is playing Dale Arden is alright. Ornella Muti has the fine figure of a Bond girl. And to think this could have been a George Lucas movie...Good fun, especially when viewed late at night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A total BLAST!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As well as other users, I also watched FLASH GORDON when I was a kid (12 years old to be exact) and I enjoyed it very much. Even back then I knew that some of the Special Effects looked phony and rushed and that the acting wasn't anything to write home about, but overall, this 1980 remake of the famous comic hero is a total blast to watch. Sam Jones does a fine job as the reluctant football player-cum-savior of the universe. Max Von Sydow's personification of Ming The Merciless is totally awesome (who'd think this is the same guy who did the Exorcist!!!). Ornella Mutti as Princess Aura is just plain hot stuff. Melody Anderson, Topol, Timothy Dalton and Brian Blessed (who lend his voice to a CG character in PHANTOM MENACE) complete the cast with decent performances. And last but not least, the soundtrack by QUEEN totally ROCKS! Especially the end song, "HERO", we hear a QUEEN leaning more to their hard rock/Heavy Metal roots. This movie has to be re-released on DVD. It angers me to see so much trash being given DVD treatment, while other more worthy movies such as this, are left in oblivion. I still have my FLASH GORDON movie on Betamax! If you're looking for a cool movie to watch with your kids and for yourselves to enjoy, FLASH GORDON is the one. 9* out of 10*!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is remarkably well-paced and really fun to watch. It is full of color and the effects are rather good for this time as well. Good cast for the most part as well...Max Von Sydow is perfect as Ming. I don't think this one did super great at the box office though, and that may be in part to Sam Jones as Flash. I think he did a rather good job, but a bigger star may have helped its take at the theaters. The story has Flash as a quarterback flying with a gal. Ming has begun an attack on earth by making natural disasters pummel the earth with the finale being the moon crashing into the earth. The plane they are on crashes into this scientist's base. He has a rocket they use to go find out the cause of the disasters. Great scenes abound, as there is a great football scene, a cool swamp scene, and a great all out attack on a space cruiser. All in all this one is just a lot of fun to watch. On a side note there are also a lot of Bond connections. Timothy Dalton, of course played Bond, Max Von Sydow played the leader of spectar in "Never Say Never Again", and Topal was a Bond ally in "For Your Eyes Only".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is without a doubt one of the greatest sci-fi adventures to ever grace the silver screen and I make that statement without the slightest hint of sarcasm. The opening credits pretty much sum it up, this is a 30's comic book slicked up with an 80's soundtrack and it delivers just that. Sam Jones performance was just right I don't know if it was intentional but it works as does Melody Anderson's. Topol is always good as is Brian Blessed and Max Von Sydow. Timothy Dalton was magnificent as Barin and... I could go on and on about the performances. The soundtrack was freakin awesome. Some people remark on the cheesiness of the special effects and sets but that was the whole point! This is literaly a comic book played by live actors. Anyway, great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flash Gordon is simply the most amazing 2 hours of cinema ever to grace the screens of the world. Flash Gordon is THE premiere achievement of mankind as a whole. Flash is truly an American hero, even though his league stats are not so impressive (14,650 total yards, 117 TD, 43 INT with the world champion 1980-82 New York Jets, which he played on for 14 seasons). Flash is the epitome of America and the second coming of such greats as Abe Lincoln and Jesus. He is a collosus that cannot be toppled and a true hero. We can only pray that with his poor movie rating (5.7), he will not be angered and strike us down."Thou shalt not worship false idols (except Flash Gordon)" Note: The last part is smudged on the actual tablets.In the future, it is the supreme wish that Flash Gordon/Jesus will come again...Maurice Palignon, King of India</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who the hell approved this project? What a nightmare! Never before has such an easy concept been so totally botched. Star quarterback Sam J. Jones boards a private jet with squeamish travel agent Melody Anderson. Turbulent weather sends them crashing into the greenhouse of mad scientist Topol, who shanghais them into his rocket. On the moon, our heroes find themselves before the very evil emperor Max von Sydow in what must have been the lowest point in his career. Sexy daughter Ornella Muti takes an interest in Jones so she arranges to foil her dad's plans, after which she takes him to her pleasure planet, ruled by fey Timothy Dalton. Anderson flees lecherous von Sydow with Topol, reconvening through a series of unlikely events with Jones on a barbarian craft run by hirsute Brian Blessed. From here, the revolution takes over the story and we're treated to a tedious stream of battles and celebrations. Like many bad big budget pictures, the opening credits - a well-done cartoon panel montage - are Flash's strongest point. From there, it's all downhill. Lorenzo Semple Jr. (who did an excellent job with The Parallax View) and Michael Allin's poorly written dialogue receives yet worse delivery; original Flash creator Alex Raymond died in 1956 and so wasn't around to wince at their script. Flash also boasts some of the least impressive special effects from the last quarter of the 20th century. Don't let the apparent abundance fool you; under any degree of scrutiny, they look rotten beyond rotten's wildest dreams. Danilo Donati's sets and costumes do have something to recommend them, but they mostly get lost in the surrounding nonsense. Some of the battles are surprisingly violent for a PG-rated movie based on a comic strip. A film like this could only be scored by slick long hair howlers Queen, which makes sense in context but would be truly horrifying if hear otherwise. Earlier in Jones's career he appeared as a Playgirl centerfold, and probably impressed far more people with his work therein. In sum: this is some dumb doo-doo. You might as well re-watch Flesh Gordon instead. Rocky Horror Show creator Richard O'Brien shows up as a pal of Dalton's. Cinematographer Gilbert Taylor also worked with Kubrick, Hitchcock, Lester and Polanski and must have been suitably unimpressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film will change your life. In the early 80's, audiences left cinemas in a state of shock, unable to cope with their daily lives having been exposed to the vision of this film.Taking the seemingly unpromising pulp 30's serials as its starting point this film weaves an elaborate web of plot, counter-plot, intrigue, deception and betrayal - most of this lost on the "average" viewer. It is of course an example of cinema as Opera (in the true Wagnerian sense) with Queen's landmark soundtrack - notably making a sly nod to their influence with their rendering of his wedding march from Lohengrin.This film contains some of the most emotionally stripped-bare performances ever committed to film. It is so rare that a director finds actors so devoted to his vision. It is a genuine ensemble piece, with each element enhancing and complementing the others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can quite understand the relatively low score this film has on IMDb. From almost every logical and dispassionate level of movie analysis, this film should probably score a "2/10". And yet, in a way that defies analysis, I do not hesitate to give it an 8, and I understand those who unashamedly give it 10/10.The common media conception seems to be that this movie is a "badly scripted, awfully acted, saved but dated by its sound-track" affair that is only like by "childish" people. "Childish" in this context used absolutely in its derogatory form.I agree with the analysis except the "Childish" part. Rather it inspires in me a child-like joy, makes me feel like an 8-year old in a very good way. That ability in a film is worth its weight in gold. And I pity the adults around who simply cannot find in themselves a way to relax their critical facilities and just get submerged in the naive and innocent joy of the film. Perhaps this is the sort of adult who sends their children to boarding school?Of course, every now and again the adult in me wishes that the script had been written by somebody who had actually got through puberty. But then I quickly stop myself: if the script was fixed, what would I quote? This film is packed full of more quotable gems than any other film in history. And I mean that!"Gordon's alive!?" (bellowed at a decibel level only achievable by Brian Blessed) "Go! Flash! Go" "Flash, Flash I love you, but we only have fourteen hours to save the Earth!" "This Ming is a Psycho!" "No! Not the Bore Worms!" "I'm a New York City girl. It's a little too quiet around here for me." "Klytus! Are your men on the right pills? Maybe you should execute their trainer!"It just goes on and on.

		<fullReview>In an alternative universe, George Lucas snapped up the rights to 'Flash Gordon', and praised God he didn't have to rely on his fallback option: directing a mere homage to it. In another alternative universe, only very slightly removed from our own, Dino De Laurentiis bought the rights, 'Dune' novelist Frank Herbert co-wrote the screenplay and Nicolas Roeg added it to his directors CV. In yet a third alternative universe, De Laurentiis replaced Roeg at the last minute with Mike Hodges, a director previously known for gritty crime thrillers like Get Carter. Ah, hang on, that did happen.If Roeg, according to the producer, had attempted to make "Shakespeare out of a comic book," Hodges proved the perfect director - despite serious misgivings: poor optical effects, a novice frontman, an Italian designer who spoke no English, and costumes you could hardly move in. As Melody Anderson (Dale Arden) said later, "It wasn't an actor's picture. It was a special effects picture." And all the better for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To really enjoy this film you should be a fan of Buster Crabbe's serials from the 1930's, especially, and I mean especially the first. The second was fair and the third was sort of boring, but I digress.This may pay homage to the original comic page strips, but it's also obvious that it pays a lot of respect to the first serial. Except this has so much color as to be almost overwhelming. And for most of the characters, they have so completely made them over the top, but that's exactly how most of us fans of the original would remember them. Well, except for Prince Barin, who here is played far more dashing than the poor miscast actor in the original (overweight and balding just doesn't cut it even if his acting was adequate).I would have liked to see the sharkmen instead of the treemen (who were in the second serial and were probably the most pathetic characters in that one) as well Thun and his Lionmen, but Vultan and his hawkmen more then make up for that loss.Enjoy it for what it is, a tribute to the original comic strip and original serial, Flash Gordon.</fullReview>

The Hawkmen boarding the war rocket to the background of Brian May's guitar going into overdrive was fantastic. So was the blastoff music and the football fight.The script was packed with power bombs. 'Forget it Ming, Dale's with me.' 'What do you mean Flash Gordon approaching.' 'Gordon's alive!'

		<shortDescription>Brian Blessed, I salute you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember first watching this film years ago with my brothers, when I was probably about 9 or 10. My brothers hated it, and slated it as an awful movie that would never again be shown in our house. It wasn't until 15 years later that I saw it again, and I do declare it is one of the best things I've ever seen.I think everyone can split films into two different sections; best films and favourite films. Whilst one may decide that the Usual Suspects is the best film ever made, you may not think it is your favourite film, as you cannot watch it over and over again. That is why Flash Gordon, whilst actually being a terribly made film with awful acting and a script that does not make any sense half the time, would fall into the category of favourite films.If you're not in the mood for thinking about plot twists, or if you're looking for a terrific comedy, look no further than Flash. Your sides will hurt with laughter from the randomness of the action going on, and some of the delicious lines. Most importantly, this film features Brian Blessed as the comic relief.I believe Brian Blessed did not have a script for this movie, they just pointed a camera at him and told him to start doing weird stuff. He is ridiculously over the top, in a style that only Brian Blessed can get away with. He's so loud that you have to adjust the television set for fear of going deaf, but without him the movie would be nothing. He spends most of the film running about laughing, and any time you cant hear him laughing, he is still smiling. Without a doubt, the happiest man in the world ever, and feeling like you are in his presence, his happiness is infectious.Nobody will quickly forget the classic delivery of "Gordon's alive?!" and the bizarre scene where he laughs for an uncomfortably length of time. "Ah well, who wants to live forever? hahahahahahahahaha DIIIIIIVVVVVEEEE!" What the hell was so funny about saying who wants to live forever? It is scenes like this (basically every scene Blessed is in) that make this difficult to rationalise if treating it like a real film, but at the same time these scenes make it worth watching for a roller-coaster ride of laughter, and tears of laughter, along the way.As always, I recommend watching this with a few beers, but when I watched it recently I was in a bad mood and stone cold sober, and it really brightened up my week. Nuff said really. Now "Give me the remote control" so I can rewind to the best bits of Brian laughing and eating grapes</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wacky, over-produced fiasco wants to be a pop-art version of the classic movie serial but pretty much falls flats save for some high energy Queen music on the soundtrack. Assembling a veritable United Nations of actors, director Mike Hodges enlists the likes of Timothy Dalton and Brian Blessed from England, Topol from Israel, Mariangelo Melato from Italy and Max von Sydow from Sweden. Saddled with the role of Flash is American Sam J. Jones, whose previous acting experience appears to have been a tiny role in 10. Jones is so wooden, it's tempting think the director wanted him that way on purpose as a way to emphasize the comic strip feel of the film. Melody Anderson is Dale Arden and she's not bad. She's full of pepper. Von Sydow fares well even if he is wearing the silliest make-up as Ming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flash Gordon is a little bit low budget like the winged creature scenes but it is still fun to watch. Timothy Dalton is in the film as a Prince. Because the words Tau ceti came into my mind it makes me wonder if there are any moonships of our Ki Et Human Moonfleet in that solar system 11 light years away. If so maybe they are mining metal there.The Queen song Flash Gordon is great. In 1980 I had an AM radio with a booster antenna and you could hear the song Flash Gordon on 3 or 4 AM stations on the dial at the same time in southern ontario. This included American stations. The actor playing Flash Gordon wasn't in a lot of other films. It is conceded that Flash Gordon was not a success at the box office. Obviously Star Wars episode 4 was the better Science Fiction film of its day.Check out Timothy Daltons other movies as well including the 007 Franchise.</fullReview>

The film, based on the popular comic strip, has Flash, Dale Arden (Melody Anderson)and Dr. Zarkov (Topol)racing to Mongo to stop Emperor Ming (Max Von Sydow)from destroying the Earth. You KNOW Earth will be spared, and Flash WILL save the day, but the film is interesting to watch. Surprising performances by Brian Blessed (As Prince Vultan)and Timothy Dalton (As Prince Barin).The music (By Queen)is cool, and the costumes are nice too. But it is Jones who brings the film down a bit. You really can't accept him as the hero type, only the object of lust for Dale and Princess Aura (Ornella Muti).Fun to watch, though.</fullReview>

There are great actors and great direction from director Mike Hodges who bring camp to the sci-fi genre. This film was produced by the late legendary producer Dino De Laurentiis who sadly passed away in 2010. I saw this movie decades ago and again on the new Blue-Ray 2010 DVD and it is the sharpest format version of the movie I have ever seen, I highly recommend the HD Blue-Ray DVD. Great interviews from the original screen writer and Alex Ross comic artist as well as the original first 1930's episode Flash Gordon serial in the DVD extras section.This movie was made to be CAMPY. If you enjoy campy films like the Rocky Horror Picture Show that never takes itself seriously with great rock music, fun lines, then this movie is for you. It was never meant to be a "serious sci-fi" film. If you want a serious sci-fi film go watch Avatar, Blade Runner or 2001. Breck Eisner is reported to be working on a 2013 version of Flash Gordon that is supposed to be a "non-campy" version so there is that film too if you are looking for serious sci-fi version of Flash Gordon.This film is adapted and stays true to the original Flash Gordon comic book serial of the 1930's. IMO the legendary actor, Max Von Sydow was the best actor in this 1980 Flash Gordon movie and the best actor to ever play Ming the Merciless!! Compare Sydow's acting performance to the actor Charles Middelton in the 1930's Flash Gordon serials and they are not even in the same universe (no pun intended)!! Not only does he play the character perfectly but his intro in the beginning is classic camp, as Ming decides to toy with Earth's destruction in the cross hairs with Queen rock music in the background!! Too many great scenes to mention!! There are a a ton of other who's who British "thespian" actors that do a fabulous job in the film. Just sit back enjoy the rock music and all the campy fun!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a wonderful comic book style design and color, it's light as a feather and surprisingly entertaining and Queen's score is similarly surprisingly accomplished (Mercury's camp and May's melodic talents prove to be the perfect match for the way the action is pitched) In retrospect the temptation to somehow match Star Wars visually would have been a great temptation at the time, but clearly De Laurentis and Hodges knew just how to treat the source material. Von Sydow's casting also seems to be a masterstroke..keeping Ming just that little bit more creepy than camp.Poor old Sam Jones' overdubbed voice is a bit obvious..but that's the funny thing about this film, everything wrong with it kind of just makes it that little bit better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When American football star Flash Gordon meets Dale Arden on a flight to God knows where, they encounter a meteor shower and crash into the greenhouse of a mad scientist who thinks that clouds going in front of the sun is an eclipse, the mad old man seems friendly but then kidnaps them, overpowers an American football player and takes them to Mongo to battle with the evil forces of Ming the merciless.This film is an underrated gem because it genuinely is a case of a film that's so bad it's good. Every time I watch this film I spot something new and appalling about it. The script as you can tell from my initial synopsis above is abysmal with a variety of terrible lines that are quotable at any and every occasion "No not the Bore worms!" and "Gordon's alive!" being the most memorable but their are plenty of others. The acting is an unbelievable concoction of over the top performances by both Topol and Brian Blessed, to understated seriousness by the fantastic Tim Dalton and Max Von Sydow, to the truly bizarre by Ornella Muti and Sam J.Jones.For anyone thinking of watching this please savour every delicious terrible moment as their is so much to see that's terrible and funny, but ultimately terribly funny.and remember, when entering a structure that's shaped like a rocket that looks like a rocket, and is pointing at the stars like a rocket, always ask "Where's the telephone?"</fullReview>

The cast is filled with talented actors like Brian Blessed, Timmothy Dalotn, Richard O'Brien, Max Van Sydow, with Sam Jones and Melody Anderson in the leading roles of Flash Gordon and Dale Arden. This is a must see for any comic book, sci-fi, 80's camp movie fan.As a fan have you wondered why Sam and Melody never had a commentary track on the special edition DVD? Well now they do!

I love the soundtrack by Queen, it's cheesy as well (I'm still looking for a copy of it on CD, imagine awhole album filled with Bohemian Rhapsody type music). Max Von Sydow(Ming the Merciless) and Topol (the Professor) are really slumming itin this film. What are they doing in this Camp Classic? Timothy Daltonsports a semi-pornstache and Sam Jones looks like Reb Brown's long lostbrother. The rugby game between Flash and Ming's guards is thehighlight of the film. Watch Flash play "keep Away" with an object thatresembles a large Faberge Egg. When I saw the credits I couldn'tbelieve that the Director of Get Carter made this film.Recommended.BBy the way, Ming's daughter is smoking hot!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is another childhood gem of mine, I got into this film when I was into the animated show "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe" at the time I never even heard about the comic book series "Flash Gordon". Watching this film I was just blown away and it was easy to see why this comic series was so popular, as it has just this rich mythology and has set the standard for the space opera subgenere as it's pulp sci-fi style has been echoed in "Star Wars", "Guardians of the Galexy", "He-Man", comic series "Saga" you name it "Flash Gordon" still lives on to this day.I really like the dialog, there are a lot of memorable and colorful lines, it's almost like some of the kind of dialog you would sometimes hear in the TV shows "The Tick" or even the 60's "Batman". Some of what they say can be so deliciously bad that it really makes you both laugh and groan at the same time, it fits with the kind of feel this film is getting at where you don't things completely seriously as this film is more concerned about having fun.I like the characters it's true that their not exactly deep characters but characters in the pulp comics at the time were never really three dimensional they were really more just there to serve their functions which is exactly what they are but do it well all the same.Timathy Dalton one of my favorite actors is solid as Prince Baron, he's basically a Robin Hood like protagonist. Brian Blesed is just excellent as Vultan whom was one of my favorite characters in the comic, I just love how he's tough but he has sort of this playful nature and cheerful and mischievous energy to him. This character is my favorite in this film as he has some of the best lines and deliver of them.The actress that plays Princess Aura is hot, I actually had a crush on her when I was a kid, she has both physicality and persona to boot; she is another favorite character in the comics as she has a interesting character arc. She's not evil just naive, a bit spoiled and blind to her father's actions; once things go south for her she does what is right for both herself and others, in a way the arc is sort of a coming of age tale.Max Von Zetow one of my favorite actors is great as Ming the Merceless, from the look of him which is perfect as if he came straight out of the comics but also just persona wise as he is the classic villain archetype that is terribly and colorfully vein and cruel. He motives are rather simple and shallow yet blackly funny as he just wants to destroy Earth out of sick amusement because he's simply bored.Even like the subordinate villain Klitus whom is played by Peter Winsagarde whom I remember from the TV show "The Prisoner" which is cool since that's one of my favorite shows. But I really like the mask he wears as he literally looks like Doctor Doom from "The Fantastic Four" comics and his voice just fits like a glove as it just conveys cold sophistication and cruelty.However this film just like in the original comic series we're all really in it for the adventure and that's exactly what this film delivers to us excapeous fun. It's all really style over toping substance and this film has tons of that.The production value is just excellent because everything is practical from the set pieces, effects, costumes you name it. It's also no doubt one of the most colorful films ever as this film is just vibrant with it as much as the film "Sin City". It perfectly captured part of the broad universe of Mongo from the buildings, different planets, technology, ships you name it it's all there you have to just see to believe.And there is some solid action, from one of my favorite one on one battles on a moving and boobytraped platform. The tree beast test which is basically Russian roulette, that always kept me on the edge of my seat. And the big raid on the sky ajack one of my favorite battles of all time which was awesome it was pretty much a swashbuckler battle with all the hawk men swooping in, laser guns and cannons bursting left and right and that music.Of course my very favorite thing about the film is the music, this film is one of my favorite scores/soundtracks of all time composed by one of my favorite bands "Queen". Some say this film is sort of a rock opera and it sort of is as their music truly plays a big part throughout the film. From the big battle at the end which was just exciting and got me pumped down to that theme song which is one of my favorite themes of all time as it just has that exciting, adventurous and epic tune to it.The only bad thing to me was that this film didn't become a franchise which was too bad, I would of loved to of seen Flash and company go on another adventure that way we could see more of the Mongo universe as well as other aliens like the fan favorite "The Lion Men" whom unfortunately were M.I.A. in this film. May'be if they do a revival movie or TV show (a good one) we'll have those things.If your a fan of the comic series or just a fan of sci-fi then this film is worth a ride. Flash Gordon is a blast.Rating: 3 and a half stars</fullReview>

A bit like the Italian version of Sharon Stone, with her mystique elegance, and her cat eyes. Somehow this movie, even though it seeming a bit corny and outdated in today's computerized universe, it still seems to stand its own. In its day, this movie was the party film of the 1980's Rock scene, which has its own place in everybody's heart, that remembers those days of the crazy colorful 80's. With the classic wonderful music by Queen, and the powerful voice of Freddie Mercury, this film will always remain as one of those 1980's classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flash Gordon is about a quarterback named Flash Gordon who accidentally ends up in the planet Mongo and must fight the evil Emperor Ming. This film is just an entertaining,silly cheesy,movie. Sam Jones in the lead is mediocre. You could tell that he didn't really give his best in the role. Max Von Sydow is great in this movie. He gave a great performance with the script he was given and he did try his best to be threatening villain. The rest of the supporting cast is fine, but nobody else gave a performance that was amazing. The music by Queen also helps in making the film an enjoyable time. If it wasn't for the great music it would probably have been worse. The dialog in this movie is as cheesy as dialog can get,but this coming from the guy who wrote Batman: The Movie(1966) it is expected. The director Mike Hodges did a good job of making it feel like a Sci-Fi B-movie and that works. Also, for film from 30 years ago the effects aren't that bad though the do sometimes look like Star Wars rip-offs. I give this movie 10 out of 10 it is not perfect but definitely not perfect but it is just very enjoyable.I do recommend it if you like B-movies or Sci-Fi</fullReview>

There's one actor who could've been chosen because was very look like old Larry Buster Crabbe (who hated dying his hair blonde) of the serials: Joseph Bottoms but now he's too old. In one link he appears shooting a laser gun in Walt Disney's Black Hole playing lieutenant Prize or something. Is it possible to write links here for you to check photos? In any case search in this very "imdb" for Joseph Bottoms and Buster Crabbe. Can you imagine using animatronics or machine head &amp; make up for lizard man, ape-men, clay men, gorillas with horns, hawk-men or the creation of sudden helmets (with wings)and armors like Roman style and Egyptian headdress with the special effects of Stargate original film or the armor of Matt LeBlanc in Lost in Space?

		<fullReview>This film is one final glorious celebration of the 'Rock 'n' Roll Renaissance' of the preceding fifteen years. Utterly devoid of such dull things as 'substance', 'plot' and that most unappealing of values, 'credibility', 'Flash Gordon' is a long-form rock video loosely based around the story of a professional footballer who rescues a far distant galaxy from the tyranny of an evil overlord.What one can see of the performances beyond the fantastic sets and imaginatively sexy costumes is entirely adequate and in some cases, superb. Peter Wyngarde (of 'Jason King' fame) who plays 'Klytus' the masked lieutenant of 'Ming the Merciless' is brilliant as is Brian Blessed. Both Ornella Muti and Melody Anderson are completely alluring and whole thing has a kind of cocaine charged sex appeal to it.Talking of cocaine, Queen provide what is simply the greatest ever score for a science fiction movie. With thundering drums and heroically strident guitar and even little bursts of Freddie Mercury's remarkable voice the music in this film is almost it's raison d'etre.After recently watching this film again I was struck with how much more entertaining it is than 'Star Wars'. Despite the fact that Sam Jones is dubbed (possibly with his own voice) he gives a much more convincing performance than Mark Hammil and all aspects of the design show that a greater imagination is at work. Of course 'Flash Gordon' wouldn't have been made if 'Star Wars' hadn't been such a smash hit and it would be impossible not to acknowledge the earlier film's originality and technical superiority. However I can't help feeling that all the fun is to be found in 'Flash Gordon'.Flash! Aa-ah! He's A Miracle!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flash Gordon Was Unexpectedly So Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flash Gordon is a science fiction film that was based on the comic strip of the same title created by Alex Raymond.It stars Sam Jones in the title role as Flash Gordon together with Melody Anderson, Topol, Max von Sydow, Timothy Dalton, Brian Blessed and Ornella Muti.The story was basically about the mission of Flash Gordon to stop the evil scheme of Emperor Ming The Merciless into conquering the world and has struggles in doing so during the process.Despite its somewhat simplistic story,it happens to still remain notable at present with the soundtrack performed by the legendary rock band Queen particularly the theme song entitled "Flash".The science fiction film is basically a campy and adventurous film that was definitely made for fun.Lorenzo Semple's screenplay is similar to the Batman series during the 60's that starred Adam West that it was full of goof and laughably bad without probably the intention of doing so.It maybe considered to be in the category of films like Cocktail that is was so bad yet it came out good in the process that one will definitely enjoy and get entertained by it.A guilty pleasure indeed.Overall,it has charm and appeal that it was able to overcome its silly,empty and ridiculous plot especially with a hero Flash Gordon,an ex-football player and his gang of groupies saving the world from an evil emperor.It was so bad that made it so good to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant rubbish, but brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched the movie for the first (2014), and not the last time, and I *think* I really enjoyed it. Let me try to explain.There were moments when it seemed like the movie was trying to impress and wrap you up in its other-worldliness, and they often worked well, like the green jungle/swamp scenes. Then it would suddenly switch to really duff scenes, e.g. the hawkmen flying en masse, and not one of the little black things seemed to move, resulting in a swarm of cigarette ash over the top right part of the screen. The flying scenes, spaceships and all, were cringeworthy. But then you laugh, because it's meant to be an animated (with humans) comic.Thing is, I would be getting into the comic atmosphere, then it would get more movie-like, and I wasn't sure if I should laugh or die. The script was funny (the clichés) and sometimes hilarious (the total lack of respect for life), but it often fell flat and made me go yuckkk when it was too predictable, and that's not good comedy. Nor is it serious. Just iffy.Overall, I enjoyed it, and I will be watching it again with a couple of friends, when we can point things out and laugh or just comment. However, I cannot imagine for the life of me why anyone would fancy the heroine with the fat face. Dog-like, as in a boxer. Still, good movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one 80's flick that does NOT need a remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of this movie plays out as if you asked a 1979 George Lucas to write down a sequel to Star Wars, but handed him the suitcase of drugs from "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" in addition to a pen. Full of ludicrously awesome moments (such as Flash griping the command chair of a ship surrounded by burning controls as Queen chants "King of THE IMPOSSIBLE!!!"). William Bushey's review perfectly surmises the music as "Permanently freezing the movie in 1980", with Queen's amazing soundtrack delivering perfect exclamation marks to scenes. You definitely want your speakers turned up for this film. Although the rear-screen projection effects look dated in some scenes, the special effects have held up well enough for 33 years, with the laser effects looking crisp and bright, scenes filmed with miniatures seem to help ground the movie in it's comic book origins, as does the opening credits featuring the original comic. This 1980 classic not only captures the spirit of the original, but is filled with the perfect amount of campy moments that firmly ground the movie in the 1980s, much to the film's benefit. Any remake will not do this film justice. A remake may be a good film in its own right, but will never capture the 1980s energy that fills this movie to the brim. Without Queen's soundtrack to back it up, or the miniatures to help ground it in the comic I highly doubt a modern remake (which will eventually be made) will be able to capture the tone of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>5 years ago, if you asked me who Flash Gordon was I would stare at you with squinted eyes and a puzzled look. A long time ago, I had this sci-fi phase and I came across the comic strip of Flash Gordon and eventually the movie. When I went to my uncle's apartment, I stumbled across it and I loved it as a kid. Now my dad bought it from Wal-mart with three other films and I feel in love with it all over again.Flash Gordon is to Star Wars as the Avengers is to The Dark Knight series. Flash Gordon is comic booky, creative, visually engaging, and just full of eye candy. It doesn't make you feel like this is taking place in real life, instead it transports you to the world of the comic strip. it's not here to be realistic, it's here to entertain.It's not Shakespeare but it sure is entertaining. If you want a semi-cheesy love story mixed in with science fiction, action &amp; cool sets then this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Flash Gordon" is a outrageously campy science fiction adaption of Alex Raymond's original character that followed in the footsteps of Buck Rogers back in the 1930s. Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis blew a reported $27 million on this epic that cast a relatively unknown Sam J. Jones as the lead and paired him up with another unknown Melody Anderson. Nothing about this 111 minute saga is remotely believable but this is what makes it so much fun. When it was produced, "Flash Gordon" boasts what was considered state-of-the-art special effects. Unlike "Star Wars," a franchise that took itself fairly serious, "Flash Gordon" is nothing of the sort. The chief problem with this extravaganza is the lack of charisma that Sam J. Jones and Melody Anderson never generate. Meantime, outstanding actors like Timothy Dalton, Max von Sydow, Brian Blessed, Topol, and other too numerous to name provided rock solid support. Dalton is as appropriately heroic as von Sydow is villainous. Brian Blessed delivers his every line with gusto, while Topol is amusing as Dr. Hans Zarhov. Although he wears a mask, Peter Wyngarde registers well as Ming the Merciless' second-in-command. The entire supporting cast overshadows our callow hero and heroine. Long time Fellini collaborator Danilo Donati surrounds everybody with his brilliant, often imaginative production and set designs making "Flash Gordon" a treat for the eyes. Add to all of these virtues the soundtrack that the rock band Queen contributed with Howard Blake's atmospheric orchestral score. The cult status of "Flash Gordon" was solidified recently with the use of it in Seth MacFarlane's "Ted" about a potty-mouthed toy bear and his childhood pal who grew up watching director Michael Hodges' adventure yarn. Some of the fun things to watch for are the wood beast who lived in a giant tree stump and hand-to-hand, close-quarters fight on an unstable saucer. The dialogue is good as is "Star Wars" lenser Gil Taylor's colorful cinematography.</fullReview>

All I was told was that it was really camp.The film was bad... the effects were bad... the acting was bad... the costumes were bad... but that is what makes the movie great! I loved it... it was so cheesy.Flash Gordon is played by Sam J. Jones... Wow... he is a terrible actor. But he played Flash so perfectly. All the flying things were on strings, and the strings were so visible they might as well have used ropes. Haha! The whole thing looked like it was made on a very cheap set. I was waiting for the walls to fall down.But, if the film was made with decent effects and good actors, I would not have liked it as much as I did. All the bad effects and acting made this film. It would not work if it actually looked good. This whole film is tongue in cheek and doesn't really take itself seriously, which I like.It is very funny and honestly so entertaining. It reminded me in a way of a worst version of Masters of the Universe. Do you remember that one? It had Dolph Lundgren in it. I loved that too.It also has a good soundtrack. Queen did the score for this movie and even released an album with the songs on it from the movie. I am a Queen fan so that just made this film even better still. I have heard the song Flash so many times. It was a bit weird hearing some quotes that I know from the song being said in the movie. But it was awesome!If you have not seen Flash Gordon and you like the feel of 70's and 80's movies, then watch it. You won't be disappointed.I will give it 7 out of 10.Fore more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

Jones) are visiting Dr. Zarkov (Topol), a scientist studying strange weather patterns, they are transported to the planet Mungo.Ruled by Ming the Merciless (Max von Sydow), Flash soon finds himself at odds with the dictator, who is plotting Earth's demise.To overthrow the oppressor, Flash aligns himself with the planet's feuding kingdoms: Prince Barin of Arboria (Timothy Dalton) and Sky City's Hawkmen.A 1980s version of Alex Raymond's 1930 comic strip, this update of the space opera comes equipped with flashy effects, pulp plot lines and a score by Queen.Besides, what's more patriotic than convincing two warring factions to oust an autocrat for America's benefit?

		<shortDescription>Unlikely football star turned hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot to Flash Gordon is very simple, "kill the bad guy, save the world and get the girl." The hero of the story is Mr. Flash Gordon himself played by Sam Jones. The "girl" is Ms. Dale Arden played by Melody Andersen. The most notable of other characters are the evil Emperor Ming played by Max Von Sydow and Dr. Hans Zarkov played by Topol.The focus of Flash Gordon is definitely on plot. I found it difficult to come to this conclusion because this film could have easily been a focus on character. It is not, though, because there is very little character development. The overall theme to this movie is teamwork and standing up to oppression. And who better to lead a movie toward teamwork than a main character who is a New York Jets star quarterback?The races of Mongo, the planet ruled by Emperor Ming, are always in conflict. This is merely to please the Emperor as he states in the film. While it is true that these races both hate and despise each other they also dislike the Emperor just as much, if not more. Enter Flash Gordon. Through his encounters with the major races, the Arboreans and Hawkmen, Flash manages to make them stop fighting each other.Just like in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, the Arboreans and Hawkmen band together with Flash against their common enemy. Other parallels I see are that the Arboreans closely resemble the elves and the Hawkmen closely resemble the giant eagles of Lord of the Rings. The most impressive part of this film is where the Hawkmen descend upon an enemy rocket-ship to an epic rock ballad.The best thing about this film is the music. I must state that the music of the film and the actual sounds and effects are two very different elements. The music, done by Queen, greatly adds to the emotional impact and atmosphere of the scenes. The sounds and effects are unfortunately repetitive and artificial.The amazingly colorful backgrounds and overall use of colors in this film are also noteworthy. The backgrounds are like liquid paintings; pools of color jumping right off of the screen. The costumes of the different races of Mongo are both colorful and extravagant. These elements help to suggest to the viewer that Flash is really in some fantastic world trying to save our own.The absolute embodiment of the theme of teamwork is apparent in the final scenes of Flash Gordon. The collective races of Mongo are gathered on a balcony cheering and thanking Flash Gordon for saving them from the Emperor. Flash has killed the bad guy, saved the world, and gotten the girl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flash Gordon's Alive! and doing well 30 years on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flash Gordon, definitely a film out of its time. When it was released in the wake of Star Wars era, it didn't do well. Looking dated in comparison. Of course now looking at it 30 years later it is one of the great joys of 80s cinema. The film hasn't really aged, it is over the top with, dodgy looking special effects and a campness which couldn't be done today. Whilst this was completely lost on a 9 year old at the time who had been wowed by Star Wars, as a 39 year old I appreciate the film more every time I see it. The acting is over top in the extreme but it works. The Plot and script silly but fun, the effects and design all dated, even in 1980 feel inspired watching today. Of course what has always stood out with the film was Queens music, which I did love then and it still brings a smile to my face.This film shouldn't be looked at and compared with other films of the same era but with those of the 30's and 50's. It is a wonderful film which has stood the time of age and blossomed into a fine wine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad at all, but it is nor really for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Flash Gordon now for the very first time in my life. In every "geek-comedy" series there are some jokes about Flash, so I MUST try it. And I think -- i is not bad film,at all. But something is too much even for me. But I recommend to everyone who likes The Big Bang Theory or similar series right this movie, it is half-comedy, half-action... half-whatever, but it is fine, old, psychedelic and I think a little of its own way very absurd. ;)About characters -- they are obvious, schematic and archetypal. Badass is bad-ass and looks like bad-ass, good one looks like Ashtar Sheran (or what is that Universe-people guy name ;)), girl looks like model, Badass's daughter is nice, cold and at the very end she cries. Next I've noticed were almost theathral actors-work. Like some kind of musical, I think.I know, it is remake of comics story (which I do not know at all), so I know people who loves it will give +2 points just because it. After all, I think it is fine movie, funny and I think it is needed to be seen ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to review Flash Gordon without saying "trashy", "camp" or "tounge in cheek" but they sum up the film perfectly. What comes across when watching is the love that went into it: the amazing design, sets, spaceships and of course costumes. The vivid colours and skies are stunning. OK, the special effects may not be photo realistic or even half convincing, but they suit the film and add to the comic book feel. The cast is also fantastic, people knock Sam jones but again, his (famously dubbed) performance seems to suit the film. Max von Sydow has great fun with Ming, while Brian Blessed as Vultan steals the film. And Ornella Muti is just the sexiest woman alive. Finally mention must go to both Queen and Howard Blake for the score, again just brilliant. See this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boasting one of the best scores in movie history, this film is great. In all its colorful cheesy delight. I recently purchased this film on dvd and had not seen it since I was a child. At that time I would watch it over and over again. And seeing it now, not only brings back those thoughts from childhood, but several new ones. This film is not meant to be a serious space war epic. It wasn't created to mock those movies either, like Space Balls. It was created to entertain, to make light of an underused genre in film. It wasn't intended to impress, which makes it impressive. I, for one, love this film, and will continue to watch it over and over again. Not only because of my throws to childhood, but because of all the new subtle comical invention, and poetic freedom that bleeds from this great film. I'm off once more to planet Mongo.</fullReview>

Ok here's what he said(PLEASE NOTE THIS IS JUST A SONY WISH LIST NOT SET IN STONE) Brad Pitt = Flash Gordon / Charlize Theron = Dale Arden / Mila Jovovitch = Princess Aura / John Malkovitch = Ming / Gary Oldman = Dr. Hans Zarkov He said David Fincher and George Clooney(he likes crazy movies) are producing. That is all the info I know and will put more up when it comes out. I told him Piers Brosnan should be in it to take s stab at Timothy Dalton.

		<fullReview>I haven't seen FG in years, until I picked up the video the other day, and sat through it with a big grin on my face.Age has not been especially kind to this movie, and a Matrix or X-Men fan may wonder why this pantomime is so fondly remembered - with its cheap sets, even cheaper special effects, and bombastic Queen music.. ..but they're missing the point. Flash is the hero, Ming is merciless, the women are astonishingly sexy for a kids' film (I'd completely forgotten about Ming's daughter - Dear Lord!), Brian Blessed and Tim Dalton are made for their roles, the costumes are a riot, and for a cartoony sort of film, it's surprisingly violent/graphic in places - I have strong childhood memories of the scary tree-stump monster, and the grisly deaths of Ming's second-and-third-in-command.It also led to a top-notch Breakfast TV cartoon serial, which I also have dim-but-fond memories of.Another IMDB comment mentions that FG works because it takes itself seriously - and that's exactly right. No matter how silly it gets, the characters carry on regardless. It does look a bit dated sure, but it's also tremendous fun. Surely someone in Hollywood is just waiting to remake it with 21st Century effects - so see the original while you can.</fullReview>

It's good to know that he hasn't gotten any better after a 30 odd year absence from the screen, big or small.

		<fullReview>If this movie had been made today it would be done with perfect special effects, excellent set design, and the latest trendy music, and probably wouldn't resemble the original Flash Gordon except in name.The people who made this movie seemed to realize that the original Flash Gordon was pretty darn hokey, and as this was 1980 if they tried to make it something serious it'd be called another bad Star Wars clone.So they instead made Flash pretty much as he came out of the serials, bad costumes and all, with only enough changes to update it to the present. The attitudes about sex and the flashiness are very much seventies, as is the slightly gauzy look in several of the scenes. The background cloud scenes all over Mongo actually look pretty good, even if everything floating in front of them is phony as hell.The result is one god awful bad film, but done just tongue in cheek enough for people to have fun with it. Matter of fact I think the producers probably knew people wouldn't be overwhelmed with it and played it straight, which is a shame because if they'd put some passion and taken it over the top it could have actually been pretty good. As maybe a "Airplane"/Coen brothers satire comedy they could have really had something. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best: A Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid, I loved the old Flash Gordon comic strip and ate up the reruns of the serial with Buster Crabbe as Flash while in high school. Hence, when I got to see this film with the fantastic cast, it became an instant favorite of mine. Some of the comments herein are most interesting and the one that prompted me to add mine was that this film had all the elements of a cult classic-- but, the reviewer adds, it didn't make it. I must disagree strongly with that statement. This film IS a cult classic, as it were and is still a delight to watch after dozens of viewing. I mean, how many films can you name wherein the supporting cast are more well known than the principals? Sam Jones and Melody Anderson have done little else but look at the likes of Max Von Sydow (a magnificent Ming), Timothy Dalton (a bastardly Barin), Ornella Muti (a auroric Aura), Topol (a zany Zarkov), Brian Blessed (a vultureous Vultan), Peter Wyngarde (a Klingonesque Klytus) and Mariangela Melato (a kissable Kala)... were they great??? You bet! This is unquestionably a cult classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Flash Gordon" is a big budget science fiction fantasy that is completely enjoyable. I saw this movie when I was 11 years old, and I remember coming out of the theater and telling my parents how great it was. As an adult, I still find it a lot of fun. The movie is intentionally very campy and unrealistic. It is a homage to those 1930's serials that starred Buster Crabbe. It's not in the same league as "Star Wars", but it was not intended to be. "Flash Gordon" is less concerned with meticulous special effects and more concerned with characters in the story. I personally enjoyed that. Don't get me wrong though, there is plenty of action, colorful costumes, classic dialogue, and elaborate sets. The movie is well paced with no lulls in the story. Sam Jones as Flash is weak, but the rest of the cast is superb. There are two stand out performances. Max Von Sydow is a formidable Ming the Merciless and Ornella Muti is perfect as the alluring Princess Aura. Overall, a real treat if you want some fun entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flash Gordon Approaching!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I simply love this movie, it brings back so many memories not only of my childhood but also of one of my favourite childhood rock bands, Queen, who happened to have done the soundtrack. The movie itself is based upon a comic strip from the 1930s and was later made into a black and white television series that I remembered sitting down to watch every day before school (and this was back in the days before video recorders which meant that if you wanted to watch something you had to sit down then and there otherwise you would miss it).Anyway, Ming the Merciless is a galactic tyrant who travels around the universe on his planet Mongo playing games with less developed planets. However those planets that do pose as a threat he either enslaves or simply destroys. With regards to Earth, he begins by inflicting countless disasters on the planet, but when Dr Hans Zarkov, along with travel agent Dale Arden and pro-footballer Flash Gordon, manage to fly to Mongo on a rocketship, he decides that Earth is a little too dangerous so sets up on a plan of destroying Earth by crashing the moon into it.As mentioned, I have seen, a long time ago, the old black and white television series, where there is a scene where Mongo actually gets really close to the Earth, only to be diverted at the last minute (back in those days special effects were incredibly basic and were usually stop motion animation or simply models, and even then you can see that they are still using a lot of models at this time). However, in the series, the entire episode with the forest dwellers is actually set in the second series where Flash, Dale, and Zarkov travel to Mars.While this is not a movie that stands out on its special effects or any deep meaning behind the story, it is still a cult classic, even if it is only because of the soundtrack ('Flash Gordon approaching!', 'What do you mean Flash Gordon approaching!'). In fact half of the memorable lines are memorable because there were repeated on the Queen song of the last name (which was the third to last song on their Greatest Hits album, even though We Will Rock You, and We Are the Champions is technically one song because they are always, without fail, played together).Look, this is a typical modern Hollywood story with humanity in danger, and the danger is so great that if they fail that everybody is wiped out, and it all comes down to a single person to stand up and be a hero, in this case Flash Gordon. What is cool is that he is a pro-footballer, who are pretty much the heroes of the modern day, despite the fact that footballers never actually add anything to society, other than entertainment. What it does show is that not only is he a team player (very important in team sports) but he also has the ability to lead, another skill that is developed when playing sport. It is these two characteristics that make him a hero, as well as the willingness to put his life on the line. However, as we can expect, at the last possible moment, Earth is saved, and it all came down to the willingness of one man to stand up to a person that is little more than a big bully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a sci-fi family blockbuster directed by the chap who gave us the gritty '70s gangster movie Get Carter. Its two leads can't act at all and are barely engaging. The performances are completely uneven to the extent that actors seem to think they're in different films to each other: from plank-like (Sam Jones, Melody Anderson) to straight-faced and serious (Timothy Dalton), to so louche he should have a cocktail in his hand in every scene (Peter Wyndgarde) to barely directed and simply having fun (Brian Blessed) to jokey and slightly hammy (Topol), to pure ham (Mariangela Melato). After Star Wars and Alien had set a benchmark for sci-fi being a bit dark and grimy its like they threw all that out and decided that sci-fi should look polished, shiny and colourful. And the soundtrack is by Queen, with the preposterousness and pomp turned up to eleven.And yet it works, and it works stupendously well. Whilst this isn't my favourite film there are very, very few I enjoy quite as much as Flash Gordon. After a very dull first ten or so minutes involving the aforementioned unengaging leads taking a plane journey we meet Topol's Dr Hans Zarkov and the pace, and sense of fun, never lets up until the end. Its extraordinary stuff with so many memorable set-pieces: Ming's first on-screen appearance to Queen's menacing synth music, Flash's ludicrous game of "American Football" in Ming's throne room, the tree- stump monster, the whip battle on the tilting platform (with retracting spikes, naturally), the hawkmen attacking a rocketship. And so many brilliant, fun lines: "Flash, flash I love you but we only have fourteen hours to save the earth!", "Dispatch war rocket Ajax to brrring back his body!", "Gordon's alive?!!"Incredibly for a film with two such poor lead performances everyone else is brilliant. Topol is on great form as Zarkov bringing the charisma that worked so well in the Bond film For Your Eyes Only, Dalton plays the whole thing utterly straight as chiseled Prince Barrin, Blessed is essentially just playing himself but it would be half the film without him, Peter Wyngarde manages to give Klytus an air of upper-class menace from behind a metal mask and Max von Sydow portrays Emperor Ming so well that he manages to make an essentially 2D B-movie type villain into someone who comes across as complex and interesting.I hesitate to use phrases like "popcorn movie" or "leave your brain at the door" about Flash Gordon because that's doing it a massive injustice. This is a brilliant, funny, clever, outrageously camp and even slightly subversive film hiding in the most commercial of genres. We will never see its likes again and that's a shame.</fullReview>

To me it's up there with Blues Brothers as a cult classic and that is saying something. In some ways I think Flash himself isn't the main focus. My favourite actor by far is Brian Blessed, who grabs hold of his cheesy, gruff, spirited part as the strangely medieval yet big hearted leader of a space warrior clan and runs with it!! Closely followed by the guy playing Dr Hans Zarkov, whose brilliant character is the mad scientist whose paranoid conspiracy theory -- of the earth being invaded by mad aliens -- turns out to be true and who is willing to die to save it. The cinematography and effects are fantastic, and of course the music by Queen is outstanding -- rousing, daring and perfect for the task at hand. Yes, Flash Gordon is clunky, and corny, and badly acted at times. But hey, it is based on a cartoon. As others have said, don't analyse it, just enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flash Gordon is the pinnacle of a lost perception of movies. Today's generation have completely missed the point thanks in large to the current movie trend of gritty, dark and realistic. This has completely destroyed most peoples sense of suspension of disbelief and if it's not true, to life, tragic and 100% scientifically accurate then it must be bad.Flash Gordon is not true to life, it's not gritty or dark but it is still a wonderful piece of film. When I watch it it simply looks like a pantomime that has been filmed and that lost art of pure fantasy drama with the leads playing off of the most rubbish of props and sets and having a great time doing it.Special mention must go to the score by Queen which simply has to be one of the best and most memorable in film history. Some may not like it but they sure as hell know what it is.All in all It's a film of a comic book, and I certainly don't want my comic books to reflect real life, I get enough of that in real life.A fantastic tribute to the bizarre, the ridiculous and the outstandingly cheesy.Take your head out of your moody, meaning filled world and enjoy the adventure!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie strove for camp, and achieved it in glorious quantities.A take off on the Flash Gordon serials from decades earlier, we get a Flash who is too good to be true, which is perfect. A great supporting cast, including Timothy Dalton channeling Errol Flynn, makes for a fun romp through the worlds under the thumb of Ming the Merciless.The colors are gaudy and rich, the women sexy, the action heroic, and Ming is truly evil. What more could you ask for?!? LOL Special effect are also good, and designs are true to the serials. Too bad this film didn't make enough to spawn sequels. It wouldn't have been a series of high brow cinema, but it would have been great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 80's Sci-fi classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heroic football player Flash Gordon (Sam Jones) and his girlfriend Dale (Melody Anderson) were on their way to New York until their plane crash lands in the hidden labs of a Russian scientist (Topol). Dr. Zanvok sends himself and the two lovers on a rocket trip to the planet Mongo ruled by the evil Ming the Merciless (Max Von Sydow) who plans on destroying the girl, marrying Dale and rule the galaxy. Flash must try to rescue her by battling many goons, unite two kingdoms and is being seduced by a lovely princess (Ornella Muti).Fantastic and humorous Sci-fi fantasy comedy based on a classic 30's comic strip, produced by Dino De Laurentiis and his studio that faithfully brought the beloved hero to life on the big screen. Co-starring Timothy Daltan, Kenny Baker and Richard O'Brien, this is a delightful and colorful epic that i loved as a kid and still do. This movie has gained a cult following thanks to it's memorable soundtrack by Queen, quirkiness and entertainment value, i recommend this to fans of Sci-fi, fantasy and comic book fans for escapist fun.Also recommended: "The Fifth Element", "Heavy Metal", "Barberella", "Transformers (2007 and 1986)", "Star Wars Saga", "Star Trek Saga", "The Dark Crystal", "The Black Hole", "Men in Black", "Speed Racer", "Nausicca: Valley of the Winds", "Superman 1 &amp; 2", "Superman Returns", "Galaxy Quest", "Conan The Barbarian", "Highlander", "Dune (1984 and 2000)", "Children of Dune", "Zathura", "Killer Klowns from Outer Space", "Lifeforce", "Iron Man", "Tron", "Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai" and "Rock and Rule".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Camp '80s Sci-fi classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that people will either love or hate, if you think science fiction should be serious then this isn't for you, however if you enjoy a cheesy romp then this film is just the ticket.Ming the Merciless, Emperor of Mongo decides to unleash a variety of supposedly natural disasters upon the Earth. Having just survived a plane crash Flash Gordon and Dale Arden are kidnapped by Doctor Zarkov and flown in the rocket he has built to Mongo where they are promptly captured a and taken to Ming.When Flash fights against Ming's goons he is sentenced to be executed, Zarkov is to brainwashed before being enlisted in Ming's secret police and Dale is told she must marry Ming. Luckily for Flash Ming's kinky daughter helps revives him after the execution and takes him to a moon ruled by Prince Barin for safety but as soon as she leaves he plots to kill Flash. The rest of the film involves Flash rejoining his friends and trying to unite the various tribes of Mongo against Ming before he destroys the earth.Some sci-fi goes for the dark and gloomy look, others go for a sterile white look... this goes for over the top bright colours, plenty of red and gold. There is little subtlety in the excellent soundtrack either as it is provided by Queen. I saw this first as a child and loved it, however there are a few scenes that might bother younger children such as when a character is thrown onto a set of spikes and he seems to dissolve and his eyes bulge out of his mask.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second only to Rocky Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the annals of campy cinema, Flash Gordon is second only to the legendary Rocky Horror Picture Show (and Rocky Horror was actually self-consciously and deliberately made as trash, so it maybe shouldn't even be ranked first). Were they serious with this movie? Or did they start off serious and then by the end completely go off the reservation, decide to chuck it all and head to Camp Town? You can watch it a million times and never be sure. Just drink in the psychedelic skies, the awesome Queen soundtrack, the Wood Beast, the flying whips, Brian Blessed's all-devastating supremacy, Ornella Muti's hot spandexed ass, Timothy Dalton's spot-on Errol Flynn impression, the beefcake gayness of Sam Jones, the cheesy special effects and last but not least, the bore worms, and don't ask too many questions. Oh, and to all Flash Gordon haters: our love for this movie is one of the things that makes us... better than you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been having a tough couple of day and revisiting Flash Gordon, a favorite from my childhood, seemed like a good idea. After only five minutes, I was right back into it - as though I was five years old again.DiLaurentis' Flash is a nonstop blast, filled with tons of hokey effects, goofy dialog, and classic fantasy action. The performances are all over-the-top, but work perfectly, given the subject matter. Von Sydow hams it up as Ming, but keeps the tension strong. It was just as wonderful as it was all those years ago. I can't wait for the DVD edition to hit this Summer. I'm dying to hear Queen belt out the title song in surround sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the theater when this movie first came out. This was a military theater and the crowd was primarily military trainees. The entire place was cheering the hero (Gordon) and booing the bad guy (Ming). The score by Queen is nothing short of fantastic, after all Freddie Mercury was one of a kind. If you want Academy Award performances then you'll want to pass on this one (except maybe Muti and the bore worms scene). But if you want a couple hours of plain fun and entertainment, then this movie is worth a look. One of my favorites. Sam Jones is more than passable as the "not to bright" jock and our hero. Melody Anderson has eyes to die for and Ornella Muti has far more than that. Max Von Sydow is superior as the tyrant Ming the Mercilous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have purchased as many DVDs and VHS copies as needed for my big family as Christmas gifts. It will thrill all members from 4-104, so I know I can't go wrong. Neither can you! Don't miss this vintage character, Flash Gordon, in his 1980 spectacular update! It is sort of tongue-in-cheek ,perhaps , but certainly captures the original strip's far out sci-fi feeling,and visual impact-- and beyond Too bad I missed it on the big screen, it must have been smashing, but you too, will be very satisfied with a home video version. Whatever your age this is totally cool!The story concept contains many twists and turns, and the variety of evil doers are truly eye-popping. I particularly loved the "non-sophisticacation" of the film. I appreciated an absence of "Hollywood over-kill special effects". They managed to pull this film off with minimal bombing and ear-drum shattering sound effects! A must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tour de force of camp self-parody.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when it first came out but certainly didn't appreciate it at the time. A friend declared that it restored her faith in humanity. I couldn't quite get that out of it, but tolerated it's silliness for the sake of a "lesser" form of science fiction.Now I realise I just didn't get it. This movie is a superb send-up of it's own genre, the thirties to fifties sci-fi pulp comic. Not a parody. But a loving indulgence in the period eccentricities of the form. From the rockets that are literally ships for space ( "Prepare to repel boarders" ) to the contrived names alluding to a mis-located and paradoxical classicism. Such as Ajax and Hero.Another thing I realise that as a Laurentis production it may reasonably be considered in the same context as Barbarella, another comic adaptation. Indeed, it is visually very reminiscent of the earlier film. The armoured guards who "welcome" the Earthlings arriving on Mongo are reminiscent of the "Leathermen" who capture Barbarella when she lands on a planet with a very similar name. The Ming palace is a lot like the perverse capital city of the Barbarella world. They both serve as the setting for plentiful suggested perversions. It is quite amazing how much they managed to get into a "straight" mainstream movie. Certainly it must "go over the heads" of many viewers, it is so well disguised as part of the plot. But then, that was also true of those original old comics and pulp sci-fi covers! It only amazes me to think that much of it went "over" my head as a 20 year old, also!Wyngardes character is hilariously snooty behind his articulated gold mask. Apropriate in view of the actors fall from grace in the preceding years. Dalton is a great thirties style swash-buckler, a role in which he would later reappear in "Rocketeer". Von Sydow camps up his part superbly. Topol keeps babbling away down his nose, for some reason, as the hapless boffin who accidentally floors our hero in an early scene whilst only trying to help. And what can one say about Ornella Muti? She takes a mans words away! Maybe Blessed is a bit too operatic for my taste, but he does seem a worthy study in swarthiness ( and hairyness ) to contrast with everyone elses smooth suavery. Strangely, the weakest casting seems to be the two leads, whose faces I really cannot seem to place anywhere else.The design is dominated by the red satin that is epitomised in Muti's ABBA style trousers. With masses of silvery baubles and clunky electricals giving it a somewhat late-Seventies look. At times a bit like a kitsch night-club. But boosted to a monumental scale rendering it at the same time perversely grandiose. Strangely, the very rudimentary special-effects only add to the thirties crankiness that was so clearly intended. Most apparent in the comic-book flying machines. Look out for their special role at Ming's putative wedding to the Earthling who seems so worried about the binding implications of the exorbitant marriage vows!My one remaining gripe with this movie is that the music, otherwise well supplied by Queen, does in one scene bang on one note for really, absolutely ages ( just before the battle ) as it does in the title sequence with only barely more justification. This really irritated me the first time and it did also this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the greatest film adaptations of a comic ever put to screen for the simple fact that it never takes itself too seriously. Hodges maintains a whimsical tone without succumbing to the "madcap" trap as did many of the 60's flicks in the same genre. Conversely, it doesn't attempt the utter absurdity of going for stark serious in a film about a football hero who saves the universe. Flash Gordon remembers that it's a live- action cartoon and takes it as far as it can go. Ornella Muti portrays one of the sexiest humans ever. The rest of the cast, pulled right out of the royal Shakespeare company, elevate the film to an recent classic. Plainly, this flick rocks. Go Flash, go!</fullReview>

I admit that its a little cheezy, at first I dindnt now what it was and started channel flipping. Then I saw it or rather heard it "the names Flash 'Flash Gordon' my friends call me Flash..." I had heard this name all my life, being born in 1976 I was only 4 when it came out in theaters (1980). When I heard his name, something flashed in my mind "This is the Greatest Si-Fi ever created!" I had to see this. I have been inspired as an artist and writer ever since. anyone who doesn't like this film is a coward in heart. The special effects might have been lame, but the heart of the story is that "Flash Gordon" is a hero, and lets face it; "We all wish we could be hero's...but are we?"</fullReview>

It never fails to make me giggle.But the best performance of the movie came from "Lizard man" Why did they even bother having him in the movie? All he did was walk around for a split second, and have that weird hovering talking thing say "escape is impossible Lizard man" and zap him.

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Fantasy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typical of an early eighties movie, this film is a classic feel-good fantasy movie. Flash Gordon is a physically fit and handsome man with absolutely no military experience, yet somehow proficient with all kinds of both human and alien weaponry AND is insanely hard to kill. He is the hero of this movie and is a footballer who finds himself the unwilling captor of Dr. Zarkov. Earth has fallen foul to some rather unusual atmospheric anomalies, which is actually the work or Ming the Merciless, ruler of Planet Mongo, who is testing Earth to see if it may compromise his rule. He comes to the conclusion that it will, and plans to destroy it. No one on earth is aware of what lies ahead, and are becoming increasingly scared due to the fact that the eccentric scientist Dr. Zarkov, formally of NASA, is the only one who has provided any explanation, and naturally, everybody thinks he is mad, because he talks of aliens and warring planets. So he travels to Mongo on his experimental rocket, and Flash and Dale Arden (the heroine of the movie) end up on board due to an unfortunate chain of events. The people on earth are unaware that their hero, a human named Flash armed only with a human's courage and his unique ability to dodge death, is fighting valiantly for their survival, while single-handedly negotiating a peace treaty between the warring factions of Mongo, as well as searching for his captured love Dale.It really is such a feel good film, with a great theme tune from Queen, in which you really do wish you were there fighting along side him as he courageously fights for the very survival of the human race. Naturally it isn't long before his name has spread throughout the planet of Mongo, and his enemies tremble at the very mention of his name, as they have never met a creature who is so courageous as the inhabitants of earth are (laugh, but in this film it is true).This film is definitely worth watching at least once for the fact that it is so fun, if nothing else. The acting isn't bad, nor are the special effects by any stretch. Watch this film and you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FLASH GORDON may just be the most entertaining, campy, colorful Space Opera ever made. Totally unbelievable, wildly imaginative, visually stunning...it is nearly impossible to describe the film without falling back into superlatives! What is even more amazing is that the film succeeds despite the stiff, amateurish performances of the two leads, Sam J. Jones and Melody Anderson. Jones, at 26, was appearing in only his third film (he had debuted as Bo Derek's boyfriend in 10); FLASH GORDON marked 25-year old Anderson's film debut. While neither actor would ever become a major 'star', they both would continue working and would improve over time, surviving the harsh critical reviews when FLASH GORDON was released.The performances of Jones and Anderson aside, the cast was a 'Who's Who' of international stars, obviously relishing their outrageous roles, and no one was having more fun than venerable Max von Sydow, 51, who took the role of 'Ming the Merciless' at the suggestion of his children, and had such a good time that he would make time afterward for an occasional excursion into 'camp' between his more 'dramatic' roles. Israeli actor, Topol, so memorable in FIDDLER ON THE ROOF, and about to do a 'James Bond' adventure, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, made a funny, slightly mad Dr. Zarkov, while future 'James Bond' Timothy Dalton 'channeled' Laurence Olivier in his intense portrayal of Prince Barin. There is a lot of 'Falstaff' in Brian Blessed's gregarious performance as the leader of the 'Birdmen', Prince Vultan, and an unrecognizable Peter Wyngarde oozes malevolence as Ming's robotic aide-de-camp, Klytus. And for all the hormonally-charged boys, clothing-challenged Ornella Muti, as Ming's oversexed daughter, Princess Aura, is breathtaking, splitting her youthful lusts between Flash and Prince Barin.While the score was composed by Howard Blake, much of the film featured songs written especially for FLASH GORDON by the legendary rock band, Queen. Freddie Mercury's soaring vocals are unforgettable, and this film, with 1986's HIGHLANDER, would mark the band's finest film work.There is so MUCH imagination lavished on the production, from sets to costumes, to intentionally cheesy special effects (a homage to the Buster Crabbe '30s serials), and dialog rich with one-liners (penned by frequent "Batman" bard, Lorenzo Semple), it is nearly impossible to catch everything in a single viewing...So I suggest you BUY a copy of it, and enjoy this classic, whenever you want!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A corker of a comic strip romp. Remarkably naughty stuff for a P.G.! "I *love* initiations..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my; I can't help saying that I loved this film; every absurd, ludicrous inch of it. Revisiting it today, after my IMDb comment on it of 17.4.01, I agree it is a diabolical film when viewed against guidelines of genuine artistry. I would however emphasize just how enjoyable the damn thing is, and that it does have a method to it. It is truly a very tongue-in-cheek film, and a visually dazzling one. So much to pore over in terms of gorgeously garish lighting, sets and costumes; so much to laugh at in the script. Some intended absurdities in the dialogue, some otherwise; it's difficult to tell with a film that models itself on a comic strip. One expects larger-than-life and unconvincing dialogue with these sort of things. Of course, with actors like Brian Blessed you know that laughs are being not so much played for as being commandeered. The bellowing Blessed is a true legend of an appallingly type-cast actor. The cast is outstanding; bizarre stuff having Timothy Dalton, Ornella Muti, Max von Sydow, John Hallam, John Osbourne (the playwright!), Peter Wyngarde and more in the same film. And directed by the British Mike Hodges, which does suggest the film's humorous, ironic edge perhaps. The set design and costumes are outstanding; indeed, as Time Out Film Guide says, this is so much better in its baroque way than the sterile, digi-tech. normality of today's science fiction.For a film with a PG rating, and the expectation it is to be for children, one is constantly taken aback by the boundaries it pushes. There are strong insults - Dalton shouting, "Freeze you bloody bastards!" and castigating Ms. Muti's Aura as a "lying bitch!" Ouch. ;-) Sexual undertones - heck, *overtones* a lot of the time (!) - permeate the film. Though bizarrely you have Richard O'Brien making an appearance and not being involved in any of that. There is an all-too-brief 'fight' between Dale and Aura; I know who my money would have been on there! Aura is a formidably bad, if vulnerable girl...Nothing is sanitized in terms of the implications of Ming's sexual behaviour, as regards the Dale stuff later on. His daughter, Princess Aura, played by Ornella Muti, is a somewhat alluring vixen, all petulance and sensuousness. The princess is a heavily made-up, predatory, suggestive lady, slinking around in unbelievable costumes and whispering, in her dulcet alien (read: Italian) tones, some rather kinky sweet nothings. She is clearly said to have 'enjoyed' her torture; the naughty, impish girl! It has to be said that she works wonderfully in the film, really enlivening it, although she has little to do, sadly, in later parts.The man Topol is sheer insanity captured on screen; may I again mention the scene which goes through his brain; deeply surreal and maniacally absurd stuff! Melody Anderson and Sam J. Jones are, erm, comical in their bad acting and reading of their lines; which only really adds to the fun if truth be told. That this self-professed 'New York quarterback', Flash Gordon, is such a bonehead, amuses me greatly.This film will have you laughing to the high heavens many, many times... the wet, would-be spunky Dale Arden absurdly cheer-leading; "GO FLASH, GO FLASH GO!" Flash going "That Ming's a psycho!" in the most absurdly hapless tone of voice, Blessed bellowing "GORDON'S ALIIIIIVE!?", Flash slipping into transmitting his thoughts to Dale while being fondled by Aura; "Oh my God; this girl's really turning me on!" Aura purring "You'll have to convince me much better than that"... this film is heaven for any lover of the ludicrous. Not a good film exactly, but one of the most entertaining you could ever wish to see. Much more fun than "Star Wars" and so many poker-faced science fiction films... and certainly a more appealing comic strip type film than "Spiderman" was. "Flash Gordon" is a glorious helping of ludicrous, dazzling and sometimes very rude excess.Rating:- ****/*****(p.s. Why, oh why no sequel? It's jokingly hinted at the end, indeed...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me Flash Gordon seems like nothing so much as it does a gay Star Wars, and as such it is the work of genius. Flash is as colourful as any psychedelic album cover of the 1960s but with a tightness and assuredness to it that proves it wasn't the work of misguided, acid-drowned hippies (as some scenes might suggest at first), or indeed, of any contemporary mainstream film director. Flash feels like a labour of love rather than of a committee - it is infused with a loving care and understanding of what it's doing that means the film is never afraid to touch upon sex, violence and gore, yet does not feel it is therefore bound to being adult, and likewise in its technicolour vistas does not shy away from what some would label childish (or camp...), and unlike contemporary mainstream films it doesn't have a cocky or pretentious sense of its own worth (just think of every stupid, stupid film that has actually seriously tried to teach us something), and by its campness Flash actually (and quite charmingly) persuades us to underestimate it as a bit of pulp fun, which is perhaps why those who enjoy it really love it too. It should also be remembered that it has a plot that is authentically pulpy and rollicking good fun at that (even Star Wars dragged a bit, but not Flash Gordon), and I'd even go as far as to say that Flash is a proper epic, with its grand scale, cast of well-known actors (Brian Blessed!) and the fact that it gets so bloody much done (compare with Titanic, the wannabe-epic which got so little done - two people fall in love - in 3 hours).Flash Gordon is the perfect Bank Holiday film, captivating and enjoyable from start to finish, it is one of a kind and I really don't think we'll ever see anything like it made ever again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to come up with the perfect metaphor for Dino DeLaurentis' remake of FLASH GORDON? Here: fix yourself a piece of french toast. Crispy, golden brown, maybe a little on the bland side, but perfectly good all by itself. Now let's add some melted butter. Okay, that's a little better. Now add some maple syrup. Pretty good, huh? Now add some powdered sugar. Now spoon on some honey. Now ladle on some strawberries. Now add some peanut butter. Now dump some chocolate syrup on it. Now--- WAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!Get the picture? The first mistake Dino made was trying to make this all things to all people, which it ain't. Either going the serious route OR strictly camp would've made it a much better film than it actually turned out to be, but by trying to go in two different directions at once, the end result was the most schizoid kind of film imaginable, where they threw everything at the screen to see what would stick, and ended up with mostly a runny mess instead.Another colossal blunder? The production design may have originally been conceived by the excellent Ferdinando Scarfiotti (CAT PEOPLE), but whatever his influence was is now completely drowned by the wacked-out visions of Danilo Donati, who is still stuck in the same time warp back when he designed BARBARELLA for Dino as well.As for the performances? Max Von Sydow, Brian Blessed, Peter Wyngarde, John Hallam and Topol seemed to be the only ones to "get" that this wasn't Shakespeare, and had as much fun with Lorenzo Semple Jr.'s WAAAY-overdone material as Mike Hodges allowed them to. Sam Jones and Melody Anderson were BLONDELY, blissfully oblivious to what was going on around them, and the international contingent of Ornella Muti and Mariangela Melato were naturally, purely camp just for being there! On the other hand, poor Timothy Dalton tries to put on a game face yet again in a situation that finds him playing the straight man in inherently gay or at least uber-camp surroundings.Ultimately, the score by Queen gets the mood just right even when the visuals don't, and Howard Blake's underscoring echoes the serial sensibility. Now with a better, surer-handed script and more charismatic leads, this could've transcended its legacy as a paragon of cinematic ineptitude and become one of the better comic strip knockoffs, ala BATMAN (the Tim Burton version.)As a time capsule of what one could expect from the debauched and decadent '80's, it's still a hoot worth watching at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie, excellent Music, I thought everyone was well-cast, and Max Von Sydow is especially good at playing the sinister and sadistic Ming The Merciless. Queen's music is perfect, you could not have asked for better, the styles of the spaceships and the costumes is great, especially looking not unlike designs of the original Flash Gordon. I Recommend this movie to ANY fan of good, fun Sci-fi!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You Don't Smile While Watching This There May Be Something Wrong With Your TV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enormousely incoherent, ridiculous plot, terrible main actor, and one of the most enjoyable film experiences you may ever have. If the theme-song by Queen doesn't make you smile in the opening credits, there is something wrong with your TV. A football player for the Jets, is on a small plane which happens to crash into the home of a man building a space ship which is to go beyond our solar system to investigate a series of anomalies befalling the earth; weird stuff like "hot hail" and other acts of God. Before there is time for introductions our hero Flash(his t-shirt has his name on it), the Dr., and some girl, are whisked away to the planet Mongo, ruled by the evil and legendary Ming The Merciless, played by one of my favorite all time actors (after Bill Murray), Max Von Sydow (of "Seventh Seal" fame). Jeremy Irons is his chief of secret police, hidden behind a Dr. Doom like metal mask. By the time Flash and company arrive, Ming is already barking "sieze them", and suddenly Flash and the girl are a couple. Flash and this girl, met on the plane, some five minutes before this, by the movies time...they don't call him Flash for nothing. Flash then, manages to fight off Mings goons with his football moves...but is taken prisoner, and then escapes and has to convince, the Tree People to join with him and the Hawk People, against Ming. The planet of Mongo, seems to exist inside a lava lamp. There's a constant Technicolor swirl of clouds, that never goes away; there is no seemingly no night or die, and the vacuum of space between planets is breathable. Like "The Jetsons", we never see the ground, only floating fortresses and land masses. Basically it's an absurdly plotted, visually stunning (Mongo: where all the women look like peacocks and the men look like robots), superhero movie with a character whose been out of print since the 1930's, and music by Queen! A true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flash! Ah ahhhhh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have half the mind to give this film 10 out of 10. But I deduct 1 pt naturally for the abundance of camp although it is clear that was what the makers were going after. In fact the screenwriter for this film, I had read, worked on the 60's Batman TV show, and the director wanted the film to take itself less serious than Star Wars. It is no wonder, why it was obliterated by Empire Strikes Back that year. But this film never steers off course of its intention which is to hand you a tongue and cheek farce of science fiction films using the most popular and imaginative sci-fi icon from the past, Flash. And in all honesty to do a realistic Flash Gordon would probably come out boring or incredibly lame. So Flash Gordon, like Dick Tracy, a decade later, decided to have as much fun in the comic strip sense of visual gags, quirky characters, and a silly plot that let good and evil play around with a lot of effects and top it off with a rock show to bring it into the era of arena rock. You may not like this film as more serious minded people do, like the ones who mistakes the Dark Knight as riveting drama, and you may think this film is pure corn and dismiss it. But if you can't understand the purpose of the film simply to have a lot of fun with lasers and rock and roll then I suggest you go and find a good science fiction film that explores the role of politics in a galactic society...you know like...Attack of the Clones. (Which is more embarrassing in my opinion because Lucas intended the film to be a drama.) Make no mistake I love Star Wars, but Flash makes its own mark on the genre that worthy of noting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all these years it still amazes me how big a blunder this film is. The Buster Crabbe serials of the 30's were classics compared to this bust. Why did they camp it up? Why did the filmmakers forget that one of the pleasures of the serial was the cheap sets and effects? It's a big mistake trying to make this film funny but then spending millions in special effects that looked cheap but weren't meant to. Why not make it look cheap in a campy style? Have fun with it. Either do it one way or the other.The biggest problem with the film is the casting of the two leads. Sam J Jones and Melody Anderson as Flash and Dale Arden are both just awful. With all the money spent couldn't they have gotten two leads who could act? The only two performances worth noting are Topol as Dr. Zarkoff and Max Von Sydow, inspired casting, as Ming the Mercilles. Even the score by Queen is overdone. This film is a mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry all you Flash Gordon's fans but this is a truly awful movie. I forced myself to see it all the way through and it was a pain. Loved it when I was 8 but now this is looks like a movie done by someone in a bad acid trip and by the time this movie was done, acid was already out of fashion. The music theme is good and inspiring but that is the only good thing I have to say about this title. The story is weak and the plot is basic and dull, the actors are awful never looking serious in their performance and the costumes are dreadful! Nothing in this movie looks even credible, we never believe the actors performance, and even the objects just look fake. Every rock we see, we now that it is made of Styrofoam and it sure looks like that. Absolutely no effort in making things look believable. Talking about direction well it is simply uninspired work. No sense in the story but not quit a nonsense movie so I don't see the point of it. It could had been a crazy, goofy movie, very artistic and wild as if it was out of a fairy tale like Alice in wonderland or City of Lost Children but it is simply a bad Hollywood movie perhaps a little bit out of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is this thing you call "camp", Earthling?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what "camp" is. Nor do I approve of it, whatever it is. I expect it's another bit of postmoderne waffle-jargon designed to let one with-it film studies graduate know when he's met another with-it film studies graduate. So what follows is based on my guesses - pure guesses - as to what the word might mean."Flash Gordon" is gaudily colourful. The skies on Mongo in particular are worth seeing, swirling reds and yellows and oranges and whatever other colours they could wring out of the old chemistry set. Costumes are done in the superior comic book style. Have we hit "camp" yet? To me it just looks like consistent art direction - something we could do with more of.The acting could be described as hammy - is THIS camp? Who knows, but it's a moot point, since the acting isn't really hammy. The characters, rather, are all remarkably, supremely, perfectly, simple. Flash has only one thought in his head at a time. (If that.) Ming wants to rule the universe. Princess Aura undergoes some development, but her psychology is never complicated at any stage of it. The cast bring this simplicity to life rather than employ the kind of ambiguous understatement that suggests Byzantine mental states. When Dale Arden delivers the wonderful line, "That's what makes us better than you," she is just stating a simple truth about the relative moral character of Terrans and Mongans - she might just as well have said, "Our sky is bluer than yours." This is GOOD acting. At any rate, it's acting that effectively conveys character, and we ought to see more of it.Is the Queen soundtrack camp? Here we touch on musical questions I am not qualified to talk about. Those who have the sensory apparatus of a platypus and can detect the slightest quiver in the current of popular music - I certainly can't - will be able to pass critical judgement on Queen. All I know is that the music seems to fit, somehow. Make of this what you will.It all boils down to this: if "camp" is a feature of presentation rather than content, then "Flash Gordon" is no more camp than any other movie. It takes the world in which it is set seriously. The world is a ludicrous one, of course - but it is also, in its way, a beautiful world, and I'm damned if I'll sit still and allow it to be called "camp". I still don't know what the word means but I sense an insult."Flash Gordon" isn't perfect, of course. The world of Mongo is all very well, but Flash Gordon has to be somehow transported there from Earth, and the terrestrial scenes just don't work - and furthermore, the sour aftertaste they leave lingers for some way into the film. Even if this is set aside "Flash Gordon" can't be considered the prince of space operas. Mongo isn't THAT exciting a place. But it's a decent setting for a decent and, in its own way, sincere movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is hilarious 'bad', but in the best way.From the opening this movie is hilarious bad/funny/good. It is so because Ming is told that the planet he will attack is "Earth" and on the control panel is a button for "Earthquake" - a button that only makes sense if you know Earth and attack Earth. Any serious movie would have made a button "Planet quake" :)All effects are similar - just enjoy it. Nothing explained. Watching this movie from 1980 now makes it so much funnier, as you can reflect upon many of the newer science fiction movies, that actually perform worse, despite all the perfect effects as none of them have proper acting and much too serious but still lack logic.In this movie our heroes drops directly into Emperors Mings world, have no idea where they are, but in no time runs around and manage to organize a fight to save earth in the very last second. All Aliens speaks perfect English and Ming gets a nice big stick through his body. Nice to see his blood is green, and his daughters is red.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...except FLASH! AHAHHHHHH! With the recent news that there may well be a sequel to this slice from sci fi cult classic pie, its review time again.Now many may be thinking why exactly I am giving this 10 stars, given its reputation as a cheesy reproduction of a serial series. However, I recently revisited this childhood favourite, this past morning after work and I have come up with reasons why.The Plot is among the most classic of cults also; Professional footballer Flash Gordon (Sam J Jones), along with the cute as a button damsel in distress Dale Arden (Melody Anderson) and the insanely over the top astro scientist Hans Zarkov (Topol) head up to the worlds of Mongo in a rocket after the Earth comes under the attack of the ruthless, Ming The Merciless (The great Max Von Sydow at his best). As Flash goes on an adventure to liberate the kingdoms under Mings rule he is joined by Prince's Barin (A very 'Errol Flynn' Timothy Dalton) and Vultan (Brian Blessed steals the entire movie) to unite the peoples of Mongo and bring Ming and his cronies down.The things that make Flash Gordon the iconic, colorfest it is, is that is wastes nothing. At 107 minutes long (on my DVD at least) it wastes none of its running time with plot floundering and dead end narrative. The action gets going almost immediately and keeps jumping forward like a horse galloping across the desert of pace.Flash Gordon also possess some extremely over the top acting but it keeps its head above water at all times with the lines being delivered in a pantomime style that perfectly befits the atmosphere we're in. For example, Sam Jones's dubbed dialogue, while clear is out of place among the more natural vocals of the rest of the cast (of course totally drowned out by Brian Blessed's booming voice), actually perfectly befits Flash as the purely Heroic, cut and dry hero. The supporting cast carries themselves along with the movies pace with gusto. Dalton's Prince Barin carries all the charm and action of an old school swashbuckler, worthy of the romanticism of the films action scenes during the climax. Mings daughter, Princess Aura (the gorgeous Ornella Muti gave all adolescent lads a reason to keep pausing) is a woman divided as she takes lovers by the minute in an effort to oppose her father but maintains her affection for Barin throughout as the two are joined by the scene stealing Prince Vultan, leader of the Hawkmen and poster boy for the entire adventure. Brian Blessed keeps the entertainment factor on top level at all times with the charisma of a King of Shakespearian era gone by.The music....what more can be said of Gordon's iconic accompaniment than, adrenaline personified. I only have to mention the battle scene with Flash and Prince Vultan leading the Hawkmen into battle against War Rocket Ajax with Brian May's screaming guitar providing the charge. My only worry that if a sequel is green lit one day then what band, if any, could possibly recreate this pulse pounding set list. Queen were as responsible as Mike Hodges himself for making this movie as iconic as Flash Gordon playing football against Klytus's (a deliciously sinister Peter Wyngarde in gold faced glory) henchmen.In conclusion, Flash Gordon is as iconic as its ever been and nothing can remove that tag line. Doer of the impossible indeed!FP</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The two leads here basically ham-it-up, but the characters and film seem to be pulled directly from the old-comics. The NFL rock-head, the professional brunette, and the decorated Ming the Merciless.BUT there's a point in all this craziness, when Sam Jones is basically wiping the floor with the enemies on the AJAX plane/ship, and the music from rock-gods Queen is quite literally shredding with Sam Jones, when the viewer(at least this one) could never have a bigger smile on his face.All the sound editing is incredible too.The film cannot be taken seriously, and it shouldn't be. It's almost as if the film was made in the 50's, only the color-splash and the action thrust it into the 80's with all the flair and daring spectacle that both era's deserve to be remembered by.Some would say that many of the lines are so bad, but If you understand that they were meant to be funny and ridiculous you might actually appreciate these little subtleties that make the film one of the most under-rated productions of all-time.As FUN as fun ever was.I usually include my "you might like this if you liked____" list, but this is a one of a kind, and doesn't line-up next to much of anything in terms of comparisons and expectations.81/100Begs to be thrown in the time capsule.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great FUN movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film many times over the years, but not recently. So when I saw it come up on the TV schedules I made it a priority to record it and give it yet another viewing. There are many things wrong with this film, but to me, they are outweighed by the things that are so right! Yes, its kitch and camp, yes the acting and the special effects aren't great, but, to me, it's so much fun! Here's a bit about the plot and then I'll tell you why.American footballer Flash Gordon is returning home after a vacation when his plane is involved in a crash. The only other survivor is travel agent, Dale Arden. They crash in the grounds of scientist Dr. Hans Zarkov, who has been in the news because he thinks that recent natural disasters are the work of extra terrestrials and the Earth is under attack. He has pinpointed where he thinks the attacks are coming from and kidnaps Flash and Dale because he cannot operate his spaceship alone. They take off and eventually make it to the planet Mongo, ruled by the evil dictator, The Emperor Ming. All the moons of Mongo are ruled by different princes who are permanently at war with each other, among them are Prince Barin of Arboria and Prince Vultan, leader of the Hawk-Men. Ming is very interested in Dale and decides to take her as his bride. Flash is to be executed, but Ming's daughter, Princess Aura intervenes and he is rescued and taken to Arboria. Zarkov is to be conditioned and enrolled into the network of spies run by Ming's adviser, Klytus. Can Flash unite the oppressed people against Ming, can Zarkov save the Earth, and can Dale escape the evil clutches of The Emperor? Well, in the tradition of the 1930's shorts, I'll leave you on that cliff-hanger.OK, I'll admit the first thing that turned me onto this film was the soundtrack by Queen; I'm a fan of their work. But once I got past the great soundtrack I found a film that is actually pretty good in its own way, and an awful lot of fun! As I said at the beginning, not the greatest acting I've ever seen, but some really over-the-top stuff from Brian Blessed as Prince Vultan is a performance not to be missed. I also liked Max von Sydow as The Emperor Ming, Topol as Dr. Hans Zarkov and Timothy Dalton as Prince Barin. And of course it would be amiss of me to not give honourable mentions to Sam J. Jones as Flash Gordon, Melody Anderson as Dale Arden, Ornella Muti as Princess Aura and Peter Wyngarde as Klytus.So why do I think this film is so much fun? Well, as soon as Flash, Dale and Zarkov land on Mongo you know none of this is to be taken too seriously. Its pure fantasy and you can just sit back and enjoy the ride. Yes, there is some violence there, but when a guy gets stabbed and his blood is blue, you know you're not in Kansas any more. The visual style reminded me very much of the 1968 Roger Vadim film Barbarella starring Jane Fonda, although I felt the special effects weren't quite so good in this one. Over all, kitch, camp, not great acting, not the best special effects, but a great soundtrack and an awful lot of fun! Recommended.My score: 7.4/10</fullReview>

And what fun to see the great Max von Sydow cut loose and practically chew his scenes to pieces. If "Flash" has a flaw, it's that some of the actors don't seem to be in on the joke (the biggest offender being Timothy Dalton, who takes things far too seriously).

		<fullReview>Flash Gordon was one of those films which were so bad that it was good. It may have been corny, the acting may have been intentionally bad by some of the cast and I would only admit to watching it to my closest friends but it was still good.It was all about fun. An awful plot and intentionally bad acting can be forgiven if you're having fun. It's based on a comic strip and watching the film is like reading a comic book. I don't think this film would have worked if it had been dark and gloomy.Sam Jones plays Flash Gordon. I think Jones was an unknown when they made this movie but he did a good job. I liked the scenes where he is on Mongo playing 'American Football' with some of Ming the Merciless's guards. Jones is perfect as Flash.Max Von Sydow makes an excellent Ming the Merciless, an evil character with no redeeming features and a total lack of morals or values.Also, who can forget Brian Blessed as Prince Vultan and Timothy Dalton as Prince Barin? They helped things along and didn't take themselves too seriously.Queen did the music for this film. I was never a fan of Queen but credit must be given where it is due-they did a fine job with this movie.So, sit back, switch your brain off for awhile,remember that you're a kid at heart and enjoy this fantastic space adventure.</fullReview>

Lucas was inspired by the Buster Crabbe serials of the 30's, not the 1980 movie.I also think that Sam Jones was good as Flash, dubbed or not. He was the All-American guy, and so what did people expect Jones to do with the role? Van Sydow was VERY sinister and the Queen score rocked!!!</fullReview>

This makes it more interesting on purely an adult level (It also has a far superior soundtrack by the magnificent Queen), and Mike Hodges has more interest in his actors than George Lucas, but it's not better. The story is bristling with holes and Sam Jones is terrible in the eponymous role, the effects are dated and... well I'd say that's enough. But this is the movie that explains why Timothy Dalton was chosen as James Bond, what Topol did after Fiddler on the Roof, and has excellent small, irrelevant details. It's a bold experiment and it's comic book origins make it essential in the current industry climate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was born only 4 years before the release of the movie, but ever since I remember seeing the movie, I've loved it.Movies are about content. Today, it's how realistic the movie appears. Back when movies first came out, they were new to it. You can see quite a few parallels between movies and plays, in fact, some of the very first movies WERE plays. A play is special because it requires imagination on the part of the audience, and a lot of what you take away from a play is your interaction with the characters. It's a lot like reading a book. In this case, it's a comic book. The props and background to this movie are very much like the comic books, and, much like the comic books, the scenes are designed to be outlandish. It's a story. The focus isn't on realism, instead it's simply a story of a hero. A hero like Superman.The movie was done extremely well. Some of it is a bit hammy, but that simply adds to the charm. The props were done just well enough to keep true to the genre, but they weren't done with the idea in mind of realism. The actors were certainly not big actors in their day, but I think they over-acted just enough to make sure that the hero aspect of the movie stayed intact. It's not about realism, it's about telling a story, just like Paul Bunyan. Not really 100 feet tall, but it sure was fun to tell it that way, and to listen to it told that way.</fullReview>

Seeing it again as an adult brought back the smile to my face. Of course i now saw the sub-par sets, the hammy dialogue and the bland acting (whats Max on Sydow doing in this anyway..?). Still, its reminiscent of old satruday matinees in its no holds-barred adventure presentation.All in all, a great film for a saturday afternoon, or those hung over sundays =).7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Younger viewers can't appreciate this classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flash Gordon (1980) was a grand adventure of the flashiest sort (no pun intended). In the minds of many, it's a classic and has no equal. At the very least, you must appreciate the zeal with which the actors and crew tackled this particular pulp story.Unfortunately, the film has the curse of age. It *looks* old, and that is precisely why most younger filmgoers will consider it a "bad" film, or just pass it up entirely. The problem lies in the young viewer's film bias and history. Virtually everything seen by a younger viewer (read: under 25 as of this writing) will have superior special effects and a completely different style, and I find that most younger viewers can't get past that point. They see a film like Flash Gordon and instantly see "an old movie" rather than putting themselves into 1980 and enjoying from that viewpoint. The unfortunate result is comments like "The special effects are bad" or "The characters are stupid". They can't grasp the idea that in 1980, Star Wars was the pinnacle of special effects, and was the great innovator only a few years earlier. Flash Gordon is what's to be expected from the last of the 1970's. It's the last hurrah of camp film, and anyone who understands what pulp serials were like embraces Flash Gordon as one of their favorite films. The color, the performances, the action- It all screams 1980, and perhaps that is why those of us who were there love this film to varying degrees, while those who weren't (or who are simply in denial) refuse to see anything but a sci-fi film that's "not as cool as the Matrix".Kudos must be offered to Brian Blessed, Max von Sydow, and Timothy Dalton, who all leapt to the front of the pack in this movie, showing that a well-done over-the-top performance is as legitimate a skill as a downplayed dramatic performance. There is energy and artistry in Brian Blessed's Prince Vultan of the hawkmen. There is potency and seething, irrational evil in Max von Sydow's Emperor Ming. There is a grand robin-hood flamboyancy in Timothy Dalton's Prince Barin. The women are appropriately vampy, strong, and alluring. The hero is appropriately dashing yet dim. It all comes together to form a great story, and it's held firm by Queen's excellent music.If you were there in 1980, you will like Flash Gordon- You will find some fun in this movie. If you were born after 1980, however, you will likely think of this as just another "old movie".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indeed, glamorous actors and glamorous set design can find a place in science fiction films. In this case in a remake of the classic '30's Buster Crabbe serials. No, this isn't the wanna be realism of George Lucas, this is the imagination of film artists turned loose with art designers replacing technical advisors. Panned by science fiction buffs, this film was meant for those who prefer Shakespeare to Herbert. I thought everything worked.

		<fullReview>This version of Flash Gordon has to be one of the greatest 'B' movies ever made--I felt like the Disco Era sort of came and exploded all over this film. So horrid, yet so enjoyable--it's loud, it's tacky, the acting stinks, and the special effects look they were done by grade schoolers. This Flash has about as much appeal as the Japanese monster movies of the 1950s (which I adore for their cheesiness). Queen's soundtrack compliments the over-the-top appeal of the film.Highly recommended for 'B' movie fans, college students needing a study break, and anyone wanting a good chuckle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, talk about a perverted flick! This is a classic cult film, no doubt, and you have to see it at least once. But considering that Richard O'Brien from Rocky Horror Picture Show is in this, that should tell you the kind of movie you're getting into! There are a plethora of sado-masochistic scenes, such as Flash trapped in a dungeon with a big spiked helmet covering his head and only wearing leather underpants. The most obvious is Princess Aura held down on a table by golden hands while getting whipped by some chick in shiny black leather, as this dude with a golden mask watches on. Still, with superstars like Timothy Dalton, Topol, and Brian Blessed (the guy who did the voice of Boss Nass in Star Wars), you gotta see it! Special effects are pretty cool for 1980 too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many people miss the point of Flash Gordon. It is simply a color, big budget updating of the old Flash Gordon matinee serials from the '30s. Max Von Sydow looks so much like the original Ming from those serials that it's eerie. The style is almost exactly the same as those serials as well, just add color and better FX and you get this movie. Sure those old serials look inherently campy today - heck, they looked campy in the 50's when they were first broadcast on television, but they had a sense of fun and adventure. The 1980 movie captures that spirit beautifully. The cast is outstanding as well: Max Von Sydow, Topol, a pre-James Bond Timothy Dalton, Peter Wyngarde, and Brian Blessed all give excellent performances. Sam J. Jones and Melody Anderson, while not great, are not horrible in their parts. Jones, particularly, has been unfairly bashed. His performance is adequate. The biggest problem with his performance is that he is just outclassed by all the supporting actors. Flash Gordon is one of the most colorful and visually stunning films ever, and is just a lot of fun to watch - as long as you don't take it too seriously. The soundtrack by Queen is perfect for the movie as well, adding to the fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1980 remake of "Flash Gordon" is another one of those polarizing movies: you either absolutely love it or absolutely hate it. You either enjoy it as a campy romp, or despise it as a horrible insult to a classic hero.Me, I'm in the first group. I love this movie more every time I see it. It's loud, it's gaudy, it's campy, and it's exquisite. Because of this movie, and its theme song, every time I hear the word "flash," I want to sing "Aaaahhh!" (and I know I'm not the only one...)Does it compare with the 1936 original? Well... yes and no. It's an apples and oranges argument -- I love the color and outrageousness of the 1980 version, but I also love the quaintness and charm of the 1936 original. For the record, Buster Crabbe is a better Flash than Sam J. Jones, but Sam does a decent job in this movie (the rest of his career is a different story). You don't have to choose between them, as far as I'm concerned.Anyhoo. "Flash Gordon" is an epic, exciting space opera, with a heavy emphasis on "opera" (thanks to the soundtrack from Queen). If you love outrageous, overblown camp, you'll love this. If you're a purist, best to leave this one alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An utterly silly and extremely camp classic from 1980, fondly remembered now for its strikingly garish set designs, excellent, OTT score by Queen, and Brian Blessed, who invests every word he speaks with enough gusto to knock over an elephant. It has a peculiarly European sensibility to it as well - like 'The Fifth Element' it looks gorgeous, is camper than a room full of Pet Shop Boys, has a frivolous sense of fun, and (importantly for 47% of the population) is packed with semi-naked women, many of which are encased in oh-so-tight spandex, which must chafe terribly.It's very, very rum, and an excellent way of whiling away a bank holiday afternoon.The excellent, eclectic cast stands out as well - where else can you find Peter Duncan, Timothy Dalton, Peter Wyngarde, Richard O'Brien, Max Von Sydow *and* Brian Blessed, all wearing a variety of fetish-wear?On the downside, it all seems very slight, the action sequences are over too quickly, and with all the above packed into an hour-and-a-half it's all too similar to the extended cameo-fest of 'Dune'. Sam Jones (who was dubbed) is competent enough as Flash, although he's no Harrison Ford.Not many films are as light on their feet as this one, and it's a rare treasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a sick love of B movies and low budget horror flicks. I have to say that Flash Gordon takes the cake for the best written &amp; acted 'B' movie of all time. Flash Gordon finds a happy middle ground between the ultra-cheesy movie and the box-office smash.And you can't help but get reminded of the 80's when you watch this movie either. The set designs, the costumes (even though they are 'futuristic') and even the special effects just scream EIGHTIES! This movie truly ushered the change from the exagurrated 70's to the wild and extravagant 80's back in 1980.Although you might not enjoy this movie, I would certainly recommend seeing it, it is sure to bring back a couple good memories or flash-backs to where you were in the early 80's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1980 brought us a few memorable movies, such as "Superman II" and "Caddyshack", but 1980 should be remembered for the sprawling epic, "Flash Gordon". The vision was astounding, the soundtrack by Queen phenomenal. Sure, Hollywood was still riding the crest of the wave started by "Star Wars", but so what? I think this film would have run into some difficulty getting made if George Lucas had not already opened the door.I used to watch reruns of the Flash Gordon 1936 serials, and I think that this rendition of one of America's original heros was a great tribute. Maybe this film didn't have a heavy social message to convey to the audience, but in 1980 we didn't need another moral message. We wanted/needed a movie that didn't make us think. We wanted escapism. Something to take us away for an hour and a half, or so. And "Flash Gordon" succeeded admirably. Besides, it's a DeLaurentis production. What's not to like?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...(certainly the producers don't), you can have a great deal of fun watching this big-budget spoof/homage/whatever to the Flash Gordon serials of yester-year. The acting in this one is so turgidly purple that you'll think you were watching an eggplant. Brian Blessed in particular latches on to one corner of the scenery and methodically gnaws his way to the opposite side. There's no real pretense that these are "realistic" three-dimensional characters, who are as two-dimensional as the comics FG springs from. The only real disappointment is the poor acting of the major leads, Sam Jones and Melody Anderson. They seem to think they're doing serious drama/action-adventure. On the other hand, Topol, Sydow, Blessed, Dalton, etc., know better, and have great fun with it. As noted, you really need to see this in unedited format: the mysterious absence of Richard O'Brien's character from the TV-edited format is one of several disappointments due to editing for time/format.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy sci-fi hits the right notes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And that has as much to do with Queen's soundtrack as anything. For all the problems this campy sci-fi adventure faced in production, the end result is surprisingly effective. Though far from a Star Wars type of success (Lucas was originally interested in Flash Gordon project), this film is funny, corny, exciting, and even a little bit sexy. Make that A LOT sexy when Princess Aura is on screen! Wow! The story centers around the ruthless intergalactic Emperor Ming the Merciless (Max Von Sydow) attempting to crash the moon into Earth for no other reason than he's bored and looking for something to entertain himself with. The only hope for our planet is Flash Gordon, quarterback of the New York Jets. He, some babe he made eye contact with at a hotel bar the night before (Anderson), and a mad scientist (Topol) fly into outer space in a rocket and are sucked into Ming's strange universe. There they must rally the kingdoms of Mongo together and overthrow this evil emperor. Making matters more difficult is the fact that Ming has conditioned all of these kingdoms to hate each other, so teaming up is a concept foreign to them. Can Flash rally the troops in time to defeat Ming and save Earth???Fortunately the makers of this film knew this material could not be taken seriously, and proceeded accordingly. Most of the cast seems to understand this, as well. Max Von Sydow has a great role with Ming, and he takes full advantage of it. Too bad this film had to go with a nobody like Sam J. Jones as its lead. Hard to tell just how good or bad his performance really was since his dialog is dubbed. Maybe his own delivery would have had more nuance. Kurt Russell was close to taking this role, but ultimately decided the Gordon role didn't have enough personality the way it was written. Here's an idea.... they could have hired him and let him play Gordon with the comic swagger of his Jack Burton character from Big Trouble in Little China. That would have been the icing on the cake. But this is still an enjoyable film. Full of both clever and cheap f/x, sexy women, fun battle scenes, and great music. Highly recommended. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

I missed some of the adult humor the first time I saw it too. It works as 2 kinds of movies for different age groups. Sci-Fi movie for kids and camp send off of Sci-fi for adults. I still think Melody Anderson is gorgeous, reminds me of Carla Gugino.

To some this may give it away right there but performances from Topol, Max Von Syndow and Brian Best bring together a classic story that children and adults have loved for 3/4's of a century. It is well mixed with action, comedy and drama. One downfall of the movie is that the production value can not compete with the sci-fi movies made today. I first watched this movie at 16. I started it alone and by the end of the movie my whole family was watching it. It can definitely can be classified as cheesy but this is a category that both good and bad movies can fall into. The original Star Wars movie is quite cheesy and so is the original Star Trek series but both are classics. This movie does not compare to them, but it shows the validity of good classic cheesy movies that the whole family can enjoy and this is what Flash Gordon is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Energy waves have pulled the moon out of its orbit, endangering the inhabitants of Earth with natural disasters. Dr. Hans Zarkov makes a courageous flight across the universe with two unwilling passengers - Flash Gordon (Sam. S. Jones) the quarter back of the Jets and love interest Dale Arden (Melody Anderson). They travel to the planet Mongo to where the bizarre energy waves are coming from and confront the planet's ruler Ming the Merciless (Max Von Sydow). It's a race against the clock for Flash Gordon and he's the only one that can prevent the Earth's destruction.Based on the world famous comic strip, "Flash Gordon" is a space adventure or you could say space opera, which has a boisterously self-indulgent soundtrack produced by 'Queen'. I think that the movie is better known for it's cheesy theme song. Well, it's such a catchy tune that sticks in your head. Anyhow, this is an overblown, ambiguous and rather energy packed big-budget comic strip adaptation that comes across as some sort of enormous stage show of colourful set designs and zany costumes. What we get here is nothing but kitsch overload with brightly handled elements such as romance, adventure, comedy, action and some music from "Queen". What makes this film enjoyable hokum is that it's pure glossy trash. The premise incredibly ridiculous, dialogue is dreadfully hammy, over-the-top to bland performances, plastic and cardboard sets, wardrobe is filled with Halloween costumes and overly flashy special effects. Though, what makes these things work is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and the retro feel adds to the strong nostalgia of the 1980's. A lot of spirit went into it and it shows on screen.What stood out in the film were the vibrantly rich features that are orchestrated. The potent backdrops are truly unrestrained and filled with exuberance. With a sky ranging with swirling colours of blue, red, orange, pink and such and such. Then you got the likes of the lusciously swampy terrain to Ming's glistening fortress. The fancy camera work does a good job with it flowing with lively angles that capture the backdrop superbly and also the small slabs of action. There are a couple of well setup duels (a gracious cat-fight) and battles. Not forgetting some comical if rather stupid sequences that glowed with activity and the incredibly cheesy romance that blossom between the leads. When it finishes it ends with a bang, but the finale is utter cheese. It even ends with a sequel on mind.The dialogue is incredibly comical and because of that it's pretty quotable. There's quite a bit talk in the film. It's filled with lame puns, punch lines, scientific mumbo jumbo and a lot talk about the good things of humanity (which might come across as quite dated). There's even a heart felt moral to the story! The pace of story flows rather well, though it does concentrate more on the set pieces than plot. Now another feature that pops out is the soundtrack by 'Queen'. It's an upbeat rock score with prominent guitar riffs, and also a strong and pumping bass. Chuck in some bizarre sound effects too. Performances are extremely comic book style, meaning eccentric and flamboyant characters. Max Von Sydow is simply hammy as the sadistic Ming the Merciless. Sam. S. Jones just lacked the charisma to play Flash Gordon, but not in the action department. Melody Anderson was terrific as playing the strong hearted Dale Arden. Topel was good as the nutty Doctor Hans Zarkov and Timothy Dalton was fine as the arrogant Prince Barin. It's purely comic book stuff, which puts up a bouncy battle between Good vs. Evil.If your looking for something with substance just keep away as it's nothing but 100% style or should I say kitsch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tasty and Campy Fun Sci-Fi Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie succeeds perfectly in what it set out to do - take the classic Flash Gordon and bring it back in full blazing color.Quick plotline: The moon is suddenly falling towards the earth, causing all sorts of nasty havoc. Mentally off-kilter scientist Hans Zarkov kidnaps hapless plane-crash survivors Flash Gordon (handsome football star) and Dale Arden (a classic 1930s sci-fi damsel hottie) - and blasts off with them on a rocketship to try and discover why the moon is being pushed towards the earth and prevent it from destroying the whole planet. They land on an alien world, are promptly picked up by goons and brought before the evil bad guy, Ming the Merciless, who in classic bad-guy fashion divulges his evil plans to his captors. Naturally, Flash, Dale, and Dr. Zarkov must escape, unite the adversary leaders of the Hawkmen and the Arboreans, get an army and rocketships together, come back and destroy Ming and turn off his moon-moving ray before earth is destroyed - in just a few days.Based on the 1930s Flash Gordon TV serials and movies, this movie is a CLASSIC in every sense of the word. It excellently captures the whole mood and feel of classic Flash Gordon. Everything you may find "cheezy" about this movie was done ON PURPOSE. Flash Gordon not only brings the original classic back to life, but goofs on all of the campy elements of the 30s TV serial - right down to the old-fashioned pyrotechnic effects and rocketships that look suspiciously like they might be flying on strings.Max Von Sydow does a spectacular job of performing the role of the evil Ming the Merciless, coloring the character perfectly and bringing an excellent flair to what would otherwise be a flat stereotypical (but classic) sci-fi bad guy role.Of course you have to have a blonde-haired all-american hero-type for the character of Flash Gordon, and Sam Jones fits the bill perfectly, and Melody Anderson plays Dale Arden wonderfully.Mind you, don't expect any Oscar-level acting here - all of the characters are supposed to be very "1930's pulp sci-fi" in style and are presented accordingly. The acting is SUPPOSED to be a little "bad". The classic line "Oh, Flash!" sighed by Dale Arden in the movie is a straight throwback to the classic television serial - and even further back to original Flash Gordon of pulp sci-fi magazines and comic strips.I found the film to be VERY entertaining, with everything you'd expect from a classic sci-fi serial - earth-shattering impending disaster, cold-hearted evil villains, a handsome hero, a wacky scientist, the gorgeous evil emperor's daughter, a damsel in distress, a brain-washing machine, and cool 1950's-style rocketships. Comes complete with the entire gamut of hero sci-fi situations, including an execution scene, a chase scene, fight scenes, life-saving scenes, steamy scenes, romantic scenes, torture scenes, and aerial rocket battles. To top it all off, it even has a power hero theme song. (performed by Queen)If you're old enough to remember the original television series, you'll love this movie. It takes you back to the golden age of sci-fi in grand style.For younger generations, this is a "let-your-imagination-go" classic piece of science fiction - in colloquial terminology, "props and respect to the old school". Sure it's campy, sure some of the effects are cheezy, but it's FUN. Good old-fashioned larger-than-life action-adventure hero stuff at its best - old-school style.Warning: If your movies have to be technically correct and true-to-life, then Flash Gordon isn't for you. Otherwise, pass the popcorn and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tremendously entertaining film. It's SUPPOSED to be campy!!!!! Sam Jones (dubbed voice or not) is perfect as the golden boy Flash. The distinctly European flavor of the film lends to its exotic appeal. the battle between Ming's warriors and the hawkmen was my favorite and that Princess Aura.....va va va voomsky!!! Max Von Sydow is so evil as Ming that only Charles Middleton of the 30's serials can surpass him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flash!.....ah..ah.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, yeah! This is definitely a "so bad it's good" film. The acting? Whoooo, it's bad; even from accomplished actors like Topol, Max Von Sydow and Timothy Dalton. Brian Blessed chews so much scenery that he seems to gain weight as the film progresses. The leads give new meaning to the word bad. Their subsequent careers would tend to support this position. The dialogue? "Go, Flash, Go" indeed! Someone got paid to write this drivel? The effects? Well, it's not ILM. The music? Now that's great stuff! I love Queen and they delivered here. Despite all of these faults, I still love this film.The costumes are pretty good, if a little too 70's at times. The designs invoke the feel of the comic strip, but setting the Earth scenes in the 30's would have probably helped. Some of the acting is passable, such as Peter Wyngarde as Klytus, and Max Von Sydow is good in most of his scenes. Ornella Muti sizzles, as Aura should.The idea for Flash being a football quarterback is a bit lame. Yeah, it beats "world renowned polo player and Yale graduate", as in the strip; but, it doesn't actually suggest warrior. An Olympic athlete, possibly modern pentathalon, would have been better; possibly a military pilot or astronaut. As for Dale, women's lib didn't quite make it here.Despite its flaws, this is a pretty entertaining movie. It's ripe for an MST3K skewering, but it's pretty fun. Hopefully, it will be reissued on dvd here in the near future. Maybe they can find Sam Jones for some commentary. I don't think he would be too busy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absurd stuff! "Gordon's Aliiiive!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fairly camp, and certainly enjoyable Bank Holiday movie is "Flash Gordon" (1980). Obviously no great film, but very watchable, it has a fun visual garishness and momentum that few other such romps can match. While Sam Jones and Melody Anderson are perhaps a little too wooden for comfort, there are plenty of performances that do have the correct hammy pitch. Brian Blessed is... well... Brian Blessed, which is no bad thing here. His role is very similar to subsequent ones he had in "Blackadder The First" and "Dr Who": bellowing, warmongering, yet somehow likeable. Certain scenes stick out as hilarious - the scene were Topol's memory is erased, and all sorts of images come up on a screen, and then his explanation for regaining it! Lots of the stuff with the voluptuous Ornella Muti is very good; I like that torture scene! Max von Sydow's good in the plum role of Ming, but Timothy Dalton is very forgettable. Some of the dialogue is good, but perhaps not enough, although much mediocre dialogue is given gusto by Blessed and others. Difficult to grade easily, as it fails very much if you analyze it as serious film, but succeeds pretty well in the absurd escapist stakes. Rating:- *** (out of *****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TWO great missed opportunities...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were only two possible ways to properly develop Flash Gordon on film.Too bad they ignored both.When I see this car wreck of a film, I can't help but thinking how great it could have been if the filmmakers had followed one of the right paths. Any of them.The first one was the logical one: stick to the comic books, be faithful and approach the character and its rich, imaginative world with respect to Alex Raymond and the classic comic book fans worldwide. That's what they made, for example, in Superman the Movie. Or in the great first season of the 1979 Flash animated series.The second one, equally valid, was just the opposite: the total campiness. Yeah, if you want to be campy, do it right: you have the look, the sets, the right effects, and an awesome Queen score! You even have Richard O'Brien!! Just tell Mercury &amp; Co. to write new songs, hire actors who can sing and dance, and you'll get a brand-new Rocky Horror Picture Show-type musical which, with the right audience participation, can be turned into an everlasting cult classic (In fact, every time I hear the great "Flash Theme" I almost cry for what could have been...)! That'd be the coolest of the cool, don't you think?Sadly, they fell into the big, deep, dark abyss between those two paths: the abyss of pure cinematic dreck. While the movie desperately tries to decide if it wants to be epic sci-fi or just a kitchfest filled with bad, unfunny humor, the viewer tries to decide if he wants to stay, only to see if things can go even worse, or return the tape and ask for a refund.My apologies to all the fans of this movie, but it's a disaster. 2 out of 10. Just skip it, and watch Superman or Rocky Horror (depending on your mood)... but buy the Queen soundtrack!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An uneasy combination of camp and cruel, FLASH GORDON is for those who like visual and aural brain candy and little else. First the good stuff. The score by Queen is terrific; throbbing, sensual, like John Carpenter's BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA or Jeff Wayne's THE GOLDEN ROUNDEVOUS. The art direction, set decoration and costumes are outstanding, a wild mixture of kitschy and surreal. Finally, Brian Blessed and Max Von Sydow are both REALLY, REALLY GOOD. Now the bad news. The sound is atrocious. Dialogue is flat and frequently unintelligible. Sam Jones and Melody Anderson are both unattractively photographed, seriously undercutting their roles. The editing is poorly paced and uninteresting. These things detract tremendously from the enjoyment of the film. This is no where near as fun as the softcore FLESH GORDON, made on one-tenth the budget. The print used for the DVD is also disappointing. Still this one is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to see this movie, it is so hilarious. A campy campy movie that knows it and works it, "Flash Gordon" is like nothing else you will see. Sam J. Jones is a study in bad acting as the lead character. Melody Anderson as Dale Arden fares no better (wait until you see her cheering Flash with "go, Flash, GO!", waving her arms around like a bad breakdancer), but with both leads such laughable actors, it somehow fits. The supporting players, music, costumes, and cheesy-yet-kinda-cool special effects are what make this film come alive. Timothy Dalton is perfect in the role of Prince Barin, and Peter Blessed as Prince Vultan is what you would think a comic book character would be like in real life. My favorites were Ornella Muti as sexy vampy Princess Aura, and Mariangela Melato as evil Kala, kitten in a plastic unitard. Max Von Sydow as Ming the Merciless was one of the best villains I have seen to this day. Queen does the sound-track (original), they could not have scored it better. Check this out when you need a no brainer, it will entertain you and make you laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pow! Zoom! If you don't take Flash Gordon, the Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Action flick, too seriously, (I can't imagine who would), and if you're able to turn a deaf ear to the wretched strains of the anti-climatic Queen soundtrack, then I believe that you just might actually enjoy this picture a lot more than you ever thought possible.Released in 1980 - Flash Gordon is rather a comical, and decidedly campy Sci-Fi/Adventure romp across the starlit universe. For such a big-budget flick, Flash Gordon contains some of the chintziest and, yes, hokiest-looking special effects that you're ever gonna see this side of Uranus. I understand that all of this glitter and garishness was purely intentional. I sure hope that this was so - Otherwise I could only consider this picture's visuals to be nothing more than an utter travesty.In case anyone's at all interested - The ever-popular hero in this film, Flash Gordon, was based on Alex Raymond's classic comic strip character from the 1930s.As Flash Gordon's exciting story unfolds - We find that absolute "scoundrel-of-a-villain", Emperor Ming (the Merciless), with the aid of his astounding Power Ring, mercilessly initiating an onslaught of catastrophic disasters across our beloved planet, Earth. From one corner of the globe, to the other, it's tidal waves, and earthquakes, and typhoons, galore.With the moon now knocked right out of phase, and city-sized fragments of it actually plummeting (at super-sonic speed, no less) towards Earth - Our handsome, blonde hero, Flash Gordon (New York Jets football star) steps in, between touchdowns, to save the day. (Oh! - What a relief!!) Joining the brave, young Flash in this fantastically dangerous "Rescue Mother Earth" Mission are, none other than, Dale Arden, Prince Barin, and Dr. Zarkow. Along with the aid of the mighty Hawkmen, this unstoppable team of gung-ho Space Cadets are now ready to kick Ming's merciless ass, once, and for all. Believe me - It's gonna be a "do-or-die" battle like the galaxy has never seen before. And, that's the truth.Can this magnificent "All-American" team of ultimate do-gooders rectify that which is wrong? Can they rightfully banish Ming to his proper place amongst the stars?.... Check out Flash Gordon the next time you crave some pure "Sci-Fi" silliness, and find out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so bad it's really camp. Almost every role is played over the top by each actor. The actors range from the absurdly horrible (Timothy Dalton, Sam Jones &amp; Melody Anderson) and the capable but hysterically overacting (Von Sydow and Topol). The costumes are really over the top and garish. The music still holds up, basically due to its rise to iconic status. Some of the characters are so bad you hope Ming will get one of them. Frankly Max Von Sydow plays Ming so over the top that you find yourself hoping he'll prevail. I see the set decorators wisely steered away from using wallpaper. The stars overact so much it would all be burned off.Having said all of this, I still love this movie. Its such enjoyable fun. I think mostly because Von Sydow and Peter Wyngarde are having such a good time -- its sad when Wyngarde's character dies. He's so tasty a character.</fullReview>

It's the tale of Flash Gordon, quarterback for the New York Jets, who gets accidentally launched into space. After being captured by Ming the Merciless, he must unite the various races of aliens to fight Ming. Between the beginning and end, you'll see some of the cheesiest special effects and silliest costumes ever. And somehow in only knowing each other 12 hours, Flash meets, dates and picks out children's names with the female co-star."Flash! Oooooo-ooohhhh!!!" is Queen's battle call. What more can I say about this film? It's hilarious! I mean, I wish I could say all sorts of really nice things about the plot and whatnot, but it's just not in me. There are some good fight scenes, though - especially the one where Flash and the Baron are bull-whipping each other. Oh, heck, just watch this movie. You know you want to.

		<fullReview>by some of the reviews I've read, it looks like it doesn't take too much to entertain many of you.This was another one of Universal Studios' late 1970's attempts to throw another out a sci-fi adventure to ride the profiting coat tails of the Star Wars phenomenon that was still red hot. (Other big budghet attempts by Universal Studios to ride the coat tails of Star Wars were Battlestar Galactica &amp; Buck Rodgers in the 25 Century- of which both were double released as both a Television Show and Theatrical Movie). The only thing that Univeral Studios did different with Flash Gordon was that they never crossed it over from the big screen and into a TV series like they had done with Buck Rodgers &amp; Battlestar Galactica.Queen's music sountrack is as silly as this movie.The Good news is that I really belive that somewhere down the road (several years from now) someone is going to re-do this into a major big budget remake, with glorious space battles, great visual effects and lot and lots of action....The Bad new is that was what this 1980 version was suppossed to be exactly what I described that the future version should be... and this movie fails on many many levels.The acting is terrible, the plot is okay(could have been better) the action is comical, music stinks and the special effects are the equivalent to a low budget film. - What were they thinking??So what was Universal Studios thinking?? - well I already answered that question with my first paragraph, they(Universal Studios) were thinking that had to get a sci-fi adventure film out into the market as quick as possible to ride the coat tails of the success of Star Wars an turn over a quick and easy proffit, Universal Studios only purchased rights to the use name Flash Gordon because of its name recognition (they had done the same thing with Buck Rodgers in 1979)In 1980 Flash Gordon was not the first time in the late 70's/early 80's that Universal Studios tried to ride the coat tails of Star Wars. What is interesting is that it would be thier last attempt to do it. After Flash Gordon was released in 1980 it was appearent that Universal Studios were never going to have thier own Star Wars.Universal Studios attempts to ride the coat tails of the success of Star Wars1978 Battlestar Galactica (perhaps thier best and most noble effort- in some ways it was better than star wars)1979 Buck Rodger in the 25th Century (pure plotless outter space disco)1980 Flash Gordon (you already know)1980 Galactica 1980 (why, O lord Why did they make this god awful show?)1981 Buck Rodgers in the 25th Century (it was rivised for season two, only aired on the BBC in Great Brittian - it was cancelled in the U.S. in 1979</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen a good amount of awful movies recently. Two of which were just this week. It feels as if I don't write reviews for bad movies very often, so I decided to do so. The second one i'm writing for, I just watched last night, and it's the camp classic Flash Gordon. I had never seen it before, and I wish that I could get my two hours back.Flash Gordon(Sam Jones) is a quarterback/ space hero who has to defeat the emperor Ming(Max Von Sydow, for some reason) on the planet Mong, and must also save his girlfriend who Ming wants to marry. But in doing so, he has to make peace with the others on Mong and form an alliance.Some may defend Flash Gordon, as some have defended Waterworld, but trust me, this is worse than Waterworld. I don't know where to begin with the awful-ness of this film. It's so corny, mind-dumbingly so. All of the dialogue is ridiculous. There's a moment in which Flash is fighting a prince(Timothy Dalton, for some reason) and Flash's girlfriend yells, "Flash, I love you! But we only have 14 hours to save the planet!" Are you convinced. The movie is too funny for words.It's strange that Von Sydow and Dalton actually went on to do things after this. We all make mistakes. But the film's hero, Sam Jones, never did anything. He makes an appearance in Ted, but other than that, he's never done anything. Well, with a film like this on your resume, you don't deserve a career. I can't put my finger on what is so terrible about this film, but you'll have to see it for yourself. Then, you'll know.D-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Or, "Why Lorenzo Simple only ever wrote one good film."Yes folks, it's me again. I'm not done with film. Luck willing, I'll be back in the business of making films and pitching a series.But enough about me. Let's talk about the travesty of the 1980 Dino de Laurentis B-movie sci-fi retelling of the old Flash Gordon serial. Who do we blame for this careless execution in abysmal styling of cinema? Do we again put the onus of blame on Dino himself? The man whose probably brought us more high budget B-movie trash than American International?Err.. yes and no. "Flash Gordon" is an American creation. Created by Americans, for Americans, with an American mindset. A smart high society athlete, America's best, is pitted against the sinister mettle of Ming the Merciless, whose fiendish plot is domination (if not destruction) of the planet Earth.The original Flash Gordon was primitive where special effects were concerned, but the stories themselves really moved. They captured the thrill of true adventure, only instead of the darkest reaches of Africa, or some far off exotic Orient setting, we were taken to a different world (albeit with a somewhat Asian flavor). There was drama, daring- do, close shaves, feats of rescue, and even some hi-jinx. When the original Flash Gordon series ended, the Queen of Mars was introduced to revive the serial. Once again Doctor Zarkov and Dale Arden assisted Flash Gordon in thwarting the diabolical machinations of the would be ruler of the universe. Flash Gordon was popular for a reason. It captured the imaginations of the young theatre goers, and was truly a spirit of Americana.So why in the world would a third-string B-movie director try his hand at "recreating" the magic of Flash Gordon, and give the project to someone who had one-good film under his screen writing belt, with the rest being utter flops, no-names, or otherwise disasters? I speak of none-other than Lorenzo Simple Junior who, by HIS VERY OWN WORDS ON THE FEATURETTE on the collector's edition DVD, (and I kid you not if you haven't seen it), STATED that Flash Gordon was an Italian comic book creation.Oh my.Okay, let's set the way-back machine for the early-mid 70s, and George Lucas has come off a couple of successful films, and is looking to pitch another idea. Initially he wanted to update Flash Gordon, but King Features, the scourge of Intellectual Properties that they are (and always have been... and probably always will be) either denied him the opportunity, or asked for way too much money to get the project done.Ergo, Lucas's fertile imagination trumps both King Features and their Flash Gordon property by creating his own space opera saga. Now... what was it? Oh yeah... "Star Wars"... whatever happened with that? ;-)Meanwhile, King Features suffers the results of their own stupidity, and tries to revitalize their missed opportunity by letting the biggest B- movie mogul have a whack at Flash Gordon.Oh my... again.You know, I have to admit, I find the 1980 color version a guilty pleasure in kamp cinema. I really do. Max Von Sydow, ironically enough, is the perfect Ming the Merciless for an updated Flash Gordon feature, but the story telling, the SFX (even for a silly-respin) are just plain awful and insulting.In short, Lorenzo Simple and Laurentis did to Flash Gordon what the Salkinds did with the Superman sequels. They trashed them until the properties became parodies of themselves.At some point money really needs to be thought of as an investment into a product that needs to thrive to create more money. But these morons beat a broken horse neighing on the proverbial cobblestone road until it was dead. What's worse is that they did it with a smile, and claimed utter success, EVEN AFTER TRASHING THE VERY THING THEY WERE TRYING TO HONOR.Wow. How low do you have to be? What kind of sociopathic creature stoops that low to wantonly and ignorantly destroy beauty, and by this I mean Flash Gordon. Who? Simple Jr and de Laurentis, that's who. And I'll toss in the Salkinds in there as well for good measure.Flash Gordon, Italian?Huh?Well, "Three Days of the Condor" it ain't, and even then I'm sure Simple's contribution was probably to format the script pages and nothing more.In short, give this one a pass as a serious film. Heck, everyone else has.</fullReview>

Which brings me to another point.Now was it me or was the main Villain's assistant the step brother of Dr. Doom cause seriously, he looks just like him. The main Villain also look like Iron Man arch foe with all the rings and !@#$ and that Chinese look.But really as crazy and as stupid the movie is, you will be entertained by the movie and how crazy and how stupid it really is.It also contains the best quote in a movie I've ever heard."Flash, I love you but we only have 14 hours to save the Earth!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's supposed to be campy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review does NOT contain spoilers. I will make references to certain characters but will not describe any particular situation or plot element.It boggles my mind when I see a movie review that complains about the campiness of a movie when the movie is supposed to be campy! Characterizations were perfect: The people of Earth are supposed to be from a place of relative normalcy while everything from Mongo is over-the-top. So Flash is confused and amazed, Dale is not as flashy as the Princess, and the professor is a mad scientist - but in a good way. Don't rag on their characters for this; celebrate it! They are all just as they should be and the actors did a fine job with their roles.Every time I played this movie, it was a hit. I wore out my VHS and need to get a DVD. But, the DVD is out of production and used copies are selling for about $100US at the time of this review. Obviously, a lot of people are voting with their wallet that this movie rates more than a 6!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film to be severely irritating and tacky. Flash Gordon resembles a zealous fitness fanatic as he traverses space dressed in lycra and using what appears to be some sort of treadmill as his main form of transportation. Also, the flying monkeys/humans, which I am supposing must either be a complete yet poorly done copy of those in "The Wizard of Oz" or the missing links between chimpanzees, humans and bats. Sadly, "The Wizard of Oz" despite being made nearly fifty years beforehand had higher quality special effects as concerns flying primates. The costumes are atrocious, really, I hope whoever designed them got stiffed on their salary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Highly promoted at the time of its release, I was horribly, horribly disappointed as I sat in the cinema, asking myself why, why did a movie studio have to make such a dog's dinner of a classic comic strip? At least the early serials had the sense to inject some humour. This abomination was a reflection of the flared jeans and other horrible memories of the late 1970s! To see something closer to the comic strip, you really can't go better than the brilliant parody, 'Flesh Gordon'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always tough to say why you have so many fond feelings and memories when you watch movies like Flash Gordon. The flick clearly lacks many qualities - but then, when I watch the first Star Wars movie today, I am shocked that I once liked that. Saying that, Flash Gordon is a timeless marvel of big-screen trash. Some of the costumes, some acting, some plot points, are so hilarious that it's hard to believe anyone ever made that. But in the end it works all nicely. It is just perfect entertainment and the trashy elements don't affect the impact of the film in a negative way. I am sure this movie will soon be cult (maybe it already is). So all thumbs up for this great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The famous comic book hero Flash Gordon is whisked onto the silver screen with lots of red &amp; gold hues and a fabulous musical score by Queen. If you can somehow manage to edit all the characters &amp; dialog out and just watch the Doug Trumball (Close Encounters) cloud effects &amp; listen to the Queen score you just might have something here. Acting = 0 Special Effects = 9. The actors are so bad that the following proposed lineup would have been 10 times better... Ozzie Osbourne replaces Sam J. Jones as Flash. Teri Garr plays the love interest Dale Arden replacing Melody Anderson. Richard Dawson steps in as Dr. Hans Zarkov bumping off Topal (Named after the smokers toothpaste. Curious.) And finally Danny Devito brings up the rear as Ming The Merciless giving Max Von Sydow the Heismann. If this cast would be better, just imagine the cast that's already stuck inside this movie! OK, I'll be nice now. Fun to watch, bad acting, catch it if it's raining outside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an amazing film: set in the HISTORY of the imaginary, this human tale of courage and badge, of honor and glory, of fantasy and the future Chinese present tense, will inspire to be careful with those "burritos": you will begin to experience gases in your stomach which are of another atmosphere. Think of guacamole: of what color is made the book -PAUL ET VIRGINIE- by St. Pierre and how much did Paris cost you? -FLASH- say cheese: your red eyes as a cherry will blow any horn in the industry. S-G? Think again: who's your daddy pappy? Homosexuals have been around the Colliseum since the Roman Empire but this futuristic tale will bring Japanese tears to your eyes! After the Futbol catch, Flash is instructed by the camera not to move and drop the ball: the angle will work at a hidden location (invisibe to the human eye). Once the -PANOPTICUM- recognizes Flash has catched the ball, it acknowledges Flash in his cry for the life of the King: he jumps his balls and screams at the mirror: LONG LIVE THE KING! A most infamous line reads: "... to bring back his body!" A command by a counter-intelligence spy working at the Cornell University. The failure of the expectations of the desired commands of the average public, which includes a set of English, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Arab speaking people (the six official languages of the United Nations)is at the end when a Dracula-like recuperates the perennial ring -the GRAAL- from the ashes of the surface of a floor and laughs at the punch-line of the same closing experience: it is an open-end film, where the remembrances of the public are in the music score, fantastic, safe and sane, punctual. Flash is about the dream of knowing if you are at the Moon or at Planet Earth, because the Sun cannot obviously carry your body, unless you are crazy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprised Jane Fonda wasn't in this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was about 5 years old this was the best film ever made. While I now disagree with the man I once was, I nonetheless find it difficult to completely dismiss my affection for this three-legged donkey of a movie. After all, stupidity and an eagerness to please are loveable features in a puppy, so why not a movie?What's wrong with this movie? Sorry, there's a word limit. What's right with it? Nothing really springs to mind.I'm being harsh. Max Von Sydow is clearly having a great time pretending to be in charge of the universe (and I dare to suggest his Ming might be considered definitive); Peter Wyngarde is likewise having fun as Klytus, a sort of Darth Vader-as-voiced-by-George Sanders, and Brian Blessed gives perhaps the deepest and most profound exploration you will ever see of the character 'Big Loud Man With Beard'.Sam J. Jones looks kind of bewildered. And who indeed can blame him? There are still parts of this film which stand up today - the space rockets are still hilarious, the music still wonderfully ludicrous, and all the colours still optic nerve-fryingly scarlet. Topol is nuts (presumably he finally fell off that roof and landed on his head... well it's difficult to balance AND play a musical instrument I expect). Ornella Muti is... erm, quite striking.The only real penguins in the nunnery are Timothy Dalton as Robin Hood, and Melody Anderson as Dale Arden, who's just too damn wet. Then again, I have a theory that big macho Flash has his masculinity so undermined by the aggressive women he encounters on Mongo that he only feels unthreatened in the company of a flaccid romantic foil like Dale (with whom he exchanges perhaps three conversations before proposing marriage). Frankly, I suspect that whole Flash/Dale thing is an attempt by Flash to cover up his real sexuality. Sadly we never got a sequel so we didn't find out. Alas.Final Thought: If Barbarella and Flash Gordon got married, would their kid have been called Fifth Element?</fullReview>

Terrible effects, a story filled with plot holes, and, oh yes, hot ladies! Basically, this is what happens when members of hair bands get together and decided to try their hand at writing science fiction. Its like creating a play with your old He-Man figurines while you're on acid. I can appreciate how the producers tried to stay true to the look and feel of the old Flash Gordon cartoons. But some of the costumes are just flippin' ridiculous, especially the lizard people. Its like a costume, inside of a costume from a second grade play. And watching the hawkmen fly is too hysterical for words. If birds could fly in slow motion, this is what they would look like. It amazes me even more to see actors like Timothy Dalton, Max Von Sydow and the guy who played Tevi in "Fiddler on the Roof" in this trash. Rent it for your kids, but that's it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Post-Modernist Exercise in High Camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My theory is that "Flash Gordon" was the cinema's equivalent of "Springtime for Hitler" from "The Producers"- a film deliberately made to be as bad as possible, presumably because its makers needed to make a loss for tax purposes. Take a cliché-ridden science-fiction plot, a wooden leading man and a heroine with the looks and personality of a Barbie doll, corny dialogue (sample: "Flash, Flash, I love you, but we only have fourteen hours to save the Earth!"), cheesy and unconvincing special effects, a psychedelic colour scheme and a manic visual style suggesting that both the set designer and the costume designer were on acid at the time; the result should have been complete turkey of a film. Rather surprisingly, it wasn't. "Flash Gordon" was Britain's entry in the cinematic space race launched by the huge success of "Star Wars" in 1977. Sensibly, the film-makers realised that the British cinema lacked the huge budgets to compete with the Americans on their own terms by making a serious space epic, so they decided to play it for laughs. "Star Wars" itself, although it had moments of humour to cater for children who preferred to watch two amusing robots rather than listen to endless cod-philosophy about "The Force", was an essentially serious film. "Flash Gordon", although it has a similar plot about an evil ruler seeking galactic domination and being opposed by a motley group of heroes, is anything but. It is not quite a deliberate parody of the space epic genre like Mel Brooks's "Spaceballs", but rather an exercise in high camp with the parody implied rather than explicit.The plot, such as it is, features Flash Gordon, an all-American star football player who travels with his girlfriend Dale Arden and an eccentric scientist named Hans Zarkov to the planet Mongo whose Emperor, Ming the Merciless, is threatening to destroy the Earth. Ming's attempt to have Flash executed is frustrated by his beautiful but treacherous daughter Princess Aura, who has fallen in love with him, and thereafter Flash and Dale join forces with Aura's lover Prince Barin and Vultan, king of a race of winged humans known as Hawkmen, to try and overthrow the tyrant.Given that the film is supposed to be wholly tongue-in-cheek it does not really matter that the plot is so much nonsense or that Sam Jones as Flash and Melody Anderson as Dale could not act their way out of a paper bag. (I was interested to note that Anderson, according to your "trivia" page, has a masters degree in social work; further evidence that there is no essential correlation between intellect and acting ability). The rest of the cast are a mixed bunch. Ornella Muti as Aura is clearly a refugee from the same Barbie factory as Anderson, but, surprisingly, the worst performance comes from Timothy Dalton. Dalton seems quite unaware that he is supposed to be camping it up and plays Barin with the po-faced seriousness he was later to bring to James Bond. On the other hand, Topol as Zarkov, Max von Sydow as Ming and, most of all, Brian Blessed as Vultan all throw themselves into their roles with gusto but without taking themselves too seriously.I cannot agree with the reviewer who found the film "racist". The original "Flash Gordon" series from the thirties probably did have a racial sub-text reflecting American fears of Japanese intentions in the Pacific and a general prejudice against Orientals in general. (The name "Ming" is taken from the Chinese dynasty, and "Mongo" is probably derived from "Mongol"). This film, however, lacks any racist intentions. Although von Sydow's Ming does look vaguely oriental, the other villains (Aura, for example) are obviously Caucasian. Ming's loyal servant Klytus speaks with an upper-class English accent. (Possibly parodying C-3PO from "Star Wars").It is perhaps significant that this film was made in the year 1980. The seventies had been the "decade that taste forgot", a period of riotous camp excess. (Queen, the quintessentially seventies kings of glamour rock, provide the soundtrack). The eighties were to be the decade that invented the concept of post-modernist irony. Both these concepts are present in "Flash Gordon" in abundance. It is obviously camp and over-the-top, but in a detached, ironical way. For all its weaknesses , there is much here to enjoy for anyone with a sense of humour. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadful....just dreadful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the old Buster Crabbe serial from the 1930s. The plot is pretty much the same--Flash is a super-hero from the present who is Earth's hope against the vicious Ming the Merciless. And, like the original, the doctor and Flash's hot girlfriend are along for the ride.1979-1980 were not great years for cinema--mostly because these were among the most garish and tacky years in human history. Tons of loud and annoying films came out these years that simply can't be matched. Think about it--XANADU, THE APPLE, ROLLER BOOGIE, CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC and FLASH GORDON all came out during this two year stretch--proving that the final years of disco were dreadful for film audiences. All featured exceptionally garish music and costumes--so bold and tacky that you have to see it to believe it.What is so amazing about FLASH GORDON is despite it looking tacky in every possible way, it was actually a big-budget film--with music from Queen and expensive special effects. Oddly, however, while Queen was a great rock group (one of my favorites), their tunes were just god-awful and stupid--blaring insipidly throughout the film. And the special effects just looked cheesy and loud.Even more odd is that despite spending money on music and special effects, the script looks pretty sad and many of the actors are second-rate. Why they chose a complete unknown like the ultra-bland Sam Jones to play the lead is a mystery. Also, for formerly respected international stars like Max Von Sydow, Timothy Dalton and Topol (Tevye from FIDDLER ON THE ROOF), it's a mystery why they would sign on to co-star in such a sad effort.Overall, this is bad film and nothing really works. A complete incompetent mess on every level. However, take heart--it is so bad, so silly and so full of cheese that it's a bit of a cult favorite as bad film fans love to watch it and laugh at its ineptitude. Some prime bad scenes involve the football scene, watching the hawk-men fly as well as the 2000 times you hear Queen inanely blare out "FLASH...Ahh, ahh!!!"--you just need to see and hear it to believe it. If you like bad film, then by all means watch it. Otherwise, stay clear--it is one giant and resounding bomb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He'll annoy every one of us!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot really fathom the relatively good ratings and comments about this film. Utterly dreadful and among the worst I have seen, it seems to me designed simply to annoy intelligent people. This despite the presence of several good actors and direction by Mike Hodges. Hodges directed the 1971 masterpiece Get Carter, a fact that alone is enough to ensure him a high place in my regard. I therefore find it kind of unsettling to see that he actually worked on this irritating waste of film.In part, the dreadfulness of this film is a result of the source material itself. Horribly dated and oozing with old-fashioned prejudice and racism, the characters have little place in the modern world. Probably the most glaring example is the fact that the deceitful, conniving baddies are the obviously Asian Ming and his "Mongo people" while the good guys are all Caucasian types and Flash is every inch the jock Nordic/Anglo-Saxon golden boy. Such obvious use of stereotyping and prejudice turns me off, to say the least. Such prejudice, while never admirable, is one thing in the context of the 1930s, but utterly inexcusable in 1980. I fault the makers of this film because this should have been obvious. This factor alone, in my opinion, ruins the film.Moreover, although the basic story (sans the racism, etc.) could have been reworked to make something that, while corny and campy, is at least imaginative and fun, no-one appears to have bothered to do that. The story is mundane, clichéd and tired, with no attempt even to take advantage of these traits. Those who made this film at least could have shown that they knew the material was goofy and clichéd and used this to advantage. They do not and instead give every impression of playing it straight. One might argue that this itself is supposed to be part of the fun, since playing comedy or clichés straight can be utterly brilliant and hilarious. Here, though, the movie simply seems so truly bad, so genuinely straightforward, that I find it impossible to believe this is intentional. A goofy, clichéd movie that knows it is goofy and clichéd can be wonderful. One that does not know it is goofy and clichéd is not fun; it is simply goofy and clichéd. To add to this film's woes, the "special effects", so called, are utterly ridiculous. Again, elsewhere someone might have taken advantage of cheap special effects, but not here.Finally, the "soundtrack", if one calls it that, is beyond dreadful. It is incredibly cretinous, annoying and, most unfortunately, unforgettable. I don't know if I shall ever rid my memory of "Flash, aaaaaahhhh!" or "He'll save every one of us!" Those horrid lines were repeated ad nauseum, it seemed, and, despite the passage of years, occasionally resurface in my mind. I have to say that, as with the glaring racism, this defect alone renders the film unwatchable. This is one example of a phenomenon, rather amazing to me, whereby a film with talented people in the end bears no discernible trace of their talents. Had it not been for the truly awful "soundtrack" and the failure to avoid the old racism of the original, this would have been at least bearable, but still no better than a low-mediocre film. As it is, though, this film stands out in my mind as a highly irritating and unpleasant bit of drivel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heaven knows that the Flash Gordon adventure serials of yesteryear were never "great" film-making, but they were terrific fun and very appealing. The same descriptions cannot be tagged onto this bombastic, campy and thoroughly unwatchable mess. Some films are so bad that they are funny - this falls into the category of so bad it is just bad. The story is nearly non-existent with howlingly bad dialog. Max von Sydow seems to be having fun as Ming the Merciless, but the majority of the supporting cast is made up of decent actors that were hopefully well paid for disgracing themselves. Much could have been salvaged had the leads been any good. Unfortunately, we are stuck with the lackluster Sam J. Jones and Melody Anderson, as Flash Gordon and girlfriend Dale Arden. Jones' biggest accomplishment at this point had been as a Playgirl centerfold and to say that he has limited range is an understatement. Sporting an unflattering blond dye job, Jones' physique gives his performance. He has zero charisma and even less comic timing. Action-wise, he seems oddly wimpy as though waiting for his stunt man to hurry in and finish the scene. He and co-star Anderson are well paired in that they are both dreadful. Anderson is as lovely as her leading man, but utterly incapable of demonstrating an emotion or a credible line reading. Her affectless speech to co-star Ornella Muti about not attempting to kill Ming after her forced marriage to him because a wife must support her husband is an especially surreal moment in bad acting. Horrible visual effects fail to save the day. It seems inconceivable that Mike Hodges of Get Carter fame directed this film, which seems to be more in line with a first-time amateur director's fatal misstep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a few childish films I have liked since being one, and this one which a critic called better than Star Wars is still one of them, from producer Dino De Laurentiis (Barbarella, Hannibal) and director Mike Hodges (Get Carter). Basically American quarterback football star Flash Gordon (Sam J. Jones, who has his voice dubbed) and the beautiful Dale Arden (also cheesy Melody Anderson) are skyjacked by Doctor Hans Zarkov (Topol) who wants to blast into space to investigate violent red lightning storm and falling moon rock. They are sucked into the vortex leading to the alien world of Mongo, controlled by the dastardly Emperor Ming the Merciless (Max Von Sydow) who has been causing the "natural" disasters on Earth. He plans to destroy the Earth with the collision of the moon, and he has Flash executed in the gas chamber, but the gorgeous Princess Aura (Ornella Muti) saves his life and they start the journey to save Earth. While they go to get try and get help from Prince Barin (Timothy Dalton) and the people of Arboria, Dale, intended to be Ming's concubine, and Zarkov escape to get the help of rival Prince Vultan (Brian Blessed) and the Hawkmen. After a fight with Prince Barin, Flash does get him on side, and eventually Vultan as well, and they form an army to start a rebellion against Mongo and Ming. In the end, Ming and his ring of powers are defeated when he is killed, and Mongo is free, Barin becomes the new king, Vultan becomes leader of the armies, and Flash is praised as the hero, oh, and someone grabs the empty power ring. Also starring Peter Wyngarde as Klytus, Mariangela Melato as General Kala, Richard O'Brien as Fico, Robbie Coltrane as Man at Airfield and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Deep Roy as Princess Aura's Pet. Both Jones and Anderson are cheesy in their roles, but that adds to the charm, Muti is fantastic looking in her costumes and being witty, but I agree Sydow does steal the show a bit as the villain. The story is simple, the performances are corny, the special effects and action sequences are good cheesy fun, and the overall camp feel is like being at a pantomime, but that is what makes it such fun. Credit must be given to Queen, who created such fantastic music for the film, and of course the opening song "Flash", overall a most watchable science-fiction fantasy adventure. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Original Film Music. It was number 64 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a kid I loved this film but I recently picked up the DVD and sat down to relive all those happy childhood memories. What a mistake that was! The plot has Ming threatening to destroy the earth via numerous weather induced catastrophes and eventually making the moon crash into the earth. Flash and Dale crash land in a plane at the lab of Dr Hans Zharkov and crawl from the wreckage without even a bruise. They are greeted by Hans Zharkov who asks if they are hurt and I suspect you want to use the telephone. Come on, like after a plane crash you wouldn't be hurt, in shock, worried about the plane blowing up and want to get away from it etc.The phone booth is really Hans Zharkov's rocket which he plans to use to launch a counterattack to save the earth. He plans to do this armed with a 6 shooter and no extra ammo. At least give him some decent guns and a few marines or something who could get killed later.They blast off fly through a ropey painting of some red sky which is spun around to give it some depth, land and are captured. They are taken to Mings palace which looks like a carnival in Rio. Flash spots Princess Aura in Mings palace and Dale who he met for the first time on the plane and has spoken a few words to suddenly berates him for looking at another woman. Sorry love but shes better looking and Flash isn't your property! Flash fights the guards in a mildly enjoyable football fight and is then sentenced to death. He is rescued by Princess Aura (who uses a doctor who she is knocking off to give him an injection) and taken to Arboria to the Barron who is supposed to be Auras lover (like you would take someone you fancy who's been saved by another one of your lovers round to your boyfriends kingdom - they must all be swingers on Mungo!) Barron plots to kill Flash despite saving him from a rubber beast and they are both taken to Vultans sky city. Barron and Flash fight, Flash saves his life and all of a sudden they are best mates. Mings secret policeman (dressed in black and wearing a mask Darth Vader anyone) turns up and Barron and Flash kill him. Vultan has to flee before his kingdom is blasted to atoms but is still happy to hear that Flash survived and helps him to attack Mings rocket Ajax.Why does the commander of War rocket Ajax stop all engines when attacked by the hawk-men. Basic military strategy would say use your speed to distance yourself and blast them or fly back to Mings and get some reinforcements but then that wouldn't help the film. A battle follows which is about as exciting as watching grass grow.Flash takes over the rocket and goes to fly it into Mings palace as there are only 3 and a bit minutes until the moon crashes into the earth. Flash crashes the rocket into Mings city manages to pierce Ming with the spike on the cone of the ship but not hurt himself and hence saves the day.Why does Mings death just seconds before the moon crashes into the earth suddenly stop the moon from crashing into the earth? Answer it wouldn't. Why is Ming getting married when the moon is about to destroy the earth - wouldn't he watch that first and then get married? Basically this is an awful film if you are over 10 years old, rubbish acting, terrible effects, and a plot with too many holes in it. If you are under 10, like amateur dramatics and like to watch bad films to see just how bad they are then watch this otherwise don't bother. The one saving grace is the music by Queen buy the soundtrack instead of the DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can it really be more tacky or is it second degree ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cake like metropolis, tacky hero, flashy colours and low quality special effects... What a SH..show ! and why did Max von Sidow and Ornella Mutti did put their name behind that ?Please watch this movie in a second degree state of mind... it might therefore come out as shiny as vinyl, as sweet as English jelly, as camp as a row of tents....</fullReview>
