		<fullReview>In `13 Conversations About One Thing,' the `one thing' that everyone keeps having conversations about is whether or not happiness is possible in a world that seems to be made up of little more than a series of random events haphazardly strung together. Just as everything seems to be going your way, an unexpected and unforeseen `event' may knock you completely off course, thereby depriving you of that `happiness' you felt, moments before, lay just within your grasp. This view of life seems to be rather popular among filmmakers this year, having also been explored in some depth in the sci-fi thriller `Signs' this summer. `13 Conversations' takes a more low-keyed approach, providing a series of interlocking vignettes from everyday life that, when pieced together, provide a possible answer to life's ultimate question. Writers Karen and Jill Sprecher (the latter also directed the film) have fashioned a complex narrative involving a number of characters whose paths cross in bizarre and often shocking ways. In fact, the film is rather unique in that the structure actually BECOMES the theme, as we discover that events that seem random to us - and indeed to the characters - at the outset actually come together to form a meaningful pattern. As one character says at the end of the film, life really only makes sense when we take the time to look back on it, for it is only from that perspective that we are able to discern the overarching pattern and meaning of it all.All of the many characters in the film are struggling not only to define happiness but to attain a measure of it for themselves in a world in which they are made to feel like mere helpless pawns, blown about by the whims of `fortune,' `luck,' `chance,' `fate,' whatever one wants to call the `power' that seems to determine the courses our lives end up taking. Matthew McConaughey plays a handsome and successful public defender who feels that he has achieved happiness in his career only to have it ripped from him when he runs over a young woman at a corner and leaves the scene of the crime. The woman herself (Clea Duvall), before the accident, is a sincere believer in a higher power that watches over us and guides us along the path it most wants us to take. Yet, after the accident, she loses that belief, coming instead to see life as a chaotic jumble of chance circumstances, devoid of meaning and purpose. John Turturro plays a college professor suffering from the classic symptoms of major midlife crisis. He abandons his wife (Amy Irving), conducts a meaningless affair with a coworker, and finds no relevance or fulfillment in his teaching job or in the students he could be guiding and helping. As a Physics teacher, he knows that the universe is NOT random, that it does, in fact, operate within a series of finely proscribed natural laws. Perhaps this is why he is the one character who actually tries to buck `fate' and to take proactive measures to change the course of his life. The problem is that the course change brings him no more satisfaction than did his previous life path. Perhaps, most fascinating of all is Alan Arkin, a businessman so unhappy with his own life that he takes pleasure in ruining the life of a co-worker who seems somehow to have attained the happiness that has eluded the rest of us.`13 Conversations About One Thing' is definitely a movie that grows on you. Like `Go' a few years back, the makers of this film respect the intelligence of their audience. They gather the strands of their story slowly, thereby allowing us to make connections and to eventually come up with the theme on our own. As the film's director, Jill Sprecher never hurries us along. In fact, much of the profundity of the screenplay is brought out by the elegiac, lyrical tone she establishes throughout. The quiet, unhurried pacing of the scenes puts the audience into a reflective state of mind that helps us see beneath the deceptively simple surface of the film's action.McConaughey, Duvall, Turturro and Irving are all outstanding in this film, but it is Arkin who soars in the key role of the disgruntled businessman. His sad-faced, understated portrayal of a man so caught up in petty bitterness that he will willfully destroy a harmless fellow human being to make himself feel a bit less miserable is shattering in its brilliance. He has truly never been better. Ditto for the other actors, for this is a great ensemble cast, even though most of the performers never appear in any scenes together.`13 Conversations About One Thing' is a film that feels like it has REALLY BEEN THOUGHT OUT ahead of time, not thrown together in haphazard fashion as so many other films appear to be. And that, given the theme of the film, is exactly the point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrific Ensemble in a Provocative Conversation Starter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I launched immediately into a conversation about this film before the end credits had even finished rolling. It's the kind of film that makes you want to apply some of its ideas and themes to your own life and experiences.At first I was worried. When the film began, I thought it was going to be an episodic experimental piece, with 13 different scenes each dealing with an aspect of happiness. This bothered me, because the first segment of the film left me wanting more of the same story and I would have been disappointed if the screenplay had never come back to it. However, the first few segments that seem at first to be unrelated begin to mesh in a fluid way (but never in a way that feels forced), and what happens in one begins to illuminate the actions and feelings in another.Because of it's episodic nature, the actors don't get a lot of room to flesh out their characters, but the performances are still strong. Alan Arkin is especially good (he always is).This one comes highly recommended.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 Conversations is amazing. I don't say this lightly, but I would count it, perhaps, as one of the best movies I have ever seen. Concise, thoughtful, smart, perfectly woven. I have watched it a few times, and each time, it inspired me and made me think. The dialogue was economic; the shooting exact. The music was brilliant. Casting was terrific, and acting, excellent. The DP and gaffing work were masterful, as the film's colors were so clean and fresh, it made you think it wasn't New York City, but rather, any city -- allowing the story to breathe and blossom. That is a real achievement for a film set in NYC. In short, everything in the film was just as it should be -- fitting its own story perfectly, representing its thoughts, its characters, its themes with seemingly effortless grace and poetry. I am amazed that the Sprecher sisters aren't major household names with six picture studio deals -- they are talented filmmakers with a unique, creative voice. (It is frustrating today that the lowest common denominator of blockbuster fare seem often to be given more money and coverage than filmmakers like the Sprechers who make true gems.) 13 Conversations is intelligent, moving, and beautiful. Definitely a film to make sure to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a small world,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's rare that a film by an independent filmmaker can pack such a lot in the way of human interaction. Jill Sprecher, inspired by a mugging she suffered, co-wrote the story in which her movie is based, with her sister Karen. Ms. Sprecher shows an insight that is rare in the young directors starting in the business today.If you haven't watched the film please stop reading.The basic idea for the movie seems to be how interconnected we human beings are. This premise is expanded as we watch how all of the characters we see in the film, in one way, or another, share a moment in their existence where they touch each other's lives without even being aware of the fact. Ms. Sprecher weaves a fine web, as she shows the different situations in the movie.Troy, the self-centered lawyer touches Gene's life when both are drinking, for different reasons, at the same bar. Gene is older and wiser; at the time they meet Gene is feeling sorry for himself, having being "downsized" from his job. Troy, being in high spirits, after having won a case in court, looks down to Gene, a man who he perceives as a loser. Troy's own life will go through it's own turmoil after the involuntary accident where he injures a young woman in a deserted street. Instead of helping her, he flees the scene, leaving the girl to what could be a sure death.Gene is the center of the story in many ways. We see him as the man in charge of an insurance claims department. There is a man who works for Gene that is the epitome of good naturedness, a real kind person who is always bringing things for everyone in the office. When Gene is asked to reduce costs in his area, he fires Bowman, the man, who according to logic, must be let go first, being the last one hired. We wonder for a moment if this is just a way for Gene to get back at Bowman, because it appears this man irritates him and his coworkers. Bowman, who up to that moment has been so optimistic about things, immediately becomes a sad man.Walker, the university professor is unhappily married to Patricia. We watch both as their marriage comes to an end. Walker is carrying on an affair with another woman from work; he ends up living alone in a small room. Not only does he lose his wife, but Helen too, the woman he was having the affair with. His life and Troy's meet, if only briefly when he buys the lawyer's car. Walker is in a way responsible for the death of one of his students who is not doing well in the Physics course.Then there is Bea, the young woman who cleans rich people's houses. Together with Dorrie, she fantasizes what it would be like to live in one of those fabulous places. Bea, who almost died when she was a child, is not bitter about her experience. She is a kind soul who is good to everybody, no matter who. Her life and Troy's become entwined in a second without realizing, or knowing him, as his car hits her in the desolate street where she is walking to the house of one of her employers to return the shirt she has just finished resewing for him. After going to her mother's home from the hospital, we see a gradual transformation in Bea. She's still a kind person, but now she has a different attitude toward life and the bad hand she was dealt.This film brought to mind Arthur Schnitzler's play "La Ronde" since the idea is basically the same. We humans tend to overlook the relation we have with one another, and how, in some ways, we touch the life of other people, the same way they touch ours. The acting is first rate. Ms. Sprecher ought to be congratulated in the way she is able to present her story and get outstanding acting by all the principals and even those in small roles. Alan Arkin, as Gene, is amazing. We see in his face how everything is affecting him at all times. John Turturro gives a complex reading of this university professor. Clea DuVall brings such a luminous aura to Bea, that it's impossible not to feel bad for what has been done to her; she gives a subtle performance. Matthew McConaughey's depiction of Troy is good.There are a lot of minor roles by actors of the stature of Shawn Elliott, Frankie Faison, Tia Texada, Rob McElhenney, Barbara Sukowa, and William Wise, who is perfect as Bowman.Congratulations are in order to Jill Sprecher who shows a talent for directing real people in real situations. Judging by this effort, she has the potential of going far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uplifting and Eye Opening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great film. The ties between these disparate stories are wondrously woven, and the sudden eye-opening twists are amazing. The spare music is a perfect backdrop. The acting is marvelous, with Amy Irving as the neglected wife of the melancholy professor and Alan Arkin playing the driven and lugubrious businessman with lots of problems and. I hardly realized who it was until halfway through the movie. I would compare this movie to other great art movies such as My Dinner With Andre, My Brilliant Career, Days of Heaven. It evoked in me similar emotions. If you are feeling down and want a big lift, I highly recommend this wonderful film. It deserves an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It must be quite something to know about screen writing and sit down to a blank sheet of paper. You can start with images, or characters or situations. You have to choose the type of thread and how you trace it, including the key decision about who you are. These sisters take a different approach, very writerly, very clever. They start with the simple question of happiness in a life and come at it from multiple directions, surrounding and probing it. The characters are secondary to the writer's curiosity, and the 'stories' even more incidental. Sometimes you have a film that works with the viewer to grow a world and ideas; here you simply watch as ideas grown on a page are revealed to you. Quite different, precious, but never close to lifealtering or even viscerally engaging.The film itself superficially resembles a 'Short Cuts' or 'Things You Can Tell' in that many story lines are interwoven. But the differences are profound. Altman's projects are driven by characters and situations that touch because they ramble. The 'Things You Can Tell' project is similar to this one in that its several components are all about the same idea. But 'Things' uses the device of one woman in many bodies, each with a different actress. In this project, the device is deliberate diversity of the characters, each facet having a discernible face.I liked it. Its not highly cinematic, rather small theater. Its not the stuff that changes one's imagination. But it is literate, refined, and well woven in terms of the words.As to the actors and their roles, one thing all these multifaceted projects have is the option for the viewer to select a backbone. As a matter of hardwiring we reflexively choose one thread as foreground and the others as background. For me, the anchor was Beatrice, which probably tells you a lot about me. The resurrection from disillusionment (with the opening of the doll's eye!) was a bit heavy so far as the character, but DuVall as an actor really impressed me. All of these actors played characters with an unrecognized inner life. Some, like Turturro work with more self-referential techniques, but with her it seemed true.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The structure of this film is familiar as we see different stories with characters that in some sort of way are connected to one another. The structure is reminiscent of a John Sayles film but this is top notch writing and character development. Directed by Jill Sprecher who also wrote the script with her sister Karen and has a number of very good actors who help raise the level of the material. The film seems to be about characters who make decisions then have to live with the consequences of their actions. Matthew McConaughey is a lawyer who after winning a big case and celebrating hits a woman (Clea DuVall) with his car and leaves the scene of the crime. John Turturro is a teacher who decides to have an affair. Alan Arkin gives the strongest performance in the film, which is no surprise. He works in an insurance office and must let someone go and decides it will be a man who is always happy. This has always irritated Arkins character. He simply cannot understand how anyone could be happy all the time. Later, he feels guilty about his actions and tries to get him another job at another company. Sprecher does a good job of keeping the script simple without going over the top to satisfy a more shallow audience. This is a film that gets more interesting when viewed on more than one occasion. Definitely a film that can be discussed at great lengths considering the realistic and flawed nature of each character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine! A movie with no car chase, no special effects, no big stars, simple piano music, and no special sets. Just ordinary people struggling with daily life and trying to find the secret of happiness. Four basic stories interweave with each other, all examining the same human issues. Alan Arkin practically walks away with all the acting honors, but there are no weak roles or acting. What a joy to watch a profound movie, simply made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is most definitely not my first choice of genres, but still I thought this film was pretty good. The film is a little slow, but it's quite interesting in the end. The characters in the film are really quite interesting and even at the end of the film I wanted to know what else happened to the characters.The acting was good on all accounts, Matthew McConaughey, John Tuturro, Clea DuVall and Alan Arkin all did a fantastic jobs and I really liked all of their characters quite a bit.Even though, I liked the film I wouldn't recommend this to everyone. It's pretty much just a movie about a bunch of people and the things that happen in their lives. I kind of found the movie to be a lot like "Playing By Heart", so if you liked that film, you may like this film. I hope you enjoy the film. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Bitter and Profound Story About Happiness and Unpredictability of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lawyer Troy (Matthew McConaughey), the actuary Gene (Alan Arkin), the physical science professor Walker (John Turturro) and the housecleaner Beatrice (Clea DuVall) have their lives connected through some sort of event. Troy meets Gene in a bar, hits Beatrice on the street and due to the accident, decides to sell his car to Walker. Through this non-chronological connection line, the viewer participates of their personal dramas, all of them relative to happiness and how unpredictable life is. In a moment, each character has a moment of happiness or expectation of a good event in his life, which is changed later due to some unexpected occurrence. The question is `Can we be happy in a world where our destiny is governed by uncertainties?' This movie is a very bitter and profound story about happiness and unpredictability of life. I saw this movie yesterday on cable television and my vote in IMDB User Rating was seven. However, I intend to see this film again (maybe on DVD) and reevaluate my review. I was not aware of the theme of this complex and almost unpleasant story and maybe my first impression was unfair. The direction and the performance of the cast are outstanding, highlighting the acting of the (always) excellent Alan Arkin.Title (Brazil): `Treze Vis?es' (`Thirteen Visions')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-written montage of human events...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film uses similar structure to more recent films, such as "Crash" (not as good) and "Tales of the City" (excellent). It is basically like the "three degrees of separation" idea, in that people, whether they intend to or not, have an affect on others, and their actions resonate in unpredictable ways.Clea Duvall is "Bea" who along with her girlfriend run a house-cleaning service in NYC. She and her friend are barely surviving on wages, while they reflect on those whose expensive apartments and penthouses they clean. Bea develops a crush on an architect which comes to bear later in the story.The academics, is the second category here. John Turturro as Professor Walker, a brilliant, yet suppressed physics professor. He has an affair and his wife (well-portrayed by Amy Irving) becomes fed up.The attorneys, third segment of story, encompasses Matthew McConaughey as "Troy", a slick and successful Assistant D.A. who at first is arrogant, self-assured, and impermeable to life. He thinks, until he is affected by a random accident.The insurance adjusters, another group, and the more amusing segment. Sardonic Alan Arkin again delivers as "Gene", running a department for 20-30 years, hating his job and resenting those who "whistle while they work". He is redeemed as a character however, in that he tries to be a good father, has been through an ego-deflating divorce, and bails his son, an addict, out of prison time and again. Frankie Faison is also a good character here, as "Dick Lacey" another part of Arkin's group who sees the pointlessness of the insurance profession.Each character in one way or another affects the other. Like ripples, subtly. Professor Walker, realizing the futility of the affair, questions one of his students why he wants to be a doctor. This leads to later results, which I won't divulge.Arkin fires a man he at first resents, then pities. Bea (Duvall) at first a happy rather naive character, changes after an accident. Troy (McConaughey) at first denies his reality, then comes to terms with it under a stark realization.This film, written by Jill Sprecher and her sister was written after she in real life, had an injury resulting from an accident. It is an interesting and human story. This is also in the rare category of films which the story will stay with you. You will recall its theme, as it comes through in day-to day life."The mind is its own place, it can make heaven of hell, or hell heaven" (Milton) Highly recommended. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altmanesque</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Robert Altman-style film, but written and directed by women. Several characters ponder what happiness means as they slog through their daily lives. The cast is impeccable, and includes Clea Duvall, Matthew Mc., John Turturro and Alan Arkin, who steals the show amid a very large cast. He plays an embittered, divorced middle manager well past retirement age with a junkie son. On a whim, Arkin commits an irresponsible act that will come back to haunt him. Duvall is an accident victim whose life can never be the same. If you like Altman movies, in all probability you will like this one. All others, beware. No wild car chases, explosions or shoot-outs here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm giving this a solid ten even though it features a physics professor who seems to have little grasp on the subject beyond junior high level. At one point he angrily tells a student that there are "no if's in physics," possibly inspired by Tom Hanks' great line "There's no crying in baseball!" from A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN.The laws of physics are not set in stone. If they were, there would be no need to do further research and publish new textbooks. We could have "the" physics textbook like we have one times table.The First Law of Thermodynamics, the Conservation of Matter, had to be completely rewritten after the dawning of the atomic age. Students who had been forced to memorize this word for word had to memorize a revised version.Other than that, this is one of those movies that I get more out of every time I see it. And the older I get, the more I realize it's truth.If I had to put the topic of the conversations in one word it would be Change. Each of the characters have to cope with changes in their lives, some for the good and some for the bad. If there's anyone who can't identify with that, I don't know what planet they're living on.The way that characters meet up with one another by "chance" makes me wonder if the makers of CRASH are also fans of this movie.This is one of those movies that makes me thankful for home video. We have two nice big multiplexes in our area. But if you have eighteen screens and sixteen are tied up with big budget special effects spectacles (many of which, I note from the IMDb, have grossly underperformed this summer) there's not room for personal independent films.Nice work. I look forward to the film's makers' next project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this film i was amazed that i loved a movie so much that had so little action and was based almost entirely on dialogues, metaphors and combined stories. Although it followed some trends and styles used in films like Crash and Pulp Fiction, 2 of my favorites and also Magnolia which i loved, and in the indie sense and the way it was done, similar to 2 days in the valley which wasn't nearly as good as this. The performances in this film were great, Arkin outshined the cast, giving one of his best performances ever. John Turturro was the next best, in a very memorable performance almost as good as the miracles he performed in stuff like Quiz Show and Barton Fink. He is great here again, also Clea Duvall and Matt McConaughey were very good as well. All in all this is a must see for anybody interested in good films. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having had a two-month opportunity to catch up with some films I've missed during my 43 years, I place this film at the top. The cause of the opportunity: I became unemployed for my first time. The scene where "Gene" gives the pink slip to "Smiley" is a virtual replica of how I was let go. This film is "The Search for Intelligent Signs in the Universe" without a feminist agenda, or any explicit agenda. It is lyrical, and haunting. Jill Sprecher's director's commentary is extremely helpful. She suffered a mugging in her own life and underwent brain surgery as a result. Upon seeing the film I found it quite plausible that only a severe, jolting trauma (a'la Harrison Ford in "Regarding Henry") could thrust a storyteller's perception toward the precision of these insights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I loved this movie and gave it a 10/10. I noticed that writers of the bad reviews for this movie fall into two categories 1) this movie was too intellectual 2) not intellectual enough. For the few who wrote about how this movie failed at its attempt to convey its message or was too "oversimplified" I suggest you relegate (yes relegate) yourself to reading Hume, Schopenhauer, and Rawls in between your yoga lessons and trips to the organic grocery store. For the other group, it's understandable to not want to sit through a movie about the challenges in life. Many want to go the movies to escape and see a story. I have no problem with that... if I payed 10 bucks and didn't know I was walking into a philosophy lecture I'd be mad too. This movie is not for everybody.However, let's not overlook the fact that the film masterfully accomplishes what it set out to do, which is to explore the way people live, their pursuit of happiness, and how both internal and external forces affect their outlook. Alan Arkin is magnificent and the technique of opening each sequence with a quote was nice as well (though originally done in Hannah and Her Sisters I do believe).See this film and talk about it afterwards. To me there are two definitions of a great film: 1) you have to talk about it afterwards 2) one you can't bear the thought of not seeing again. This film fit both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******SPOILERS****** In dept story about a number of New Yorkers who's lives touch each other during the course of the movie and how it in the end changes their lives forever. Even though the movie seems complicated it has a simple and basic answer to a hard and unfeeling world: That faith and optimism are the best reasons to get through life no matter how difficult it is. The movie moves back and forth in time with Gene English, Alan Arkin, and Troy, Matthew McConaughey, in the bar scene at the start and end of the film. Gene runs an insurance office that's in danger of being downsized because of a bad rating it got from an research agency. Gene also has problems with his son Ronnie, Alex Burnes, who's a drug addict and is in and out of court for committing act of larceny to support his habit. On top of all that Gene also has a broken marriage and all those things makes him very unhappy and sarcastic with the people that work in his office, especially those who seem to have a better outlook on life then Gene does. When Gene's told by higher ups to cut down on his staff by letting go those who he feels that he can do without Gene cut the most happiest and optimistic person in the office Wade Bowman, William Wise. Wade to Gene's surprise take it a lot easier then he expected him to, which makes Gene almost wish that he would be more like Wade. Later after Gene's told that there was a vice-president slot opened for him to fill he himself was laid-off. What Gene saw in Wade and how Wade later in the movie got back on his feet by not feeling sorry for himself and with, Wade not knowing it, Gene's help Gene's outlook on life changed for the better. Which made him a wiser if less richer person and seemed to help Gene overcome his sarcasm and bitterness that made him almost impossible to get along with. There's Walker, John Turturro, a collage psychics professor who's cheating on his wife Patricia, Amy Irving, by having an affair with Helen, Barbara Sukowa. Helen is also married and a teacher in the collage where Walker works. When Patricia finds out about Walker's affair she leaves him. Walker also loses Helen when she goes back to her husband to keep him from killing himself after he also found out about her and Walker. Hurt and bitter Walker seems to take out his troubles and frustrations on one of his students Chris Hammond, Rob McElhenney, who ask for help from Walker because of problems that he has at home as well as in school. Being cold and sarcastic toward Hammond's pleas for help and understanding leads Hammond to commit suicide. This has Walker see what his being so self-centered and selfish and thinking only about himself and what's best only for himself can do to all those around him. Troy is a hot shot DA who just won a big case. After celebrating in a local bar with a couple of drinks Troy hits a young woman Beatrice, Clea Du Vall, with his car and leaves her for dead instead of trying to get help. Troy becomes so overcome with guilt over what he did that his whole outlook on him being a DA and putting people away in jail takes a whole new meaning to him. Troy loses his ability to do his job and wants only to find the women that he left for dead and make up for what he did to her.Beatrice the woman who Troy ran over is a sweet and quiet girl who works as a cleaning lady and whatever free time she has goes to church to sing in the church quire. Beatrice always believed that people are good and feels that there are miracles in the world. In a lot of ways Beatrice didn't grow up and develop the cynicism that most people develop by seeing the world for what it or what we feel it is: A cold and unforgiving place. Beatrice loses that child-like belief after her accident and later, which to Beatrice was even worse, after she was released from the hospital. It was then that a person that she worked for accused Beatrice of stealing his expensive watch which to his shock and embarrassment she showed him where she put it, in his dresser draw. Hurt and depressed by losing her faith in all that's good in the world and in peoples goodness one cold afternoon Beatrice just wanted to step off the sidewalk, and into the dangerous city traffic, and end it all. It's then when she saw a man across the street looking at her with a smile on his face, and as if he read her mind subconsciously, telling her that there's still good in the world and that her life is unique and worth living and not to foolishly throw it away. Like a miracle this man restored her faith and got Beatrice out of her depression that almost drove her to kill herself. Wade Bowman who always saw the good and positive side of life no matter how bad things got for him and not only uplifted himself but also uplifted everyone else, no matter how down and out they were, who came in contact with him had me thinking. This made me start to wonder who just was that man who's smile cut through all the cold and selfishness that gave Beatrice back her faith in human values and goodness. This when she thought that it was no longer true and valid after what she went through? I just wonder who that man was?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Putting on a Happy Face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 7.1 (out of 10)?Thirteen Conversations about One Thing': For my money, Jill Sprecher is the best female writer/director we've got working today. Far from the studio romantic comedies of the likes of Nora Ephron, Sprecher focuses her lens on the tiny everyday minutia of life and seeks to find and show some meaning in it all. Her movies work and are so fascinating ? at least the 2 she's made so far - because it seems as though she really believes in it instead of playing to an audience. Also unlike Ephron, Sprecher films will be ones to admit that not everything comes out happy or wrapped up in a neat little package. Her first film, ?Clockwatchers' (1997), knocked me out in this regard (9.0 out of 10). What we thought was going to be a quirky independent film about the wacky shenanigans of 4 women temps became a quiet stewing in the general malaise of office life. That was a film so fresh and surprising that grabbed me and took me for a ride. '13 Conversations' doesn't have that sense of surprise, nor does it have a backdrop at which to base, and bat around, its lofty ideas. With '13 Conversations' Sprecher has set out to make a movie about nothing short of life itself. Sprecher, and co-writer Karen Sprecher, use the now fairly common technique since ?Pulp Fiction' of giving us several seemingly unrelated storylines and cleverly tying them all together before the final scene. I have to admit I love this plot structure, watching it all come together. However, instead of letting the actions and characters inspire us in pontificating the film's greater themes Sprecher puts the cart before the horse, giving us the point and then making it again just in different ways. When the stories do connect it is in moments few and far between. By sidestepping story and characters she puts all her eggs in one basket: essentially thinking that a movie about life, fate and the cosmos is profound in and of itself. With gusts of wind and twists of fate, `Life' is practically another character in the movie ? and not just another character, but a big star that the studio shelled out 20 million bucks to get and insist his face be shoved in ours for as much of the screen time as possible. Unfortunately, Sprecher's love of the abstract ideas results in a movie where the theme overtakes the plot and swallows the characters. A movie where I didn't end up liking it as much as I like the idea of it and it's intentions. Matthew McConaughey (against type), Clea DuVall, Amy Irving, John Turturro and Alan Arkin all give terrific performances. Sprecher gets them all to stare blank faced into the camera and talk in monotone voices as much as M. Knight Shyamalan. Another big problem is that not all the stories are that interesting. As the movie cycles between them we grow fond of some and tired of others all unbeknownst to Sprecher. Clea DuVall and Amy Irving's stories fail to carry their water and McConaughey's hit and run becomes tiresome. The most interesting and purely entertaining of the lot is John Turturro's - who is just about forgotten as the movie progresses - and Alan Arkin's. Arkin's particularly, which starts out telling us of a man who is constantly happy to the annoyance of his boss and co-workers. Arkin's story successfully gives off the feeling of a the classic domestic ?Twilight Zone' episode. So cheerful and ordinary that it's almost creepy and sends us waiting for the other shoe to drop. Sprecher is a phenomenal director. It's just here she seems to be trying to do it all - make a movie about everything for everyone. While, none of the characters beyond Arkin's are that interesting it's not easy to tell at first glance because the Sprechers have put such terrific dialogue in their mouths. She broaches the abstract - things she desperately wants to talk about, but just puts so many balls in the air that the movie sprawls out of her grasp and into abstract, detached nothingness itself. But it's an admirable effort, worth a look, that few others would attempt. And I must say the ending is classic. Tightly and cleverly executed in a cinematic world of drawn out and overly explained fade outs, it's one that leaves you in the seat in silence for a moment after it has ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recap: A few people in New York with their own trouble seem to have nothing in common but does think about the same questions. Does luck exist? What is fate? And foremost: What is happiness and how do I get it? By some chance encounters these people meet and their life intertwines, and unknown to themselves they are integral in the other's lives. Cause and effectComments: A very odd movie. The pace of the story is slow and it gets quite deep sometimes. It's philosophical and trivial at the same time, and to put the dot over the I, not told in chronological order. Watching this I felt a little conflicted. It was too slow to keep my interest totally and I started lose concentration, thinking about something else to do while watching. But at the same time it was intriguing enough that I couldn't pull myself from the screen. It was an odd feeling.The thing that kept me in the end was the out of sequence order of the scenes and how the people met and the impact they had on each other. My interest wasn't so much in the story that was told, but more in solving the puzzle of what happened when and to what effect.It's a different movie, certainly not one of the main stream pictures. Nice to see then that it attracted some main stream star names, most notably Matthew McConaughey, but also Clea DuVall, John Turturro and Alan Arkin. Good performances all around, and that was important as the story depends on each one of them to be believable in their own little misery. If one of them would have stepped out of line everything would have crumbled.This is a movie to watch if you want something else, something new compared to the box office hit movies. A movie that you need to work a little for the entertainment and not be spoon fed all the way. Something to watch when you are alert and perhaps with company that you can discuss with during and afterwards. If you don't like movies like that, stay away.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intersecting Paths in the Pursuit of Happiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was surprisingly well done. The characters and story lines were masterfully woven together. To me the most thought-provoking aspect of the movie was how the same events could have opposite (or at least markedly different) effects in the various character's "pursuit of happiness." For example, two men are at a bar drinking, one is there to celebrate, one is there to grieve. Or, a woman gets hit by a car leading her to question her innate good nature, and ultimately come through with a stronger foundation of happiness, while the man who hits her is toppled from his state of superficial well-being and ultimately forced toward true happiness through genuine atonement and simultaneous, serendipitous redemption.Although these and the other intersecting story lines of this movie have many of the semi-predictable marks of fiction, can anyone doubt that such intertwining events occur every day while the participants remain completely oblivious? Indeed, the characters in this film remain unaware of their connectedness, which in the end makes the film even more satisfying.I found that the overall effect of the movie on myself was very uplifting. I loved this movie and would highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Crash" seems to have followed in these footsteps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just rented this one and overall it's kind of depressing with a couple of moments of respite. It is very similar to the latest "Crash" and I wouldn't be surprised if I was to hear that Paul Haggis had seen this prior to writing the Crash screenplay.Separate personal story lines of New Yorkers intersect at various times over the course of about 1 year in a strangely cohesive time-travelling stew of flashes both forward and backs.A good friend of mine periodically mentions that we never know how our interactions affect other people, no matter how fleeting they may be. This film picks up on that notion, most often in a fairly heavy-handed fashion. Whether it's a grumpy boss and cheery subordinate, self-centred university professor messing up at home and with students, or one of two other story lines, cause and effect are shown without much subtlety.I consider it very much worth seeing, but it doesn't have the feel-good cathartic release that Crash had. The situations and characters are nonetheless very real and flawed. Some are really lovely people, some aren't. Sometimes a jerk makes a break for change and to tries to discover what it's like to do a kind turn, even one that takes all of 3 seconds.Well acted and directed. Sets are great as is the cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangers' lives intertwine in emotionally moving story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without counting the actual number, I am sure there were at least 13 conversations in this intriguing collection of character studies. It doesn't become clear until very late in the film that about 2 years are elapsing in the story line. The "one thing" (believe it or not) isn't sex, but happiness. The questions "why are we here" and "is this all there is" come up frequently. What makes life worth living? Is happiness a gift, or can it be acquired? Several characters experience ups and downs, while some seem chronically malcontent or skeptical. The ones who boast about having achieved greatness in their work soon become to doubt their accomplishments, while others are desperate to find a way to regain the joys they once knew. Coming to terms with mistakes made, as well as showing remorse for wrongs committed against others, each in their own way must conquer this one "thing".Along with effective acting from the entire cast, there are many other reasons why a film buff would enjoy this movie. Several brilliant camera shots, done in a mysterious stand-out color-scheme, are perfectly intermingled with the story to show reflection, a sense of deep thought. Outstanding editing, connecting separate scenes into a common idea, is clearly superior to most films.The sum of these characters spell out pessimism and gloom. Look for the middle-aged man with that undying optimism who has many scenes. When all others insist life is one big disappointment, this little guy will assure you that it really is just a bowl of cherries. We need more smiling optimists, and more films with that important message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I record films on my DVR from IFC (Independent Film Channel) and usually have 10 or more films recorded at any time. Based on the brief review provided and my mood, I'll pick a film. I did so with this movie a few days ago. I never heard of it, and I was very pleasantly surprised. What initially attracted was the all-star cast: three of my favorites are Alan Arkin, John Tuturro, and Amy Irving. I can't remember the last time I saw Alan Arkin in a film. For me, he stole the film. His character was sympathetic and hateful at the same time. Ultimately, you find he has his heart in the right place. The film weaves separate stories about people whose lives intertwine in random ways. Alan Arkin: a frustrated middle manager in an insurance firm, John Tuturro: a cold hearted college professor, Matthew McConahay: a cocky attorney with the DA's office, and ? a positive young woman who earns her living cleaning houses. The question is: what is the "one thing" these conversations are about? I would say they're about guilt, but that doesn't fit every case. Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

Alan Arkin was outstanding as usual.I just felt that the tiny bit of closure - or a better word, redemption - that these characters stumbled onto, was too understated. I also felt that perhaps that was the intention of the film-makers to begin with. But I think in the end, it took away from the film as a whole. Maybe it's because we're conditioned to want larger, more dramatic pay-off. I'm not sure.Still a good film, 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"13 Conversations About One Thing" is in the genre of movies that deal with fate/coincidence in a rondelay story-telling technique. This is the more intellectual version of Tom Tykwer's German movies or as less violent than "Amores Perros."Writers/director the Sprecher sisters take a very different approach to human nature than in their sardonic "Clockwatchers," helped by intense performances by Matthew McConaughey and Alan Arkin and especially Clea DuVall who visibly change before our eyes as they are affected by chance slowly and fitfully playing out its hand around them.The chapter headings are a bit precious. I couldn't actually tell what order the story was being told to us, backwards, sideways, forwards? Or is the point that doesn't matter for happiness?

		<shortDescription>Terrific Ensemble in a Provocative Conversation Starter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I launched immediately into a conversation about this film before the end credits had even finished rolling. It's the kind of film that makes you want to apply some of its ideas and themes to your own life and experiences. At first I was worried. When the film began, I thought it was going to be an episodic experimental piece, with 13 different scenes each dealing with an aspect of happiness. This bothered me, because the first segment of the film left me wanting more of the same story and I would have been disappointed if the screenplay had never come back to it. However, the first few segments that seem at first to be unrelated begin to mesh in a fluid way (but never in a way that feels forced), and what happens in one begins to illuminate the actions and feelings in another.Because of it's episodic nature, the actors don't get a lot of room to flesh out their characters, but the performances are still strong. Alan Arkin is especially good (he always is).This one comes highly recommended.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was by far one of the most beautiful and thought-provoking films I've ever seen. There is not any seat-gripping excitement, gratuitous sex, or violent explosions, but then again, that's why God made multiplexes. If that's what you're looking for, watch something with Arnie or John Travolta.This film studies what it means to be happy--one of the most difficult questions of the human condition. It can mean a number of things, and is as elusive as the moon on a cloudy night. This movie looks at this, and leaves the audience to draw it's own conclusions. If all you need is a "payoff" at the end, look elsewhere. The lives in the plot are connected almost laterally in intricate coincidences, rather than being in family or business connections. And in real life, isn't it the most unscripted moments that affect us the most?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting though Consciously Deliberate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good films make their point with an obvious deliberateness. Great films make their point with out the viewer being consciously aware of it. "Thirteen Conversations about One Thing" is a very good film. This is one of those intertwining slice of life movies that puts on display a DA caught in a hit and run, a maid whose care-free view of life is shattered by accident, a claims adjuster dealing with a myriad of personal and professional problems, and college professor lost in a mid-life crisis. Every thing said and shown to us is quietly deliberate and very literary. Nothing is wasted here, all has meaning on some level. The film works best when it shows us how random life can be and how our small often not contemplated interactions with others and tiny gestures displayed throughout the day can have huge impacts on ourselves and other people, both loved ones and strangers. In the end, the film plays out like a less nervy, much shorter (and thankfully so), and all together quieter, and perhaps for that reason, more resonating version of PT Anderson's "Magnolia." Worth a view if you are in the right kind of mood to digest such ponderous notions on life, luck, and everything in between. Alan Arkin is especially notable as the claims adjuster.</fullReview>

Arkin's performance as his initials gets straight A's. 8) Why wasn't the film released in more theaters? 9) It would be a great DVD to buy with some of the gift certificates you received as Christmas presents 10-12) The movie is good but 13 conversations are a handful. There is so much one can discuss about one film. Take a break and have a few drinks for conversations 10-12. However, do not have too many drinks or you might experience the same demise as McConaughey's character who drove his car into a pedestrian after his happy hour festivities. 13) 13 is an unlucky number so I do not have anything else to say about this film because if I do say something else I will suffer `The Curse of 13 Conversations About One Thing' which I hope is not worse than `The Curse of Poltergeist'. **** Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtly brilliant; but not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie focuses on several sets of character spotlighting a few of these in their moments of existential crisis. The one thing that they they are talking about is happiness and how to obtain it in life. Each character has their own preconceived notions about what they need to do to be happy, and they struggle as these notions fail.Meanwhile, we watch as the paths of their lives intermingle. I think that it would be a mistake to claim that this movie is essentially about the interweaving fates of the character. That is to say that it is about that, but more importantly it is about dealing with the realization that love, ambition, ideals and faith can't weather any storm. Each character begins in some different ebb or flow of happiness and is dashed upon the rocks losing whatever had kept them afloat all this time, having to live the life that remains. The interactions that do occur simply serve to show us the importance of living authentically in the world despite our struggles with it.Most or all of the movie is rather depressing. One does not run to the brink of nihilism with a smile on their face. Fortunately, the movie does resolve itself up rather well. Nearing the end of the movie, I would not have guessed that the ending would leave me as very satisfied as it did.I think that the subject matter of the movie is hard to digest and it is rather easy to dismiss some of the subtleties of the story as being trite, artsy or even masochistic. I'd recommend an open mind and an appetite for philosophical material before watching this. Goes well with a helping of Nietzsche or Sartre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intelligent American film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film title suggest it is about sexual relations. But "13 Conversations about one thing" hits a home run about an even more fundamental concern - what makes us happy. Through a very involved cast of four main characters smartly intersecting each others' paths, from an early bar scene that it returns to at the end, this film remains a genuine search for that elusive something in our lives. The film is also a mosaic about the human condition, from cynical (the math professor, John Turturo, asking his troubling student why he wants to become a doctor in order to prolong our miserable lives) and egotistical (the prosecutor, Matthew McConaughey, proclaims that luck is merely a poor man's excuse for hard work and faith is the antithesis of proof) and cruel (the young woman, Clea Duvall, with so much hope crippled by an accident that left her saying she had been changed only to the extent that now she was like everyone else) to the transcendental (the double curse by the cynical insurance man, Alan Arkin) and whimsical at the end (the surprise glance between two desperate characters, Arkin and Amy Irving, leaving the subway). Of the four characters, Clea Duvall gets our sympathies and admiration. In her segment, 'Ignorance is Bliss', she symbolizes a certain freshness the world hasn't had a chance to turn stale. Her salvation by the ever smiling Drummond is a profound reversal of the otherwise pointless characters in this film. "13 Conversations" doesn't try to tell us what is happiness as much as it directs us toward trying to find it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are we happy yet? No? Let's talk about it with seven characters, all experiencing some level of depression but not leaving the audience depressed. Go figure.Let's see, we've got a physics professor in a burnt-out marriage - though only John Turturro could leave Amy Irving for Barbara Sukowa. Wait, he's a physics prof... never mind. We've got two characters that have the least likeable jobs on the planet - a house cleaner and a claims adjuster -while maintaining an attitude that would make Norman Vincent Peale seem down in comparison. There's Gene (Alan Arkin) whose philosophy is "Show me a happy man and I'll show you a disaster waiting to happen," And then there's Troy (Matthew McCanaughey) whose self-reliance goes beyond any reasonable human limit. He's an Ass't D.A. who's attitude - "F--k Guilt" - riles the gods. Turns out he's the type of guy who was born on third base but thought he hit a triple.All these folks start out in reasonably good conditions and wind up in predicaments beyond their coping mechanisms. All in the pursuit of happiness.Pay close attention! Gene's story was actually a flashback; the Troy story moved forward in time; and the housekeeper's story is half flashback, half forward progression. Ms. Sprecher challenges us coming and going.Thirteen Conversations, inspired by Bertrand Russell's book "The Conquest of Happiness," gives you 13 segments in a non-linear presentation that interweave stories which resonate, some if not all, with every adult audience member. Faith can support you through the rough patches but it has its limits after multiple worldly assaults. Everything happens for a reason but those reasons aren't always plausible or tolerable. Amazing things happen all the time but it's not always in your best interest. Actions are irreversible and once mixed with gasses in the atmosphere can't recombine. Entropy happens. Watch out or you'll wind up agreeing with Gene thinking 'fortune smiles on some, laughs at others.' Later he muses about the little things we do or say that may cause a sea change in our existence: a wave, a smile, a gesture acknowledging another's humanity.I loved this one and am looking for an excuse to see it again.

		<shortDescription>13 Comments About One Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was drawn to this film because (1) Alan Arkin is in it and I'm a huge follower of his work, which is always rich in nuance and imploding with humanity. (2) He is once again brilliant here, evoking stormy emotion in the most subtle of ways. In fact, (3) everyone is excellent in this intriguing little puzzle of a film; all the characterizations are dead-on and enjoyably specific. (4) This is a non-linear (and therefore extremely involving) piece of work, requiring the viewer to be more than a 'passive' taker-upper of a seat -- you're constantly challenged to figure out at which point in the story each scene is taking place, and at the end (5) when it actually comes together, (6) you are immensely rewarded for your participation.The thing I enjoyed most about the film was how (7) all the main characters had something to learn from the lives they had co-created with the Universe, and how ironic it was that (8) -=- MINOR SPOILER ALERT -=- the seemingly most-negative character in the film (Arkin) learns something extremely positive about himself by performing a negative act - he takes great relish in firing a Pollyanna-type fellow employee but finds afterwards that he feels deep remorse about what he's done to this man (and in fact takes steps to redeem the situation). He learns from this experience that (9) he indeed IS still human and that there IS hope in life - for new starts, new relationships, a new understanding of himself. -=- End of spoiler -=- And as a native New Yorker who grew up in NYC, I could completely relate (10) when one character speaks of feeling lonely even while being surrounded by so many people, how everyone is trying so hard "not to look at each other." I have experienced that feeling on all too many occasions in NYC (and in most other places as well) - the irony of how we are all of course spiritually connected, but yet, sadly, we all still feel separate most of the time. The film is (11) written and directed with meticulous and carefully measured structure, and I found this to actually be (12) a bit of a drawback. At times it feels too studied and staid, a bit on the precious side -- the pieces of the puzzle feel too "square", not quite organic enough for the film to be considered a masterpiece. (I usually avoid comparisons, but I couldn't help thinking of Chris Nolan's far more perfectly realized non-linear piece, Following, while I was watching it.) But it is (13) a supremely ambitious movie, certainly always interesting. If you want to take more than a passive role as a film-goer some afternoon or evening, 13 Conversations will most definitely please you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb job by Sprechers and Arkin. Honest in look on humanity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jill and Karen Sprecher's (Clockwatchers) new film 13 Conversations follows the intermingled lives of strangers in New York searching for happiness and meaning. The movie is hard and the characters sometimes very cold. Gene English's (Arkin) sadistic half-grin as he takes revenge on a helpless co-worker is chilling. Arkin shows the heartless villain that is in each of us. Yet, it is his same character's warmth later that we remember.The film is honest. It is hopeful. It asks that you believe in the good of humanity, but does not hide the evil. At their happiest, the characters are continually struck down with catastrophes. But as in life, the moments of despair are dulled by shock and eventually conquered by time and small kindnesses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>last night i saw this film at the Halfway2Hollywood film fest in Kansas City, and also was able to have an hour and 15 minute conversation with the director and 2 film critics. But about the film. The film was amazing, i loved it. To be honest i'd probably watch the movie several more times to get the full feel of the movie, it's truth, simplistic feel was great. There were scenes where i and the reviewer behind me said "wow". I'm not sure where exactly to categorize this movie. It works on so many levels. The actors were superb. The way it was shot was great. I loved it. I suggest it to everyone. The director was amazing too. She was extremely down to earth and beautiful to say the least. She talked in a question and answer question to the film about how her own personal experiences came into play writing the film w/ her sister, as well as how philosiphy played a big part also. It was amzing to see how much feeling Jill put into the film. I truley loved it.</fullReview>

The performances were excellent.Almost all of the characters were so GOOD which was refreshing. They were good people trying to live their lives and sometimes they did things that weren't quite right. That's the way most people are, I think.One character stands out for his great warmth and generosity of spirit, the fired salesman. His character is also the most humorous.

		<shortDescription>A really good film often generates healthy conversation after you've seen it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER---SPOILER---SPOILER13 Conversations About One Thing is a series of interconnected vignettes about life. This drama plays out through four main characters whose lives have common---but not essential--- threads. An Assistant District Attorney [Matthew McConaughey], a Colombia U. Professor [John Turturro], a claims adjuster [Alan Arkin] and a maid-for hire [Clea DuVall] are the main subjects. Each views life and reacts to its events differently; yet, each is searching for the same thing. The fatalist view of life is that `as luck would have it, you either get smiled upon or laughed at'. The pragmatist, on the other hand, knows that one may influence the serendipitous events in his/her live. Which is it?13 Conversations, in addition to being entertaining, is a thinking person's movie and this flick offers much to think about. A really good film often generates healthy conversation after you've seen it. This is a great movie, based upon that measure. A central question is the degree to which we can control or set in motion life's events and their outcomes. Enough said. 13 Conversations is a gem that's not likely to leave the art theaters, so put on your tie-died T-shirt and make the trek to the nearest screen. The marvelous cast, in addition to the above named actors, includes Amy Irving and a host of lesser stars many of whom you'll recognize. The hit of the show must be Alan Arkin. Never has an actor and his character been as perfectly matched as in this case. Catch-22 [1970], also staring Alan Arkin, does however come to mind. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is divided into sections each about an aphorism. Lawyer Troy (Matthew McConaughey) is celebrating a win at a bar with his colleagues. Then he hits a pedestrian and decides to drive off. Walker (John Turturro) is a physics professor who is cheating on his wife Patricia (Amy Irving) and she suspects him. Beatrice (Clea DuVall) is a maid but her sweet blissful nature is shaken after getting run over by Troy. Gene (Alan Arkin) is a cynical insurance claims manager with family problems and bitter at his happy co-worker.There are interesting stories and good performances. The cast is amazing. It aspires to be philosophically deep and meaningful. The meandering nature of the story telling leaves me wondering if the movie is actually saying anything. The rotating characters do not allow the tension to build. It needs to rebuild every 15 minutes. I wonder if the movie would be a lot better following one character and dropping the philosophical pretense.</fullReview>

Thirteen Conversations About One Thing is just a marvellous movie that depicts people looking for meaning and happiness in their lives. Alan Arkin is just terrific as Gene who is a profoundly wise insurance manager. The whole movie gives off a foredoom feeling that everyone is doomed to fail due to fate. Thirteen Conversations About One Thing is an extremely philosophical movie that portrays profound and moving examinations of the meaning of happiness illustrated through everyday events. It is just a terrific movie with a terrific script. Thirteen Conversations About One Thing is full of sage and wise sayings such as "Show me a happy man, and I'll show you a disaster waiting to happen", the movie is full of philosophical sayings and ideas and this is an intelligent and moving movie from the Sprecher sisters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awful lot of conversation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film if you have a lot of patience and are OK with zero action.It is a massive character study, the closest comparison I can make is Magnolia. 13 Conversations lack the heavy hitting stars and soundtrack of Magnolia so has to rely more on the characters. This makes it a little more gritty, less polished but equally as satisfying.Magnolia also has a focused event at its heart making it quite a structured film. This isn't, there is no one big event that ties it altogether. The characters live their lives, sometimes their stories collide, brush against one another or completely diverge.This lack of structure really comes down to a taste. If a character's life is effected by the actions of a stranger don't naturally assume that stranger will be named or their story weaved in later on. It is possible they will never be mentioned again. This keeps you guessing and makes the film unpredictable. But it does leave loose ends that some people may find irritating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylized, but there should be more movies like this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie is filled with a cast of Hollywood personalities, it is a movie that is not made enough of in Hollywood. Imagine a Hollywood film about people pursuing happiness, but never finding it (nor understanding it). I liked this film, because it was an honest film that touched on real life in some effective ways. Alan Arkin's character is interesting, because he is a shrewd, manipulative advertising agency manager who fires an employee because he is jealous of the employees always looking happy no matter what. Arkin's character is very cynical, and practical to the point that he has alienated everyone in his life. Clea Duvall becomes very depressed and cynical after an accident. Her strength of positive personality has made people depend upon her for friendship. However, her inability to cope with the consequences of her accident alienates people. It is a drastic change in personality. Turturro plays a math professor, who is so obsessed with mathematical rationality that he can't be a human being. I suppose the weakest story was that of McConnaughey's lawyer. It wasn't very clear what happened. He appeared to hit someone with his car who was already dead. This leads him to feel guilt about being the prosecuting attorney, because he runs away from the scene (and then his boss, not knowing about his involvement, happens to assign him the case for prosecution for this very mysterious death that he is indirectly involved with). I thought that story was a little weakly done. It would have been better if it was like in Bonfire Of The Vanities, where there is a direct involvement in the incident. All in all, this is an enjoyable film, because it does something that few Hollywood films reflect upon in any way - real life. The movie does make you think. While not a perfect movie by any means, I learned something from the Clea Duvall (related to Shelly or Robert?) character. People seek friendship in people who appear to be a source of strength and positiveness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many films of the last few years, this one has a complex, multi-layered, interwoven story structure, but it's worth the effort to follow. It IS a film in which you literally listen to "13 conversations about one thing" ? a film which is both linear and non-linear at the same time. It is definitely worth your viewing. Expect a film that is moody, downbeat, and thoughtful, yet tinted with optimism that ALL of the characters seem only begin glimpsing. You'll want to SLAP them sometimes! The acting is good (many stars), the scoring very supportive, the photography rich, and the lessons to be learned: very useful. Pay attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always pleasing to unexpectedly stumble across an intelligent and thought-provoking film such as this. Essentially a study on both the fickle nature of happiness and our (mis)understanding of it, and of the random manner in which complete strangers can alter the path of a person's life with neither being aware of the fact, 13 Conversations interweaves the tales of a handful of characters with deceptive ease and no little skill. Not only does the film smoothly pull all the strands together, it also does so by telling a tale that is not chronologically linear, but which overlaps in the same way that its characters' lives overlaps.Perhaps the only flaw is that a disproportionate amount of screen time is given to Alan Arkin's character at a cost to the others. John Turturro's professor and Matthew McConnaughy's yuppie lawyer in particular seem to be the casualties of this, but it has to be said that Arkin gives a masterful performance and carries his part of the film with ease. The dialogue is sometimes a little too clever for its own good ? we get a sense of people making speeches to each other rather than holding conversations on occasion ? but, having said that, what the characters have to see is always interesting and absorbing. A very good film, worthy of its high rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty decent ensemble flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's with these screenwriters these days? Was there some lecture in the late 90s saying "if you wanna make an ensemble movie - put a car crash in it" - Amores Perros, (and it's remake 21 Grams), Magnolia, Crash...etc. Among these and some of the lesser well known ones that have been released we have 13 Conversations About One Thing. If you liked any of the above movies, this will be your sort of thing. Certainly not the best of the bunch, but definitely an engaging watch, I actually appreciate the fact that there was no REALLY overly pretentious "oh look at this isn't it emotional" thing, it was just a well made film with some decent dialogue that kept things ticking for a few hours. In terms of the way it was made, the cinematography, editing, score, and acting were all of a decent standard. With special mentions for the always excellent Alan Arkin, playing a sort of watered down Homer Simpson to one of his co-workers Ned Flanders. It's not particularly memorable, but is definitely worthy of a second viewing and is a decent film I would recommend for people who do things like go to the Sundance Film Festival.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Higher Truth Here....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading a few reviews, there's not so much I feel I have to had about the movie. But one thing that I came across a few times was (as much among the ones who liked it as among the ones who didn't) this tendency to seek for some kind of conclusion, or opinion or answer, given in the movie.Well, actually, I can say with high chances of being right, there isn't any and shouldn't be any. One of the things that make this movie great is that it's doesn't try to tell you ''life is like this''. There's only two main premises I can think of.1. Life is unpredictable 2. Everyone is looking for a way to be happyFrom that point, there's nothing that the movie states. It just shows different people that think different things would make them happy, or that have to overcome various difficulties in order to be happy, or that had some experiences with happiness. For example, there's Troy. His way to be happy was by professional and social success. He's overwhelmingly self-confident, and in a way ignorant, because all he sees in happiness is his career and his social life, and basically nothing else. But life will prove him there's more than this with the accident when he hits the girl. He won't be able to overcome this, although except in his mind there was no consequences in this (he wasn't caught), and professional as well as social success were still there.It kinda shows that ignorance isn't happiness. But later on, another stories shows the opposite with Bowman. Who is in his way ignorant too, but probably at the same time the happiest guy in the whole thing. To him, ignorance is happiness. So in the end, ignorance can, or cannot be, happiness. No answers definite provided here....All there is in the movie are a few possibilities based on the 2 premises. That's all. It doesn't try to convince you to work like crazy or not to do so at all, or doesn't really try to define happiness. It's more like some kind of philosophical reflection about it. No answer provided... And there shouldn't be any. As if every movie had to come up with unexpected punchline or empty-meaning conclusion or supposedly higher truth. This movie doesn't try to do so, and that's perfect. It is to the viewer to take all that is said in the movie, and make the rest of the reflection.One thing I particularly liked was when Bea tells Dorrie she tried to commit suicide, but that some stranger smiled to her and that convinced her not to do so.... You could bet 5$ that his man was Bowman (shown walking and smiling the very next shot), for whom it is just a normal thing to do, smiling to everyone. But he'll never get to know he saved that girl's life.... And that's ignorance, again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Phrases of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I find some of the comments here on IMDB more depressing than this film. Mistaking the sex of the director, cautioning viewers to "pay attention," the mandatory comparisons to "Magnolia" and so on.Sigh.But then this is a film to make one sigh. Its message (and colors) are muted. The title to me was almost problematic. While watching this, I felt a little like at the end Gene Rayburn was going to ask me,"Okay, you've seen the film...we're looking for Thirteen Conversations About **Blank** "Match Game 2003...Time would elapse, the buzzer sound and all I could come up with is... "One's Station in Life...Well other reviews here (IMDB) and there (Ebert) and possibly even in the press kit refer to "happiness" as the answer. I'd argue against that (although not against the Sprecher sisters themselves, I do believe in intention of an author or auteur).While "happiness" is heavily accented in one of the chopped subplots, applying that theme to the others seems to be a bit of a stretch. I found the characters more caught up in why/how they got to where they were at. This, along with the title, suggest a film that is, can I say garrulous?A litmus test of sorts, if you enjoy Hal Hartley (as I do) then the "text" of this film will pose no problem for you. The plot chopping is not so haphazard as a Brion Gysin cut-up, there was a time or two where I had to stop and think, "okay this took place before." The film is divided into a baker's dozen (I think??) of sententious phrases, that characters mutter and/or wrestle against.Those "phrases of life" were kind of funny to me (well "muted" funny), like in silent films when just to keep the audience on the same page, plot stages would be written on screen. Here it kind makes us feel omniscient, and in a way draws attention to us as viewers of the film. That's possibly a flaw for some who just want to be lost in the "show."Still I cannot be alone in enjoying a film with characters you are more likely to live next to, then say the beleaguered millionaires of "Somethings Gotta Give" and countless other films. You could include "Magnolia" in there if you must. And again it seems some reviewers must. Or are all those mentions clever 21st century marketing?Anyway, Arkin is outstanding (his wrinkles express more than most other actors mouths). Scenes with Arkin and Frankie Faison felt like I was a peeping-tom or one of Wim Wender's angels. In general the insurance office scenes were tremendous. As in "Clockwatchers" I think the Spreckers remember/honor what it is like to have a job.And to have to have a job.Regarding the actors, I'd have to rate their performances in order as Arkin, Turturro (wish he'd had more scenes), DuVall and lastly McConaughey. I'm not strictly against Matthew as some are, it's just that I thought his portrayal of the "hot-shot DA who leaves the scene of a crime, but the crime never leaves him" paled against the others for me.Overall the film was thought-provoking. I think the drab worlds occupied by the characters led some viewers to find this "depressing." I like the fact that there is no magic bullet or lottery ticket to rescue the characters. Well, at least the main ones...Regarding one's station in life, each of the main characters in this is dealt a blow. Turturro and DuVall somewhat randomly, and decidedly physically. Arkin and McConaughey sort of argue for moderation, as they mark the extremes of downtrodden and upbeat outlooks. Arkin is dealt what he expects, McConaughey gets his come-uppance.Ultimately, something about this film did *not* feel bleak.There's an element of fate in what occurs to the characters, but also the possibility of change. Turturro's change was most notable....yet least effective. DuVall's is attitudinal. McConaughey's may just be luck, and a second chance. Arkin dabbles with karma.Well I'm having a hard time clarifying that "something."Perhaps the muted message was more muddled. Or maybe it was me...still this was worth a watch. So I'll round it up to a7/10 (more like a 6.6)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep, or just vague?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't believe the back of the box when it says this is a collection of separate stories that all tie together in a wonderful, meaningful way. This is nothing so coherent!"Thirteen Conversations" consists of a series of vignettes following the lives of several main characters. The main characters do interact in some ways, but by the time the movie is over, nothing that you'd call a "plot" has occurred. That's okay, though, because the movie works without a plot. Although stuff happens to people, the movie is really more about the people than the stuff that happens to them. We get to see how different characters react to different stressful or painful situations and how their reaction affects their happiness.Although I generally enjoyed this movie, I got the sense that there might be more to it than I got out of it on the first viewing. In retrospect, I don't think the movie actually has significant depth (although you can read depth into any movie if you try hard enough--e.g. "The Matrix"?). Rather, I think it is vague enough to give the sense of significant depth without actually possessing it. It's very worth a rental, but I wouldn't buy it.But this is a beautiful movie, including the DVD. Colors were obviously important in the overall design of this movie. Different themes restate themselves in characters' clothing, the sets, everywhere. This is one of the prettiest movies, from beginning to end, that I've watched in a while.If you haven't seen, "Magnolia," invest your time in that movie instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a difficult, wordy little picture that asks a single question: `How do we achieve happiness?' Of course there is no answer, but director Jill Sprecher and her sister, co-screenwriter Karen, offer up four scenarios that offer up interesting variations on the fragile nature of happiness. Matthew McConaughey is Troy a swaggering lawyer who is slowly torn apart by guilt after committing a hit-and-run. Walker (John Turturro) and Patricia's (Amy Irving) marriage is collapsing under the weight of his infidelity. Beatrice (Clea DuVall), a good-natured young woman who cleans rich people's houses, has her life and outlook altered forever after a near fatal accident. The final and best storyline involves Gene (Alan Arkin), an insurance claims adjuster who fires his happiest employee simply because he can't stand to see him smile day after day. This is an odd film ? one that takes some warming to ? but it does get under your skin, particularly Alan Arkin's scenes which are played with the skill, insight and timing of a master.</fullReview>

I must say its one of the most enlightening film I have ever seen.Deceptively simple in narrative yet structurally open ended, Thirteen's understated premise caused many people to overlook its hidden depths.Infact, it took me a repeat viewing to fully soak in its magic. This film completely deconstructed my world view and take on life. For concealed within, were eye opening, philosophical answers on that "one thing" mentioned in the title. I do not dare declare I had the film figured out. But I am mesmerised nonetheless by its ambition. Not wanting to spoil your pleasure of discovery, I can only say it offered a myriad choice of metaphors for our interpretation of what exactly is "one thing" in the title.Happiness? Contentment? Grace? None of the above? Or all of the above?The possibilities are as boundless as this film's ability to inspire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this film, it was made out to look a lot like the earlier (and longer) MAGNOLIA by P.T. Anderson.

The film has a good story, and the acting is half-way decent, but the whole thing about this film is that these people's lives intersect with one another. Well, I really can't remember them intersecting a whole lot. One minute, the movie concentrates on one character for about twenty minutes, and just when you're getting used to the movie talking about this guy, the film starts on another character. The whole thing was also very confusing, as I could never really tell for sure what was a flashback and what had already happened. Because, somebody tells us a story about something, and then a little while later, this story comes to life. Its like "did this already happen? Is this a flashback"? You are never really sure of what is happening and what has already happened.The acting was very impressive. I really enjoyed the performances and each of the character's own little situations, but there was not enough development on each of them, and the film switches back and forth from each character way too much. The ending is most disappointing of all, as it is not the end I was hoping for. Its like the film ended right *before* the climax of the whole story. Still entertaining to a degree.13 CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONE THING gets 3/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the first frame we realize that this is going to be a film that captures you with it's dialogue.The movie contains very little music to draw you in.We are drawn in by the wonderful performances by Alan Arkin(Gene)and Matthew McConaghey(Troy).The film helps us look at the perspectives of upper class and lower class people alike.It also helps us to understand how different people react differently to different things.The movie takes place in middle New York.It takes us through the lives of four different people that have a story that all connects to the other persons missing piece.We realize how much we take for granted at our highest times as well as our lowest times.I recommend this film to anyone who has a decent heart and anyone who wants to see a movie as close to perfect as you can get.Four stars from me,a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MINOR SPOILERS*What I see most meaningful in the way the film is done (i.e, the non-linear narrative) is that it concentrates not on the cause &amp; effect per se, but on the connections that underlie everything. Although things may not all fit, in the end, into a sequence that actually works (I'm not entirely sure if they do--I'd have to see it a 2nd time), I think that reflects the narrative we see in life. Life, as we know it, is never so easy to understand as in most movies. What 13 Conversations does, and does very well, is help us to see those connections we miss in our everyday lives. It doesn't pretend to have all the answers, but certainly raises some important questions. I think woundedness is also an important thing to consider when watching the movie. That continual theme of woundedness in all of us, and how we need our 18 inches of personal space and we pretend that we're different from the strangers around us, and yet underneath it all, we're all searching for the same thing and we are the same people with the same struggles. It's the little things in this film that convey meaning--the chance smile on the street, the candles, the doll, the physics problem, the prism. It's the chance occurences which seem so random (which is why I see the movie as an example of chaos theory) that make the movie. The movie, in the end, isn't about plot, it's about connections and who we are. And in the end, that's the ultimate simplicity of the film. It's real life, it doesn't have all the answers, it doesn't pretend to be more than it is. (My rating: 9 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 Conversations About One ThingBrava, Sprecher sisters! Your writing and directing are a refreshing and human vision to behold!Surely, as has been said, there is a Kieslowski relation in this work...and I say Hurrah to that! What better master to emulate? Was Beethoven less of an artist because he was influenced by Mozart? This film is no Decalogue, but its probing depicticn of ordinary lives and their interweavings left me more satieted and moved than by any American film in many a moon.Alan Arkin as a disillusioned insurance manager, struggling against life's challenging odds, gives another of his superb performances that (thanks to the writing) includes some honest self-examination, rare in film characters. The young woman who cleans houses is played with grace and sympathy by Clea Duvall, giving us a small taste of the vicissitudes of experience and their possible consequence. John Turturro makes his routinely structured physics teacher, looking in vain for a charge to shift out of his rigidity (nice metaphor in the "immutable laws of physics"). Michael McConaughney took on his role as a cocky lawyer brought down, with a breathing facility. Amy Irving as the sad, clueless wife brought a poignant reality to her brief appearance.The very ordinariness of the people populating this film was lifted by this well-conceived scenario to make evident the uncommonness of the common man. Thank you, Sprecher sisters! Give us more!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE DECALOGUE meets WHO MOVED MY CHEESE?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kieszlowski's epic-yet-everyday Ten Commandments have clearly been watched till the VCR screamed for head cleaner by the writer-director Jill Sprecher. Here, she attempts that characteristically Kieszlowskian conflation of lyrical-quotidian and Moses-profound, and what comes out is convoluted, highfalutin New Agism--Jason Robards' deathbed regrets in MAGNOLIA turned into another Tuesday with Morrie. In the most interesting vignette, a Saul Bellow-school insurance man (Alan Arkin, one of our best and most unappreciated actors)is driven nuts by the seeming carefree happiness of one of his put-upon employees--an obsession that turns into a vendetta. (The story is assigned an unfortunate Be Nice to Others ending.) In the least interesting vignette, a cocky lawyer (is there any other kind?) played by Matthew McConnaughey hit-and-runs a young girl and goes cuckoo with guilt. McConnaughey's performance makes sense at first--he seems to be channeling his scary cracker grandfather--then ceases to make sense. In between, there is an almost-interesting vignette about a maid in her early twenties (Clea DuVall) who takes on the qualities of a Bressonian saint...until the movie uses her to make tough, hard-hitting, unsentimental points about cynicism. There is music that recalls a film of similar portentous title, 26 SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD, and there are intertitles jacked from HANNAH AND HER SISTERS. The whole thing seems to be made for nobody--except those who nod and click their tongues at outsized literary devices, and those in need of a tougher-than-usual dose of Course in Miracles pablum. Leave it to Americans to turn Kieszlowski's shards of fatalism and chaos into a piece of aromatherapeutic, deep-tissue-massaging, present-in-the-moment pottery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully intertwined plotlines.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the good fortune of seeing this film at the Toronto Film Festival (on opening night, no less). Jill and Karen Sprecher's screenplay examines the lives of several people, who see several different events from several angles.Alan Arkin's performance is reminiscent of his Glengarry Glen Ross effort, and Matthew McConaughey is very solid as a guilt-ridden lawyer. The real winner here, though, is the Pulp Fiction-esque narrative structure, which is perfectly suited to tell these parallel stories. Granted, it's a little more work for the viewer to piece it together for themself, but it makes the end product all that much more satisfying. (I find myself telling anecdotes in the same way, so I enjoyed this style all that much more.)I hope this film eventually finds wide release. I liked it in the same way I liked The Big Kahuna, with its packed dialogue, but this tends to focus more on interpersonal relationships than any sort of "big question." See this if you get the chance -- well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 Conversations About The Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies about the life and the secret to be happy, a great screenplay supported by a well-selected cast. The film opens with the lives of few people: a young lawyer, a sweet cleaning girl, a stressed businessman, a teacher and his wife... Everyone is desperately searching for the meaning of their lives and how to be happy, after some accidents which linked them to each other. The life of every character has, at one point, a kind of connection with the others. Those unexpected moments are the lead subject of this brilliant film. Well directed and performed, "13 Conversations about one thing" has also a great film editing (the story is composed by 13 arguments), a soft score and a good cinematography. The sound editing is interesting, completely different from Hollywood standard, as in the scene of the car accident at the beginning, without sophisticated and spectacular sound effects and orchestral musical. Clea DuVall, one of the best new Hollywood stars, gives a strong performance as Beatrice, the cleaning girl. Great work from Alan Arkin, John Turturro and Matthew McConaughey, too. Fine job from Amy Irving in a minor role, as Turturro's sad wife. One of the best scenes of the film is that where the fired man comforts the man who fired him... A really amusing scene. A really, wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent but sad movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an intense, sad movie, with an excellent cast, well crafted but disturbing. This movie attempts to bring the audience in touch with the vagary of life. Whether this can be considered entertainment is debatable. The characters are forlorn, lost souls who are wallowing in disillusion and are bitter about their lives. Pretty heavy stuff. The movie dramatizes their struggle to find meaning in their lives and to discover an explanation for why things turn out they way they do, and here the movie fails. The movie bites off more than it can chew. When a movie delves into the more esoteric aspects of life, like the meaning of life, the purpose of existence, fate vs. coincidence, it's treading on thin ice and it's the rare movie of that genre that succeeds in avoiding the cold water. This is the case because unlike a conventional story that has a beginning, a middle and an end, stories with complex themes leave the audience hanging; they offer no answers, no resolutions, which is frustrating and unsatisfying. Once the director opens the Pandora's box of emotions, either close the box by bringing resolution to whatever is bothering the characters or don't go there in the first place. The movie makes a point that people are bitter. Now what? Where does the movie go from there? This movie does a great job in dramatizing personal dissatisfaction and the bitterness associated with unfilled wishes, but doesn't bring closure. So if you want to watch some fine acting, then this movie is for you. But be warned: it's not a happy movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing life teaches us quickly is to expect the unexpected. For example, in Jill Sprecher's 13 Conversations About One Thing, Troy (Matthew McConaughey), a rather self-important lawyer tells a depressed insurance adjuster how happy he is during Happy Hour at a local bar then, while driving home, he hits a young woman crossing the street and his life is changed forever. Ms. Sprecher, a Philosophy graduate from the University of Wisconsin, explores the experiences of four New Yorkers and how their lives intersect. Although films about how people's lives are interconnected have become something of a clich, Sprecher's film has a freshness that catapults it far above the ordinary.One of the New Yorkers who is forced to confront "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune" is a Physics professor (John Turturro). The professor knows that what works is to "wake up enthused, to experience life, to be happy" but cannot translate that into his experience. He is involved in an extra-marital affair with a fellow teacher (Barbara Sukowa) and is unable to connect with the suffering of his wife (Amy Irving) or a student who is depressed about his grades. The film, however, really belongs to veteran actor Alan Arkin who is completely believable as Gene, an aging insurance executive distraught by the breakup of his marriage and the travails of his drug addicted son.At work he is increasingly annoyed by an employee named Wade (William Wise) who walks around with a smile on his face and does not let the exigencies of life get to him. To see how he will react, Gene fires him but that doesn't stop Wade from looking at the bright side. Realizing how bitter he is becoming, Gene quietly finds Wade another job without letting him know that he has pulled some strings. In another sequence, Beatrice, a young house cleaner (Clea DuVall) believes that we are guided since she had been miraculously saved in a near drowning incident as a child. Her faith is shaken to the core, however, after she is hit by the car of the young attorney and is accused of stealing a watch by a client she had grown to admire. To the dismay of her close friends who relied on her optimism, Beatrice now believes that things in life happen for no reason and we are powerless in the face of a random universe.13 Conversations About One Thing ends up where it began, with a conversation between one who can only see the positive in life and the other, only the negative. During the course of the film, Ms. Sprecher examines life itself in all its ups and downs and its multifaceted contradictions. Although she does not preach or overtly put the experiences of her characters into context, it is clear that in her view there are no coincidences and that patterns emerge when we reflect from a distance on seemingly unconnected events. She depicts how the small things: the knowing smile of a stranger or the reaching out to others without asking anything in return can be among the most important ingredients in a happy life. Recently I said that the films I'm attracted to are those that are honest, intelligent, sensitive, and thought provoking. 13 Conversations About One Thing is a perfect example and I am looking forward to seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I can say for certain about the folks who love this movie: they've never taken a college physics class!Above all, an indie film like this has to be *true.* Drop in a scene that plays false, and you risk losing the viewer for good. It's a testament to what's good about this film that it manages to survive some absolutely terrible chunks.To say that John Turturro's scenes as a college physics professor are unbelievable (if you've ever studied physics) is a massive understatement. In fact, to say that they bear no relationship whatsoever to anything that might conceivably happen in a college physics classroom is still an understatement. Moving from acceleration to entropy in the middle of a lecture? C'mon. And his final rant about the nature of physics expresses a mindset *exactly opposite* the attitude any actual physics professor would have. (It is, however, the mindset you'd expect a physics professor to have if you were a screenwriter who not only had no idea what physics was actually about, but were too lazy to have your script vetted by someone who did.) This storyline, if excerpted, would be a C- student film. Making a C- student film starring John Turturro and Amy Irving -- that's a triumph of awful screenwriting.I don't know whether it's Matthew McConaughey himself or just Jill Sprecher's direction, but he gives one of the worst, least subtle performances of the last few years. Did I ever really believe him in either his on-top-of-the-world or down-in-the-dumps mode? Not for an instant. Of the thousands of human beings I've ever known, has anyone telegraphed their emotions so obviously? No. Little things, too. Are they any college professors who still smoke? Would Turturro's obsessive-compulsive neat-freak have an affair with the one in a hundred who did? Would rich people tolerate their housekeepers smoking in their homes (as Tia Texada's character does)? If there's an indie film God, He's in the details, and so many of the details in this film are thoughtlessly wrong (or, in many cases, forced into wrongness for some desired effect).What's good? Alan Arkin is terrific. His storyline (thankfully, the predominant one) is a little cartoonish and credulity-stretching, but it works great at the level of fable. Clea DuVall is always worth looking at, though her character transformation, like McConoughey's, is rather too broad. The movie dares to tackle the big issues of Happiness and Fate / Luck (the conversations are really about two things, it seems to me), and can't help being thought-provoking -- even if most of the talk strikes me as being merely pseudo-profound.And finally, of course, some of us are suckers for this sort of story structure (which, Magnolia comparisons notwithstanding, was actually perfected by Philip K. Dick in early novels like THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE). The casual interweaving of the four separate stories is very nicely done.6/10 and not recommended if you're not a fan of this story structure . . . 7/10 if you are, or if you're a big Alan Arkin fan (and you should be, on both counts!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A thought-provoking work like this affirms the value of film. If you are just looking for action or comedy, then the film might not appeal to you, but if you appreciate movies that seriously address the nature and mystery of life, then you should like this. It requires thought and a little bit of an attention span. The film shares with many others of its type a bit of an existentialist tinge, but it stands apart by treating religiously inclined characters with respect. Unfortunately this is not too common in modern American cinema. As for the acting, John Turturro and especially Alan Arkin are pre- dictably brilliant and the young girl who plays the victim of a car accident is also great. This ranks among the best films of its year.</fullReview>

What else you could want from these Conversations. Brilliant.Perpetual Experimenter comes to know that experimenting may not be the solution in itself; one has to make a stand some time. Spirituality of housemaid is tested severely by a cruel accident, which made her revisit her basic premises. Similarly pessimism of senior executive clashed with optimism of his sub-ordinate insurance agent. And lawyer has to confront the ugliness, which is most likely to be in all of us in some degree or another, of human response in some hard fateful circumstances.Excellent.</fullReview>

She is clearly disinterested in "messages" and doesn't hammer her themes to death either. The best scenes in the movie aren't big revelations, dramatic monologues or directorial set pieces, but subtle character moments: a conversation that hits the right note, a glance that suggests a subtext, a smile. Thirteen Conversations About One Thing is a movie that refused to leave my head for weeks, one with an impact disproportionate to its tone. 2002 has been a great year for American independent films, and this one's a doozie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching the DVD with my husband and we both enjoyed it tremendously. It was highly original with characters so real I felt like each one of them was someone that I knew from work or from real life. Having been a claims adjuster and underwriter for way too many years before thankfully changing careers, I can tell you that I felt like I was painfully right back in the insurance industry. The actors, the direction, the set, the style of the film just nailed the atmosphere and experience of it all. Many other films seem to glamorize this profession and for the life of me I really cannot understand why. It is one dull profession; a life sentence just as the movie portrayed.I have a question though. With performances like McConaughy's and Arkin's why weren't they nominated for any sort of acting awards? Why do we have to see the same people nominated again and again? (sorry that was two questions) I was floored by their performances. Not wanting to repeat the insightful comments already made about this film, I will say that it was complex and thought-provoking (although I think it was probably made on a shoe string budget). The film had numerous messages and works on many levels. The film also paid attention to alot of the little details of life (example: the haunting sound of the bell when your car door is opened, personality details excellently portrayed by Turturro's very precise character, the beauty of a homegrown tomato, the meaning of a home-baked cookie etc.) These details did not go unnoticed by me.Overall the script was not predictable at all which made the film that much more riveting to watch. Look for an unexpected act of kindness by Alan Arkin's otherwise sour on life, borderline despicable character. Beautiful. It has been said before and so many times. It is the little things in life that mean so much. In this production, the director's attention to the little things make it an outstanding film experience. Conversely, it is the characters' inattention to the little things that create devastating consequences. </fullReview>

This movie, which is about happiness, and what it means, how to achieve it, why one might deserve it, is fox-like in this way: it tells us lots of small things about happiness, some of them trite, perhaps, but no less true for that. It does not, however, try to be a hedgehog and give us an overarching Philosophy of Happiness.It seems that most of the commenters below who were unhappy [ahem] with this movie were looking for a hedgehog's wisdom, and so were disappointed.The Sprechers are empiricists, Aristotelians who are content to make numerous observations of the subject at hand. Which is a valuable service, even if the observations have been at other times and places. It is after all useful to have all the data in one place, for leisurely analysis and contemplation.Except for the fellow winning the lottery, and perhaps some details of the physics lectures (what kind of physics prof would move straightaway from a kinematics problem to talk about entropy???), the storyline mostly rings true. Beatrice's sweetness and purity early in the movie is almost painful--we can see clearly enough that it won't last. Yet Wade manages to hold on to his indefatiguable optimism, and even manages (it is implied) to re-infect Beatrice with it.Alan Arkin's performance is rightly praised. But there are no weak performances here. I'd like to think that the cast saw a screenplay that they believed in, and gave it 120%.10/10...one of the very best movies I've seen in the past year. Hedgehogs however are advised to steer clear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The collective posts for this film is one of the best I have ever read in IMDB.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first time I wrote something on IMDB for a movie, which I have not seen. But I choose to say something anyway (however unqualified). Because frankly, I am heartened by the rare quality of writing contributed in this forum. From the past few user commentaries I have read for "Thirteen Conversations About One Thing", their intuition and profound understanding struck me. There must thus have been an unmistakable truth about this intriguing film to galvanize so many like-minded people to share their heartfelt thoughts.Dear fellow commentators, thank you for your words of wisdom. In truth, I can only aspire to be as articulate as you are. It is with your passion and empathy, that gave me an enlightened take on one of life's seemingly unattainable goals - the search for happiness. Upon reflection of the inspired words shared in this forum, one can conclude that what one really need, is coming to terms with which we have no control over. Acceptance will naturally lead into contentment and by extension, happiness.At the very least, I should now hunt down a copy of "Thirteen Conversations About One Thing". For this is the magical film, which inspired you all to write so passionately, and insightfully about life and our collective human condition. May the new year bring about sustained positive vibes for the good of us all. Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something to think about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting for a film like this for months. It is not often that one returns home from the movie theater thinking about what you have just seen. Thinking and relating it to your life. 13 conversations about one thing is a great movie mainly because of its script. It evaluates the lives of different characters and takes you into a journey that will help you discover human nature, how humans are built and how they react in times of crisis. This movie is about life, about how these different characters react to life , how they live it , how they make certain choices that will determine their future. It makes you think about some things you would not often think about, like how small choices might determine your future just as important choices often do. How doing or not doing something (even something trivial) can change your life. It is about destiny and about how everything in life has an explanation (or doesn't it?) Go see it, you won't be dissapointed.</fullReview>

It is in strong contention for "the most valuable film I have ever seen" and I am in my 8th decade of life. I feel I really OWE Jill and Karen Sprecher (whom I have never met).I found especially effective the way that the actors, in sometimes casual actions, influence each other. These simple, casual actions that seem almost trivial, lead to destruction sometimes and redemption other times.

		<shortDescription>A philosophical tour de force!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of all the differences and diversity in the human society, there is one thing common about all of us- the quest for happiness. But what exactly is happiness and how do we obtain it? This is the theme revolving the movie 'thirteen conversations about one thing'. With all its wisdom and philosophical reflections, the movie reveals to us the bitter truth of life- there is no light to the darkness of this infernal world and every action of ours is absolutely meaningless. All the promises of happiness are but creations of the human mind and the only true paths to happiness are ignorance and luck. The movie begins with the entry of a happy and confident lawyer who believes that the world is a happy place, emitting sunshine over the lives of us all and everyone should and can bask in it without luck having to play any role in it. But as the story continues, the lawyer meets with an unfortunate incident in which he accidentally runs down a woman. Thereafter he is deprived of all his peace and happiness and repeatedly reopens his injury to punish and remind himself of his guilt. As a result of a single unfortunate event he has now transformed into a spiritually broken man. While we ponder over the psyche of the human mind, the movie has in store another story for us, perfectly befitting the quote 'ignorance is bliss'. It's framed around the life of a cheerful girl who hitherto finds objective and goodwill behind every event. That's when she becomes the victim of an accident (the same incident concerning the lawyer) which totally changes her character and she ultimately figures out that life is meaningless and no path takes course for an objective. The movie tells the story of several unknowingly interconnected people who ultimately reached the same conclusion that life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating, highly recommended film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 Conversations About One ThingCombine a cadre of fine actors and some sharp and intuitive writing and the result is a independent movie that is as fresh and stimulating as anything coming out of mainstream Hollywood.In "13 Conversations", nine ordinary people come to grips with the fundamental question of why fortune smiles on some, laughs at others.At first, their lives run separately, then parallel and finally, interweave to form a tapestry that highlights the hope, guilt, honesty, love and triumph that is the fabric of the human condition.Top acting honors go to Alan Arkin, middle manager watching his luckless life unravel; house cleaner Clea DuVall questioning the part fate plays in her life; Matthew McConaughey, the prosecuting attorney shocked into reassessing his moral character following a late-night accident; math teacher John Turturro, whose chalkboard formulas take on tragic significance and his distraught wife, Amy Irving, a shattered life made whole by a casual human gesture.The writing by Karen Sprecher and Jill Sprecher is revealing in substance, economic in style. Director Jill Sprecher has brought it all together into a fascinating film that I highly recommend. Seen at the American Film Market in February.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was already horribly depressed, and this film did not help!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I enjoyed the movie to some degree, I found it horribly depressing. I was in a bad mood to begin with, and I just found the subject matter and especially the pace of the film, pretty sad. The acting was good, and the editing was creative. I don't generally enjoy Matthew Mc... Matthew, but he was fairly good in this film. I only recognized one other actor, Clea DuVall, who seems to be typecast often as the disturbed young girl. But, she was in fine form as she usually is. So, it's not a bad film, just not cheerful. Some of the themes are fairly profound, in terms of luck vs. will, and what really makes one happy. So many stories in one makes for a bit of a cluttered film, but it didn't move too quickly to handle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd say that about sums up 13 Conversations About One Thing. Don't get me wrong, it's a great movie, it's just depressing as hell.Which is surprising, considering that the "One Thing" is supposedly happiness. The writing is skillful to be sure, and the cinematography, although never flashy, is always wonderfully controlled. New York's never been more beautiful. The film follows a cast of characters through their lives in New York as their stories intertwine and follow similar themes. Each character tries to find happiness in his or her own way, and each has his or her own unique view of the world. At the end, however, in typical existentialist fashion, none of these views or approaches to happiness is heralded as "the one true view." Instead, we are left with a hopeless, deterministic world where people are pushed around by impersonal forces, and the assurance that "you gotta believe in something" if you expect to make it through the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was one in a million. I actually purchased and watched it last night. My comments may change as I watch it more. I enjoyed the characters tremendously. Each person has a gift of happiness placed upon his lap. What they do w/ this happiness is completely up to them. Fortune smiles on some and laughs at others. I simply found this movie to depict real life in a sense. Real life meaning that we all assume that we know it all. That we, as human beings, make the rules. This is what I gathered from the movie. I also enjoy the professor. He chose to do something new and exciting. He chose to break up the monotony. He got bored of doing the same old thing over and over and so he chose a life of adultery as an escape from the norm. Oh, how many people believe that sex is the answer to their marital problems. HA HA. I just found his story to be the most believable and conceivable. Thanks for reading my input.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arkin deserved Oscar nod</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I never thought Alan Arkin would get a nomination for 13 Conversations about One Thing, because like all Arkin's best work, his performance was unspectacular. That's one of the things though that you grow to love about Alan Arkin's work, its utter lack of self-interest. In "Glengarry Glen Ross," everyone has talked about Alec Baldwin's scene-chewing 10 minutes, Al Pacino's barbs, Jack Lemmon's desperation, and Ed Harris' hard edge. However, we forget Arkin's great work as Stanley Aaronow, whose loudest line is, of course, "IS ANYBODY LISTENING TO ME?" It might be because Arkin usually plays the types who makes us think most of ourselves. He never plays his characters as absolutely pathetic, but he has grown to play relatively weak men without going into Arthur Miller territory.  Alan's character here is a further development of the same type we saw in Glengarry, a cynical salesman who begins to see the light and makes a few small adjustments to improve the lot of others around him. The last minute of the film is all Arkin's, and it encapsulates the point of this both depressing but often intriguing movie without a single word. So, I wish rather than honoring John C. Reilly for playing it Hollywood as the sad-sack husband in "Chicago," the Academy had shown their appreciation for the genuine article. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thirteen (or more) reasons for watching another movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are the conversations in `Thirteen Conversations About One Thing' really about one thing? They seem to be about a great many different things to me. And I hate to be picky but they're not so much conversations, in the sense of discussions, or witty talk, but just scenes, in which, needless to say, people do talk. The Sprecher sisters who together wrote and directed this movie are clever and original women. It's a pity that their first effort turned out to be so disjointed and rambling. It's even more unfortunate that it's a sententious and highfalutin downer that, despite the presence of excellent film actors, somehow isn't very cinematic ? I couldn't help feeling it would work much better and seem much wittier as a play. Witty it is not. The Sprechers unfortunately interpret `conversations' to mean talk that touches on the meaning of life, and particularly on issues such as happiness, free will, and luck. There is plot ? it's the car accidents, firings, divorces, abandonments, minor natural disasters and personal cruelties that, despite the occasional hiring, good deed, or moment of enlightenment, make the whole thing such a gloomy way to spend an hour and forty-three minutes. But despite these events, there is a great deal more telling than showing, and since the conversation is neither witty nor unified one can't help wishing there would be less of it ? Six Conversations About Four Things, say, and Seven Events Involving Twelve people. What is it about such a system of organization that so much annoys me? It's because it's so intrusive, so redolent of cutting and pasting and authorial intention. I don't like being told what all the scenes are about and it doesn't make it any better that they're really about something else. Did I say the actors were excellent? Somehow Alan Arkin dominates the movie. I guess his Conversation is allowed to go on the longest. Arkin as always is incisive; his very face is razor-like, somehow, even more so as he gets older: he sharpens, rather than mellows, with age. He is absorbing, if rather grim, as a minor insurance claims executive who objects to a new colleague who's always happy. Happiness is a snare and a delusion, he tells us, and he fires the colleague just to show he's right. But ?paradox!-the colleague remains happy even when fired. And then Arkin's character is so guilty he gets the colleague another job elsewhere, through pulling strings. Another colleague whom he brands as a loser ups and wins the lottery. Bam! These kinds of twists are much better when O.Henry puts them in a short story. Instead of a chapter heading there ought to be a sign saying: Message Coming. John Turturro, who's good at being stiff, plays a prissy college physics teacher who (oh God!) believes that the Laws of Science are Absolute. We're hardly surprised when he gets jilted by the woman he leaves his wife for, especially when we see him being nasty to an eager student with personal problems. The physicist gets his comeuppance, and so does the insurance executive. If Turturro's character represents false determinism, Alan Arkin's represents the refusal to accept luck or happiness, and he duly gets permanently laid off, and then regrets a moment when he might have saved his marriage and his son's future simply by waving at his wife when she appeared. God is in the details ? yes, that saw gets trotted out. Mathew McConnaughey (who takes a razor to his chiseled cheek) adopts a grim fatalism after fleeing from an accident, but nonetheless gets rewarded with a surprise promotion and a plum assignment. Life's just hard to predict sometimes-but some movies aren't. A couple of young women who clean houses cease to be friends when one, who considers herself blessed because she was saved from drowning as a child, loses hope after being hit by a car.All of these characters, despite the good acting, are forced to discuss their fates in tiresome and repetitious detail. There is not a lighthearted moment in this tendentious round of expositions of life with a capital L. I left the theater thoroughly demoralized, oppressed by the Sprecher's heavy-handed expression of their grim and dubious worldview, which is relieved only by the occasional equally heavy-handed paradox. The acting is good but the cinematography is generic. Krzysztof Kieslowski, whose images are never anything less than beautiful, handles similar kinds of material infinitely more subtly and powerfully in his `Decalogue' series. `Thirteen Conversations About One thing' is Krzysztof Kieslowski for Dummies. Kieslowski's masterpiece lasts many hours. You just can't cram this kind of thing into an hour and forty-three minutes, even if you chop it all up into fragments and call them `Conversations.'</fullReview>

Alan Arkin gives a good performance, but he can't save this film. The film is comprised of vignettes focus on four basic groups of characters: lawyers, office workers, cleaning ladies, and College professors and students. But almost nothing exciting or remarkable happens in this film, nothing that really made me wonder what would happen next or how this film would turn out. All I wanted was for this film to finally end, but I fell asleep before then and had to use the scene selection. Overall, this was a pretty dull viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Highly inspired in In?rritu's Amores Perros, Thirteen conversations about one thing follows the same non-linear narrative which made the first an absolutely masterpiece of the post-modern cinema. But yes, it don't has a third of the quality of Amores Perros. First of all, the lack of depth in the drama: the subject explored here, the happiness, barely turns into 'The Thing', which the title refers to. It's way too shallow. The characters stories looks like fairy tails that met each other in the end, instead of a story that leads the characters to met each other. Forced in my opinion. Also, the hell is the motivation of the girl to try suicide throwing herself in front of a car? She could've jumped from some building(actually, it's what most people do).But what bothers me a little bit more than the unconvincing and somewhat forced plot,was the interpretation of the actors. Apart from a somewhat good performance by Alan Arkim, the rest of the cast either overacted or underacted. This alone would change the film(to worse) even if the plot were so good as the one in Amores Perros.It's not worth a watch. 5.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'13 Conversations About One Thing' is, although you might have guessed otherwise, a film whose characters discuss happiness; but it's not exactly a happy film. Rather, it's an annoying one, with inappropriately fey music, silent movie style chapter headings, dull and unrealistic dialogue, and the strange (possibly budget induced) choice of the director, Jill Sprecher, not to show us any of the main events of her story but only the conversations the characters have about them. The plot, such as it is, brings together characters with only loose connections between them; but none of their tales amount to much alone, and the whole is little more than the sum of their meagre parts. Alan Arkin's character seems like a prototype for Larry David's in 'Curb your Enthusiasm'; overall, there's little insight into the human condition here, only scripted pretentiousness.</fullReview>

As it went on, I found myself switching on the time display on my DVD player more and more frequently to see when the wretched thing would finally end. In fact, a short composition by the 17th Century German composer Heinrich Schuetz that is performed (for no reason apparent to me, at least; maybe there was a reason, but I had stopped caring) somewhere in the middle of the film gave me more esthetic pleasure than the rest of the film put together.In my opinion, a sophomoric waste of time for both the film's makers and viewers, and a waste of the talents of an excellent cast.</fullReview>

All the quotes on happiness during the film we have all heard before. This film lacks originality because everything that happened in it we have seen happen in so many films before.

		<fullReview>With all the potential of becoming a great movie, 13 conversations came up to the plate and struck out. The movie tells 4 different stories, each in different time frames with the goal of showing that the stories connect to form something greater (at least that's what I think was the directors intent). Each story was not a symbol for something, or did not add a piece to the puzzle; just some random tale that coincidentally intertwines with the other stories being told. In reading other reviews, it is obvious that even fans of the movie do not understand the meaning of this movie. I am not sure that the director understands the meaning of this movie. There is only one possible reason for this. The movie has no meaning, just random stories, about random people that live ordinary lives. The people only connect or intertwine here and there, and even the way they do connect is of no significance whatsoever. The stories do not combine to form something greater.  Perhaps they should have skipped a theatrical release for 13 conversations and put it on day time television with all the other soap opera's, where it would have fit right in.</fullReview>

I believe this is the 'one thing' they were referring to in the title but it probably would take a 2nd viewing to determine what that 'one thing' is. I'm usually a sucker for off-the-wall unique stories that don't really end up anywhere but with this one you're left shaking your head almost from the beginning to the end and you figure with a unique title like this we ought to be able to figure what that 1 thing was and what the 13 conversations are. Well, this is not the case, at least not for me. We basically start the movie with John Turturro's story of being a late to home husband with a bruise on his eye that came from some encounter a few days before then we're brisked off to McConaughey's piece about a positive man who runs into some bad luck following a sermon he gives to a man at the bar about him not ever being unhappy. The rest of the stories interweave into each other before it's all done, which is an interesting concept, but it's been done much better in other films. Alan Arkin's the man at the bar and his story is confusing, to say the least. He's a mean boss who can't stand happy people. His daughter ends up being intertwined into another story and another story is about a couple of women who clean houses for a living and one of them gets into an accident that changes her life for the worse. Sorry about the rambling, but I thought I should give others all the information and see if they can come up with anything. Good luck if you choose to view this and let me know if you could figure out more than I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, thirteen short conversations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title is not very accurate. There is some dialogue in the film, but not more than usual in drama - actually a bit less. That's a pity. People are confronted by twists of fate, so I would have liked to hear them comment more on it, share more of their thoughts and reflections.Movies today have an exaggerated fear of words. There's a lot of one-liners instead of dialogue. But Shakespeare was not wrong, words words words bear meaning, explore characters, make food for thoughts. It demands excellence from the writer - whether the dialogue is high-brow or not - and maybe that's what's mostly missing.In this film, the underdeveloped conversations leave the characters a bit superficial, their souls still closed to us, even when disaster strikes them. A pity, since there are some interesting people - like the DA with a conscience doing a sort of Raskolnikov thing, the middle-aged man unable to take any initiative in his life, and others. I'm sure they have more to say, than they do.Still, the film on the whole is a pleasant poem, where the lines have been mixed around but the meaning remains crystal clear. I'd say that's the one thing: meaning. It is, isn't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 Dozen or so trite monologues about fifty different cliches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie isn't about anything. Jill Sprecher tried to wax philosophic about alienation and about how people are so detached while also copping Tarantino's interweaving. The style contradicted the substance. WHat little substance there was. Though alan arkin and john turturro were really good, it was almost sad to watch them struggle to make this godawful piece of writing into good acting. there is only so much to be made out of utter slop. Also of note: there is not a single conversation or interaction in the whole movie. Each is a monologue where an actor bounces trite lines off of an obligatory sounding board of a character (Turturro's doctor, McConaughey's friend, Arkin's office buddy, etc...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thirteen..." is a pieced together, planar, circumflex, Magnoliaesque bunch of interleaved stories about people with varying levels of happiness, fulfillment, experience, achievement, etc.: A kind of superficial overview of the human condition of some city dwellers which feebly deals with happiness.The film is a technically and artistically excellent production with a fine cast. However, it's preachy, stagey, chock full of trite little pearls of wisdom, and annoying little phrases to introduce each scene, something which serves only to yanks us back to reality after we've worked to make a difficult buy-in...etc. The story is mechanical and herky-jerky with too much busy-work and too little time for story dynamics and character depth. A quick look at the stats on this site would suggest this is a good watch for less mature audiences...young adults, perhaps. (B-)Note - I need at least 20 inches of personal space. Sounds pretty stupid, huh?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>terrific concept but I can think of 13 other movies I'd rather see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a great film though it is very thought provoking. The weaving of the various storylines could have been tighter. Although there was nothing wrong with any of the performances, one could truly see that the concept itself was more interesting than the script.A disappointing night at the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had a lot of good actors. It's about life, and while it is thought provoking, many other movies have broached this subject in better more interesting ways. "Thirteen Conversations About One thing" was slow, depressing, moody and dark. And at times it wandered without purpose.It's a sleeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humourless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it weren't for the fact that I had company whilst watching this drivel I would have given up on it after 20 minutes. It is dire. if there is a message then I really can't be bothered to find one. The acting is stiff. The script is plain awful. The point of the movie - God knows I really don't. I find that most movies that deal with really important life issues always engage humour - the humour breaks the tension that inevitably builds. This movie neither creates tension nor provides any relief from the humdrum misery it portrays. Not a smile to be found - was everyone on Prosac? Avoid like the plague. Find something better to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Save Your Time &amp; Money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie blows. It is a waste of your time and money (if renting) after about 45 minutes of the movie and 2 glasses of wine I still did not find it entertaining. After you begin to get into 1 plot it jumps into the next. Whats the point of this movie? An independent film maker telling me how life is already? I don't think so! Don't waste your time! Spending an hour in a cage full of rhinos is less painful than this crap. Rent about Schmidt instead, it is a crappy movie, but at least it has some sort of plot line! At least I didn't pay to rent this movie. Thank god one of my friends works at Blockbuster and gets me free rentals. The only thing I had to pay for to watch this movie was the bottle of Radical Red wine from a great local winery and the gas to drive to the store.</fullReview>
