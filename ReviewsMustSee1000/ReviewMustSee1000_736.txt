		<fullReview>This is definitely one of those films that grabs a hold of you and does not seem to want to let go.Ron Howard's excellent direction and Mel Gibson giving perhaps the performance of his career make this film worth seeing.Those of us who have children, although many of us may not have the courage to push the limits as Gibson's character did here,may appreciate this movie more so than those who do not.In fact,I might have been more reserved and cautious,even though I love my son just as much.This is a definite thrill ride from start to finish,and if you have a strong enough heart to handle it,then this film is definitely for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was quite enjoyable. Mel Gibson is a corporate father whose son is kidnapped for a ransom. Mel is an incredible actor - he has great emotional skill, his dialogue never sounds corny or hokey, and Gary Sinise is another fine actor with great skills. Together they make a movie definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buy it instead of renting it. This movie is like a drug:when you watch it, you cannot stop. It is an intense thriller with an incredibly brilliant performance from Mel Gibson. There are not too much bad guys but we got the time to know them, and that is a good thing. There is lots of blood but no free violence. No big guns, no macho commandos and anything bad. It is simple but well written and well acted so the movie is a must-see! I give it 89%.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bit of a confusing movie but well worth it's money,Ransom does not fail to deliver a couple of good performances from some good actors.Mel Gibson stars as Tom Mullen,a businessman who runs a huge aircraft firm who has his son kidnapped by a group of people.Rene Russo delivers a good performance as Kate Mullen who is the mother of Sean Mullen who was kidnapped and also the wife of Tom Mullen.Gary Sinise delivers a fine performance as Detective Jimmy Shaker as well as Delroy Lindo as FBI Agent Lonnie Hawkins.If this movie was dramatic,I was surprised that Mel Gibson wasn't nominated for a lead actor Oscar but was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor-Drama.It is a shame for a movie that is a good drama/thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most underrated movie of all time on IMDb?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>6.6??????? Are we kidding here people...Mel Gibson comes off his Oscar Winning film Braveheart to star in Ransom with an all star cast and gets so little credit. It sickens me. Gary Sinise now ranks as one of the most notorious villains after his role as Jimmy Shaker in Ransom, one of the best performances I can remember in recent thriller history. Gibson lights up the screen and is backed by Ron Howard's brilliance and yet so few people appreciate his work. He has proved he can direct (Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Splash) and Ransom only solidifies this stance. Ransom will keep you on the edge of your seat for 2 hours, culminating in a showdown between Gibson and Sinise that won't be soon forgotten. Also, the lack of plot holes in the movie make it even more believable, mostly because of the brilliance that is shown in its simplicity, i.e., Gibson will go to any means possible to get his son back, period. Check this movie out asap and do it justice by giving it a higher rating than 6.6!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ransom" is no ordinary kidnapping thriller. It's a tense and believable thrill ride where even the people who seem to be in control are in fact not. And they know it.Self-made airline tycoon Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) has it all: a beautiful wife (Rene Russo), an intelligent young son (Brawley Nolte), and a thriving business. That's all about to change when his son is kidnapped. The FBI, led by Lonnie Hawkins (Delroy Lindo), is on the case, but after a mishap, Tom loses confidence in their abilities to get his son back. Tom decides to turn the tables on the kidnappers: he's offering the 2 million dollar ransom as a bounty for the kidnappers.The best thing about "Ransom" is that no one knows who's in control. Tom may be calling the shots, but he's very aware that this gamble could end in disaster, something that neither his wife, Lonnie, nor the kidnappers are happy about. However, it also could turn in his favor: the kidnappers know that this is an opportunity to get the whole ransom that they were going to split between them.Mel Gibson is one of the biggest names in Hollywood, and for good reason: not only is he very photogenic, he's an effective performer. Mullen is a desperate man, but taking risks is what he does best. Gibson is well-cast in the role. Rene Russo was the go-to female star for mainstream movies, but her career has fallen recently. While she's no Meryl Streep, she's a good actress. She doesn't have the juiciest part, but she's no mere housewife, and Russo makes the most of it. I've never been a fan of Delroy Lindo; his delivery seems pretty hammy in his performances, and there's no reason why Lonnie couldn't have been played by someone better. Gary Sinise is good, but too low-key.Ron Howard started his career as a teenage actor, but now he's one of the hottest directors in Hollywood. Howard knows how to make a movie. "Ransom" is suspenseful and unpredictable. It's efficiently made and involving. What more could one ask for? The only problem I have with the film is the ending. It's not what happens (it's more or less inevitable), but Howard obviously did it the way he did as a concession to the studios: the last couple of minutes are so wildly improbable and over the top it destroys the taut level of suspense that has been built up.Nevertheless, the majority of the film is well worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good plot, typically stupid American ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This whole section is one big spoiler, so please only read if you want to or already know the end. The wild shootout at the bank was obviously forced on the director by the studio heads, since it was so out of character and pacing. So typical of why I dislike American movies. If this were a French or British movie, it would have ended with the wounded Jimmy collecting the reward and retiring in Florida. The audience would have cheered his pluckiness. If it had been a Russian film, Jimmy would have become mayor or governor and taken out perfectly legal revenge against Tom. Other filmmakers would have had Jimmy's girl turn on the hoods with Jimmy. If it had been a Japanese film, Tom would have hired private detectives, eventually smoked Jimmy out and it would have been thrown out of court or some such. The class hatred angle was done so much better by Victor Hugo, I don't know why they bothered. The ending we got was the dumbest possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't miss with this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Popular director Ron Howard ( "Backdraft", "Night Shift", "Parenthood", "Apollo 13" ) again delivers a risk free, sure fire hit with "Ransom". When you've got a volatile subject, a solid, if somewhat crowd pleasing script and Mel Gibson playing the everyman type hero, how can you miss?Richard Price and Alexander Ignon have delivered a screenplay that grabs the attention early, and though it lulls somewhat in the early stages after a pacey start, the tension that is generated in the final third of the film is truly tangible.Gibson is easy to identify with as self made multi-millionaire Tom Mullen, and he is most believable as the father desperate to find his son. Evergreen Mel improves as the movie progresses, yet one can't help but wonder how much of a stretch this role is for him. For an actress of obvious talent, Rene Russo gets very little to do, yet she does well as the anxious mother praying for the return of her lost child. The support cast are perhaps the movie's real strength, with Delroy Lindo hard to miss as the FBI man in charge of the operation trying to find the boy ( Brawley Nolte ). Even more impressive though is Gary Sinise as detective Jimmy Shaker. Indeed an eye catching about face for an actor accustomed to 'lighter' roles ( "Apollo 13", "Forrest Gump" ).Editors Dan Hanley and Michael Hill could perhaps have tightened up the first half of the film, but their work on the latter half is most commendable. The music from Howard Shore is right on the mark, as is the cinematography from Piotr Sobocinski. Director Ronny never pretends to be delivering any more than professional, reliable entertainment with a few small surprises. The result is a safe bet, a good night out.Sunday, November 17, 1996 - Hoyts Forest Hill Chase</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson (Braveheart, Maverick) stars as the rich father of a kidnapped boy, played by Brawley Nolte (Nick Nolte's son). The kidnappers give a ransom of 2 million dollars. Rene Russo (Outbreak, Major League) plays his wife. Delroy Lindo (Clockers, Get Shorty) plays the head FBI agent on the case. Gary Sinise plays a New York cop. Gibson soon starts to doubt the chances of the ransom working, so he changes the ransom to a bounty on the kidnapper's head. The film is well-directed by Ron Howard (Apollo 13, Cocoon). The story line is gripping and well-written. Mel Gibson is excellent as the father. Rene Russo and Gary Sinise are good in their roles. Delroy Lindo delivers the best supporting performance, he plays the agent very convincingly. A suspenseful, entertaining, and overall great film. Rating R: (violence, language)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They may take our lives, but they will never take our CHILDREN...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ransom" is one of those films that defined the late 90s. With large budgets, larger than life sets, bigger stars, and predictable situations, "Ransom" demonstrates that overabundant Hollywood escapism. There was no worry that a Mel Gibson movie would flop ? there was no concern that ticket prices would drive audiences away ? there was no worries about putting $80 million dollars on the table because this had everything late-90s cinema goers wanted to see with their popcorn and soda. This movie was melodramatic; this gave audiences an evil guy that was loved in "Forrest Gump", and it kept us cool for nearly two hours. It had everything. This was a time of taking risks and pushing big names into theaters ? now, well, (and one could argue "thankfully") that recycled magic has gone. A film like this could not exist today. The "safe" nature of this film would be pushed aside for quirky camera footage, younger actors, and less tears with more violence. Audiences have changed, and while I have grown up beyond the "Ransom" excitement, I was feeling this love/hate relationship with this film. In 1996, when this film was being released, I was first being introduced to cinema. I was going to theater at any opportunity, I was being pulled into these less-than spectacular situations, and people like Gibson, Sinise, Russo, and Howard were idols because of what they could accomplish on screen. But like any child, I was pulled into the glamour, the hype, and the glitz, while in retrospect, the basics were being missed. Watching "Ransom", now thirteen years later, it just doesn't seem like the type of film that deserved wide release. Watching this film today, it felt more like a superimposed made-for-TV movie than a blockbuster. To begin, director Ron Howard was out of his element with this film. "Apollo 13", "Blackdraft", "Splash", even "Willow" seems to be more nature based dramas, so to feel him helming this violence-based drama, it just felt staged and unfocused. In the director commentary, Howard discusses how he attempted to use POV shots to convey the story and develop his characters, and while the idea was present, the execution just felt phony. The juggle between Gibson and Russo's perspective at times felt dizzy to the viewer. Yes, the details around a kidnapped child have that effect; it creates havoc for the viewer ? ultimately missing stronger themes throughout. That isn't to say Howard didn't have some powerful shots with his cinematographer, overall "Ransom" just missed the strength behind the camera. Then, as if to overcompensate for this, Howard allows his actors to overpower the screen with their over-the-top characters. Gibson, a wealthy airline tycoon, goes from passive father to vengeful cynic (a la "Payback") in a mere instant, allowing ? sadly - more drama to unfold between Russo and Sinise. Who was the central focus of this film? This is an excellent question for Mr. Howard as well as the cast. Is Gibson the main character? Is his child the main character or merely the developing plot? Is the wooden Delroy Lindo a major player, or is Sinise just trying to keep up with Gibson's anger? Valid questions that, alas, cannot be answered by this film. "Ransom" attempts to bring too many twists and turns into an already filled suitcase, and the end result is catastrophe. If this would have merely been a story about Gibson reacting to the capture of his son, and Sinise never being revealed until the end, then "Ransom" would have successfully accomplished with what it set out to do. The pivotal ending would have been more controlled and dramatic, that this would have made this normal film stand proud. Instead, Howard incorporates two "family" dramas together, the Gibson family, and the jumbled undeveloped Sinise family whom includes Lili Taylor, Liev Schriber, Evan Handler, and Donnie Wahlberg. Again, this would work well on paper if we would have the opportunity to see via each perspective, but we do not even within the two hours. Therefore it becomes further unfocused, and disruptive to the central conflict.Finally, the last twenty minutes were mere fluff. Not to give away plot, but it felt like it was placed there for those wishing Gibson would provide some much needed action to the screen. Nothing that developed, nothing that revealed, nothing that enhanced, merely staged action for a drunk with Hollywood money audience. It was shameful.Overall, I disliked "Ransom". When I first began this review, I was in a love/hate relationship, but as I wrote I found more issues with this film. The lack of development between minor characters, the entire Jackie Brown subplot was embarrassing, and the scene in which Russo visits the church just wasted my time. The transitions between scenes and plots were lacking, which I blame directly on Howard's inability to control what was happening. He had a strong focus, but the execution is where it faltered. I do not see myself watching this film ever again ? and ultimately will smile when seen on late night TV or in the dollar bin ? that was the feel of "Ransom".Grade: ** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharks vs. Hacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bottom line to this flick is: "Better businessmen do better business". The evil protagonist in this yarn (Sinise), in the final analysis, can't do good business with the pro (Gibson). The dirty cop fancies himself a shark who has been limited in his station by the breaks. Clouded by his inferiority and hatred of his class, this loser simply can't keep up with the Trump-like entrepreneur who finally sees the game for what it is and out-does his adversary. Personal weakness and self-loathing have driven the self-styled "master criminal" to his actions in the first place. Money is just a way to keep score.Gibson, on the other hand, would just as soon have closed the deal in the first place. When he clears the fog and the emotional "baggage" of his son, his business instincts take over and he pretty much mops the floor with the amateur. Kind of a metaphor for why the world works the way it does.It is both maddening and a mark of class distinction to the villain that, from a monetary standpoint, this is no big thing for Gibson, apart from the personal issues.This should be a message to those want to play with the big boys: your opponent didn't get there for nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the terrific APOLLO 13, I thought Ron Howard was ready to move on to even bigger things, Mel Gibson is good when he's given the chance to act, Richard Price is one of my favorite writers, Lili Taylor is one of my favorite actresses, and the trailer really rocked, so I was primed to see this. But it's somewhat disappointing. The filmmakers try to make a flawed hero, and Gibson certainly is that, not afraid to make his character unlikable, and we even get the psychology of a man used to having his way not having his way, and how he reacts to that. And most of the rest of the cast is good(with one exception I'll get to in a moment). As a fan of Taylor, I was especially pleased at how she was used. While she doesn't have a lot of dialogue, she gets to develop her character in a way her fellow villains don't because Howard has her on camera a lot, and she expresses a lot with her face.But the other villains aren't well-developed. The one wrong performance(not bad, wrong) is by Gary Sinise; he tries, but he's just not convincing here, mostly sounding forced. And the last 15 minutes are melodramatic and unconvincing. The elements were all there, but it doesn't deliver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kidnappers snatch the son of multi millionaire airline magnate Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) and demand $2 million ransom for the boys return. Initially it seems a straight forward case of pay the money and all will be well. But with a murky incident from his past hanging heavy on his shoulders, and an overriding feeling that no matter what he does, his son will not be returned alive, Mullen turns the tables on the kidnappers. He instead now offers the ransom money as a bounty reward to anyone who finds the kidnappers, dead or alive.Perhaps with Ron Howard in the directing chair it's no surprise to find that the premise here is toweringly safe. To a parent the snatching of ones offspring is the worst nightmare imaginable. Thus armed with a considerable Hollywood budget and a cast list not to be sniffed at for any big production, Ransom ultimately ends up as a hugely efficient thriller guaranteed to keep sane adults interested. But it really should have been so much more, for although Howard does a stand up professional job, both he and his writers are guilty of not pushing it a bit further to keep the viewers perched firmly on the edge of their seats. What saves Ransom from a standard script devoid of some much needed jolts, is the absorbing performances of Gibson as the stricken and conflicted Mullen, and Gary Sinise as the snarly on the edge kidnapping kingpin, Jimmy Shaker. Their cat and mouse game, in either direction, gives the film its dramatic edge. For although the exasperation that comes from other quarters, Rene Russo's fraught wife and mother-Delroy Lindo's (excellent) FBI team leader; does need to be played out; as does the switch back and forth to the falling apart dummies in the kidnap gang, a film of this type needs serious drama. Thankfully then, that comes in spades from Gibbo and Gary.A great concept that is executed with almost mechanical precision from some of Hollywood's go to film makers. It just lacks a darker edge that the premise had promised, particularly in a rather redundant final reel. Still it's got some tough scenes {Gibson possibly doing the best show of believable male grief in the 90s} and its lead characters are never less than intriguing. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would happen in the movie was no big surprise to me really, thanks to the bad advertising for this movie, in which the main plot twist was already revealed.Still "Ransom" is a very good watchable movie. OK calling it average maybe is not completely fair by me maybe, cause "Ransom" is more than average at times.It really is good that this movies shows both sides of the kidnap, both the little boy's (Brawley Nolte, yes, indeed the son of...) parents (Mel Gibson, Rene Russo) and the kidnappers (Gary Sinise, Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber, Donnie Wahlberg, Evan Handler.). The fact that it also shows the kidnappers is what makes this movie even more tense actually.I'm sorry but I just can't stand Rene Russo in this movie. Her character really irritated me at times. Best actor is Gary Sinise who was really 'hot' in the mid-90's, ever since his Oscar nomination for one of my personal favorite movie's, "Forrest Gump". It was also nice to see the at the time fairly unknown actor Donnie Wahlberg, who also did a good job.The music by James Horner is good, still I'm curious about the original Howard Shore score.Yes the movie has some good moments and is perfectly watchable but it most certainly is not Ron Howard's or Mel Gibson's best. It also is not a movie that I enjoy watching multiple times. Also the original from 1956 is still a better movie even if it doesn't have action or a spectacular ending. At least it was more tense and less predictable as this movie was at times.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

This is my first review so I'm not quite sure how much I should say.So anyways, I'll assume you've already seen this but if you haven't, well would you be surprised to know that this is about a kidnapping! As an airline exec. Mel has made some enemies' and one day his son is taken by Gary Sinise &amp; Co. Well, at first Mel cooperates but he soon thinks that he'll never see his son again, alive anyways, if he pays. What follows is a spectacular scene in which Mel dedicates his life to finding and terribly murdering those responsible. Thing is Gary is a cop and is that a great cover or what!Even if you don't like Mel still rent this one. You'll love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great psychological gamesmanship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite film of all time, I've probably seen it 50 times. Gibson plays the part of a self made airline owner whose son is kidnapped by NYPD detective gone bad Gary Sinise. After a bungled ransom drop Gibson realizes if he pays the ransom demanded his son will be killed. He attempts to the turn the table on Sinise by offering the ransom amount as a bounty on Sinise's head, which Gibson will withdraw if Sinise releases his son. I love the psychological battle between Gibson and Sinise as each battles to establish dominance over each other and of the situation. In what I would call the climactic scene of the movie, the direction and writing are about the best I've ever seen on celluoid. Gibson has a final 90 second phone call with Sinise. Sinise offers proof of life by allowing the kidnapped son to say Daddy into the phone. He then offers one last chance for Gibson to withdraw the bounty and pay the ransom. Gibson refuses and the camera pans back to Sinise who points his gun in the direction of Gibson's son and fires. The next 60 seconds consists of jumping to reaction shots of all the main players - the audience is not sure if the son is alive or not. The drama in this scene is overwhelming.After this climactic scene - the movie winds up about a half hour later with an action packed ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After being reminded how good an actor Mel Gibson can be in Expendables 3, I have decided to revisit some of his earlier work. This time around i decided to watch 1996's Ransom. I saw this in the cinema when it was released, but for some reason I have never revisited it. And I had totally forgotten how good this movie is!! All the cast are superb. I cannot praise them highly enough here. Gibson who has contributed some tough fisted, hard as nails characters over the years is perfect as the vulnerable panic stricken father. Re teaming with Gibson after Lethal Weapon 3 is Rene Russo who is excellent as the desperate mother. Gary Sinese, Delroy Lindo, Donnie Whalberg, Liev Shrieber and Paul Guilfoyle are all solid support. There is not one weak link in the castRon Howard has directed a movie that is a highly professional piece of work, swift and suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for perfect entertainment.Gibson is truly a great actor, and hopefully he can sort his personal problems and demons out, because as we all know Hollywood loves comebacks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense thriller. Another great Gibson movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie first when it came out and I was only about 11 years old or so. So I decided to give it a watch nearly ten years later and I loved it even more. Its not a very original idea and it has been done before but the writing and the great performance by Mel Gibson make this far superior to most of the movies with this subject.This movie is about a well off boss of an airline who while at the park with his family one day has his son kidnapped. The kidnappers ask for a two million dollars ransom. The father is going to pay without any questions until he starts thinking that once he pays they will kill his son so he comes up with a back up plan.This is a really good thriller and another great movie from Gibson. I have always been a Gibson fan and I only wish he made more movies these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard and Mel Gibson have a thing in common. Unreliability of excellence. Both have done exceptional work, but some of it not so. This is ironically a meeting of those inconsistencies in a movie that is not the best or the worst of either. The blending of the two talented, if spotty, mega-stars ends up being a glaring case of highlighted mediocrity not superiority.The overacting and totally unbelievable Gibson uses many mannerisms of his earlier films and seems unable to play any emotion except righteous indignation, and that he does well. But here he is called upon to emote and react with heartfelt feelings that come off as hammy and borderline horrendous. His best scenes are in the car and on the phone and with the bad guys and the worst are with his wife and child and his over reactions with the FBI and police.The Director gives this a good try but again, he seems glaringly out of his element. The action scenes are well done but the suspense and the rhythm of the film seems craggy and out of step. Since then he has honed his abilities and stylish beats and does much better in recent years. But here he is not quite with it when it comes to this type of thing.The bad guys scenes work much better than the family situations both with the kid and with law enforcement types. The plot is overly complex with muddled motivations but moves along quickly enough to make this nothing more than an average feeling man's action movie that has too much fake feeling and not enough edgy action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The gaping hole between fiction and reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this movie is that a father becomes convinced that the kidnappers of his son will kill his boy even if he pays up; in his desperation he goes rogue, offering money for anyone who helps find the abductors instead...... which might seem like a good idea on screen, but is a horrible one if you have the slightest demand for realism. It was quite ridiculous to watch the ruthless kidnapper-boss getting himself all pumped up over Mel's strategy. In real life Mel would have probably received an envelope with his son's fingers each day he wasn't paying. I mean come on- there are plenty of things one can do short of killing that would have made anyone in the world pay in half an hour.So yeah, the acting was good, the action OK, the movie as a whole entertaining, but it's hard to give it a good mark if its core idea doesn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ron Howard presents Mel Gibson? with Blood!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Multi-millionaire airline mogul Mel Gibson (as Tom Mullen) loses track of his son at a science fair, and kidnappers are there to take advantage. Dirty detective Gary Sinise (as Jimmy Shaker) and his gang want $2,000,000 in exchange for the kid, but Mr. Gibson finds out a prearranged drop-off place wasn't known to an accomplice (Donnie Wahlberg), and realizes the gang has no intention of returning his son alive. This causes Gibson to take matters into his own hands. His distraught wife Rene Russo (as Kate) and FBI agent Delroy Lindo (as Lonnie Hawkins) try to convince Gibson his plans will fail, but Gibson will not be deterred? This re-make of a 1950s teleplay is exciting enough, but leaves you wondering about plot details, if you think too deeply about the unfolding story. Two examples are a certain "check-signing scene" and a "voice recognition scene" which stand out like a couple of sore thumbs. To make things interesting, the story makes hero Gibson a crooked businessman, while adding some sympathetic character traits to lesser members of Mr. Sinise's gang. Gibson and Sinise play against each other well. Director Ron Howard and crew updates the original's plot by pumping a bucket of blood into the story. "Ransom" paid off at the box office.****** Ransom (11/1/96) Ron Howard ~ Mel Gibson, Gary Sinise, Rene Russo, Delroy Lindo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting on a great plot - stained by Hollywood stereotypes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The moment, when Tom Mullen makes the ransom a bounty, is one of the most fascinating for me in action cinema ever. And how the camera is descending to the banknotes after the end of his declaration a spectacular follow-up.I found Mel Gibson's acting in showing the price, Tom Mullen must pay for his strictness, superb. The aura of iciness, Gary Sinise gives to Jimmy Shaker, and Tom Mullens desperate try to overpower him in relentlessness was a fascinating show for me - rising some interesting thoughts about money.However - how the story turns to the final shootout is far below that level. And that there is such a shootout at all too. One of many Hollywood clichés in that film. Others are the paternal chief agent (sheer papier-mâché), family shown as something everlasting whole, founding a company as a heroic act. There is certainly more - however, i'm a German.These clichés spoil a lot of the pleasure to have seen this exciting film. I feel slightly abused by this film again, as by so many others.</fullReview>

Want realism, action with meaning, interesting stories with good execution, good editing, good effects, good acting, etc. On this case I just can't say anything bad about this movie. Maybe a little sad, but you can expect that from a ransom.If you want drama and action, you should like it. Maybe not the best movie, but very satisfactory to watch.

		<fullReview>This movie started to lose me when the plot had Mel turning up the heat on the kidnappers. I mean, don't kidnappers usually return the heat, with a severed finger or ear of the victim, showing up in the mail! Does anyone remember the Getty case? I kept thinking to myself, yes this is Hollywood - but do they seriously expect us/me to believe this rubbish.Cops and robbers films need credible scripts that leave the viewer thinking - "well, yes this could actually happen". This is the prime essential ingredient of a thriller or drama. This film never made me feel that way. I became annoyed, thinking that I was being served a load of tripe. This movie would best be categorised in the fantasy realm - it would never happen. Waste your money if you have to, as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ransom would make my top 10 movie list purely on emotional impact alone. Superb acting is the centerpiece to a strong storyline. It has just enough action and suspense to be entertaining, without taking away from the story.Overview: Tom Mullen, is a Selfmade Millionaire and Familyman, who has everything. But his son is taken from him, so Tom, contacts the FBI. Sent to assist him is the same agent(Delroy Lindo) who investigated Gibson on a prior Bribery accusation, involving his company. The Kidnappers demand Ransom, but the drop is botched when the FBI intervenes. Now Gibson is forced to face the hard fact that he may never get his son back, and decides to take an unthinkable gamble!TO THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE: The most emotional scene I have ever scene, is just after Shaker fires the Gun at Tom's son. The Gibson and Russo interaction on the Balcony was amazing. I was also very pleased with the Depth Lindo and the Screenplay gave his character. You see his willingness to Manipulate Tom and his wife, to save their son. But his straight forward comment to Tom, about possibly using his comments against him, during Tom's Bribery's confession, shows his Character's character. The movie often forced me to Empathize with these people and their plight, shoving me face first into each moment. Even the crew of kidnappers felt real. Although they were the bad guys they weren't made out to be the embodiment of evil, they were human, corrupted regular people. Howard as director did exactly as he should have, he made you forget you were watching a movie! No matter how many times I watch this, it always entertains and impresses me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent, intense movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ransom is an excellent, intense movie with a strong cast, a great script, and an excellent director all rolled up into one. The film was released on November 8, 1996 from Touchstone Pictures and in my opinion was one of the best films of 1996. The film stars Mel Gibson as Tom Mullen, a wealthy businessman who runs an airline company which is the fourth highest airline in the world. He's married to his wife, Kate played by Rene Russo(who was great in Tin Cup and Lethal Weapon 4). They have everything in the world that they wanted, but it all crashes when their son, Sean played by Brawley Nolte(real life son of Nick Nolte) is kidnapped by NYC detective Jimmy Shaker played by Gary Sinese. Shaker wants 2 million dollars in cash with 50's and 100's and no marked bills or Sean will die. The cat and mouse game begins between Tom and Jimmy. Tom cooperates with FBI and it's leader Agent Lonnie Hawkins played by Delroy Lindo(who was awesome in Malcom X and good in Romeo Must Die as Aaliyah's Father). The Mullens will do anything to get their son even if they kills them to do it. Jimmy has put together a group of young guns to hold Sean hostage. Jimmy's girlfriend Maris Conner is the tough chick and was Tom's caterist at his parties. Lili Taylor plays Maris and also there's the Barnes brothers: Clark and Cubby played by Liev Schriber and Donnie Walberg of New Kids on the Block and Boomtown. also there's Evan Handler as Miles who's involved as well. The film caught me from the beginning to the end. I really liked the ending in which Gibson and Sinese have a great confrontation towards the end and you won't believe it. The film is excellent and exicting throughout. Gibson gives an excellent as Tom Mullen, i think he deserved an Oscar Nomination for his great performance. Russo was terrific as the wife who's afraid for Gibson and the fear for her son. Sinese was amazing as the conniving, sneaky, slimy, and unfaithful cop who kidnaps young Sean Mullen. Sinese puts up great performances throughout his career including Forrest Gump, Snake Eyes, Mission to Mars, Apollo 13, and George Wallace. Lindo is good as Hawkins, Taylor was a mainstay as Conner, and the cast: Schriber, Walhberg, Handler, and the young Brawley Nolte all were great in their roles. I recommend watching this film, you'll absolutely love it. Ron Howard did an excellent job directing this film. He was also great in directing Apollo 13, Parenthood, Cocoon, and A Beautiful Mind. Overall, Ransom is a 2 hour, 1 mintue fun ride that will take your breath away and leave you out of your seat begging for more.By Gerald P. Garrow- 1/5/0310/10 = Excellent</fullReview>

The psychological confrontation between Gibson's character and Sinise's character is a marvel to behold. The only blemish on the film is the ending whose handling could've been improved. Nevertheless, outstanding performances from Gibson, Russo and Sinise highlight this Ron Howard project. Highly recommended, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Neatly Twisted Kidnap Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kidnap thrillers usually produce plenty of tension and drama but when they also feature action, excitement and a terrific plot, they're virtually irresistible. This is certainly the case with "Ransom" which is highly entertaining, thoroughly engrossing and justifiably became a huge commercial success. Because the story involves the abduction of a child, emotions run high from an early stage as the parents and everyone else involved with trying to bring the child back home safely, struggle to keep their composure in order to achieve the best possible end-result.During a science fair in Central Park, Sean (Brawley Nolte), who's the 9-year-old son of wealthy airline owner Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) and his wife Kate (Rene Russo), is abducted by a gang of criminals who take him to their house where they handcuff him to a bed and tape up his eyes before sending the Mullens an e-mail in which they demand a payment of $2,000,000 for the return of their son. Tom calls in the FBI who soon arrive and use his New York City penthouse as their operations room.Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins (Delroy Lindo) who's in charge of the investigation, is also an expert in dealing with kidnapping situations and so when he advises Tom to pay the ransom to get his child back, Tom readily agrees and meets up with one of the gang members to hand over the cash. Things go wrong however, when an FBI helicopter suddenly appears and following an exchange of gunfire, the gang-member is left dead and Tom is no wiser about the location of his son. Even more seriously, when Tom reflects on the gang member's reactions when he was going to hand the cash over, he becomes convinced that the gang never had any intention of returning Sean alive, even if the full ransom had been paid. Tom's response to this situation is swift and shocking as he goes on TV and announces that he's no longer prepared to pay the ransom and is instead, offering the money as a bounty to anyone who can bring in the kidnappers dead or alive.Tom calculates that the kidnappers' best move would be to return his son safely to avoid being hunted down by a bounty hunter but Kate and Lonnie certainly don't see things the same way. Kate, who's always been a very devoted and supportive wife, is desperately upset because she's convinced that Tom's putting Sean's life in greater danger by not co-operating with the kidnappers and Lonnie tries to use rational argument to dissuade Tom from what he's doing. Interestingly, Tom's action also triggers discord amongst the kidnappers and a whole series of unexpected developments then follow before the story reaches its violent climax.The character of Tom Mullen is interesting because he's a self-made man who'd built up his airline from nothing and his success had made him used to being able to get his own way either by negotiation or (on one notable occasion) bribery. The criminal who'd masterminded the kidnapping had targeted Tom because of his wealth but also significantly because he's identified him as "a payer". Tom is consumed with guilt about this action in his past which had led to his son's life being put in danger and Kate and himself having to suffer unbearable levels of anguish, fear and despair as a consequence.In an incredibly intense performance, Mel Gibson portrays the frustration, anger and pain that Tom endures as he tries to navigate his way through a dreadful ordeal and Rene Russo is also convincing as she displays Kate's mixture of fear for her child and outrage at her husband's actions. Gary Sinise is great as the kidnapping mastermind and the remainder of the cast members are also superb in this wonderfully enjoyable, plot-driven thriller that's full of neat twists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ransom (1996): Dir: Ron Howard / Cast: Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, Gary Sinise, Delroy Lindo. Lili Taylor: Misfiring action thriller that boarders on being clever but substitutes revealing information and a climax where violence is overused. Title regards a kidnapped boy but it is his father who has something to hide thus making him as much a prisoner. Mel Gibson stars as a former fighter pilot who now owns an airline but he is under investigation for bribing union officials. F.B.I advise him to pay the ransom but he offers a reward for his son's return instead. Directed with detail by Ron Howard with a realistic touch to the operation but this doesn't place well against his superior films such as Apollo 13 and The Paper. Gibson plays a man who is desperate yet smart. He is given the one role worth its salt until its action oriented third act. Rene Russo plays his frustrated wife who is totally brainless when she shows up at a location after being summoned by the kidnappers and is threatened. Gary Sinise as a corrupt cop would make a great villain but perhaps had the film saved that information for the third act as oppose to revealing it in the first thus leaving nothing left. Delroy Lindo leads the ransom operation, which is standard issue material. Lili Taylor plays one of Sinise's one dimensional accomplices. Theme regards the issue of ransom and measures taken.

		<fullReview>When a rich man (Mel Gibson)'s son (B. Nolte) is kidnapped, he cooperates with the police at first but then tries a unique tactic against the criminals.One thing I really like about this film is the comparison of New York City with the two species from H. G. Wells' "The Time Machine": the elite and the cannibals. Now, what is most interesting is how they stopped at New York City and did not take it further. Could we not say this is most of society (at least in America)? But still, very clever.But really, this is a good action film. Sure, not as in-your-face as "Taken"... but still rather clever, relying more on wit than guns. Gibson challenges the kidnapper without getting physical, and there are twists that are rather clever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Gibson deals with kidnapper Gary Sinise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been such a long time since I watched Ransom (1956) with Glenn Ford that I can't compare this one with it. I think they have the same skeleton plot but the Gibson one seems more elaborate. In any event, this is a good Hollywood product right down the line. It's above average for thrillers of this kind. The story hangs together. The acting is convincing. There's plenty of screen time on the bad guys who kidnap Gibson and Rene Russo's son, and that adds a lot of suspense and color to the film. Delroy Lando is excellent as the FBI agent in charge. Gary Sinise gives a well-balanced performance, showing appropriate restraint and explosiveness at times. There's plenty of suspense. Only in one scene in which Gibson was crying did I feel the script had gone too maudlin. Fortunately it was brief.The main thing lacking in a picture of this length is greater insight into the characters. We get quite a bit on Gibson as industrialist who did something shady, but that's left unresolved at the end, and it's still light on his character. We get even less on the motivations and ways of the gang led by Sinise. They are disunited, to be sure, and we develop some ideas but the script is not sharp enough to develop these characters in greater depth. For an example of the very best in that direction, see "The Asphalt Jungle" (1950).Apart from this lack of depth, the film is a decent suspense-thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Mel Gibson as Endeavor Airline President Tom Mullen is put on the spot when his 12 year old son Sean,Brawley Nolte,is kidnapped by a gang of hoods lead one of New York's Finest hero cop Let. Jimmy Shaker, Gary Sinise. It's in him feeling low paid, like getting $80,000.00 plus a year isn't enough for him!, and him being a disrespected member of the working class cop Shaker had all his life developed a deep seeded hatred of anyone with money. And he sees Mullen and his family as perfect targets for his insane paranoia against the rich and famous which he considers Tom Mullen to be member of.As it later turns out the two million dollars in ransom money he want's for Sean safe return is just a cover in what Shaker really wanted in having it both ways: Getting the money and at the same time killing the innocent Sean to satisfy his both blood and money lust! It take's a while for Tom to figure out just what a low-life piece of you know what Shanker really is, far lower then his lame brain accomplices,and decides to play a game of chicken with him against the advice of his wife Kate, Rene Russo, and the FBI Agent in charge of the kidnap case Agent Lonnie Hawkins, Delroy Lindo.Going on TV to make an announcement to his son's kidnappers Tom instead of paying up tell the shocked and at the same time confused hoods that the 2 million he's got in ransom money is now a bounty on their heads for anyone who can track them down and bring them to justice! That's unless they return Sean safely and unharmed to him and Kate. With the heat now on the kidnappers they start to unravel and it's hero cop Shanker who's the first to jump ship! Not in turning himself in and releasing Sean but gunning down in cold blood his cohorts and making it look like he save Sean from his kidnappers! In the process of his "heroic action" Shanker is shot and wounded by his fellow kidnapper and lover Maris Connor,Lili Taylor, who in return Shaker blasts to kingdom come. ***SPOILERS*** Now things really start getting interesting with Shanker wanting to collect his hard earned 4 million, Tom had since doubled the bounty price, that he murdered some half dozen people for and jumps the gun by showing up at Tom's fifth Ave penthouse to collect. That instead of waiting a few day for the hero of the years ceremony at City Hall where he's to be given the four million dollar check by both Tom and the Mayor of the City of New York! Slasher like ending with both Tom and Shaker having it out at the bank where he's,Tom, to deposit the four million dollar check into an off shore account in Shanker's name. Tom had gotten the lowdown to who Shaker really is, Sean's kidnapper, by seeing Sean wetting his pants when he heard his voice, at the Mullen penthouse, the same voice he heard when he was held kidnapped and blindfold by Shaker and his gang. This touched off one of the goriest ending in movie history as Shaker after being shot to pieces by police and FBI bullets and cut to ribbons, by going head first through a plate glass store window, still had enough left to pull out a gun out of his ankle holster only to get plugged with enough lead that would have sunk a fully equipped and manned US Navy nuclear aircraft-carrier!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing so many raves/reviews about Mel Gibson's latest show "Signs" (I have not watch it as reading all the reviews gives me a pretty good idea "what" the show is about and going to be and I don't think I will be watching it either) reminds me of another show of his that I have watched in TV lately.(Might contain spoilers)To sum it up, this is a well-made movie which builds the story and tension up slowly. Twists and turns are also woven into it as who would think that Tom Mullen would turn the situation around and risk his son's life by offering money on the villian's head instead of paying the ransom.There is a well thought story plot and it actually carries thru the movie unlike some movies where the start is good and trails off..... Plus unexpected twists and change of emotions and really good acting that the audience would want to follow to find out what's gonna to happen.Mel Gibson is good in this movie and esp. Gary Sinise, whom I think is a underrated actor. His performance shows as he proceeds from a calm and know-how-to-pull-it-off to how he decided to change plans and betrayed his partners.A gripping show with a story plot (which sadly, they don't seem to make it anymore nowadays).</fullReview>

The hard test Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) and his wife (Rene Russo) had to pass in their relationship, was the strongest, most moving part in the movie. But there was one point that I didn´t like: When Mullen said, that he won´t pay the ransom and outs out a reward on the kidnappers heads - that was just incredible.

		<shortDescription>Finally a Mel Gibson movie worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My only previous experience with Mel Gibson was the eminently forgettable "Braveheart," so I was pleasantly surprised to see him in a good, entertaining movie.Tom Mullen built an airline through the sweat of his own brow, and when a low-life labor union boss tried to ruin his company he ended up having to resort to a bribe to stop him. For that, the media and the FBI wanted to persecute him.When his son Sean was kidnapped, he called those same FBI agents in to help him. Instead of coming up with anything helpful, they wimped out by insisting that he pay off the kidnappers. Then they screwed up the payoff by killing the mule Gary Sinise had sent to pick up the money, thereby endangering Sean's life.Tom (Gibson)finally realizes that the kidnappers in all likelihood will kill his son no matter what he does, so he turns the tables by taking the two million he was going to use as a reward and making it instead a bounty on Sinise's head.At this point, it seemed to me, the plot missed a bet. In real life, that two million dollars would have turned the other bad guys against Sinise, and at least one of them would have tried to turn him in for the money.All in all, I thought it was a truly good movie. I gave it a 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole story in this movie is not that unusual, but the way the different events takes place, is very unusual and surprising. The whole time it left me guessing what might happen next, but it kept surprising me all the time.It's very exiting, and if there's something about it that is not unusual, then it would be that Gibson delivers another excellent performance as the desperate but yet cold-blooded father who stops at nothing to get his son back alive!It's a very good movie, and it deserves the good reviews it's been getting ever since it's release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ron and Mel Deliver the Goods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard and his team have crafted a polished, tight thriller that squarely hits its mark, and I strongly recommend this as a rental. Mel and Rene deliver the dramatic goods as expected, but an unexpected high point is the Gary Sinese portrayal of a corrupt police detective and mastermind of the kidnapping. (This is not a spoiler since all the protagonists are exposed very early in the movie, a device which is required as the course of the kidnapping progresses).Caveat: Even though you know in your heart of hearts that Ron and Mel will ensure that some form of justice prevails, the scenes with the kidnapped child may be too intense for younger viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson is one of the best actors I have ever seen and this film yet again blow my mind. After watching other fantastic films that Mel Gibson has done I have leaned that I can't be disappointed with the films he acts in. This film shows just how far a father would go just to save the life of his son. Gibson is a very rich owner of a his own air port and because of this he becomes a target and so does his wife and child. Well at a day trip to the park Mel and his wife lose track of there son and next thing they know he is gone and not long after that they get a video of there son tied up and a voice demanding a ransom for his return. Mel and his wife agree to the terms and attempt to hand over the ransom of $2 million but it all goes to hell thanks to the kidnappers and Mel derides to turn the tables and place a bounty of $4 million on the kidnappers heads for the return of his son and the delivery of the kidnappers, Dead or Alive! The film is a fantastic ride and by far one of Mel Gibson's best films. The film is full of money, action, FBI, dirty cops and many more. The film also stars Gary Sinise, Delroy Lindo, Liev Schreiber and Paul Guilfoyle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I enjoyed watching this movie - even though it felt at times that it would never end. It looks like there are enough reviews on here praising its technical "merits" by Hollywood criteria. I for one do not think the acting had much quality or depth to it at all (Gibson's is really inconsistent/ delirious), nor would I say at all that this is a "good" film story, just an enjoyable one, and a compelling one for the following reason; This is possibly the most thinly-veiled cinematic propagation of a Neoliberal capitalist mentality I have seen - from the mid-nineties: White collar criminal (Gibson) gains his redemption / dignity and the respect of his family and government (the skeptical FBI agent (Lindo)) by pursuing a stubborn, risky path of non-negotiation (which jeopardizes the life of his son). Gibson's character refuses to pay-off the "human garbage" who could partially be seen to represent an extralegal justice.. and effectively pits the actors who constitute the threat to his decadent life against one another; the competition literally destroys itself -for the most part. The final scene is the most unbelievable, where we see the corporate 'hero' disobey the faithful but ineffective state - the officers demanding that he "drop the gun", who failed to take down the wayward dissatisfied officer from their ranks. A sort of case for the benefits of extreme self-interest, privatization, deregulation of business, realpolitik, etc.? This is an interesting watch as it significantly predates the wall street crash, the more contemporary political-economic policy that one would associate with this sort of message, and the more recent flashier action films (i.e. Nolan's Dark Knight, Miller's 300 etc) that are recognizable now as the Hollywood promotion of (I would say quite TOXIC) Neoliberalism. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

The long, drawn out sequences between Gibson and Sinise just add to the suspense. This is Mel Gibson at his absolute best! Ransom is probalbly the best movie I've seen.

		<fullReview>Perhaps it is a reflection of just how good and underrated Mel Gibosn is as an actor that many, many reviewers of many of his (unfortunately) too few films (which is a plea to please make a few more)remark on how a particular character he plays is close to the "real" Mel. Well, I think this one may come closer than most. I have heard from a number of people who know him (he had a home in my home town for a number of years and was in occasional residence with his family) that he really, truly is a very engaged father and a very decent guy who (obviously) likes to get his way and has a lot of smarts and talent (the looks don't hurt either). In this movie you get to admire his looks, see his smarts and feel his intensity. Kidnapping has to be a major fear for a celebrity and something in his face suggested (at least to me) that this movie struck a chord. Rene Russo is not a particular favorite of mine but as in the past Mel brings out something not often evident in her performances and I liked her here. Gary Sinese was sensational and Mel, well, to quote his character in Ransom, "what can I say ... he's the man..." Boy oh boy, is he ever. Great Mel in a Great Movie as a Great Dad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson is Tom Mullen, the high-flying boss of a successful airline who's spent the past three months trying to hide the fact that he's been bribing union officials. Sensing from the media coverage that our man's 'a payer', bent copper Gary Sinise pulls together a gang of knuckle-draggers, nabs Tom's son and demands the big bucks for his safe return.After initially jumping through various hoops at the whim of his son's captors, Tom eventually hatches a plan to give this nasty piece of work some food for thought. Although I can't say what it is here because it would give the whole hook of the film away, it's bloody good."Ransom" at first appears to be shaping up as an instantly forgettable and unapologetically mainstream thriller - but some wonderful twists around the midway point make the second half of this movie an unexpected treat. Director Ron Howard doesn't quite get to grips with letting us into what makes the lead characters tick. But there's a genuinely thrilling plot that will keep your eyes fixed to the screen with increasing intensity as things progress.An extremely underrated film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This WILL have spoilers. No joke. Serious Spoilers.There are truly no other words I can use to describe Ransom. It was suspenseful and yet made you think of every other kidnapping movie/TV show you have ever seen. Will the kid die? will the dad get his son killed? Will there be a happy ending?Spoiler: No. No. Yes.The hero saves the day. The bad guys (girl) die. The marriage is saved. The kid pees his pants.The one thing that I remember most - having watched this movie three hours and honestly only remembering this one part with the most clarity and excitement was when Mel's character, Tom Mullen and the bad guy Gary Sinise's character, Jimmy Shaker are having a heated conversation. They're shouting like crazed mad men, people are shocked and waiting to hear who is going to win this battle -- then the gun goes off. For a moment and found myself (however irrationally) terrified that Jimmy had shot the kid. But of course that would interfere with the whole happy ending prospect, which I realized after like three seconds of true panic. To be honest I don't really recommend the movie. At times it is far too fast paced, and at others it is much too slow. It was like the film had been put together in such a short amount of time that no one knew what the hell they were doing. Or that they hired some TV show people and said "Hey make this into a TV movie that we can put on the LMN."(Now of course this is a horrible insult. My mom watches the LMN and I make fun of her every time. I even went as far as giving the LMN a mean pet name: Lame Movie Network. Of course it isn't that original, but you try making something terrible that makes sense out of LMN.)Mel's performance is stirring in a particularly long scene on a balcony after the "shooting" I described earlier and probably saves the movie from being a total waste of time. His character was the only one that touched me -- other than that poor kid who peed his pants. I actually thought that was the best thought of thing in the movie. Set aside the plot, the kid hears Jimmy's voice, recognizes it, pees his pants. Pure Gold. And I say this with all seriousness. After that kid peed his pants I nearly cried. He went and hid in his tent and I nearly cried. It was so sad and wonderfully convincing.End note. If you must rent the movie and fast foreword to the shooting scene and the kid peeing his pants scene. The rest of the movie is basically the same as every other kidnapping movie/TV show you have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a really good concept here--rich guy strikes back against his son's kidnappers, finding a way to take the fight to them. Unrealistic, but a yummy looking hook to get you in the theatre a dozen years ago, and have you watch it on the late show now.But there's something missing in Ron Howard's Ransom, maybe a TVish look. I still don't know. It's all tightly plotted and interesting, but it doesn't have a lot of staying power in your mind. After it's over, you just go back to doing whatever it was that was sucking up your attention. There's no linger power in Ransom.Maybe it's this: One part of the movie that still makes me uncomfortably queasy. It's toward the very end of the movie, when the baddie, the always watchable Gary Sinise, is being boxed into a corner by Mel Gibson on one side and the NYPD on the other. Maybe I'm being silly here, but did Howard need to slaughter a couple of patrolman at point blank range, then go on to have an even more nauseatingly bloody climax? It's like he tried to keep the movie relatively thought-provoking, but just couldn't deny the blood lust ending he figured we all wanted.Well, I could have done without it. I'm no rocket surgeon--I don't even play one on TV--but a bit more cerebral and less vascular ending would have done me just fine.I don't like to leave the theatre or turn off the tube with a sour stomach, and Ransom ended with a two-shots-of-the-pink-stuff alarm in my gut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** Contains SPOILERS ***Ransom is a fantastic edge of your seat thriller, you can not imagine what is going to happen. When I first saw the movie, in Malaga, I felt excited because it was a twist to the usual boring ransom films from the past. Mel Gibson's character decided to use the money as bait to lure the kidnapper to him. I felt nervous because the bad cop could shoot the boy at any time. Finally the cop wants his money and went to Gibson's house to collect but when they spoke the boy recognized his voice and wet his pants, it was at this moment when Gibson understood what had happened and tried to not pay the money. After that, the cop got angry and forced him to go to the bank to get the rest of the ransom. At this point the movie became very exciting with a thrilling chase ending in a dramatic final scene where the bad cop is shot.I would recommended this movie because the actors portrayal of the characters was believable and excellent. This is a great way to see how the rich and poor people live in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bad followup for Gibson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one who demands accuracy from a movie, but this one had too many things that were just laughingly unbelieveable. To even suggest that this movie deserved ANY Oscar nominations is just silly. First of all, a police detective cannot accept a reward for doing HIS JOB. It is against the law. And no, before anyone even tries to suggest it, he cannot quit and then get the reward. If he was a detective when he 'found' the kid, it is against the law for him to accept the reward. Secondly, Sinise almost gets away with it, but the kid recognizes his voice and wets himself, thereby giving Mel Gibson evidence that he is being taken. The only problem with this is that this kid HEARD Sinise when he was being 'saved'! Why didn't he say something then, or at any point after returning home? If his voice was so ingrained in his mind that he pees in his pants several days later, then he MUST have recognized it when Sinise was screaming during the rescue.One thing could have made this movie tolerable. It is the same thing that would have made the Talented Mr. Ripley more tolerable as well. The writers should have had the guts that were shown in making Seven. By that I mean, they should NOT have given it a nice cheerful happy cutesy ending! I would have been MUCH more satisfied without that last chase and fight scene if, instead, the movie had ended with Gibson handing Sinise the $4,000,000 check, without even knowing he was the kidnapper. And, of course, it also would have eliminated the folly of the kid now suddenly recognizing the sound of his voice after not doing so right after. Movies need to be daring enough to let the bad guys win every once in awhile. (For the record, Ripley should have ended with Damon on the boat, without him getting recognized by Cate Blanchett, and basically getting away with the murders as well as the money.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Ransom', a common film name for a common film...at least until Mel shakes it up. In one of his best '90s performances Mel Gibson portrays golden boy Tom Mullen, a multimillionaire family man who as a high tree catches a lot of wind. And so, once upon a day Jimmy Shaker blows by and snatches Mullen's son, necessitating two million for his safe return. After a botched first attempt at a ransom trade, the incalculable Mullen abases the kidnappers by announcing in prime time the offering of the ransom money for whoever forks'em over 'dead or alive' - this old film term serves as a perfect indication for the direction the film heads in next: 'Ransom' takes the form of a great old fashioned power struggle, a game of wits between two equally crazed - whether by money or desperation - individuals, as a life hangs in the balance. 'Ransom' makes for a smashing good time, entertaining us with a fittingly raging Gibson, a two-faced grin-y Sinise, backed up with a good script. Filled with more twists and turns than the Space Mountain, the film keeps our attention until the very last minute - although the climax comes a bit closer in the third act - and delivers what it promises in the first act, making it a satisfying crime thriller. After all, the most important thing we expect to get out of these keep-you-guessing thrillers is a climax that doesn't disappoint. Howard's 'Ransom' leaves us with that good taste in our mouths after the credits......see this movie when you get a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say I've ever been a big fan of Mel Gibson, and in fact I can't think of many films he's been in that I'm a fan of; this one included. Ransom is a remake of a 1956 thriller that I haven't seen, so I can't compare the differences between the two; and while this film does feature an interesting story and some good set pieces, there's too many things wrong with it for it to really be considered an effective thriller. As the title suggests, the film centres on a kidnapping. Mel Gibson is Tom Mullen, the rich owner of a successful airline. Naturally, this makes his son a target for kidnappers, and soon into the film; his son is kidnapped by a group demanding ransom. Initially Tom decides to pay, but after a botched drop-off, it soon becomes apparent that the kidnappers have no intention of returning his son to him alive, and this prompts a change of tactics from Tom as he decides to turn the tables on the kidnappers, in spite of the advice of the police and his wife who fear for the boy's safety.One of the problems with the film is simply that it's overlong. The plot would have occupied ninety minutes well, but it's stretched to over two hours and there's not enough about it for it not to feel like filler. It also quickly becomes predictable, which takes the sting out of it. Gibson is really just his usual self and despite a couple of emotional scenes regarding the boy's safety, he never really needs to push his performance up a gear. Gary Sinise is, as usual, cast in the bad guy role and he's slimy as usual; but again, he's nothing to write home about. It's clearly a Ron Howard film as it features his main trademark; namely, it's well made but nothing special. The second half of the film is better than the first and once we reach the twist in the middle, things do start to liven up, which is just as well. The ending provides no real surprises; the final half hour is entertaining enough, but don't be expecting a shock ending. Overall, Ransom is just about worth watching if you have nothing else to do; but I can't recommend anyone going out of their way to see it.</fullReview>

Powerful gripping movie that will keep you on edge till the very last minute.An excellent supporting cast including Rene Russo who plays his wife Kate, Delroy Lindo and Gary Sinise who is now starring in the new CSI show CSI: New York.

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it thinks it is - 72%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was determined to watch a film today and subsequently write the review. Sadly, the choice on TV was not inspiring. As I wasn't a fan and had only a vague idea of who Andy Kaufman actually was, his biopic "Man On The Moon" was second choice to this - a traditional thriller from the director of "Apollo 13". Mel Gibson plays a successful airline owner whose son is kidnapped - so far, so Charles Lindenburg. However, he has a novel approach to dealing with the ransom demand and it turns into a proverbial race-against-time (GOD, I hate that phrase) to find his son and bring the 'nappers to justice.OK so the plot sounds a little weak on paper (or monitor, of course). But it is actually much better than it sounds thanks to a solid effort from the cast. Though under-used, Rene Russo plays Gibson's wife very well - having perfected the role in the Lethal Weapon films - and Gary Sinise does his bad-guy-thing once again. The film feels charged with tension as Gibson and Sinise clash in their contest of wills. Because this isn't a straight-up action flick, "Ransom" is all-the-better for it and proves that thrillers can thrill without over-long gun battles and fist-fights on the top of trains. If this were in the hands of, say, Joel Schumacher then Bruce Willis would be the hero and he'd be fighting Gary Oldman and his army of henchmen at famous locations across New York. Something that we've all seen a hundred times before so thank you Mr Howard, for this welcome addition to the genre.However, the film does have a couple of gripes that I'd like to see addressed. Firstly, Gibson's character isn't as clean-cut as you'd expect and, dare I say it, is portrayed as something of an asshole. As such, I found myself siding with Sinise who almost appears to have moral reasons for kidnapping Gibson's son. In my opinion, Gibson's roles all share the same head-strong, authority-bucking instincts that audiences supposedly love. In this film, it doesn't work - in Gibson's shoes, I'm sure that I'd listen to everything the FBI told me to do and that does not include ignoring advice for telephone conversations and getting personally involved in the ransom drop-off. The ending, also, felt a bit predictable and lastly, there was too much gore. I'm not exactly talking "Passion Of The Christ" here but why did Sinise look like he'd been dragged over three feet of razor-wire when he'd only fell through a single pane of glass? For some reason, I kept thinking that Richie from "Happy Days" had directed this and it looked like he was paying homage to that old favourite, Quentin Tarantino.Ron Howard is clearly a director with talent and this is a cracking story, deserving of a modern update (it was originally made in the Fifties). He draws a fine performance from his cast and keeps the film exciting and taunt. Ransom, despite its flaws, is well worth checking out even if it is only to remember Gibson's good old days before he became an over-ambitious director with delusions of religious grandeur.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old reliable Gibson stars in this slick, glossy, marginally predictable thriller by Ron Howard. Ransom will not have you on the edge of your seat, because you know NOTHING is going to happen to the kid. That doesn't stop this film from being entertaining. Mel Gibson portrays the abducted child's father nicely; making up for Russo's embarrassing screaming scenes.The supporting cast keeps this film moving, with Delroy Lindo and Gary Sinse adding a nice flavor to the film. The last 30 minutes, are what make Ransom a memorable Hollywood thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a beautifully done plot twist about halfway through this movie which elevates it above and beyond your typical crime thriller. It occurs when Mel Gibson (playing a self made airline tycoon) comes to believe that his kidnapped son will be killed if he simply takes the safe route and pays the ransom. At that point, he turns the tables on the kidnapper in a stunning TV appearance, and the rest of the film is about the mind games of bluff and counterbluff that Gibson's character and the kidnapper play against each other. Gary Sinise makes an outstanding villain, and Mel Gibson and Rene Russo are spot on as the terrified parents of a kidnapped child. There are tons of crime drama wanna-be's (se7en, for example) but very few that really fill the bill. "Ransom" is one of the rare ones that succeeds on all levels.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had a 6.8/10 rating when I last looked, which I confess to being very surprised at. I love this film for its very real performances delivered by its three stars, Mel Gibson, Rene Russo and Gary Sinise. It is a tried and tested scenario - hugely successful business man finds his power worthless when faced with a situation that every parent would identify with. In this case it is the safety of his son that is at stake.I have always admired Gibson as a very real actor in these such situations - the determination of leadership in BRAVEHEART, the yearning to be accepted into society in THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE, and even the slow decent into madness (LETHAL WEAPON). Here he shows great skill in portraying the panic of futility when faced with the possible demise of his child, and the phone calls with his son's captor provide the most moving examples of these. Rene Russo does well as wife and mother, torn between her trust in her husband and her desire to see her son again. Gary Sinise is excellent as the villain, maintaining a disturbing calmness until the moment where the tables are turned on him. This versatile actor deserves more recognition in the same vain as the similar Kevin Spacey is finally getting.Never the mind the reviews, make up your own mind - what would you do...?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did they come up with that twist in the second half?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing that this movie was directed by Ron Howard gave me some good hopes about this movie. I've seen "Apollo 13" and "A Beautiful Mind" and loved both. I even appreciated "Edtv", so I was convinced that this movie would be yet another hit. But I was wrong. I'm not saying that it was a bad movie, but it wasn't a really good one either. It really left me with a double feeling, but more about that later on.First I'll tell you something more about the story. The movie is about Tom Mullen, a successful airline owner and the father of a kidnapped boy. Sean Mullen was kidnapped and taken as a hostage for a ransom of two million dollar. But when the drop goes wrong, the business man in Tom takes it over from the father. To everybody's astonishment and horror, he turns the tables on the leader of the kidnappers by turning the ransom money into a bounty for the man's head in the TV news...At first this looked like an ordinary Hollywood production about a kidnapping. Nothing special, but no TV-movie material either. But as soon as he puts that bounty on the kidnapper's head, it all went wrong in my opinion. I can't believe that there is any parent that would ever do such a thing. Jeopardising the life of your child is probably the last thing that you want to do and I'm sure that the police would never let it happen. And that's not the only problem that I had with the movie. The final of the movie didn't add much to the believability either. I'm not going to tell you the details, but it involves a lot of shooting and other action shots.Still not everything about the movie was bad. Mel Gibson's and Rene Russo's performances weren't bad, but in my opinion it was Gary Sinise who was the best actor in this movie. The role he had to play as Detective Jimmy Shaker certainly wasn't the easiest one (again I can not tell you too much about it without giving away too much information), but he did it very well.All in all this is movie that left me behind with a double feeling. It started well and the acting is OK, but the second half really blew it for me. That's why I give this movie a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. This was a phenomenal movie that truly deserves applause. The most impressive part of this movie was that the actors and actresses in this movie conveyed their emotion so well, it was almost as though one could feel it himself. Every time that Gibson would have a nervous breakdown, sympathy from the audience would result, rather than a ho-hum feeling. And when everyone hears the gunshots on the telephone, Rene Russo portrays almost exactly what any concerned mother would do and how one would act.The plot, with the father and mother torn between easy, conventional rescue, and hard, crafty tactics, totally blew away what any family would do, but in real life, it is quite plausible that something like that would happen, but only if you're expecting the unexpected.All in all, this movie ranks up in the top of my list, and it gives me more respect for Mel Gibson and Gary Sinise.</fullReview>

Kudos to Mel Gibson &amp; Gary Sinise on their performances which were Oscar calibre. The scene whereGibson &amp; Sinise argue over the phone was acting at it's finest. How they evoked those emotions without being in the same proximity was brilliant. Howard who's always had great casts for his films, strikes oil again with this one. Rene Russo is solid and great as always. Delroy Lindo plays his role perfectly. Nolte &amp; Donnie Wahlberg do good work as well. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. A perfect 10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Ron Howard could make this bad of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie like "Ransom" is so preposterous and unbelievable it could only be made by a person like Ron Howard. From Opie, to "Happy Days", to producing and directing, Ron Howard has spent his entire life in a Hollywood bubble, shielded from reality, so when he tries to make a gritty, realistic movie, it comes out like this. The only thing that raises "Ransom" from a direct-to-DVD release starring Steven Seagal is the acting (Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, Gary Sinise) and the budget. The rest is crap, not to mention it runs on for far too long.The story is a straightforward kidnapping tale and I'm sure the rest of the reviews here at IMDb have covered the basics. I'll cover the hallucinatory parts that Ron Howard thinks are real:1) Gibson plays the owner of the fourth largest airline in the US. Yet, he takes Sunday off with his wife and son to hang out at the NY City Kids Science Fair, without security or an entourage. The idea that a guy who is busy running an airline he built himself would take an entire day off to waltz around a science fair with only his wife and kid is idiotic enough, but to do so without security and assistants, etc... takes this into the realm of fantasy.2) Gibson and his family went through an excruciating three month FBI investigation where Gibson's character was investigated for bribing a union official. Gibson confesses to the lead FBI agent covering the kidnapping that he is, in fact, guilty of the bribe and that he lied to cover it up. At the end of movie Gibson should be in jail, but the career FBI officer doesn't do anything with the information except tell Gibson's wife.3) Gibson's character ignores his kid at the science fair, which enables the kidnappers to grab the kid. Gibson lied to his wife about paying the bribe and put the entire family through a hellish FBI investigation. Now, Gibson refuses to pay the ransom, and seemingly places his kid in danger when everyone else is telling him to pay it. In the real world, this would cause a lot of marital problems, and might in fact lead to a divorce since Gibson has lied to wife about some serious issues and placed their child in extreme danger. Of course, its a happy family at the end.3) Gibson's wife only has $500,000 to her name despite being married to a billionaire for 20 years.4) Gibson goes on TV and offers a two million dollar bounty on the kidnappers which he later raises to four million. Now in the real world, this reason this doesn't happen is because its against the law to offer money for someone's death. Again, the moment after he made those threats, Gibson should be in jail. In Ron Howard land, nothing happens.5) The kidnapper, who is smart enough to plan and pull off the kidnapping, is stupid enough at the end of the movie to walk into Gibson's home to collect the reward, despite knowing that Gibson's kid would recognize him since the kid has heard his voice. 'Nuff said, this movie was garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ransom is an intense and edge-of-your-seat crime thriller from to start to finish, about millionaire Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) whose son Sean (Brawley Nolte) is kidnapped. As a result, he utilizes a clever method to get his son back.This movie cuts to the chase with story elements that grab your attention right away with its fast-paced plot and intriguing acting, making you eager to find out what highs and lows Tom will go through to recover his son (just wished the filmmakers elaborated Rene Russo's mother role more). And, this film gives you a taste of drama and consequences what being a millionaire might lead to, and gives you a mind-boggling twist on the kidnapper's sinister plans.It's a kidnapper movie with a unique and solid twist - good film to watch for a weekend activity!

		<shortDescription>Ron Howard crime drama movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) is a wealthy businessman who may have some darker methods. He has a loving wife Kate (Rene Russo) and a son who gets kidnapped. The kidnappers demand $2M. Tom calls in the FBI. Something goes wrong when the FBI crashes in on the money drop. The reporters are now following the story. When the kidnappers try again for the ransom, Tom changes the game plan. Instead of giving $2M to the criminals, he goes on TV to offer the money as bounty for the kidnappers' heads.This is a Ron Howard directed movie. It is functionally made. There is something about Mel Gibson and/or his character that makes him unlikeable. I don't know if it's the union bribe that is hinted at right from the start, or the intensity that he gives off even to his son. He's like a guy with a mean streak trying desperately to show that he's just a nice guy. There is something offputting with Mel Gibson's overwrought acting in this. Same thing goes for the story. There is just something wrong with it. The FBI is hanging out at his apartment and following him in those FBI jackets. There is a lack of intensity. The story is kinda of scattered. And there are things about the kidnapping, payoff, then plan change that doesn't make sense. Maybe crime drama is just not in Ron Howard's wheelhouse.</fullReview>

One day during a conference at the park, his son goes missing.By the time he arrives home, he receives a video-taped message of his son, who has been kidnapped.He is willing to pay the ransom, but he calls the FBI in secret.When the drop goes bad, Tom tries another tactic against the criminals, using the money as a bounty on their heads...A wonderfully high concept movie, this was released when Gibson was one of the biggest stars in the world, and this has to be one of his most adult orientated movies of the nineties, as the majority of his non-directed movies focused more on his charm and wit.For the most part, it's a solid movie, with great performance from the four central characters, and Howard keeps the tension taut throughout the movie.As Hollywood blockbusters go, it's refreshing to see something as dark and as sinister as this, and some of the scenes here are very disturbing, and Sinise proves he can play one disturbing bad guy, as well as a wholesome good guy.It falters off into generic action territory come the end, but all in all, it's nice to see a movie as high profile as this, not spoon feeding the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but nothing special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ransom is not really a bad movie, but it's nothing special, either. Its plot is somewhat believable, yet quite predictable as well as full of clichés and improbable decisions. The performances are solid, although Mel Gibson does overact on a few occasions in the title role of an airline tycoon named Tom Mullen. Gary Sinise is very good as the main villain, a dirty detective named Jimmy Shaker. However, his character is revealed as the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Mullen's son very early in the movie, which completely ruins the possibility of a good plot twist.The whole kidnapping scene was quite unlikely. Tom attends a science fair with his wife Kate and their son Sean. They seem to attend the fair without any bodyguards despite the fact that Tom not only owns a successful airline, but is also investigated by the FBI for allegedly bribing a union official. He was also way too careless when he lets Sean play in the crowd right before he gets kidnapped.There's a lot of very well-known plot elements throughout the movie. When the kidnappers call the Mullens for the first time, they ask them not to involve the police. Of course, they do not follow the instructions and call the FBI, whose team soon secretly arrives at their New York penthouse. While talking to the team leader, Tom also admits that he had indeed bribed the union official. Of course, he is not arrested at the end of the movie.There is also a failed drop-off sequence, after which the kidnapping becomes public. Tom then appears on TV, turning the 2-million-dollar ransom into a bounty on the kidnapper's head. He also soon increases the amount to 4 million.After that, the movie becomes fairly predictable. Shaker kills his accomplices and "saves" Sean. The other day, Tom is out there with his wife and son. He goes back to their apartment to quickly pick up something when Shaker shows up to collect the bounty. Sean and Kate arrive soon after Tom, and Sean recognizes Shaker as the kidnappers' leader.Shaker becomes totally gullible after that. He first easily reveals his true identity and holds Tom at gunpoint. They drive to the bank to transfer the money. On the way, Shaker makes another ridiculous mistake when he forces Tom to call the airport so he can book a private flight. Of course, Tom calls the FBI, and the police are soon informed to arrest Shaker. Upon leaving the bank, Shaker kills a couple of cops and the final showdown with Tom ensues. The showdown was quite boring, and I was just waiting for the movie to end as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two things that I really didn't care for in this movie.The first is Mel's over-acting. For the entire film it appears as if he's passing a large kidney stone.The second is the ending/spoiler alert here. Sinise goes to collect his 4 million dollar check for foiling the kidnapping. Then the kid pee's himself when he hears Sinise's voice. Gary doesn't see the kid do it, but figures out that he's been had when Renee Russo suggests that Gary meet their son. Mel fumbles around and Gary KNOWS that he's not getting out of there with the money. BUT,... then he hops in the car to go to the bank to have it wired at gunpoint. This might be the most ridiculous scenario in film history.The kid(nolte) was a bad casting decision, and his character is about as under-developed and poorly acted as it gets.All that aside it's relatively harmless, fast-paced normal tough guy fare. The kind similar to Mels more recent 'Edge of Darkness' that isn't a terrible movie, but treats the viewer like a 4rth grader. At times so dumb that it publicizes its' stupidity, "if he knows what I'm worth why wouldn't he ask for more money"? Good question Mel,.. good question. 49/100Holding a billionaire's son for a ransom of 2 million split four ways is straight out of Austin Powers. That's just one of about 5 serious plot/script issues. Not recommended.</fullReview>

To anyone who hasn't seen it and might have young kids, prepare yourself for some very intense moments. Imagine being able to talk to your child's taker and maybe even killer.

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson is an airline owner whose son gets kidnapped and held for ransom. Rather than play into the kidnappers' hands, Mel's status allows him to go on national TV to advertise that the 2 million dollars ransom money has become bounty money - he offers the 2-mil as reward for any info on the kidnappers.Serpentine Gary Sinise heads the kidnapping ring, which also features Liev Schreiber, Lili Taylor and Donnie Wahlberg, all doing a vapid job of being hardened kidnappers.Crazy-eyed Delroy Lindo is the FBI agent helping Mel and his wife, Rene Russo, find their boy, while trying not to act TOO much like Laurence Fishburne.Both Mel and Rene do some fine traumatized acting - we really feel they've lost a son. But there's nothing like Mel's "tragic face" - you know that look he gets like he's one feather-push away from total nervous breakdown? I love it! Ron Howard directs this well-made thriller. First two acts are compelling, especially the twist of turning the ransom into bounty - which sets all the kidnappers against each other and twists Gary's panties no end. But the last scene ruins any impact of True Vengeance; even robs us of that satisfying feeling of Justice - and I mean True Justice, not The Law's milky version of it.It may not be politically correct to "wish" vengeance on someone, even if they're bad guys - but the Hollywood/MPAA staple that makes it imperative that bad guys should draw first and ONLY THEN be shot down by the good guys is becoming tiresome. End result is always the same - bad guy gets killed - but the methods of execution are so painfully pc transparent.In RANSOM, Gary Sinise is beaten by Mel - justifiably - then the cops show up and force Mel to drop the gun he has trained on Gary. Even though Mel has every right to shoot this scum who kidnapped his boy, The Law and our supposed Moral Compass tells us he shouldn't, tells us the criminal should be wrung through the judicial system for punishment. All moot when the downed criminal suddenly draws a hidden gun on Our Hero and Crazy-Eyed Lindo pumps the perp full of lead. Case Closed.The resolution is the same as if Mel had killed him, but now we all "feel better" about ourselves because the criminal drew on Our Hero behind his back. That kind of willowy movie rationalization is gonna get someone killed in real life.It ain't gonna be me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am positive this is a 1996-remake of a movie by the same name, starring Glenn Ford. As fine an actor as Mel Gibson is - and what big box-office he is - I'm sure his acting didn't come close to the stellar performance played by Mr. Ford.....I've seen no other macho actor portraying such a sensitive character, with palpable sorrow and defeat - but iron-willed determination not to give the ransom (500-thou) demanded by a kidnapper. This is one of the finest roles ever played by Mr. Ford. Since there is very little mention ANYWHERE about this movie, we don't know if it were awarded Oscar-nominations......as it certainly deserved. A Black actor played the butler, and - along with Mr. Ford, whose character had been put-down by all of the other actors/actresses - gives a heart-rending performance. Close to the end, the father collapses with the realization he just may have caused the death of his son. The butler gathers him in his arms to console him. At the very end of the movie (after the son is returned unharmed), he quotes from "The Prodigal Son": "He was dead, but now lives - he was lost and is found".This is a powerful film - many thanks to TCM for showing it. It truly deserves a re-release with all of the hoopla modern-day premieres receive, red carpets et al, because every role is played to the hilt - a very modern-day drama. I'm sure Mr. Gibson (I'd give him a 9) did a good acting-job in THIS version, but it cannot compare to the earlier one. This "Ransom" is a 40.............</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superbly mounted drama from the Ron Howard files....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Ron Howard hit a bullseye with RANSOM, a taut and emotionally charged drama that will have you riveted to the screen thanks to a multi-textured story and some superb performances. This intense drama stars Mel Gibson as a self-made millionaire, owner of an airline, whose questionable methods in averting a strike at his airline, have indirectly led to the kidnapping of his son. Howard has a wonderful screenplay to work with where nothing is in black and white...the characters are three-dimensional here with personal agendas and hidden motivations that don't always match what their character is doing on the surface. Gibson's self-made millionaire is presented as a flawed human being who has made mistakes and is willing to admit their part in what has happened to his son and even the kidnappers aren't a cohesive unit...there is infighting and resentments among them and you're never sure if they're going to stay together and keep their eye on the prize. The screenplay brings us to what we think is the end of the story and we are left unsatisfied...or so we think. This one will keep you on the edge of your seat right to fade-out and the performances are flawless right down the line. This is one of Gibson's best performances and Rene Russo is strong and vulnerable as his wife. Gary Sinese delivers one of the slimiest villains to ever grace the silver screen as the highly intelligent but clearly evil kidnapper and Lili Taylor, Donnie Wahlberg, Evan Handler, and Liev Schrieber are quite unsettling as his crew, whose true allegiances are not always clear. Delroy Lindo also offers one of his best performances as the police officer assigned to the case and there's a brief but effective turn by Dan Hedaya as a con Gibson thinks might be responsible. Brawley Nolte, real-life son of actor Nick Nolte, plays the victim of the kidnapping. An Americanized version of a French film, this was a triumph for director Ron Howard and everyone involved. Everything works here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a well-knit and taut thriller with some liabilities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't stop watching Ransom when I saw it recently on TV, not necessarily because it was an ultra-gripping thriller- even as it comes close to being that- but because I wanted to see what would happen in the story next. By turns the story is really only plausible in mostly 'movie-logic', but in the veneer of this being something that could actually happen. I'm not sure if ransom cases happen this way, where the father of the child changes his mind and takes away the ransom to make into a bounty on the kidnapper's head. But it makes for a pretty neat contrivance that is unfortunately surrounded by a couple of others that are pretty glaringly insipid. If there is one reason aside from the hit and miss storyline, it's the acting, with Gibson being his conflicted hero role of the father, who just wants his son back as his only need. Sinise, playing the villain, is a little less believable but does what he can in a villain role. He's really quite nuts, in fact, as he hides it with his veneer of professionalism- it's "his" show, he tells his underlings-in-crime (including Lili Taylor and Liev Schreiber)- and will stop at nothing to get HIS money from a guy, as he says, "pays up".Sometimes there are great scenes even when Sinise isn't really as good at playing this kind of role as he is playing a conflicted good guy himself (or shattered OK guy) like in Forrest Gump. One I really liked a lot was when Gibson had to drive to drop off the money the first time, and as Sinise follows him he goes on and on talking through his walkie-talkie, with a dead-pan infliction on the voice about the film the Time Machine and how it relates to him and Gibson's character. It's not the usual thing I would see in a movie like this. The scene that follows this though, when Gibson suddenly realizes what's 'really' up with these guys- that they won't pay up- due to Wahlberg's character's folly (should've remembered an address), is a little more typical with helicopters over a setting like a coal-workers area, with the music pumping hard and fast. It's interesting to see a director like Ron Howard working from one very good scene to just a standard one, but then again Howard's better with actors and characterization than he is at doing highly-charged action set-pieces (see the DaVinci Code for more details).What drives Ransom to be a better fare than it could've been, and why I kept on watching, was it had a solid cast (aside from Gibson in his determined and headstrong role where he goes through a big change, there's Russo as the upside-down mother of the kid and Delroy Lindo who might be the best of the group as the main hostage negotiator-type person behind the scenes). What we end up with is a film that isn't totally satisfying, but has many emotionally charged scenes and moments that do connect, like the aftermath with Sinise and his "partners" after the first bothced attempt to get the money. Or, more crucially, the final phone call between Gibson and Sinsise- the "GIVE ME BACK MY SON" scene- that does really stretch the bounds to get manipulative with the audience. So, the problem then? Logistics really (and this is why I have a spoiler warning up): why would Sinise go back to Gibson's HOUSE, as opposed to somewhere else like his office? Wouldn't he think his son- whom he got back to him via killing off his underlings and calling it in- would be there and might recognize his voice at least? It's a really iffy bit that sets up the ultra-violent climax that I irked me.That being said, it's worth checking out Ransom to see, at least two-thirds of the time, how to do a professional type of thriller where psychology is meant to take as much precedence as the suspense. We get a good shot of that, if maybe a little too slick for it's own good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Calling a Bluff: A Timely Look at Citizen/Police Interaction in Kidnapping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RANSOM is yet another Hollywood extravaganza movie about the terrors of the crime of kidnapping - with a twist. Ron Howard directs this, for the most part, gripping story with propulsion and the ability to gain nuanced performances from a disparate cast. The result is a tightly wound spring that coils tensely until the last fifteen minutes when the film explodes.Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) is a wealthy man with a strong willed wife Kate (Rene Russo) and a son Sean (Brawley Nolte - yes, in life the son of actor Nick Nolte). When Sean is kidnapped by a Detective (!) Jimmy Shaker (Gary Sinise) and ransom is demanded, Tom goes before national TV audiences and doubles the ransom demand for a bounty on Shaker's life. How this turn of events of a kidnapper becoming the victim and the resolution of the kidnapping that results is the gist of the story: it is the struggle of good vs evil, citizen vs police, and calling the bluff of a dangerous man for the sake of a father saving his child.Gibson does well as the torn father, though director Howard allows him to go a bit over the edge, acting wise. The real shiner of this film is Gary Sinise who continues to impress with the facility with which he moves through varied character parts. There are moments of fine expressive silences from co-stars Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber, Evan Handler, Delroy Lindo, and Donnie Wahlberg that enhance the tension because of the underplaying of their roles: Gibson could take some pointers... A good cat and mouse tale that has at its core the heinous crime of kidnapping, police corruption, and family devotion, this film is worth a view.Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to the 1956 RANSOM with Glenn Ford, this version is not necessarily better or worse, but it is different. This 40 years later remake gives us a close up look at the people who never appear in the earlier film. This makes for a good deal more action, but it lacks the clear cut issue of the original. Personally, I like the more psychological approach Glenn Ford's film used, but the added blood and gore of this one is not offensive. I think we live in a bloodier age now than we did in 1956 As for the cast and production values, what we have here is first rate. Some may be offended, but I doubt anyone will be bored. Mel Gibson may tend to go overboard at times in his roles and productions, but this isn't one of those times.</fullReview>

Don't take it the wrong way I loved this movie staring Mel Gibson, Gary Sinse, Rene Russo, Delrory Lindo, Donnie Walberg, and Liev Scriebier. Mel Gibson is Tom Mullen, whose life is suddenly shattered when his son is abducted and held for randsom by a gang of criminals! Then Mullen takes matters into his own hands... turning the tables on the kidnappers in a last-effort to rescue his boy fom the criminals! Randsom also includes a great ensemble cast from director Ron Howard(A Beautiful Mind) including Mel Gibson(Braveheart), Rene Russo(Lethal Weapon 4), Gary Sinse(Apollo 13), Delrory Lindo(The One), Donnie Walberg(Dreamcatcher), and Liev Scriebier(Scream 2) make a great action packed film with surprising twists that will keep you guessing and guessing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The critically acclaimed box office hit Ransom, in my opinion, was a very good movie. There was a ton of intensity levels, lots of action, and quality acting. I was suprised, however, that Mel Gibson did not recieve an Oscar for his powerful performance. It was his best performance since Lethal Weapon. Airline tycoon Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) has only one thing on his mind latley. And that is his family which is his son Sean (Brawley Nolte) and his attractive wife Kate (Rene Russo). While spending a day in Central Park celebrating a science fair that Sean is involved in, Tom apparently turns the corner for one second, and comes back to discover that he can't find Sean anywhere. Hours later, Tom recieves a call from an anonymous person who apprently e-mails a graphic tape to Tom of Sean being gruesomely tortured. Tom now discovers that Sean has been kidnapped by a group of brutal killers who are: Clark (Liev Schreiber), Cubby (Donnie Whalberg), Miles (Evan Handler), Maris (Lili Taylor), and the leader of them all.... police detective Jimmy Shaker (Gary Sinise). Tom and Kate are told by the kidnappers to not involve the police or the F.B.I. or else Sean will die. They are also ordered to have $4 million ready to hand over in 48 hours. Secretly, Tom and Kate turn to an authority figure (Delroy Lindo) and his crew. Tom trys everything he can to cooperate with the kidnappers which doesn't work. Instead, Tom back fires on them and offers the $4 million to anyone who catches the kidnappers. I must also say that Ron Howard did a beautiful job directing this movie considering he only does certain films. This is for sure one of his best pieces of work. Ransom is a must-see thriller!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GIMME BACK MY SON!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ransom is truly one of the best thrillers i've ever seen. Mel Gibson's acting is too genuine it seems like he isn't acting, especially when he totally loses it and screams bloody murder at the kidnapper, and when he cries when he thinks his son is dead. Gary Sinise is cool too, and like Gibson, he portrays the corrupt, yet sly and deadly detective very well(he also does this really cool palm strike to a guy's throat).Ransom's plot is also quite unique. Kidnappers kidnap a rich man's son and hold him ransom for 2 million dollars. Of course, for a rich guy, Mullen(gibson's character) can easily pay the 2 mil, but realizes that if he were the kidnapper he'd kill the son upon receiving the money. He tries to make the drop on his own, but can't get the FBI and the Press off his back. At the same time, he questions the kidnapper:"why me?" and the reason why him is not only because he's rich; the reason tells us a lot of things about the price of having the good life, and also tells us that even the most calm and kindest person can't hold the beast within. Mullen goes from being a high class, civilized millionaire to a bloodthirsty madman as he gets more desperate to rescue his son. My only complaint is that the kidnap leader's identity should have been revealed much later in the movie.Overall, Ransom is a good thriller, one that i would recommend to anyone. Great acting, a simple-to-follow, yet unique plot, combine to form one of Gibson's finest. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That lines sums up Ransom not because it's a great movie but because once youve seen it once and enjoyed it, chances are when you watch it again you wont like it. I liked Ransom when it first came out and I bought Gibson and Russo's emotions as the worried parents but this movie could have been told in 70 minutes. Billy Corgan's techno score brings life into the film. It's just too talky, ok Mel Gibson you want your son back and are willing to pay anyhing...ok give the man his kid back so this movie can end. A few memorable scenes are scattered along and there are signs of charisma in the actors but once youre finished watching this you dontknow what to think. I would recommend it just for a decent thriller. Sinise does good support work as a corrupt cop. I think Ranson tries to be more of an epic than it really is. I want to give this movie a *** because it doesnt entirely suck but I think if I popped this in the VCR right now, I'd turn it off. Once is all you need. **1/2</fullReview>

It is a completely different movie, but equally great in its own way and an ideal next movie for Howard after his 1995 movie. The acting and script are absolutely top-notch, the movie keeps you on the edge right to the end. What makes this movie special are the unexpected twists it takes, but it never gets ridiculous or implausible. After all those shallow summer action spectacles, it was refreshing for me to see this intelligent action picture on TV. I thought it was going another movie with top-drawer actors and a Z-grade script. How wrong I was. This movie has a fantastic script and the direction is excellent.

		<fullReview>"Ransom" is a gripping film about a rich businessman (Mel Gibson) who decides to take matters into his own hands after his young son is kidnapped. Fed up with the authorities and the kidnappers, he decides to put a ransom on the heads of the criminals. It turns out that cop Gary Sinise is the kidnapper. This is the biggest problem in "Ransom". Sinise's involvement is revealed almost immediately. There is nothing to reason out or think about. Instead of the film being a psychological thriller, it turns into a "Deathwish" kind of film. The screenplay is not very good. Ron Howard's direction saves the project. The same is true for Mel Gibson and Gary Sinise. They both do great work and overall the entire cast is adequate. However, numerous shortcomings keep "Ransom" from being as good as it should have been. 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ransom comes very close to being a great thriller. Its main failure is that it is unwilling to explore the dark side of Mel Gibson's tycoon after offering up fascinating ideas. He is no saint, he has bribed people and in one terrific scene he meets with a mobster (Dan Hedaya) whom he thinks has engineered the kidnapping as a revenge scheme. The mobster, who has 6 kids himself, is outraged and with good reason. The movie has many good things in it. Gary Sinise is exceptional as the villain so deeply embittered he seems to believe his actions are justified (though I wouldn't have minded if the filmmakers added a touch more humanity to the character). The best scene in the movie is an explosive phone confrontation between Sinise and Gibson where the two men threaten one another and neither can quite believe that the other will not back down. Overall, a near miss. the failure to explore Gibson's dark side is jarring, since any man willing to treat his son's life as a business deal obviously has some serious control issues (at times, Gibson seems so demented you want to reach out and shake him).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film flows fairly well from the get go as shaker and his gang steal the kid and assume the driving seat, telling tom mullen (gibsons character) in an email that they've got his son and then deliver a list of instructions of how they want a drop off of $2 million dollars and no cops involved. So Tom mullen against the gangs wishes calls the fbi as he is familiar with their methods from working with him on another problem. So all the characters are introduced quite well on either side of the ransom and it quickly becomes a case off will the crims kill the boy or hand him back once they get their money. When the 1st drop off is made and goes awry the character cubby is enevitably killed off. Now, i think this was a mistake because not only does he offer a different kind of character, a more compassionate human being out of all the kidnappers but when mels character tom decides to offer a bounty on the ransomers he(cubby)could of taken up that offer perhaps and may have tried to give jimmy shaker up on behalf of the kid and the mullen family; perhaps to could have almost succeeded and then shaker might have foiled him and gotten the kid back. Also cubby was a likable character and made the dynamics of the gang seem a bit more complex as cubby had a brother and who knows what side he might have taken had cubby tried to save the kid. The bald guy in the gang is almost pointless apart from i gather being a technology expert, screwing up the cops satellite signals and so on.Basically there was one or two ingredient's lacking in order to keep the suspense going, it got a little bit mundane until shaker turns on his fellow accomplices, i thought that was a good touch. After shaker poses as the cop that busted the gang and saved the day (shaker's day job is a cop) so he could get the money for himself there isn't much left to play out and the ending was a fairly wounded down affair.Disappointing as the premise was good, much of the characters were good especially shaker and cubby - Gibson was entertaining as always. But the main problem was the way that the tension dissipated very much half way through. The movie was spiked with some good moments later on but overall it had a very on and off feel to the tension - no tangible climax no flow</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect thriller!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I must admit, having seen this film many many MANY times it's lost it's certain charm that it had the very first time I saw it. Having seen it recently though I am still blown away by what a first class, drop dead amazing thriller/drama that Ransom is. To say that emotions run high don't even begin to explain this charged film. This is one of Ron Howards greatest achievements as far as I'm concerned and Mel Gibson's best work hands down (and I am an enormous fan of his.) Ransom is just pure genius beginning to end. It establishes such an amazing character arc and not only the main characters of Gibson and Rene Russo who are the parents of the kidnapped boy but the kidnappers themselves. We get such a great introduction to all of them that you can't help but get drawn into each and every characters story.The kidnappers are played by Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber, Donnie Wahlberg, and Evan Handler. Saving the best for last is their ringleader played by amazingly evil Gary Sinise. He's got to be one of the best bad guys in film history in this movie. He's cold, calculating, ruthless and against Gibson they have an amazing chemistry and a rivalry that builds to an incredible climax. Lili Taylor as the only female kidnapper also does a great job and she is also quite ruthless as well. Liev Schrieber is almost unrecognizable compared to his usual roles as the smarter Barnes brother trying to hold everything together. Donnie Wahlberg is amazing as the sympathetic, emotional younger brother kidnapper. Evan Handler rounds out the bad guy list as the tech guy Miles. They all have a hand in the kidnapping and all add to the plot and the characters. Mel Gibson's Golden Globe nominated performance as Tom Mullen is just remarkable. He's strong, tough, rich, well educated and we watch him fall to pieces at the prospect of losing his beloved son. We also see the sub story unfold about him paying off a mobster (Dan Hedaya in a brief but well done role) to save his self made Airline. The relationship between him and his wife (Rene Russo) is powerful and their tension during the kidnapping is so deep and emotional. We see both sides very explicitly from the kidnappers to the parents. Delroy Lindo plays the FBI specialist trying to help Tom get his son back.When Tom finally decides he's had enough and turns the tables on the kidnappers the intensity sky rockets and you're on the edge of your seat. This film brought me to tears more than once and maybe I do love it more than most but I have not seen anything that comes close to the performances delivered in this movie. If you don't feel an emotional pull when Gibson collapses on his balcony in tears because he thinks he's caused his son's death...well I don't know what's wrong with ya. A brilliant, unmatched story, brilliant actors, and powerful performances make this a must have thriller. I think it will be a classic, certainly always to me and if you haven't you're in for the ride of your life!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rene Russo Was Overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a pretty good film! However, most of the credit went to Mel Gibson, Gary Sinise, and Ron howard's direction. I think this was Rene Russo's breakthrough performance as a damm good actress. She has proven herself good at light comedy, and at playing supportive wives and girlfriends. She has always been a capable actress, but untill now, never one that I would consider Oscar worhty. But this performance should not have gone unnoticed. (SEMI-SPOILER) There is a scene in this movie in which she overhears what she thinks is her son being killed. She then kicks the s*** out of her husband for not paying the ransom, and then goes into such a breakdown, that she vomits in the sink, and can't even talk straight. Also, throughout the movie, her face and movements, resemble someone who has not gotten enough food and sleep in the last couple of days. This performance, along with her performance in Rocky and Bullwinkle, prove to me that she is a talented versatile actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a lot of good ingredients. Taut management of the mood by director Ron Howard, outstanding performances from Gibson and Sinese, and a couple of good plot twists in the poker game between an abductor and the victim's parents.Unfortunately, the script bogs down in a lot of ways. A lot of that... oh, yeah, we need one of the gang members to be a computer genius, but we don't want to take the time to develop his character. (Perhaps his name should have been Deus X. Machina). There are several threads that go nowhere. It just isn't a tight script.But grab your handrail and go along for the ride, because it isn't bad. It moves fast, provides some instant gratification, shows some vulnerable chinks in the armor of the good guys, and some compassion, education, and honor among the bad guys. And it has a couple of very amusing side-trips. (I loved the concept of the scene where the abductor and Gibson go to the bank together and are recognized by people who don't understand their relationship ... although again this wasn't developed as it might have been.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Expensive, highly-charged rethinking of a modest 1956 Glenn Ford drama about a well-to-do couple working with the F.B.I. after their little boy is kidnapped for a ransom of two million dollars. Despite all the glossy new ingredients (or, rather, in spite of them), it's a familiar if gut-wrenching melodrama mostly seen from the parents' side, and director Ron Howard gets solid performances from Mel Gibson and Rene Russo. The same cannot be said of the villains of the piece; changing music cues (laughably) to heavy metal whenever he cuts to the kidnappers in their grungy hideout, Howard cannot get a convincing rhythm going with these greedy lowlifes (they're stock figures out of a million hoary fictions). The Feds don't come off especially well here either, although Delroy Lindo's tightly-wound agent is a worthy component. Gary Sinise does some interesting things with his crooked-cop routine (which is a cliché, but let it pass), however the child in question is treated poorly by the filmmakers--who exploit his suffering--and the bloody-showdown finale is a complete muck-up. Howard tries out a few time-wasting tricks with the camera, such as playing with the color-knob or slowing down the action, but it just makes his movie look cheesy. The '56 version kept things compact, while Howard's version goes for the slam-bangs. It works momentarily, but not for the long haul. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What bothered me most about this film was the fact that it takes a full hour, half the movie(which is about half an hour too long) to get through what is described of it in the plot outline. To put it another way; what should be a twist in the film, what should have been kept a big secret is casually mentioned. The first part of the film leads up to that moment, and we already know what is going to be revealed. Think of it as watching a contest knowing who the winner is beforehand. Then there's how obvious and by-the-numbers the film is. Face it, it was really predictable. No great twists here. At one point, something out of the ordinary happened, and I hoped it was going to keep it up... a minute later, everything was back to normal. This wouldn't really be that much of a pain if it wasn't for how freakishly slow and dull the better part of the film is, and if this was the first of its kind... but it was, and it isn't. The plot is decent enough, but way too much of it is revealed in any summary you read or hear. The pacing is horrid. The acting is quite impressive, for the most part. The characters are somewhat well-written and adequately cast. The violence is quite graphic and brutal. All in all, this is just another run-of-the-mill kidnapping-flick, one that tries to pass itself off as something better but ultimately fails. I recommend this only to big fans of Mel Gibson and/or any other actor on the cast, and possibly big fans of this type of thriller. No one else should bother. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson could hardly resist doing this picture since it not only amounts to a vehicle for him, but is exactly the kind of slightly off-beat but heroic part that he likes (cf., Conspiracy Theory 1997). He does a good job although his tendency to overact is not under consistent directorial control. But Ron Howard directing Mel Gibson is a bit like Spike Lee directing Danny DeVito. (Huh?) Or how about Oprah Winfrey directing Whoopie Goldberg? Or, John Wayne directing Clint Eastwood?Gary Sinise as Jimmy Shaker, a cop gone not just bad, but sleazy psycho bad, also does a good job although just why he is such a sickie and why nobody noticed before is not developed or even explained. Rene Russo does her best (alas) as the suffering wife and mother condemned to a dreary role of one dimension. I was thinking, how about some creative casting? Instead of Lili Taylor as the bad girl, how about having her play Gibson's trophy wife and make Russo the girl gone bad? Taylor is talented enough to pull it off with panache and Russo would be an arresting sight among the degenerates.Ron Howard clearly worked hard to hi-tech the old ransom plot with cell phones and cell phone tracers, infrared goggles, voice-distorters, helicopters and electronic homing devices. He provides plenty of shoot 'em up and gives the tale a twist with Gibson challenging the kidnappers. He also affords us a lot of satisfying revenge stuff at the end.I do have a couple of questions though. Was his portrait of the FBI inspired by the real life FBI's fine work at Ruby Ridge and Waco? I mean at no time in this movie did the FBI do anything positive. I'm not crazy about today's FBI anymore than anyone else, but was this a fair and realistic take on how they might handle such a case? Also what was police detective Jimmy Shaker's motivation for the kidnapping in the first place? After x number of years on the force he suddenly gets a yen for a lot of money and balmy climes? Finally why doesn't he just take his cleverly and murderously earned reward a couple of days down the road instead of showing up prematurely at the Mullen place and giving himself away?Bottom line: this picks up after a slow beginning, and there's some clever business along the way, but don't examine it too closely.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>Ron Howard is not a good director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had ONE good idea, which was revealed, with much fanfare, about halfway through. Unfortunately it was also revealed in the trailers. Even a ten-second TV ad, which had no time to tell us anything else, told us the one thing that ought to have been kept secret. It must be said that this wasn't the movie's fault; but if knowing the central conceit in advance makes it pointless to actually watch the movie, that IS the movie's fault. I knew what the surprise in 'Psycho' was going to be before viewing it. Did this ruin the experience? Certainly not entirely: it may have been preferable to watch it in complete ignorance, but there's more to 'Psycho' than just one idea.Anyway: 'Ransom' is about a rich man with a slightly shady past (Mel Gibson) whose child is kidnapped; and thereafter, the one good idea aside, it's all confused, portentous stodge. I must say that the shady past sub-plot had potential, and to be honest I cared more about what Mel Gibson had done and whether he would get into trouble for it than I cared about the kid, who just got in the way. But there were several subsidiary plot elements and they were ALL ill-served. The film is one big barrel of red herrings, each one distracting us from the scent of the others - and they all have much the same over-salted taste, anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson seems a likable sort of guy, his recent tsuris notwithstanding. It would be great to have a beer with him and have him try to explain his current predicament. As an actor, however, I find him rather bland. I keep seeing Mel Gibson instead of the character. He does a better job than usual here. He's surprisingly good at projecting fear of physical harm, almost as good as he is at wisecracking.The supporting cast is fine too. Gary Sinese is a rogue cop who has kidnapped Gibson's and Renee Russo's young boy, ask for two million dollars in ransom, and plan to off the kid anyway because he's a witness. Lili Taylor is good as Sinese's rapacious girl friend who (for reasons I don't quite understand) turns on him at the end and is shot full of holes for her effort. The script gives us a Sinese who is completely cold blooded except for his love for Taylor, so his having to shoot her is an act that leaves him basically empty of everything but bitterness. Nothing goes the way he planned. And at every frustration, every new glitch, he blasphemes and kicks furniture. We all know how he feels. There is also DelRoy Lindo with the biggest chin in the business.We feel sorry for the doomed kidnapped kid, of course, but the drama surrounding the nest of kidnappers on the one hand (which include Liev Schreiber) and Gibson, the millionaire airline owner on the other hand, swamps any real emotional involvement with the kid's plight. On a chess board he'd be a lowly pawn.And that brings up the part of the movie that has me wondering about what, exactly, it is trying to say.Sinese is holding the kid and asking for two million. Gibson, who can easily afford twice that amount, tries to cooperate. The first attempt at a drop is botched. Half-way through the second, it occurs to Gibson, in the absence of any evidence, that they're going to kill his son no matter what he does. Pay or not pay -- it makes no difference.So instead of being the compliant victim, he turns into an open antagonist. Gibson goes on TV and announces that, yes, he has the two million. Here it is, right on the desk, in unmarked bills. But the kidnappers will never see a cent of it because he will never pay them, convinced as he is that his son is dead meat anyway. So instead of a ransom, Gibson designates the money as a reward for whoever drops the dime on the kidnappers. "Do you know anyone who would NOT turn you in for two million dollars?", he asks. (I'd turn my mother in for that much. I'd turn my ex in for nothing.) Later, Gibson ups the reward to four million.The movie lost me at about this point because I couldn't grasp precisely what Gibson's motives were. The police, the FBI, TV journalists, and his wife all beg him to pay the ransom. (It's half Russo's kid too, isn't it? Yet he doesn't discuss his decision with her.) And though of course there is always a risk that the kid will be offed anyway -- think Lindbergh -- there's at least an equal chance that the kidnappers will return the kid and avoid murder charges.Instead of betting the percentages, Gibson turns into a kind of John Wayne figure. It's a duel of wills between him and Sinese. I kept waiting for Gibson to come up with some John Wayne-ism like, "Talkin' words is fer wimmin." What the hell is he playing at? His kid's life is at stake. His unshakable belief that they intend to kill his son anyway is not rooted in facts but only serves as an excuse for Gibson to out-tough Sinese.A scene near the inevitable final shoot-out is very well handled. Sinese, whose identity as one of the criminals has not been uncovered, shows up to collect the four million dollar reward from Gibson. Gibson gradually becomes aware of Sinese's involvement, and Sinese gradually becomes aware of Gibson's awareness. Sinese tosses the four-million-dollar check in the air and it glides to the floor in a neat shot.The violent climax was a bit anti-climactic. Gibson winds up in the middle of a New York City street pounding the disabled Sinese to a bloody pulp while the audience is supposed to be cheering and the traffic whizzes unflappably by. And guess who gets to shoot Sinese in the last scene? It's all supposed to be cathartic, I suppose. The writers and director must have thought the audience is slavering at the prospect of finally seeing Gibson loose his rage on Sinese, but it's disappointing all the same. What has so far been a contest of wills and intelligence has become a routine blood bath.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ransom is a good thriller. The plot really kept me interested, thanks to some surprisingly twists, good dialogue and very good acting. Although Ron Howard didn't spent much time giving the villains a background, he succeeded in making them believable, human characters. There are several scenes with lots of tension in it, you really don't need big shoot outs, explosions etcetera to make an exciting movie. The actors and actresses all turned in fine performances, especially Mel Gibson. Although I liked the movie, it isn't flawless. The subplot concerning the bribe suddenly disappeared. I think real kidnappers would have reacted differently on Tom Mullen's unexpected action. And the final scenes weren't as convincing as the rest of the movie. Despite these flaws, I really liked this movie. My vote: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ransom" is about a rich man with a slightly shady past (Mel Gibson) whose child is kidnapped. Instead of paying the 2 million dollar ransom (which he first intends), Mel Gibson's character decides to put a 2 million dollar (later raises that to 4 million) bounty reward on the kidnappers' heads."Ransom" is an average movie, some suspenseful scenes but overall too predictable. Giving away that this movie will have a happy ending is not even a spoiler. One knows from the start. Not for a second can this movie make you believe that the boy will die.But for a second I thought (hoped) that the corrupt cop who kidnapped the boy but then decided to collect the bounty reward by killing his accomplices and "freeing" the boy would get away with the money. I would like this ending way better: Mel Gibson's character gives the corrupt cop the reward. The FBI finds out that the cop was involved in the kidnapping but since he left the country he gets away with the 4 million dollars.This movie is also not very realistic as some actions are not credible: The FBI shooting one of the kidnappers in the ransom pickup is unrealistic in that situation and would be a huge threat to the life of the boy as is Mel Gibson's refuse to pay the two million, not to mention the threat the bounty reward poses to his son.Mel Gibson's character's wife thinks that the actions of his husband are wrong and there is tension between them as she tries to somehow get 2 million (she does not) and pay the ransom without telling her husband. A second sub-plot deals with Mel Gibson's illegal business stuff about which the FBI knows. Both sub-plot are fine but not done as good as they could have been.In the ending scene, Ron Howard uses slow-motion in an "action" sequence. It looks really ridiculous. I hate this ending. Gibson could have at least shot the villain but no. As the cops want to arrest Gibson because he carries a gun that he pointed at the villain (whom the police shoots as he reaches for a gun), one of the FBI agents jumps in between and saves him from being arrested. It made me laugh...don't think that was intended. At the end the family is united and wife and husband seem to have forgiven one another after the kidnapping had almost tore apart their relationship.The directing is rather poor and the script is bad because the basic story line could have worked (with a different ending). Mel Gibson's performance was weak. He fails to make his character and thus the whole movie believable.I cannot recommend this movie. It has a some good parts but, overall, it is predictable and unbelievable. Plus it has a stupid ending (think I already mentioned that) ** 5.0/10 **</fullReview>

I would've been a little happier had Sinise's character not been revealed as the kidnapper so early on in the movie. One must also ponder the horror of violent crimes involving the terrorizing of young children; crime can be exciting, but at what point does the horror of a situation that occurs all too often in real life overcome the drama and make a movie not worth seeing? I could have done without a close-up shot of the boy peeing all over himself and the floor as he recognizes the voice of Gary Sinise's character, this being what reveals the kidnapper's identity to Gibson. I'd have to say that the movie is mediocre at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers...How many times was ransom used in movies? Through the years, it has become a cliché of detective movies and here, at first sight, to design a movie with this subject leads us to predict something unoriginal. Sadly, this affirmation is true when you arrive at the end of "Ransom".I watched it for the first time when it was launched in French theaters in January 1997 and I really loved it. I watched it recently and this time I was absolutely disappointed. For me, Ron Howard has made an unremarkable detective movie that suffers above all from a threadbare topic. In spite of the scriptwriters and the actors' efforts to give scope and interest to the story (Mel Gibson who decides to use the ransom as a reward to trap the gangsters), I'm obliged to recognize that this movie, in the long run turns without gripping and it's based on conventional characters and situations. Of course, there are successful sequences but the whole inevitably leads to the happy end. Moreover, the movie doesn't exclude a few incoherences: how can Gary Sinise be both the boss of the gangsters and a cop?Nonetheless, I noted a good idea in the script: Gary Sinise's allusion to the Morlocks and the Elois, H.G.Wells' characters in "the time machine" to epitomize the world in which they live.</fullReview>

First, tests and surveys report that they like the look on Mel's face when he gets angry, then with determination grinds out revenge. This makes money, it has been proven over and over. Patriot and Braveheart are one formula which follows a battle thread, which exploits our desire to be led. Here, they dust off a thriller formula that is cheaper to make and exploits our desire to be passionate parents. Howard is called in as a formula-delivering workman.Some plot devices grind out scenes where he can show that glinty determination. Eventually, he viciously bests the beast after the precisely determined number of minutes (a constant regardless of the formula).The only interesting thing about this is the wonder of why we like it so much. Is there that much in a single face? Do we make it important, or does it create its own meme?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen the trailer for this film a number of times, it did look like my sort of thrilling film, and when I finally got to watch the entire film I was hoping it would be something good, directed by Ron Howard (Splash, Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind). Basically Tom Mullen (Golden Globe nominated Mel Gibson) was formerly a fighter pilot, he is now a successful airline owner and multi-millionaire, married to wife Kate (Rene Russo), and father to nine-year-old son Sean (Brawley Nolte, Nick's son). While attending a science fair Sean is kidnapped, Tom and Kate are shocked to receive an email from the kidnappers, they are demanding a $2,000,000 ransom, if they do not pay he will be killed, Tom and Kate call the FBI, led by Agent Lonnie Hawkins (Delroy Lindo), to assist and operate in their New York City apartment. Sean is being held in the apartment of one of Tom's caterers, Maris Conner (Lili Taylor), along with criminals Clark Barnes (Liev Schreiber), Cubby Barnes (Saw II's Donnie Wahlberg) and Miles Roberts (Evan Handler), and the mastermind of the kidnapping is Detective Jimmy Shaker (Gary Sinise) of the NYPD. The FBI advise Tom to pay the ransom, he and Kate agree to do so, Tom follows the instructions of Shaker, his voice electronically disguised, Tom is told to meet at a New Jersey quarry to exchange the money for an address, but Cubby meeting him is ignorant to this, and is killed by the FBI following. Tom is contacted again for another ransom dropped, he demands to go completely alone, but he realises the first drop was a setup, there is no guarantee he will get Sean back, so he tells the kidnapper to watch the television. Tom appears in a live news broadcast to announce that a $2,000,000 ransom will not be paid, instead the money will be a reward to whoever turns in the kidnapper, dead or alive, this bounty will be dropped if Sean is returned alive. Kate and Hawkins make individual pleas to have him change his mind, but he refuses, Kate is later called by the kidnappers for a meeting, she is threatened to pay the ransom or Sean will die, finding this out only urges Tom to increase the bounty to $4,0000,000. Shaker makes a call for what appears to be a final chance for the Mullens to pay the ransom, the argument on the phone increases to the point where Sean is heard over the phone, followed by a gunshot, Tom and Kate are distraught thinking that their son is dead. Shaker forms a new plan to act as the cop he is, killing the kidnappers, including Maris, and following a call to other authorities pretending to rescue Sean, he is injured and found with the boy by the SWAT team charging in, Hawkins takes Tom and Kate to the scene and are finally reunited with Sean, Tom shakes Shaker's hand in gratitude. Shaker appears at the Mullens apartment to claim his reward, as Tom writes the cheque Sean passes and is shocked to recognise Shaker's voice, and Tom realises who he is, Shaker then turns a gun on him and threatens to kill everyone, but Tom convinces him to take him hostage and go to the bank to wire the $4,000,000 to his account. While driving Tom makes a call pretending to be to his pilot for a private jet, in fact he calls Hawkins and covertly tells him he is with the kidnapper, police eventually show up at the bank and Shaker is forced to shoot and attempt to escape, he and Tom get into a brutal fight, in the end Tom kills Shaker before he can draw another gun, Hawkins stops the police from arresting Tom, and Kate turns up to support her husband. Also starring Nancy Ticotin as Agent Kimba Welch, Michael Gaston as Agent Jack Sickler, Kevin Neil McCready as Agent Paul Rhodes, Paul Guilfoyle as Wallace and Dan Hedaya as Jackie Brown. Gibson gives a compelling performance as the maverick tycoon who takes the law into his own hands and will do almost anything for the return of his son, Russo is wasted as the concerned wife, Lindo is a good choice as the leading cop trying to help him, and Sinise is a great choice as the twisted cop turned sinister villain kidnapper. I agree with critics this film is perhaps overplayed in moments, whether it be with the acting in emotional or action scenes, but you cannot deny it is a gripping urban combat drama, and it is a believable situation, it is a worthwhile crime thriller. Mel Gibson was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping and Tense Thriller With An Amazing Performance From Mel Gibson!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a gripping and tense thriller with an amazing performance from Mel Gibson!. It's got quite a few awesome plot twists, and the characters were all fantastic, plus, the film grip's your from the very beginning!. It actually gave me the creeps sometimes, because, it was a very scary situation, and of course Mel Gibson being the brilliant actor he is, made it all seam so real, plus,Gar Sinise is extremely menacing as the main villain!. It took me a little while to warm up to the main characters, however, i could see where they were coming from, and very soon, i found myself rooting for Gibson and Russo all the way!, it also helped that they were so likable. The dialog is excellent, and as i said, it really grips you from the beginning till the end, plus the ending was perfect!. This is a gripping and tense thriller, and i highly recommend it!. The Direction is great!. Ron Howard, does a great job here, with great camera work, good angles, and keeping the film tense and gripping throughout!. There is a bit of blood. We get some extremely bloody gunshot wounds, and a slit throat. The Acting is Brilliant. Mel Gibson is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here,he is extremely likable, tense, and near the end, he was just full of intensity and i loved it, he was amazing in this!, and also had brilliant chemistry with Rene Russo once again! (Gibson Rules!).Rene Russo is beautiful, and is fantastic here, she is extremely likable, fantastic in the acting department, was awesome in her emotion scenes, and had brilliant chemistry with Gibson once again!. Brawley Nolte is good as the kid, and was actually rather likable, even if he didn't have much dialog. Gary Sinise is excellent as the main villain, he was extremely menacing, clever and was fun to watch!. Delroy Lindo, is very effective here, he is a great character actor!. Lili Taylor is hot and did what she had to do well. Liev Schreiber bored me here, not a fan at all. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall i highly recommend this gripping and tense thriller!. ***1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ransom is one of those few thriller's that actually works. Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) is a multi-millionaire with a loving family. Everything seems perfect in his life until his son is kidnapped. Tom is ordered by a anonymous kidnapper (Gary Sinise) to pay 2 million dollars to get him back. Tom cooperates with the police at first until the transaction is interrupted by FBI agents and the pick up man is killed. Now, Tom knows that if he pays the money, his son will be killed and must outsmart the kidnappers and get his son back.Mel Gibson does an excellent acting job, bringing both emotion and thought to his character. Rene Russo (Kate Mullen) is a bit wasted but still does what she can. . The plot is pretty good, a few holes here and there but all in all strong. Gary Sinise shows how versatile he truly is. He is cynical and disturbing as the lead kidnapper and will keep you guessing what he may do next. To me, he is one of the scarriest villains in a thriller I've seen. The plot is quite strong in my opinion and will keep u guessing until the very end.A few plot twists and a dark story line keeps it going and makes it a worth see.Ransom. Starring: Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, Gary Sinise, Delroy Lindo, and Lili Taylor. 4 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Psycho-Thriller About Kidnapping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After three times I watched RANSOM it still works as a gripping thriller. The characters have been studied deeply and especially the role for Gary Sinise could have been written above all for him. Mel Gibson delivered a strong performance and should have won the Oscar. The director created a masterpiece of psycho-thriller. Therefore I cannot share at all the decision of the boys' father concerning the ransom. It's not realistic because I would do every thing for my little son to get him back. This is only possible in Hollywood movies but don't misunderstand me: fasten your seat belt and simply enjoy it. Rating: a solid 7/10.If you liked this I highly recommend PANIC ROOM or TRAPPED.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is unlike any other movies I've ever seen. It doesn't just depict the struggles of the parents of the kidnapped child, but mostly depicts the struggles of the kidnappers themselves. I really enjoyed that aspect of the film. Every single character in this film did an extraordinary job, and I think this movie should've gotten more credit than it has. The film just seemed so real to me that I was totally absorbed into every little scene. This is Mel Gibson's and Gary Sinise's best film (acting wise) they've ever done. They were good enemies. A good film on every level.don't's vote: 7 out of 10</fullReview>

Have you ever followed a story or a plot and actually used your brain to 'think' along the way or connect events?Good lord, but this is a lazy script and insulting to the audience in so many ways. My favorite idiocy is at the very end, when apparently copies of the script are laying around in the police dispatch office so they can figure out who the bad guy is at exactly the last minute, and send word out to the patrol officers, who just happen to see the bad guy go into a bank! Perfect. Watching this free on Netflix instant download is about the right price for this silly movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ask me, RANSOM is an excellent film that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat and blow you away. Shaker (Gary Sinise) kind of gave me the creeps. You'll understand why once seen this movie. I got really scared when Sean (Brawley Nolte) was kidnapped. To me, Tom (Mel Gibson) was a very tough guy when he had to do as instructed. In my opinion, the performances were top grade, the direction was superior, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the cast was perfectly chosen. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too. Before I wrap this up, I must warn you that this movie is very violent if you're going to see it, so viewer discretion is strongly advised. Now, in conclusion, if you like Ron Howard films, I highly recommend this movie. It's sure to keep you guessing from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice intense thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat. Mel Gibson and Gary Sinise are incredible actors. That is what really struck me about the movie. The story is a little unoriginal, but for it's time it was very exciting. I've seen quite a few "Ransom" type of films. So that's why in some ways I knew what might happen next. The action is great though. The acting is very wonderful. Mel and Rene were so perfect together on what would happen to the parents of a kidnapped child. That's a tough role to pull off. Because, how doe you react not knowing where your child is? I would highly recommend this to adults. The children, you might have to cover their eyes, this is more of an adult thriller though. So, if you liked the movie "Trapped", you will definitely enjoy "Ransom". It's one heck of a ride. Good job to Mel and Gary! 9/10</fullReview>

To imagine one's own child is kidnapped and to act this way I can only say that this man got balls the size of church bells.

		<shortDescription>Humorless Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no humor to be found in "Ransom" as it is the story of a boy's kidnapping and his parents attempts to bring him back safely. Mel Gibson delivers a great performance as a father on the verge of breaking down from the kidnapping ordeal. Rene Russo provides a role she rarely plays of a serious character, unlike her showcase roles in "Lethal Weapon 3 &amp; 4", "Major League", and "The Thomas Crown Affair." She is very believable in her role as the boy's mother. Gary Sinise plays the deranged police officer who is so close to reality it's scary. You don't know what a cop thinks when you walk by them on the street because they have steel attitudes and looks. Ron Howard gives one of his best directing efforts yet making the movie intense to the end. By delivering no humor he keeps the subject matter serious and chilling to the very last reel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all you have to know that this is a remake (at times identitical) from the movie with Glenn Ford in the fifties, only done with a Hollywoodbudget and some action like you expect from Mel Gibson. I had the same problem with Gibsonversion as the original one, it can be that cruelity against kids is wrong (of course it is) but in the case of Gibson and his happy managerlife, you just think he derserves nothing better and you start to favour Gary Sinise. Besides, very exciting isn't the word to use as after 15 minutes you already know who the kidnapper is, and that is really a stupid thing to do. What follows then is just possible in Hollywoodmovies and more than once you feel like you're watching some inferior Lethal Weapon-episodes. All by all a decent film with a decent Gibson, a brilliant Gary Sinise and a terrible Rene Russo. Quite average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson stars as Tom Mullen, a successful businessman with a wife, Kate, played by Rene Russo. One day, tragedy strikes when Tom's son Sean (Brawley Nolte) is kidnapped by Detective Jimmy Shaker, and is held for ransom. Tom, being the businessman he is, can sense a blush, and in a last effort turns the tables on the kidnapper. Ron Howard directed this film, and I for one am not a fan of Howard. I didn't love "A Beautiful Mind" and all his other hyped-up films. I did, however, enjoy "Apollo Thirteen," and "Ransom" almost equals "Apollo" on a scale of greatness. Due primarily to terrific acting, an excellent script and gut-wrenching moments, this classy remake nailed what it was aiming for. I was very surprised.4/5 stars --John Ulmer</fullReview>

"Ransom" would have been a much better film if it had ended 20 minutes earlier than now, then the film would have been something to think about afterwards.

		<fullReview>This film had ONE good idea, which was revealed, with much fanfare, about halfway through. Unfortunately it was also revealed in the trailers. Even a ten-second TV ad, which had no time to tell us anything else, told us the one thing that ought to have been kept secret. It must be said that this wasn't the movie's fault; but if knowing the central conceit in advance makes it pointless to actually watch the movie, that IS the movie's fault. I knew what the surprise in `Psycho' was going to be before viewing it. Did this ruin the experience? Certainly not entirely: it may have been preferable to watch it in complete ignorance, but there's more to `Psycho' than just one idea.Anyway: `Ransom' is about a rich man with a slightly shady past (Mel Gibson) whose child is kidnapped; and thereafter, the one good idea aside, it's all confused, portentous stodge. I must say that the shady past sub-plot had potential, and to be honest I cared more about what Mel Gibson had done and whether he would get into trouble for it than I cared about the kid, who just got in the way. But there were several subsidiary plot elements and they were ALL ill-served. The film is one big barrel of red herrings, each one distracting us from the scent of the others - and they all have much the same over-salted taste, anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is the stupidest and least thought out film of 1996. The decisions made by some of the characters made little sense. If this film was made in the early 80's then it would have been marketed off as an exciting vigilante flick with Charles Bronson in the lead role. Ransom has to be one of Mel Gibson's worst performances as an actor.Many things that happen in the film are without purpose or sense. One example is the scene when one of the kidnappers is shot and killed during the first ransom pickup(it doesn't make sense to kill the the only person who could lead not only to Tom's son, but accomplices as well). The movie is poorly done and contains the usual two demensinal characters seen in many of todays' films in Hollywood. This shows that Ron Howard is much better at depicting sentiment and family life then he is at action and suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't really figure out what would be the actual point of making a movie like "Ransom". So a boy gets kidnapped, the kidnappers demand a ransom, and the boy's dad instead offers the ransom money to anyone who can find the kidnappers. So what? You'd think that Mel Gibson's Oscar win for "Braveheart" would have made him get involved in something better than this (actually, maybe it wouldn't, as Oscar wins often make people star in terrible movies).Anyway, even if we ignore Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic rant, this movie doesn't really add up to much. I would expect more from Ron Howard. Also starring Rene Russo, Gary Sinise, Delroy Lindo, Liev Schreiber, Donnie Wahlberg and Lili Taylor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad you'll root for the bad guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RANSOM is about a super rich man who is God, or at least that what the movie states. His son is kidnapped, and he is so perfect, he handles everything himself. Of course he doesn't need God's help, because he is God. Mel Gibson plays the super rich man as pompously as always. It might be viewed as humor. The movie is made to give the impression that no crime can be successful against the people in power, and the rich people of the world will eat this up. They, of course, hope enough movies, books, and other forms of propaganda like this will make all crime be against poor people, and they've pretty well succeeded. Only a pro would go after a powerful person. The propaganda is so far reaching that some user comments claim "don't mess with the big guy, he's too much for you," and "he got where he is for a reason." No, these people got where they got by pure luck of the draw. They are no better, smarter, or godlike than any other person. But if you read enough books and see enough movies ran by their propaganda machine, you'll be pretty powerless against that lie. That said, the whole film is full of holes, and nothing adds up. Every item is super contrived. Horrible writing, horrible acting, horrible plot, and the "good guys" are so unidentifiable and unsympathetic, you'll root for the kidnappers. One of the worst movies ever made.</fullReview>
