		<fullReview>In December 6, 1989, disgruntled 25-year-old student Marc Lépine shoot 28 people and then killed himself in École Polytechnique in Montreal. He aims his anger at feminists and blames his failures on them. This is a dramatized version of the true events. Maxim Gaudette plays the unnamed killer. Valérie (Karine Vanasse), Stéphanie (Evelyne Brochu) and Jean-François (Sébastien Huberdeau) are fellow mechanical engineering students and friends. The film follows these four characters before, during and after the incident.Director Denis Villeneuve shots this in black and white. It gives a cold feel to the movie. I think the killer's writing is chilling but the minutia of the fellow students' lives are boring. The only exception is the interview for the internship. The black and white is quite effective during the shooting incident. There are a lot of comparison to Gus Van Sant's Elephant. The main difference for me is that this is a real incident. I almost never call for a strict reenactment but this needs that kind of detail. I would prefer that the 20 minutes shooting spree be recreated perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What people don't seem to understand....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read many comments by people stating that this film is bias because it only reflects the point of view of the victims who were mainly female and that is just giving support to the feminist movement but that is not the case.This film isn't about the shooter, it isn't about the families...it's about the victims/survivors of this horrific ordeal. It does not focus on the background of the killer, it does not explain in great detail why he committed this terrible act of violence... it depicts what the victims/survivors went through.Some people tend to feel empathic for the shooter, commenting on the fact that he felt prosecuted for his gender and that he felt threatened and hatred for females who in his own opinion were taking jobs away from males who deserved them... Kind of like the two shooters from Columbine who to some people became a icon for anti-bullying, thinking that the only reason they committed these crimes was because they were prosecuted by their peers and the community. It doesn't change the fact that both the Columbine shooters and Marc Lepine took innocent lives and then so cowardly take their own.Some people liken this movie to "Elephant" and I agree but it also reminds me of "April Showers" since both movies did not focus on the killer but on the people who suffered through the event.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent Docu-Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening scene of students busy doing their copying in front of an array of copying machines, and the sudden disruption caused by a burst of gun fire, Polytechnique grabs the viewers by the collar and placed them right in the middle of this horrific event that took place in Montreal in 1989.The film claimed to be a fictionalized account of the massacre, in which 14 women were killed and many others were wounded, and I don't know to what extent it adheres to facts. But that does not matter. As far as story telling goes Denis Villeneuves did it with skill and without fanfare. B/W images, and a restraint use of dialogue and music add to the mood of this film, which is not an uplifting experience by its very nature. Acting was good by the several male and female leads. Editing was excellent.Overall, I look at this films as Canadian cinema at its best - despite the depressing nature of the subject matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't terribly impressed by this movie, in fact at times I found it rather boring, especially the last 20 minutes which felt a bit pointless. The first 40 minutes were alright though, even though I have no idea what the point was in filming it all in black &amp; white (didn't know it was gonna be and the poster is slightly misleading as that is indeed in colour) it's set in 1987 after all not 1957, but I'm sure many think that that was a brilliant idea.Anyway, lack of colours aside, yeah I wasn't terribly impressed with it, you don't get to know the characters much, or what made the killer actually snap (what made him hate feminists remains a mystery). I mean I understand that maybe they didn't want to take too many liberties with the script, but maybe it would have worked better as a documentary instead. And then we'd get a little more insight as well.The true story of which it's based is of course awful but that doesn't make the story anymore engaging, at least for me, certain others disagree and that's fine good for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the right choices</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2nd film by Villeneuve I've so far seen, and he's already one of my favourite film makers. And, judging the reviews, he also divides. Some of the negative reviews complain about the film makers' choice to basing the film on actual events while fictionalizing it on purpose. And I'm a little lost about that, I'm not sure whether it's the choice or in fact this disclaimer that meets this discontent - in other words whether anything would be different had the reviewers in question missed the disclaimer. What is fiction, what reality indeed, to quote one of the other reviewers. As soon as you touch a subject, be it in writing or as a film, you fictionalize it - to a degree it even goes that way with documentaries (and it begins with memories). This makes the choice of the film makers a rather smart one - if you know nothing about the Montreal shooting, actually if you do, but weren't there, the difference is almost incidental. What we're left with is one shooting and its effects for many others. Does this choice make the film unrealistic? Far from it. Unless you consider a, say, McEwan novel as unrealistic and exploiting for being fiction while putting the plot into a context of real events. Whether the choice is made out of respect for the victims is also irrelevant for the viewer. For the viewer contents-format relation is decisive. And what we see is uncommented on matter-of-factly depiction that keeps an unusual balance between the graphic (not in the sense of the usual graphic detail, but rather of graphic impact) and the subtle, the restrained. It says, This is what a shooting is. Full stop. The effect on the survivors is told in equally un-elaborated form. It never fully enters either the victims' nor the perp's total POV beyond this constraint, which is smart again; otherwise it'd be inevitable to cross the border to the sentimental, which I always find insulting towards the victims. Instead we're watching jumps between the significant moments both of the shooting and the later effects on the traumatized, only where necessary, and without distorting embellishment. The film begins with a letter composed by the shooter, which he's about to carry on his person, to be found by the world to read in the aftermath. The film makers do not allow him this fame within the frame of the film. Although the film begins with him, and although he necessarily prominent he is denied the higher significance he seeks on the whole, his end as incidental in comparison; he remains nameless. It ends with another letter, from a survivor to the shooter's parents, beginning with her saying that she knows that this letter will not be read (presumably because it's meant to stay with her). Which is the one that stays with us. This is the closest the writer &amp; director go. And they let it end right there. Perhaps it's not the best way to turn a review into a rebuttal, but these points highlight what I liked about the film. The film makers stood before the same questions as the reviewers, they made a conscious choice, and it was the right one. To me this is one of the most tactful treatments of the subject of shootings, while bringing us right there, and it does so without the burden of artificial sentiment, making the impact an even stronger one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Much Hatred There Can Be In This World?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the ?cole Polytechnique massacre that took place on December 6, 1989 in Montreal, Polytechnique documents the horrifying tragedy in which a gunman who claimed to be "fighting feminism" murdered 14 young women &amp; wounded several others before turning the gun on himself and is shown from the perspectives of three people; the killer, one of his wounded victims &amp; the victim's friend.Excellently directed by Dennis Villeneuve (director of Incendies &amp; Prisoners) plus exquisitely captured in black n white, the film grabs the viewers' attention from its opening moment &amp; is told in a manner that only pulls them in, in spite of its dark story. Running at only 77 minutes, it not only recreates the dreadful event but also covers the aftermath of the three main people involved in the story.The three characters we are introduced too are nicely presented on the screen by their respective actors, each delivering a very fine performance. However, the back-n-forth jump this film takes from time to time turned out to be quite distracting from the main subject. As for its faithfulness with the historical account, the film covers the gunman's killing spree with stunning accuracy.On an overall scale, Polytechnique is a hard-hitting docudrama that neither tries to make a statement nor offers any kind of redemption but simply offers an insight of what happened on December 6, 1989. It presents a man who lost his way in life &amp; blamed women for all his miseries and yet never really judges him for the judgment part is left to viewers themselves &amp; in that aspect, it's sure to divide its audience.An unsettling, tense &amp; haunting recount which once experienced won't be easily forgotten, Polytechnique is a daring work of filmmaking crafted in memory of those 14 young women who lost their lives &amp; few who survived but were scarred for life only because of the extreme misogynistic view of an individual who went completely crazy and the film as a whole subtly exhibits just how much hatred there can be in this world. Thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unconventinal and grim storytelling with lots of film references</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Canadian movie is really some different approach on a school massacre movie, made by someone who obviously had a lot to say. It's shockingly grim and brutal, yet made with artful eyes and a close look to details, made by a future film genius.We're immediately drawn into the story, which tells about the horrific shootings at the technical high school in French speaking Montreal in Canada in December 1989. We meet both the shooter and the victims in a film which makes an everyday event like school is, to be a nightmare. The shooter was a young man which have lost his way in life, the meaning of it all, blaming women's liberation, and women in general. It was a great shock to the peaceful Canadian nation, giving the country a shell shock. A true depicted tragedy, here recreated with a horrific feel of the reality in it.The film has lots of film references. It's filmed in a Hitchcockian style. Some scenes and sounds are even inspired by Psycho. The film is made in black and white, which adds to this feel. The film would have been unnecessary gory if the blood had been red. It's in many ways very similar to Gus Van Sant's Elephant Camera moments are excellent. Angles are eventfully made and at times astonishingly beautiful, adding to the artistic feel. Music is scarce, ambient and adding to the feel. Both things makes us remember this film. The walking in corridors of the school is also quite similar. I also found similarities in the film language with the Swedish "L?t den rette komma in" (Let the right one in). Wonderful and great acted by the main role here. He is terrifyingly without any reason to carry on his life.Not longer than necessary, which today is a blessing, when we see long movies dragging the story out. A well made film, which forces you to reflect on the event, and others like it. Kudos to the involved. Watch out for director Villeneuve, which gas already made some great stuff. He's gonna make a real important movie in the near future. Actually he right now has got his two latest films, 2011 Oscar nominated "Incendies" and the fresh smash hit "Prisoners", both with 8,2 rating here on IMDb. What a film maker!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful and meditative film that is both horrific and poetic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't planned on seeing this film but was invited by a friend. Thank yous came out of my mouth the moment we stepped out of the theater; the only words which managed to escape my rattled mind.This is a film which I believe is a must see. Brutal and raw, it breaks a real story into a few basic elements and lets the events speak for themselves. The film depicts the sad events of this day in 1989 with such realism that the viewer feels himself part of the drama, a witness to the violence. Filmed in black and white, and with very similar stylistic elements to Gus Van Sant's Elephant, few words are needed for the director to properly convey the desired range of emotions which take place in the movie.I must add that there were shots of such beauty which contrasted the ugliness of the shooting in such a moving way that while trying to old back tears at one point, I thought to myself "Life is a wonderful gift.." I have never written a review for this site before, and enjoy a great variety of films: I walked out of the silent, full theater, packed with viewers just as shell shocked as I, thinking that this might have been the most gut wrenching movie experience of my life.Do see</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A response to violence against women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pure and simple, this film is a response to our societal violence against women. I'm surprised by some of the reviewers here particularly from diomavro, trying to belittle the events or claim exaggeration on the film's part. Yes, the film is a fictionalized account, but the actual events are nearly note-for-note the same. All one has to do is read the Wikipedia article, École Polytechnique Massacre. The killer was very clear in his intentions, and he in fact cornered a group of women and told them he hated feminists and hated them for pursuing careers in engineering. Yes, it did cause a "media scandal" precisely because this was a massacre based on misogyny. That is what happened, there is no "grey area" here. Villeneuve has honoured and represented this event faithfully and truthfully. The Polytechnique massacre was a shocking reminder to Canada that men and women are still not equal, and there are those who will fight a perceived loss of privilege to the death. To try and cover this up, and claim that the murders were about anything other than a hatred of women, is to spit on the victim's graves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anti-feminist shooter invades a school of engineering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Polytechnique" (2009) is a well-made film that tells the story of a school shooting at a school of engineering. It focuses on 3 persons. The shooter (Maxim Gaudette) has developed a tremendous resentment and hatred for feminists, blaming them for his own problems. This perverse idea and psychology he acts on by invading the school and killing a number of female students before taking his own life.The film doesn't verbally elucidate the psychology of the shooter in much detail, but it is made plain enough. The underlying goal is revenge. Envy is in play too. The shooter is male and young. He has been exposed to the notion that males succeed by gaining power, social status and sexual prowess. Violence is a means to power when the other routes have been frustrated or haven't been attainable. His logic is that feminists have thwarted him in becoming a man. He commits suicide so that he cannot be taken into custody by authorities, as that would show his weakness and impotence as a man. Suicide is again a way to show his power.The film concentrates more on the other two characters, both of whom are students, showing how they are affected during and after the shooting. One of them is a man (Sebastien Huberdeau), the other a woman (Karine Vanasse). The young man is in the classroom when the killer divides the students into men and women groups and orders the men to leave. He toys with the idea of resisting and jumping the killer but he doesn't. It would take 3 men to do this and 1 or 2 might get shot. They'd have to coordinate first. They'd have to think and act very quickly. They'd have to sacrifice themselves. None of this is easy. But Huberdeau feels guilt afterward, very great guilt. He runs for the cops but they are slow to appear. None at all arrive during the course of the shootings as the killer moves around. As in "Elephant", there is a slowness in making known to everyone that a killer is loose, or else the killings occur relatively quickly.Vanasse's character illustrates the difficulty of a female student, even an excellent one, making headway in a field dominated by men. She's no feminist in any of the many ways that term might be taken, but she wants to have an equal shot at a job. After the shooting, she has a long memory of the events and the loss of her closest friend. She remarks on the capacity for deep hatred in human beings. She finds that it's a long road to building up trust in human beings again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The value of human life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denis Villeneuve's Polytechnique (2009) is as far away from his later Enemy (2013) as I could imagine. It is pure and stark, informed by its subject matter: a 1989 school shooting in Montreal, targeting women. It looks great in black and white, which creates a sombre atmosphere.This film is a testament to the importance of story and substance. The cerebral Enemy never really justified its existence to me. Also, unlike the bloated Enemy, which wore out its welcome after 15 minutes, this film is engrossing through its conservative 75 minute run time. The film is profoundly disturbing, and just plain profound. It is a sensitive film that evokes the barbarism of murder, while celebrating the value of human life.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but too idealized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know its supposed to be a true story so the material is bounded as to what it can provoke but nonetheless this is insufficient. It feels like this is trying to give feminists a purpose instead of trying to give humanity to its characters. The shooter is just a misogynist from top to bottom and everyone else is a nice and balanced person. This just isn't good movie material. I will say I enjoyed the way this movie was filmed however, quite stylish with some nice shots in the school especially the rotation around its characters. No offense but anyone who actually thinks that its likely that somebody would tell a female engineer she should re-consider because she is a woman in AN INTERVIEW is downright delusional, especially in Canada where something like this would probably cause a media outrage, a little offhand comment is plausible but somebody expanding to that detail was just nonsense. This is nitpicking but this nonsense kind of pulled me out of the film. The dude who killed himself is only in the movie so we can see him kill himself, such teleological picking doesn't make for a good narrative, at the very least we should have seen some more of his emotional struggles. Its such a shame because this director has talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ode to the victims and survivors..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denis Villeneuve's second feature film is a respectable and redeeming depiction of a true incident that occurred on the sixth of December in 1989 when a young man walked into a technical high school in Montreal and shoot fourteen female students before he pointed the gun at himself. In the suicide note he left behind, he called himself a rationalist who's had his life ruined by feminists.School tragedy's has happened more frequently in the United States, Germany and Finland than any other countries, and been documented by filmmakers such as Michael Moore, Gus Van Sant and Ilmar Raag. In Denis Villeneuve's dramatization of the massacre that occurred 21 years ago at ?scole Polytechnique in Canada, the story is seen from three different points of view and told from two contrasting voice-overs which represents both sides of the story. The Canadian director's use of non-linear narrative and persistent changes of pace gives this film the intensity one often experiences in thrillers, and with the hand-held camera movements, the abrupt takes and sound-mixing, Denis Villeneuve takes the viewer's straight into the minds of the characters who who represents the people who were involved in the incident."Polytechnique" is based on the survivors' stories and seen from the point of view of one perpetrator, one victim and one survivor. It's filmed in black-and-white and conveyed through a skilled film language which distances the viewer's from the emotional impact that a documentary might have had, something it manages to do without reducing it's credibility. With his reasoned and lyrical screenplay, Jacques Davidts gives life to the three central characters that where fictionalized in respect of the victims and the survivors of this horrible tragedy. These three characters are credibly portrayed by three good Canadian actors who makes this fictitious reconstruction of a tragic incident an authentic fictional film through their understated performances. What makes "Polytechnique" as good as it is, is that it early on drags it's focus away from the tragedy and dedicates as much time to what took place before and after, and even though it is strongest when it comes to the technical aspects and the narrative, this stringently structured film which deals with severe and controversial themes, is essentially an ode to the victims and the survivors of this horrible incident which unfortunately is only one of many similar incidents that are happening all over the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Men's Suffering have been Erased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denis Villeneuve is a bystander who fails to show the real workings from behind the scenes and adheres firmly to political correctness to avoid an uproar by sexist feminist hate groups. Independent studies reveal that girls torment and abuse others in different ways that are not even recognized by the current laws. The lack of public awareness on abuses by girls, allow such atrocities to continue beyond reproach. When bullies pick on loners in schools, they pay the price when the loner gets a weapon and hurts those girls who tormented him. A gang of girl bullies cornered and killed an Indian girl not too long ago. The world gets to see inside the minds of those involved, and pick out who is responsible and what part of the process that led to such a tragedy. Polytechnique avoids all of that. In fact, it is just an exercise in panning the camera about and never digging into the facts that is expected from a movie. It never goes beyond the information already provided by the news media, and even tells us less than what we already know. There was nothing gained by shooting it in Black and White, other than to give an amateur false sense of newsworthy material. It never mentions the Disturbing Misandrist Quebec society that fosters extreme bigoted Feminist hate and discrimination via Affirmative Action. The misandry is systemic and is completely entrenched in the education system which leads to more sexist misandrist hate and discrimination against men.Marc was the victim of intense hate and discrimination because Misandrist hate is so ingrained in Quebec society that everyone, including young girls, think that it is acceptable to hate and abuse men because men do not have the political voice to cry out when they are victimized and oppressed. There is not a single men's shelter in Canada and men are not recognized as victims under the current gender-biased sexist Feminist laws. At some point when the misandry is just too much to bear, the abused man will lash out and strike out against the feminist abusers to defend himself. Marc's pain and suffering was not recognized, and his feminist abusers were not exposed so they will be free to continue their abuse and discrimination under the protection of the sexist feminist misandrist laws. 4 men were shot at Polytechnique, but their suffering have been erased because under an abusive sexist feminist regime, men are not allowed to be victims, but must be held responsible. Girls are given absolute rights but are not required to be held accountable. Only girls get to hold the Victim Card.No one is allowed to speak out against the misandrist feminist tyranny without being silenced under such an oppressive Marxist regime. Larry Summers made such a mistake by speaking out, and he was silenced. Now Harvard University falls victim to the Feminist Communist oppression. Warning, you will walk away with the feeling that the movie was heavily censored and was an amateur attempt to evoke emotions, without providing known explanations for the misandrist backlash because of intense fear of political subterfuge from Feminist hate groups. The Polytechnique event is revealing and exposes feminism for its militant hate policies, but the misandrist truth is far too disturbing for the public to fathom. 20 years later, the disturbing feminist misandrist rampage has spread to little boys in elementary school. Only 32% of university students this year are men. The circle of bigoted feminist misandrist hate and oppression against men is complete, and paves the way for the Marxist Communist New World Order.girlwriteswhat on youtube said it nicely, Feminism is the destroyer of worlds, and the dumbest people will promote Feminism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where does the reality begin and end?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm finding it hard to write an in-depth review about this movie, but of all the mass murder films I have seen, the imperfections of this film seem to make it a very good case in point to comment upon. The thing I most take issue with is how the film makers decided to relate the film to any real life incidents it was based on, by telling the viewer upfront at the opening of the film that it was based on the Montreal massacre, but saying all characters in the film are fictional. The purpose for this is clearly for nothing other than the capitalization upon real life human suffering, otherwise really why would it need to be blatantly stated if the film is a fictional account? When film makers do that, they knowingly attract the interest of people in such events, and moreover they place their film on a pedestal above fiction which tends to endear people towards the film, however this IS fiction and it is difficult to tell where the fiction and biogrqaphy begins and ends.Adding to this tasteless fact, the film makers decided to make their film in black and white (for whatever official reason). The likely and common reason, is that it bestows a certain respectability and legitimacy to the film, a technique used many times before in action dramas which may otherwise come across as exploitative, for if it were in color like most films, it might have been regarded as "just another made for t.v. movie" which to be honest wouldn't be that unfitting.As to the content, is the film in itself horrible? Not necessarily, though because the scenes depicted are very matter of fact, and mainly action driven with very little dialogue, not to mention that of all the films involving mass murder I've seen, this film shows probably the greatest amount of actual violence, it may not be intended to shock, but there is very little depth outside of what we instantly know the film pertains to."Polytechnique" can very easily be compared to "Elephant" in terms of the feel of the film, though Elephant really did seem to have a purpose and real depth and artistry, whereas this film seemed to be merely showing us events. While Gus Van Sant in "Elephant" badly messed up on chronological timing, there isn't much in "polytechnique" to scrutinize other than the fact that in the 30 or so minute range of time that the shooting takes place, it remains questionable that there would be so many people still simply milling about the institution unaware of what was happening for such a long time, though all things said and done, it is very hard to say exactly how such events would play out in reality.There was very little buildup, very little contemplation on the event, and since I came away from the film feeling empty, and really asking what the point of the film was, ultimately the film just doesn't have very much to say. What it does, is it merely coldly shows us a horrific event without giving it much of a face other than (The shooter hated feminists... so he killed them.) Again, not a horrible movie, but it doesn't possibly in any way do justice to the actual event that took place, which is really a bit shameful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another missed opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was put off by one of the very first things you see in this film, which is a statement in which the filmmakers hope to have their cake and eat it too. They claim it's "based on a true story" but they then disrespect the families by saying all characters have been fictionalized. It's the ultimate disrespect to profit (via cash or fame) on the misfortune of others, while not even telling their story. We all know that far fewer people would have chosen to see this movie if it was titled "Gately College" or something.While I wasn't expecting a documentary, I was expecting something true to the facts. Now I'm left with the problem of figuring out whether anything in the film was true at all. Did we learn anything about the shooter? Did we learn anything about the victims? Did we learn anything about the responders? No.Having said that, it did contain some of the most intense shooting scenes I've seen in a film, and for some reason I was also struck by the images of trees. But I was not impressed by the self-indulgent upside-down camera angles.I think it probably is superior to Gus Van Sant's Elephant (Columbine) film, although it does follow in the same vein of being almost entirely devoid of content. If this is going to be the way that directors and writers depict traumatic mass murders, then they need to stop it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On December 6, 1989, Marc Lepine wrapped his Ruger Mini-14 semi automatic rifle in a plastic garbage bag, filled the pockets of his coat with ammunition, and headed off to class at the Montreal's Ecole Polytechnique, the engineering branch of the University of Montreal. By the time he was through, fourteen women lay dead, and another ten women and four men were in critical condition. Lepine culminated his misogynistic rampage and wretched existence with a bullet to his head, leaving behind a rambling three page letter railing against feminists who had turned society against him and ruined his life and everything good that had been created by man.Even today the magnitude of the tragedy runs deep in Montreal's collective psyche, and its into this minefield that the film Polytechnique dares to tread, stirring strong sentiments from the public and critics alike for recounting an event whose wounds still live in the consciousness of victims families and survivors.Filmed in stark black and white, and shot twice, once in French and again in English using the same cast, Director Denis Villeneuve imbues the film with an almost suffocating foreboding as a pallor of death hangs over the day like the snow that gently falls throughout. Rather than dwell on Lepine, he instead shifts the focus to two fictional students, Valérie (Karine Vanasse) and Jean-François (Sébastien Huberdeau), each bringing the perspective of their respective gender to the story.By framing events through the lives of these two, Polytechnique packs a most powerful punch. With the exception of a bone chilling beginning, Lepine's murderous rampage virtually plays second fiddle to the story of Valérie and Jean-François, which is how Villeneuve wanted it. He studiously avoids dwelling on death, and shifts the film's emphasis to that of life, grappling with tragedy head on, and the aftermath of anguish that exploded that day like so many bullets from Lepine's gun.This isn't some sensationalist gory ode to a mass murderer, but rather a memorial to the victims of that day. It's not that often you see that in a movie, which makes watching Polytechnique an act of remembrance, and a cause to reflect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Movie That Fails To Add Anything To Our Understanding Of The Event</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the darkest and most tragic events in Canadian history was surely the 1989 "Montreal Massacre" in which a number of female engineering students in a Montreal college were shot and killed by a misogynistic, feminist-hating gunman. This movie is based on those events, although changing the identities of everyone in the movie to the extent that none of the characters were even named as far as I recall. The movie begins with a long recital of a letter by the gunman expressing his hatred of women, and it closes with a long recital of a letter by one of the victims (who survived) expressing how the shooting had impacted her. Between those closing narrations, the story might best be described as "minimal." There's very little dialogue of any kind between any of the characters. The movie focuses more on the reactions of the students as the gunman wanders through the building, shooting any women he encounters. It's shot in black and white, which gives a somewhat "eerie" feeling to this, and it is very suspenseful; the viewer certainly feels the sense of helplessness and chaos that must have been felt by the students. This movie is quite reminiscent of the American movie "Elephant," which was based on the Columbine shooting. I preferred "Elephant" - I thought it made better use of the school setting than this one did. I can't say that I was really keeping track, but I thought this movie also exaggerated the event a bit. The Montreal Massacre was bad enough as it was; in this far more women seemed to be shot than actually were shot in the event itself - although, as I said, I wasn't really keeping track. The best part of this movie is the suspense that's involved. One doesn't really learn anything about the Montreal Massacre. Marc Lepine (the name of the real shooter) was a misogynistic feminist- hater. We already knew that. So, perhaps one wonders what the purpose of this movie was. The opening captions say it was to honour the women killed, and their names did appear in a scroll at the movie's end, but I confess that I honestly didn't think it succeeded in that goal. It was a dramatic enough portrayal of a school-shooting, but it adds nothing to our understanding of the event. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing portrayal of the Montreal Massacre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an incredibly disturbing fictionalized account of the 1989 massacre. None of the characters in the movie are real people, except maybe the killer, Mark Lepine, but the movie probably doesn't want you to think of the killer as him either.The movie is disturbing. That's fitting because who would have predicted such an incident back then when school and university shootings were hardly the norm? This was the largest mass-killing at a school or university at the time. What made this incident even more disturbing was that the killer had a sexist agenda. He killed 12 women and no men.The movie give focus to the killer, a male classmate of the female students at Polytechnique as well as some of the female students. The killer is shown as disturbed man who at the beginning tries to kill himself, gives up, then visits his mother, before going on his rampage. He's calm and focused as he walks around the halls shooting women. Apparently this is how it really happened according to interviews.The movie also shows a male classmate who has female friends in the classroom where the killer originally starts the massacre. The incident obviously affected women gravely but I'm glad it showed men as well. This character was intended to show that not all men are as brutal and insane as the killer (obviously). But it also shows his pain in survival and how helpless he felt being separated from the women. There's always survival guilt in school shootings but there was obviously a lot of survival guilt for the men here. That's shown, I'm glad it was.The incident is also shown again from the women's perspective. It's plain disturbing. I don't think the movie ever crosses the line into sensationalism. The whole movie is in black and white which makes it more like video surveillance footage from 1989. It also tones down the more graphic parts of the movie where there's blood.The movie isn't for the faint of heart. I think it is a story which should be told even 20 years after the original incident. I was 9 when the incident happened and I don't remember much besides the white ribbons on the anniversary and I didn't even know what it was about really except that women were killed in Montreal. I think that people who were kids when this happened or born after it should watch it to know what happened.The movie also begins by showing how tough it was for women engineers in 1989. I'm sure it's still difficult, probably less than it was in 1989, but still difficult nonetheless.The film doesn't try to understand the incident or why the killer murdered 14 women. It's kind of like Gus Van Sant's "Elephant" that way (a movie about the Columbine massacre). As long as there's deeply disturbed individuals who aren't getting help and lots of cheap guns and ammunition, incidents like this will persist. Changes have been made since 1989 and despite there being shootings like the one at Dawson college, I think progress has been made.December 6th is officially National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women in Canada. A white ribbon campaign was started by men in 1991.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, Harrowing, Appropriate. A must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of things to note: this film is described as "fictionalised", but as far as I know most of it is accurate. The massacre occurred, the film is dedicated to the fourteen women killed (who are named at the end of the movie), and the film makers have changed the names of the characters to spare the families.I avoided this until someone I trusted recommended it. I was concerned that it would be either exploitive or inept, or one of those movies that tries to explain the "phsychology" behind insane rampages (yawn) at the expense of the victims.In fact Polytechnique is a sparse simple work of great skill and humanity. There is no gratuitous violence, no gratuitous emotion, no excesses of any kind. Unsentimental, and completely moving.Afterwards I found myself looking up the chronology of the massacre and was surprised at how accurate the film really is.And to address a previous comment, Marc Lepin was not a victim of a feminist conspiracy. Marc Lepin was the victim of Marc Lepine. Too bad he took fourteen others with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful; like "Elephant", with a little less minimalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(English version)If you didn't enjoy Gus Van Sant's "Elephant", then hopefully you'll enjoy "Polytechnique". The director doesn't use long camera shots of characters walking, and they have more of a back-story. In "Elephant", the characters had practically none. I enjoyed the film, regardless, but "Polytechnique" is done better, and I'm not saying this because I'm Canadian.I was only two when the massacre happened, but I learned about it as I grew up. Like the events depicted in the film, a disturbed misogynist with a semi-automatic rifle walks into Montréal's École Polytechnique, on a winter day in 1989. He picks a classroom, tells the males and females to divide up, and you can guess what happens. What I didn't learn is that he wasn't done. He continued his rampage in the school, until he committed suicide.The film is in black and white, making things more depressing, along with shots of snow falling. We occasionally jump back and forth in time, from earlier in the day to sometime after the tragedy. It was a little confusing for me, but I eventually understood what was happening. The killer is shown thinking and preparing, beforehand. Whenever he's on screen, it's especially tense. Part of that is credited to Maxim Gaudette's performance.The other main characters are two female students living together, and a male friend of theirs, who wants to help the killer's victims in the school, instead of fleeing. These three characters aren't highly developed, but we do get to know them more than the ones in "Elephant". As for the killer, his development comes from his narrated suicide letter. Regardless, I don't believe the filmmakers were out to make him look like a monster. He's basically filmed the same way the hijackers were in "United 93". Just people.The version of the film I'm reviewing is not actually dubbed. From what I understand, the scenes were retaken with the actors speaking English. It's more obvious, for instance, when you see someone writing on paper in that language. Personally, I would've liked to see it in French. There wouldn't even be that many subtitles, because the film doesn't have much dialogue. It doesn't really matter, though."Polytechnique" plays like the tune from the soap opera "The Young and the Restless". It's tragic and memorable. The other day, a teenager in Britain nearly went on a rampage in his school, but it was prevented because the threatening message he posted online was quickly reported by someone with a heart. A heart that these filmmakers have, to not exploit the tragedy, but to show it respectfully, and dedicate it to those who lost their lives that day. Lest we forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant piece of work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that this film really portrayed the story very well. If you have ever had to endure a Montreal winter, even for a few days, it was captured so beautifully. The lack of dialogue drove you to rely on your other senses. This film really made you think that this could actually happen here in Canada! I think all of the negative comments are just from some of our friends in the south who have been through many school shootings and are desensitized to it. You must member, 20 years ago, there was nothing like this happening anywhere in North America! let alone a higher education institution!The 20th anniversary is coming up, and I will be wearing a white ribbon. I know the man who runs this program and will be donating as well. Violence against women is still a very live reality in this world, and we should do everything we can to educate against it. Seeing this film is a great start for anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please run see this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot say enough how overdue and how perfectly balanced this film is. It will hit you like a ton of brick, and you will not see the world the same ever, and it's a good thing! Polytechnique sucks you in and makes you not the voyeur of a gory violent spectacle, but the helpless witness of your own rape. The script of this film is absolutely brilliant, and the masterful editing takes you on a journey right on the cusp of the abyss but instead of leaving you there, takes you away and lets you make your own mind.To think that the events on which this film is based really happened (I was an engineering student in 1989) is bone-chilling. But to realize, as the film so strongly suggests, that you can survive hell and live to be a strong and beautiful soul, that you can refuse to surrender to the horror some believe to be the only solution to life's contradictions is a lesson we can all learn from.Despite all apprehensions and negative comments we're heard or read since this movie became a project many years ago, this film is first and foremost about hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Troubling account of a tragedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before what happened in Columbine and similar recent events, there was this night of December 6th, 1989.Students were either studying, having a good time or just speaking each other in the cafeteria. In between, a troubled and rejected young man enters the Polytechnique institution in Montreal in search of killing some "feminists", somewhat responsible for his ruined life...Shot in black and white, the effect is troubling. All we are left is with a lot of questioning starting with this single word: Why ? Good acting, good photography and a story which is moving, similar to "United 93" which was linked with a far worse tragedy.A movie to see, either in French or English (not dubbed...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome cinema - wonderfully disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please disregard the quite bizarre ranting of that earlier reviewer talking about 'whitewashes' and 'feminist hate groups' - good grief! Some people's children...Short potted review: a truly stunning film, beautifully photographed (in glowing black and white) dealing - like Van Sant's Elephant, with a school shooting. I have to say I preferred this to 'Elephant' - as it reached depths that Van Sant just couldn't get to.Put aside the Hollywood-inspired urge to have everything neatly tied up and explained - the film treats the complexity of a school shooting with the subtlety it deserves.If you're into thoughtful elegant cinema - you MUST see this. This is the kind of apparently simple-seeming film-making, that America, by and large, has completely forgotten how to do.There wasn't a single wrong note anywhere in either the casting, direction, or script - I was totally entranced. Given the absurd raving of the previous reviewer, I was expecting some kind of sleazy b-movie - and was pleasantly surprised at the very well made piece of cinematic art that I was watching.This is one of those 'keepers' - a rather special film. Yes its intense, and violent at times - but what do you expect - the central plot is about a rampage through a school by an armed psycho who seemed to have some major issues with the female gender. That said, there's a fascinating little subplot, looking at a larger social picture which, in some ways, reflects the same attitude of the psycho killer...Enough said, I don't want to give anything away - if you like mature, thoughtful cinema - this is some astoundingly well-made film.</fullReview>
