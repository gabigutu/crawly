		<shortDescription>There's so much more to this movie that I never noticed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see Mon Oncle for the first time, you'll be charmed, catch some of the bigger jokes, maybe catch the film's major theme, and you'll walk away with a pleasant experience. Given its masterpiece status, you may very well be wondering what makes that so (confer my posts further down the page for my initial and secondary reactions). On the second viewing, you will probably notice some of the smaller jokes, discern major motifs, and ultimately see it as a better film. The THIRD time, you may notice just how meticulously this film was crafted. In wonderment, you will gaze at the screen, your eyes glancing every which way trying to find the tiniest of jokes. And there are some jokes that are tiny, believe me.The first time I saw this film, I gave it an 8/10, the second time a 9/10, and the third time a 10/10. I actually wept when Hulot said goodbye to his neighbors. Boy, I cannot wait to watch it a fourth time, and a fifth. I hope Playtime and M. Hulot's Holiday are as good as this utter cinematic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come For The Pretty, Stay For The Witty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my introduction to the world of Jacques Tati...and I liked it. If Tati's filmmaking M.O. was to remind us of Charlie Chaplin &amp; Buster Keaton, mission very successfully accomplished. 'Mon Oncle' could have been a silent film. It uses sound effects and music to tell 75% of the story anyway, just as Charlie and Buster and their contemporaries did so well in the talk-free era. He also has their simplicity of camera movement. And as with those film giants, Tati is the star/director/producer and co-writer of this project. His recurring Monsieur Hulot character isn't as famous as the Little Tramp, but the quirky Frenchman is just as bumbling and likable.In line with Chaplin's 'Modern Times', the theme of 'Mon Oncle' is the inability of one man to adapt to new technology. The slapstick sequences that result from the clash of man versus machine are more amusing than truly hilarious. There are a few big laughs, but you'll smile more than than you'll guffaw. There's no standard plot. Hulot's sister, her husband, and their son live in an ultra-modern '50s house. (This weird set is truly magnificent.) Occasionally, they have trendy guests---the out-of-place Hulot among them---and he inadvertently gets the ball of chaos rolling. If his sister's house is too bizarre for him, he still gets to enjoy old-fashioned pleasures in other areas of France. He doesn't fit in with these social climbers, but the man is charming and unflappable in his own eccentric way.This movie looks as stunning as Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' (also released in '58). Both pictures use colour extraordinarily well (especially green) and Tati's film would be worth seeing for the visuals alone. He also makes it a delightful aural experience with a jaunty music score and comical sound design. It's not all a cold technical exercise, though. The acting is a bit exaggerated (except for Tati's underplaying), but they only look foolish in the name of laughs. Will you enjoy a French comedy from nearly 50 years ago? Is 'Mon Oncle' just a critical darling (Oscar for Foreign Language Film, a prize at Cannes) and not an audience picture? Hey, I didn't think I'd be entertained by a two-hour French trifle, but I was. Rent the Criterion DVD and drink in the plush visuals, then have some grins. Come for the pretty, stay for the witty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing Stroll through a French Town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word I would use to describe this film is "amusing", not "hilarious"; "amusant" rather than "rigolo". It gently charms a smile onto your face. Only rarely does it bring out an actual guffaw (when M. Hulot is faced with his sister's kitchen, for example). Tati refuses to impose his own ideas of what is important on the viewer, which is usually done by spending more screen time on them or zooming in. The title (usually considered to be important) is a scrawled piece of graffiti which stays on the screen for less than 1/2 second, but there are long sequences showing M. Hulot's apartment. The viewer has to work to see Hulot appearing (apparently randomly) in the various windows of the building as he walks through it. I love the window which is inexplicably at foot level in which you can see Hulot's feet turn to the wall as the feet of a woman dressed only in a slip appear.In other words, this film is a stroll where, if you keep your eyes open, you will spot some amusing things going on. And France is a great place for a stroll.Two more things. While the comparison to Chaplin is apt, I was led to think of later characters, particularly Hrundi Bakshi in Blake Edwards' The Party and another almost silent character, Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean. Indeed I'm sure Atkinson stole ideas from this film.Also, I think it is misleading to focus too much attention on M. Hulot's struggles with modern tech. The title, Mon Oncle, should direct our attention to the nephew, for whom Hulot is a parole from the prison of his sterile house, enabling him to run with the kids, get dirty, buy doughnuts from a grubby vendor who applies the icing sugar with a bare hand and play practical jokes on passers-by (with Hulot ready to cover for him if need be). Fifty years later these comments are even more biting as we look at a whole generation of children raised in this kind of inhuman antiseptic environment: overweight, with eating disorders and allergies, socially inept with only a TV and a video game for a friend. Makes a dachshund in a red coat want to run with the mutts and tip over a garbage can or two, doesn't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never say no to touch of storyline!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tati's Oscar-winning movie has often been criticized for being the most conventional of his films. I am sure this is true, but on the other hand, there is still enough Tati inside this film to recognize it as one of his. And a touch of storyline and continuity can never be detrimental for a film, not even for a Tati. Actually, this is the most satirical Tati I have seen and therefore, in my opinion, the best. A true masterpiece, unbelievably full of ceative ideas. And I do not understand, how the Academy could award Mon oncle as best foreign film and at the same time completely ignore the tremendous production design.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tati's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only recently discovered the work of Jacques Tati. As a fan of the great movie comedians-auteurs (Chaplin, Keaton, Brooks, Allen), I wanted to see Tati's work. So far, I have only seen PLAYTIME, MR. HULOT'S HOLIDAY and finally, just recently, MON ONCLE. I can easily say MON ONCLE is not only the greatest comedy of Tati, but also one of the finest comedies ever made. It is truly hilarious. I found MR. HULOT'S HOLIDAY to be just a bit slow at times, where I might find myself losing interest for a moment. PLAYTIME was a bit too "mainstream" with many big special effects and so on. But MON ONCLE is simple yet hilarious. For 117 minutes, Tati keeps the viewer in his own world of comedy. The ultra-modern house gadgets were hilarious, making for some very funny sight gags. Tati's Mr. Hulot character belongs in a gallery of great comic film personas, along with Chaplin's Little Tramp, Keaton's Great Stone Face, Allen's neurotic New Yorker, and Brooks' Jewish characterizations. MON ONCLE is also beautifully photographed in color, which adds a lighter touch to the comedy. I've noticed that Tati's films are unlike those of anyone else. The style is all his own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A superior sequel to 'Mr. Hulot's Holiday', it has a more solid story, funnier jokes and some things to say about the coldness of modern technology this time round. The humour does not rely on the dialogue, as there is hardly any, but it does not rely on physical humour either. Instead, the puns come from the way in which Tati sets up the shots. The mathematical precision of certain sequences, and the way that the actors are positioned within the frame, are what is amusing. The jokes are much more subtle, not hand-delivered, and therefore there should be more that can be picked up on multiple viewings. One of the funniest scenes gives a building two moving eyes, thanks to a clever set design and great lighting. The art direction is simply excellent, the music is wonderful, and the timing for every shot is just superb. Not everything is brilliant though. The continuity is a bit off at times, no thanks to some awkward jump cutting, and towards the end the jokes become a bit repetitive and tiresome. There is also little plot, but there is certainly a satisfactory amount of storyline, it being an original take on the fish-out-of-water plot line. The supporting characters are silly, but they actually benefit the film here. Characters such as the neighbour show just how out-of-touch some persons are in the technology crazed world. This film may not be for every taste, but I simply found it delightful stuff myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manifesto of a post-modern Chaplin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jacques Tati needs a statue in the movie history hall of fame. He will have it, eventually. As an actor, he created Monsieur Hulot, a sort of post-modern Chaplin, walking through the world as estranged and yet delighted, as a middle-aged ET. As a director, he did about the same thing, but added a visual brilliance, a classical sense for the absurd, and a lot of poetry.Mon oncle, My uncle, is pretty much the manifesto of his artistic raison d'etre. The uncle, Monsieur Hulot, with his timeless, almost zen-like attitude to life, is contrasted by the successful bourgeoisie family, trying so hard to shine. What happens in the movie, is simply the little everyday absurdities rising out of this meeting of contradictions.Tati makes fun of everyone, but in such a gentle and loving way, no one gets hurt. He is truly enjoying himself, when observing the little madnesses of modern man. There is no call for anyone getting really angry at anyone else.Still, there are statements, and they are provoking if pondered. Tati probably succeeded in balancing the 1950's unreserved delight in consumer gluttony, with a bit of a taoist reconsideration as to the significance of it all. Without Tati and his movies, it is quite likely that we would have taken much longer in glimpsing the futility of earthly possessions, and that which has for the last half-century been called progress.And contrary to many other movies of up to the same age, Mon oncle carries the years with just as straight a posture as the one of Monsieur Hulot. They should show this movie in the schools, so that all kids get to see it and reflect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The absurdities of human behavior... and that music score!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Tati's 'Modern times', a critical stab in the side of civilization and the changing of the times in Paris in the late 1950's... and it's absolutely delightful and disarming in its simple display of the absurdities of human behavior in relation to it. I vaguely remember watching this as a nine-year old... and 29 years down the track, it's a great realization to suddenly understand why Tati was regarded as a true movie-making artist. Watching this lovable gem of a movie is like watching a pastel painting elaborately (and slowly, so patience is required!) coming to life. Just watch that recurring shot where the crumbled brick wall borders the old-time, lively street to the new, sterile concrete apartment complex blocks. Symbolism at its best!No laugh-fest exactly, but it's loaded with charm, both heartwarming and satirical, with an attention to sets, props and character detail that's quite amazing: the opening credits... the ubiquitous dogs, the street-sweeper, the vendors, the bar guests... and most importantly: the whole household (and garden!) of Hulot's sister! And finally, what about that accordion music score? It has to be one of the best in cinema history!!8 out of 10 from Ozjeppe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The subtle world of Jacques Tati</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mon Oncle is a movie with a lot of subtle humor. You don't need subtitles as all speaks for itself. Also Monsieur Hulot only speaks when they ask for his name. It is an attack on modern times with the stupid superfluous technology that does not serve but make people crazy. Also the snobs are made ridiculous by their own technology and children, The film starts and ends with dogs. The dogs more or less are an example how man could be: free, having fun without the the obstacles of daily life they create themselves. The dogs are the winners. The children show us how adults easily can be fooled and also they always win.In most of his movies there is only one typical french soundtrack that is constantly repeated, it enhances the suggestion of being in France and part of it. The sound is separately added to the movie and has the effect your hearing is far more sensitive. This also enhances the effect of being part of it.The house with this special gravel garden is shocking modern considering the 50's the film was made. It is almost a piece of avant-garde art.Take your time to watch it. This movie is art, not just another film that rolls out of a movie factory. Tati creates his own world that shows us who we are. Tati made his masterpiece but I can understand many people will not notice all the humor that passes.Like in "Vacanses de Monsieur Hulot" and "Jour de Fete" there are so many subtle moments of humor, it is normal you will miss some.It may be "The Party" with Peter Sellers was inspired by Mon Oncle as it has the same ingredients: the modern house with technology and the snobs that own it.There is not anyone else who made films like Tati. In Europe Tati always was respected and admired for his work. Except for "Trafik" I have all films on DVD. All members of a family can watch these films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a man belonging to a dying world is sent away by his nephew's parents because he is not a good example</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tati was fascinated by the collision of modernity with a dying world he had a lot of tenderness for, full of innocence and nonchalance, unproductive, lazy and contemplative. The whole dynamic of Mon Oncle is based on that. In a beautiful frame at the beginning, we see a breached wall, an old wall, with bits of a fence in it, an old askew lamp, and that broken wall gives a view on modern buildings : big concrete cubes surrounded by a minimalist white fence, a modern street lamp standing erect in front of it. This opposition of two worlds, two aesthetics, two ways of living - gives Tati the basic material for an amazing number of inventions and clever visual twists. It ALWAYS delivers a terribly funny, generous message, full of hope in the future as much as nostalgic for the past, with innocence looking at the present. nostalgic : at one point M Hulot steps over that particular breached wall from the beginning, makes a brick fall and PUTS IT BACK in place. He wouldn't make a thing change if it were only for him. But the world moves on and so he swings along with it, nonchalant and clumsy as he is. There is no drama in a tati movie, when M Hulot is sent away at the end, "because he is a bad example for Gerard" (the nephew) he makes no fuss, just leaves and says a very french "eh oui" to his neighbour. (c'est la vie!)Yet if Tati does not condemn he comments what he sees and he is VERY attentive. In return, he expects the same from his audience, in a way that i find very similar to Kubrick's even if the comparison seems odd at first (The two directors, even though they achieved very different goals, had the same obsession for perfection and watched over every aspects of their films : directing of course, sound, settings, - plus acting for tati). Watching a Tati movie does not require to be concentrated, it requires your attention, which is different. It's talking to you in that very particular riddle-like way of old comic strips. It's a finite work that presents infinite combinations (just like a novel by Joyce), images, sound, editing, - each build their own series of gags at their own rhythm, each stream mixing with the other at unpredictable moments for explosive results. Tati is funny, witty, clever. He is not depressed. not hysterical. not morbid. Full of ideas, he's right in what he observes and light in the fashion he conveys it to you : that's why he'll make you laugh. Laugh heartily at all the people you'll recognize in the characters he draws, each of them being a bit of us.</fullReview>

But a really good tragic-comedy.I love the way Tati uses the film as a kind of anti-modernism film with "L'Oncle" being the tradition vs his family's obsession with modernity - the click-click of his sister's heels on the garden pavement in their box house and her routine of starting the fish "fountain" every time someone calls is a treat.These films should be shown more...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Arpels live in a world filled with ultra modern appliances that are all too clever to be of any real use. However, Madame Arpel's brother, Monsieur Hulot, lives in a world where a water feature and a laser-controlled garage door have no place. Hulot's world consists of horse-drawn wagons, corner stalls, and broken-down walls. When these two worlds collide, things tend to get broken. In addition, Hulot is considered to be a complete nuisance by his brother-in-law, Monsieur Arpel. Despite this, Hulot persists to enter his sister's domain, if only to marvel at an unbreakable coffeepot or to show his nephew the wondrous universe beyond his parents' electric gate.Mon Oncle is a remarkable example of cinema and well deserved its Oscar for best foreign language film in 1959. Even though there is not much language in this movie, the little dialogue that is here is quite clipped and inconsequential. But this does not matter, as the true genius of Mon Oncle is in its visuality. There is a rich use of colour in this film, as each scene is put together beautifully. Be it the minimalist visions enhanced by the odd flash of vibrant colour within the Arpel's technologically advanced "Maison," or the autumn colours that gloriously clutter the landscape surrounding Monsieur Hulot's home, the visuals are exquisite. Mon Oncle is very much a visual masterpiece. Yet, that is not all it has to offer, as most of the jokes use not language, but sound, to heighten the impact of the comedy. Never before or since has the loud "clickety-click" of high heels or the gong of someone inadvertently walking into a lamppost been enough to make you howl with laughter! Hulot is the creation of the movie's director and star, Jacques Tati, and Mon Oncle is not his only adventure. Each of his other films depicts a similar style. And, with this character, Tati reignites and modernises a genre of comedy that would have probably died away with the talkies.Tati brings Hulot alive, through his attention to detail in his direction and in the delightfulness of his performance. This is a film that will enchant its audience. And, fans of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin should revere Jaques Tati, as the greatest, "almost," silent comedian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the worst Best Foreign Film Oscar winner of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OVERRATED "ART FILM" ALERT: The following film is adored by sophisticated and "with it" film fans. The fact that the average person may find the whole thing unfunny and bland is due to their just not being smart enough to understand and appreciate this masterpiece.Maybe this played a lot better in 1958, but I simply hated this long and slow and totally uninteresting film. While I have never been a fan of Hulot films, I do love international cinema (particularly French), so you can't blame me for being xenophobic or too "plebian to get it". It's just bad and about as funny as watching paint dry and I refuse to join the drones who praise it just because it received an Oscar.Like other Hulot films, the movie is similar to episodes of Mr. Bean--but without the humor or feeling any connection to the main character. I love the Bean TV show and can appreciate this style of humor--it's just that, unlike many Frenchmen, I really think Jacques Tati wasn't at all funny and his Hulot character was vapid--plus the story developed so slowly that I found myself frustrated because the payoff never came close meriting the excruciatingly long wait. I know these are VERY harsh words, but I watched this film with two others and none of us laughed and we all hated the film. I've also seen several other Tati films and just can't understand all the attention his films receive. They are NOT in the same league as Chaplin despite me hearing this repeatedly and it's an insult to Chaplin's name to compare them.The basic plot (and, frankly, there was almost no plot) consisted of Hulot visiting his sister and brother-in-law in their ultra-modern home as well as all the boring and mundane things happen to him along the way. I guess we were supposed to laugh at how silly this home was and how uncomfortable all their furniture was--I just didn't get it--THIS was the basis for a movie lasting more than two hours?! In many ways, this reminded me of another terribly unfunny comedy, CRACKING UP, when Jerry Lewis spent much of the film slipping on modern floors and off of modern furniture. It really was tiresome.If you DO want to see an ultra-pretentious film that most normal people would hate, then this is your movie. Dull, dull and dismally dull from start to finish. This is not movie magic--and it looks like someone's dull home movies. I have a hard enough time enjoying home movies of people I know and love--so why would I ever want to see this?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The tender Tati's humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great director Jacques Tati gives us a film in which the machinery, the misuse of technology, the supposed modernity, and so act as key drivers of the alienation of the characters. It's very clear distinction between the two neighborhoods. In one live "Monsieur Hulot", where everybody talks, discusses ... a neighborhood alive. On the other lives his sister and her husband, a cold house, at times even has a spaceship ... And through his nephew, who clearly opts for the uncle, who is with finding happiness.Tati's genius director shows us the simple life of the neighborhood, where "Mon Oncle" is the film noises, noises that accompany the progress of technology, of course, unbearable noise, and are given in the house Gerard's parents and the factory. It is also the film "Monsieur Hulot" going by bike or by horse drawn carriage, with its catchy jingle, puppies running around, people, market and ... children.This film gets to the heart by its tender, the manners of a world now defunct neighborhood .. y. longed-for those vacant lots in ruins and over the neighborhood so quaint, and a dazzling use of objects and colour. Tenderness finds us as "Gerard" with his hand finds the hand of his uncle, with complicity. It's a good movie that will endure time.The humor of "Mon Oncle" is a great humor, and for any movie lover, it is essential to know the mood of Tati in "Mon Oncle".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my new favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw and loved the movie MON ONCLE. Many people might be put off by this movie because it's French, or made in 1958 by Tati, but screw 'em. It's the most beautiful social criticism of Le Corbusier's Machine for Living, and it's funny to boot.The set up is a sweet quiet guy, the Oncle, lives in a small town on the square. The town is traditional old world, vibrant, noisy, fun and a little dirty. His sister, married to a successful businessman lives just outside town in a huge, immaculate, ultra modern home filled with labor saving devices and starkly furnished. The sister has a young son, the nephew of Mon Oncle. The movie plays with the tensions between the old world town and the ultra modern suburb.Its shockingly prescient. Plastics are big business, cars dominant the landscape and force people to the margins. The people who live in giant antiseptic homes have little sense of humor or awareness of themselves-except materialistically. The town dwellers are more fun, maybe cuz they aren't always vacuuming and they hang out in cafés. But enough with the critical thinking, this movie is FUNNY.The way Tim Burton's BEETLEJUICE visually skewered modernism, drew heavily from MON ONCLE. Some of the uncomfortable chair gags are almost identical. There's very little dialog and many scenes, like the dogs romping thru town on their own adventures reminded me of the some of the shorts SESAME STREET used to show or Buster Keaton flicks. The masterful situation and prop humor reminded me of the best work of the 3 Stooges or Jerry Lewis with the volume set on mute.The movie is also a visual stunner, Tati could really frame a scene. The opening credits are groundbreaking and have inspired MANY movies since, including Apocalypse NOW. The modern home and it's furnishings have the "shock of the new" almost 50 yrs later.The only folks I wouldn't recommend this movie to are McMansion dwellers committed to the superiority of the suburbs. Everybody else needs to see this, seriously, you'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When viewing Tati's body of work, Mon Oncle is always the major focus. Not only is it the funniest of his films, it is also his most balanced and well developed work.Preceding films, while excellent in their way - Les Vacances de M. Hulot is a wonderful, gentle, observation of a holiday weekend - suffered from a lack of money or equipment. Later films were sadly tainted by the demands of mainstream film. Tati loved early Hollywood - especially Buster Keaton - and it was this simplicity he wished to bring back to film.With Mon Oncle, Tati for the first time has all he needed at his disposal, and the result is nothing short of wondrous. Superbly filmed, beautifully directed, great cinematography (though some might complain about the extensive use of long shots in this era of the close-up).If you have a chance, see it. If you have a chance to see it in a cinema, definitely see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say about a genius? That Tati was so funny his material was still funny after Benny Hill ripped it off. That Tati was so funny that his material was still funny after Jerry Lewis ripped it off. Mon Oncle often takes on the look of old home movies with static shot after static shot. It's the action in the frame that takes the film beyond cinema and into genius. Watch the wife complete her husbands outfit in the morning, just a camera on a tripod but hilarious. I think the funniest scene in the whole movie comes early on when a small dog growls at Hulot's grocery purchase. I also love the secretary whose dress is so tight she can't walk.Tati as everyman trying to find his way in the modern world plays it straight as he bumbles everything up at his brothers factory. Make no mistake this film is about technology and mankind's inability to control it. But it's also a film about life in Paris after the war and how the new generation is leaving the old behind. Shiny new American cars outnumber the horse drawn wagon but haven't quite replaced it yet. Shiny new houses and office towers replace the city tenement blocks with their ramshackle floors built on top of each other. The old Paris is beginning to disappear and the new is just sliding in. That it's a comedy is obvious but strip away the laughter and you get a documentary about change.</fullReview>

I know many people who swear by this film and its a winner of numerous awards and yet I'm left scratching my head.The plot is simple, Jaques Tati's Mr Hulot tries to come to terms with a changing world as exemplified by his sisters family who lives in a modern home with all of the latest gadgets. In its way its what happens after Mr Hulot gets back from his vacation. (see Mr Hulot's Holiday)The film is a series of loosely connected bits as we see the family and what they go through and how the basically pastoral Hulot deals with all the modern push button conveniences.Coming as I am late to seeing the films of Tati after having read about them for years I wasn't sure what to expect. It was only several months ago that I finally say Mr Hulot's Holiday and fell in love with it and its style. Based on that I picked up Mon Oncle. I finally sat down to watch it, after reading a Tati biography in the interim and was greatly disappointed.I think part of the problem is that the film is very leisurely. It takes a while to set up a gag indeed several sequences seem to have no point only to have a pay off later in the film, if at all. Yes, they generate laughs but there aren't enough of them.Worse there is a great deal of repetition in the film. Several times we watch as Hulot goes up to and down from his roof top apartment, we watch the whole trip and even allowing for the slight variation of the people he encounters it gets monotonous. There are instances where we get repeated actions, the fountain gags for example, that are kept to the for front each time they occur even though they could be pushed to one side. Its too much of the same thing.There are laughs. Much of the first half hour, when most of the jokes are new, is very funny, as is the garden party, the "sausages", and the old man attempting to cross the street towards the end. It can be a very enjoyable romp.Regrettably I don't think this is the be all and end all that some people feel it is. Granted if its like all of Tati's other films a second viewing might reveal it to be much funnier and better than first thought. However as it stands now I find it to be a funny but very over rated comedy.Rent it before you decide to buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here Jacques Tati plays the famous bumbling Monsieur Hulot who has some silly adventures at a factory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amusing and lively movie with enjoyable humor in which Hulot is back again in this slapstick and splendid comedy . The second of Tati's cinematic romps in which lovable Mr. Hulot (the first was ¨Mr Hulot's holiday¨ in which to be found in vacationing at a holiday seaside resort) , Tati's recurrent of the common person confronted with increasingly mechanized and depersonalized society where he accidentally originates destruction , disaster and catastrophic events . This time around , the botcher but beloved Hulot is taken under the wing of his oh-so-chic in-laws , -Jean Pierre Zola- , who live in a futuristic suburban mansion dominated by every conceivable form of embarrassing electronic gadgets . Needles to say , Hulot's old world mentally can not adapt to this strange new environment and the result are , to put it mildly , horrific . As Mr Hulot is back again in this surprising comedy , as he attempts to keep in a sterile as well a bizarre house but all of its objects , furniture , fountain , garden , automobiles , garage seem to conspire to thwart him at every turn . Furthermore , Tati's bicycle does a fine job in a major supporting role . This delightfully lighthearted is plentiful of original sketches and fine sentiment . From the beginning to the end the good humor and bland comedy are continued . The film blends tongue-in-cheek , irony , giggles , joy , jokes , social critical and is pretty bemusing and entertaining . In spite of being occasionally disorientated and runtime is overlong , the run is about two hours , isn't boring neither tiring , but funny . The gentle humor developed in the film is clever and thoughtful and the comical numbers vary between slapstick and surrealist . The plot is plain and simple , about the natural natural comedy to be found in factory , home and meeting between Hulot and his nephew . Although partially dubbed , this movie has a mime quality that is marvelous and magical . Jacques Tati is extraordinary as Mister Hulot , this remains one of Tati's most rewarding movies , an universally appealing blend of satire , social critique and good feeling . The great Tati is top-notch with his slapstick and continuous botchers which lead to some really fun moments . Direction and interpretation by Jacques Tati is magnificent and wonderful . Alain Romain's score -Tati's habitual musician- is agreeable and cheerful . The motion picture received awesome reviews and deserves the complete knowledge because there are amount chuckles and entertainment . It is also the only Tati picture to win the Academy Award for best foreign movie . The flick was stunningly directed by Tati who also made other masterpieces , such as : ¨Jour De Fete¨ , ¨Playtime¨ , Traffic¨, and ¨Parade¨ . All of them plenty of visual gags and situations worthy of the great silence comedians and the viewing is more than enough to provide lots of laughs . The picture is nowadays considered a European cult film .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film many years ago while on vacation in Palm Springs. I thought it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I went into hysterics during some scenes. There's sheer artistry at work here. I'd never heard of Tati and his films before. So I didn't know what to expect. And boy, did he deliver! I've always liked subtle humor, as I think it takes so much more talent and wit than loud, pompous and aggressive comedians. And it requires an intelligent and perceptive audience. An American comedian who comes to mind was Ernie Kovacs (1919-1962). If you think Jim Carrey does great comedy, you'll probably NOT like this movie. This is NOT over-the-top comedy; it's under-the-top humor. Either you GET it, or you don't. I sure did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great use of a set.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie with the best use of a set I've seen in a long time, and some of the best use of music. The film is the contrast of post-World War II France with its pre-war glory. M. Hulot lives in the old France, in a house in a neighborhood. It's full of people, life is lived and loved on the street, and the music is marvelous. His sister and brother-in-law have become Americanized (even having an American car). Their streets are empty, no houses visible behind the barricades with electric gates. There is no music, only the staccato tattoo of Madame Arpel's heels on the concrete floor. The director uses M. Hulot's house to the fullest, and I encourage watching all the scenes with some attention, as Jacques Tati (who plays Hulot) is a master at his craft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the gentle world of Jacques Tati</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing a Jacques Tati movie again is like visiting old friends: absence makes the heart grow fonder. As the awkward and innocent Mr. Hulot, Tati faces the complexities of modern life with absentminded detachment, never noticing how out of step he is from the rest of the world. He is, as his sister explains in the film, "vague", but it's precisely this air of agreeable confusion that appeals to his young nephew, who prefers the comforts of his uncle's ramshackle, traditional neighborhood over his own mechanized, sanitized, "all-communicating" house.And where Hulot goes, havoc follows?through no fault of his own. Tati's bumbling comic alter-ego is too passive and benign to instigate anything resembling trouble, but he nevertheless manages to leave a trail of painless mayhem in his wake. Hulot is more a plaything of fate, in much the same way as Buster Keaton but on a more recognizably human level. And through him Tati was an astute, impartial observer of social idiosyncrasies, mocking our habits as gently as he mourned the passing of our traditions.Some of the jokes are so casual they almost pass unnoticed, but each one has been painstakingly constructed and rehearsed, from the lightest chuckle to the largest belly laugh. In a brief but telling episode Hulot dislodges a small stone from the already crumbling wall separating the old neighborhood from the new, and with hardly a pause reaches down, embarrassed, to needlessly replace the loose chip.The moment is over in an instant, but shows the subtlety with which Tati arranged every detail of his films. For Tati, inspiration was the result of long planning and hard work, and the effort here won him (deservedly so) an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old world gentleman thrust into futuristic dwelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mon Oncle is about Hulot, an old fashioned gentleman who lives in a bustling old world town. His lively neighborhood is sharply contrasted with the cold, futuristic home his sister lives in with her husband and son. There is practically no exposure to the outside world within the gated courtyard of Hulot's relatives, just the organized efficiency of technological gadgets. The boy can't stand his lifeless surroundings so it's only natural that he prefers to run off with his uncle instead of playing with the expensive toys his father gives him.Hulot's sister isn't satisfied with his impoverished bachelor's lifestyle but her attempts to change it go terribly wrong as the jobs she tries to place him into are in a world of mechanized production (of plastics no less) that he isn't equipped to deal with and the neighbor woman she tries to set him up with is ensconced in a lifestyle even less hospitable than the modern factories. Eventually Hulot's humanity proves to be indomitable and his family finds itself adapting to his needs since he can't be adapted to theirs.At 115 minutes the mostly plot less Mon Oncle proves to be slight and overlong in spite of the general likability of the protagonist. For a film that is ostensibly a comedy the humor is too subtle to keep the film interesting for its entire running time. Still, the soundtrack is delightful and there is enough charm in Mon Oncle to make it a worthwhile experience for patient viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece in a trifle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jacques Tati hails from a small group of super auteuristic filmmakers that includes names from all over the developed world. Few would think to put him in the same category as the likes of Kubrick, Kurosawa or Lynch, but this is an err created by the vortex of commercial culture, not the quality of the work itself. And just a reminder that all Tati movies survive today as part of a resurrection bestowed upon him by admirers within the established film community. The center of this disparity between amateur and professional opinions lies on the single factor of attention to detail. But we all know that subtlety is not the way of the riff-raff.Where is the subtlety? Why, it's in the soup. Mon Oncle features a different style of story-telling in which we are not hit over the head with the details of the plot. But a plot there still is except the central dynamic character is not a traditional character but the setting of Paris. Once you recognize this, you'd see accordingly, the multifarious set elements and caricatures that shape this character. Only then, will you gain unfettered access to the cornucopia that is Tati's vision.In summary, this story is about the silly plight of a much too likable Mr. Hulot lost in an equally charming city bent on embracing the inevitably machinations of modernity. The real joy is noting ALL of the caricature elements and see its beauty in and of itself. Mon Oncle brings to mind, for me, childish emanations of a Where's Waldo type world and that's exactly it. There is light humour throughout but neither sex nor violence.If this just isn't enough for you, no worries, it means you're an adult. Particularly of similar ilk as the G.F. Babbitt incarnations in that ultra modern home.Keynote points: the street sweeper that never actually sweeps, the dog walker that get walked by his dog, and the pastry vendors that repeated wipes his filthy hands on his even-filthier apron, and much much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And now, more than ever, this gentle rebuke is needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here Jacques Tati tries to show by his gentle satire how de-humanised we are becoming (and this was half a century ago!). The passion with which people hurl themselves into 'the new', at the price of their souls, the glee with which the patina of the ages is scraped by the sandpaper of market forces from the surface of our lives, is here shown for the mindless vandalism it is. Tati shows how his sister in the story, devoted to him though she is, is a vandal of all that he holds dears about life. Her twee idolatry of mechanical gadgets, her worship of the fashionable, and her social enslavement to the opinions of others, render her a threat to the world. Tati tries to save his nephew from this moral corruption in his bumbling way. Gag after gag expose the hollowness of the mad world of affluence. Tati 'goes his way', breaking things, tripping over things, embarrassing everybody, making a mess. But it is the unplanned and truly precious mess of real life, of the natural way of living, that is the subject of Tati's Ode. Tati is a charmed fool, an innocent, because he cannot be contaminated. He is a kind of idiot savant, and the temptations of the banal cannot reach him. There are some wonderfully funny moments in this film, but its humour is more generally diffused throughout as a kind of pervasive glow. It is another Tati classic, to be savoured by those who do not have to rush off, but instead are prepared to share 'moments of being' at the pace of pre-modern existence with this man who would rather be thought stupid than be corrupted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leisurely Viewing - But Charming and Delightful !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is true that this film can be difficult to view in a single sitting. Don't expect fireworks or fast-cut editing. But pleasures increase with subsequent viewings.The first time I borrowed it, I only got through the first half hour. I borrowed it again, not remembering I had already tried it, but immediately recognized the house and the fish fountain. The second time I could only get through the first hour! But this is a film I would love to own and go back to again and again!It's gorgeous to look at, the colors and production values; it really does have a timeless look. One minor example is the scene where Hulot sneaks back to the house in the dead of night, and the "eyes" of the house follow him out! Simple, but brilliant. The soundtrack is gorgeous, with jazz representing the modern world and traditional French music for Monsieur Hulot's world.There isn't much in the way of plot or character development- it's more just a slice of life. But I love some of the minor characters, like the street sweeper who just sweeps the garbage into piles, but never actually picks any of it up. And the female teenage neighbor, who offers Hulot sweets. She definitely has feelings for him!On the Criterion DVD, also check out the 1947 short L'Ecole des Facteurs. Tati plays a rural postman, which he would later develop into Jour de Fete. There's a couple of great scenes where he joins some dancers in a local pub, and also delivering the mail on his bicycle, he leads a group of professional "tour de France" cyclists.</fullReview>

From the moment we are "buzzed" into the coldhome of Hulot's sister and her family we are privy to the little pretensions our hostess employs to impress her neighbors. A gurgling fish-shaped fountain isonly turned on when company comes (not included is Mr. Hulot, theprotagonist). At every turn the viewer can savor the contrast between thissmall rustic French town and those striving to live out the modern dream life. From factory to home every nuance is gently ridiculed.

		<shortDescription>The Second Coming Of Mr. Hulot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`My Uncle' is that rare case in movies where a sequel bests its predecessor. In `Mr. Hulot's Holiday,' Tati took us away from the hustle and bustle of city living for a week's holiday by the sea. In `My Uncle,' he takes us through the rigors of daily living, and introduces us to his family. We learn he has a sister, Mrs. Arpel (Adrienne Servantie), whose husband (Jean-Pierre Zola) is an upper level manager at a plastics factory. Their son, Jimmy (Alain Becourt), is a boy who never seems to enjoy anything at home unless his uncle is visiting. There is a very simple reason for that. Uncle Hulot spends time playing with Jimmy. His sister, though, is concerned that her brother has never made time to set goals for himself. Mrs. Arpel suggests that her husband find a job for Hulot at the factory. Mr. Arpel does, but Hulot, who is a step or two behind the times, has trouble adjusting.Hulot's life is far less modern and, apparently, much happier. He still owns a horse-drawn carriage, which makes him a hit at Jimmy's school. He also has a bike, which he rides to work every day. Much to the chagrin of Mr. Arpel, Hulot parks his bike in a car parking space. Mr. Arpel gets his brother-in-law a desk job as a production supervisor at the factory. However, he has his desk right by the production line, and the plastic fumes make him drowsy. His attempts to correct the problem make Hulot - and Arpel - the laughingstock of the company. Arpel has put his good name on the line for Hulot, and Arpel is determined to make sure his name remains in good standing.The story is only a small part of `My Uncle.' It's also a spectacle of sound and vision. Tati uses a lot of long shots to maximize the comedy of each frame. For example, he shows us the Arpels' neighbor, mowing her lawn with a pedal-powered grass cutting cart. She may be able to sit and steer her way around the yard, but she pedals so hard, she would be better off walking with a standard grass cutter. Whenever someone walks on the concrete at these homes or at the factory, they make a hollow sound. In this movie, we see a lot of the so-called modern conveniences are, in fact, aesthetic and ergonomic nightmares. The Arpels' home looks like a life-size version of Kenner Toys structures I used to make. In other words, it looks real, but doesn't seem quite normal. Also, all of the colors in the house (and the factory) look drab and practically lifeless. The dining table is small, and the chairs are mostly metal, with just a touch of cushion. The setting does not seem conducive to a nice family meal. A nice meal proves impossible when the Arpels invite guests. Hulot is so confused by his sister's concept of a couch, he turns it on its side and uses it for a bed when he spends the evening babysitting Jimmy. The Arpels' fountain is the most outlandish of the family luxuries is the fountain - a fish shooting water from its mouth. Hulot doesn't understand the attraction of his sister's things, but he sees that these things seem to make her happy.Tati, who was a skilled pantomime, does not show a range of reactions as the easy-going Mr. Hulot. His facial expression, as well as any other motion, is very precise. He is always very polite to everyone he knows, and even takes the time to play with the Arpels' dog when he inadvertently follows his master to work. It's not that work isn't important to Hulot. It's just that humanity is, too, and no time clock will tell him it isn't. The Arpels want him to be more goal-oriented. They even suggest with one another that he should have a home like they have, complete with every electrical gadget that has been invented. Hulot is very content with the place he has, a third story flat where he has to walk by every apartment to get to his place. He has set his goals to his standards, and would be lost if he tried to be someone he isn't.Most of the laughs in `My Uncle' are as easy-going as Hulot himself. My favorite happens when he is introduced to the concept of a car lighter when he can't light his pipe with his matches. The one hard laugh I had comes after Hulot has reset the plastic machine. Another manager, who is giving a visiting businessman a tour of the facility, notices a part of the result on the floor. He quickly scoops up the rejected plastic, stuffs it in his suit coat, and continues the tour without missing a beat. Tati's main focus was on the gentle and natural comedy man creates in his daily life. For his efforts, Tati won an Oscar for the best foreign language film of 1958.`My Uncle,' however, is not the best entry in Hulot series. That would come with the next Hulot film, `Playtime,' which came nine years later. In `My Uncle,' Tati acknowledges the world will change, and it's up to each person to decide if the change is for the better. Mr. Hulot understands that concept, but he is quite content with the things that he already has. `My Uncle' is a comic clash of quiet proportions. After all, Hulot realizes the world does not revolve around him. He's just trying to be Mr. Hulot, a good uncle, brother, and person. The rest of the world has to search for its own happiness. It would also be nice, according to the film, to always have a place where dogs can run and play.(As a side note, I have not made a mistake in identifying the Becourt character as Jimmy. That is the name he is given on the mainly English language version of `My Uncle,' which I purchased from Movies Unlimited over a decade ago. The version you see, though, may be different from the one I have seen.)</fullReview>

Both involve a man who comes from a very "unmodern" place to find themselves out of place in a very strange "modern" world. There are many almost parallel scenes and it makes me wonder if the writers of Edward Scissorhands received inspiration from Mon Oncle. I don't see how they could not have. Comparisons aside though, this film should be required viewing for everybody. It's timeless and hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrelenting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Mon Oncle' is the standard Tati film. It has one obsessive theme (modernism is inhuman) and no story arc. Each gag lasts less than minute and then we're on to the next 120 atomized gags. Consequently once it starts, a viewer has no prayer of knowing if there is ten minutes left or an hour. Every moment is pretty much the same; an infinite sequence of episodic gags in which no point receives emphasis, makes it nearly impossible to watch in a single sitting. He can take a gag and riff on it longer than one thought humanly possible, as eons transpire between some excruciating set up and it's payoff. Tati wrings a scene for every conceivable gag until he's filled his catalog with duds; then he can move on. It's all sight-gags, shot in oversimplified tableaux, with the action front and center, and nothing else going on.Tati hasn't solved the basic problem he's made for himself; why would anyone watch all the movie when it's clear it's not building and a viewer can tune out for 40, 80, 100 gags, but come back and have missed nothing crucial. Mon Oncle never gets moving. Tati's desire to be the mid-century Chaplin is displayed in characteristic, long stretches of silence and perfunctory, tedious scripts. He simply cannot be swayed from the belief that only visuals and set-pieces are funny. Any dialogue becomes a utilitarian means to get from point A to point B. He refuses to let a single verbal exchange be memorable or get a laugh. Mon Oncle is just brutal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mon Oncle (1958- Jacques Tati) Mon Oncle, much like other Tati films, is about Monsieur Hulot and his struggles with the industrialized and modern society. Tati, with his trademark Hulot character is much like the silent era comedians, not only because he barely talks but also because of his simplicity and innocence. He is dazed and confused by the modern world (in a scene he literally escapes from her sister's place after dropping his nephew) and prefers his own old-fashioned neighborhood. In fact there is even a visual line between the modern world and Hulot's own neighborhood (the old world!) that is the wreckage of a break wall with a couple of tall buildings far back in the background (the break wall representing the old world and buildings the modern world) and every time Hulot wants to go to the modern part of the city (whether to go to his sister's or to go to the factory etc.) he passes through there. Gray, silver and blue are the dominating colors in the modern world (in contrast to the warmer colors of Hulot's neighborhood) and modern architecture , minimalist decors and complicated machines are everywhere whereas on the other side Hulot reflects sunlight on a bird when he wants to listen to music at his apartment! Hulot's brother-in-law owns (or works in) a plastic factory and they constantly tell their friends that plastic has been used in different parts of their home. When Hulot goes to work in the factory he goofs up the first day and makes plastic pipes which look like sausage! Plastic is another representation of the modern world with which Hulot cannot cope. Everything in the modern part of the city is highly stylized. Hulot's sister and her friends and family are very pretentious and they act stylized and unnatural. In a scene during the party when they want to move the chairs to another spot, they precisely follow the designated and paved path and are careful not to step on the space between the blocks. Hulot doesn't communicate much with the people at the party (or elsewhere!). He seems to prefer the childish simplicity of his nephew and we see him spending most of his free time with him. In the end when Hulot (the symbol of the old, conventional world) is leaving his neighborhood, we see that the buildings are being wrecked; the modern world is taking over! Tati's comedy is a rare example of visual comedy in cinema with clever uses of mise-en-scene. Something that is very refreshing to watch for all of us who have been accustomed to the verbal (and mostly vulgar!) comedies of Hollywood. In a scene where Hulot's sister is showing their neighbor to her husband from the window, we get a long shot from them from outside of the building and it's as if their heads are the houses pupils and the windows are its glasses! The same joke recurs when Hulot is sneaking in to their house at night. He makes a noise and suddenly 2 heads with black hair pop up from the window and again look like the houses pupils. To reinforce the idea, they simultaneously and in the same direction, much like human eye does. The visual gags are made possible through Tati's combination of long takes and long shots with fixed camera that lets the spectator choose what he wants to see from the -usually- multiple actions that are happening at the same time in the scene. The scenes like the part in this film or the restaurant in Playtime are perfect examples of Tati's precise choreography combined with a camera work that gives you the freedom to choose want you want to see. Tati's most interesting use of formal elements is probably with sound. "I pitch dialogue at the level of ambient sounds" he said, "like the way you hear them in a supermarket or train station". He defies what Chion called Vococentrism, for him dialogue is just a sound like any other sound. Instead of dialogue he heavily relied on sound effects and made one of the most interesting uses of them in film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chaplin, Keaton, Jerry Lewis, Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean?. We know all of these characters, but what of Hulot? The French pantomime from the wonderful imagination of Jacques Tati. Not to say that slapstick comedy hadn't existed or flourished already under the world of Chaplin, but Tati offered a unique, intimate, and really gentle version of it. That is to say, he combines it with the principles of Italian Neorealism. It's Micro-Slapstick, as I would call it. A combination of real life, silly and sublime, is what Tati is striving to look for. No film of his better exemplifies this idea than Tati's first color picture "Mon Oncle". It's a series of long-form skits, filled with very humorous micro-actions and very foolish behavior on behalf of Hulot and the entire set of goof-ball players. The story simply tells of Hulot, down on his luck, crashing at his sister's place in order to find a job in a new city. What follows is comedy of errors. As we know, Hulot can't help himself, and his na?ve curiosity leads him into some embarrassing and outrageous situations. But tomfoolery is gracefully done by all of the actors and the director himself. It's a ballet of sorts. Take for instance a scene where Hulot accidentally block the flow of water to the strange fish-shaped fountain in his sister's front lawn, during a lavish dinner party. For about ten minutes or so, we see the event unfold, in a long shot, as we are guided through the step-by-step process of fixing the problem. Hulot tries to stick his foot back onto the hole, which works temporarily, but he can't just keep his foot there! After a while of strange problem solving, Hulot runs off, and leaves the patrons of the dinner party to deal with the problem themselves. What follows is another series of embarrassing problem solving, this time revolving around people who don't have a clue as to how the situation happened in the first place. Every last action is as monotonous, strange and silly as a predicament like this would play out in real life. Tati allows us to appreciate the simple fact of life, that when things go bad, they tend to go worse over time. What about the gentle side of the picture? Can it be just mishaps, or is there truly a heart to the picture? Well there certainly is, and it even begins at the very beginning. The film opens and ends with a group of puppy dogs frolicking around the French city of which the film takes place. As adorable as that is, it's a reassurance that where Tati is taking us is a happy little place. The spirit from the very beginning is just plain fun. All of the jokes and gags that the film offers us definitely exist along the lines of laughing with the performers, not at them. It's just plain fun to embark on some mischief. Take for instance, the scene where the little kids of the town gamble to see how many townspeople knock into a lamppost. It's hilarious, in that classic child prankster way, and definitely as harmless as they come. The parents all blame Hulot for influencing the trouble, but Hulot doesn't care, for he and boys are having way too much fun. It all cultivates near the end of picture, when he gather up the boys in order to dispose of a clump of rubber hoses that he accidentally made at the factory. Hulot and boys throw the big pile off of a bridge, into the water, and scare a teenage couple down below into thinking that a suicide had taken place. The boys and Hulot run off in their wagon, and sing songs all the way home. There's such an innocence to these actions, and reminds us greatly about the simplicity of childhood. Hulot is a little kid at heart, and much to the parents with whom he is living with; the careless fun eventually rubs off them. Through a series of pantomimes, gestures and other events, Tati creates a beautiful world of childhood wonder, and that is what makes the film "Mon Oncle" unlike any slapstick comedy ever since. It's the child at heart that Tati was able to capture in all of us through his titular character Hulot, and through his films, we'd all like to be like those puppy dogs, and scamper about the streets of France, looking for fun at every turn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mon Oncle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew about this French film when I saw it listed in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, I knew the title translated was "My Uncle", and I later found out it was the follow up to Monsieur Hulot's Holiday, from returning director Jacques Tati (Playtime). Basically Monsieur Hulot (Jacques Tati) is the adored uncle of nine year old Gerard Arpel (Alain Bécourt), the nephew lives with his parents Charles (Jean-Pierre Zola) and Madame Arpel (Adrienne Servantie) in an automated and convenience filled ultra-modern house, which includes a fish fountain in the yard that must be turned on whenever important guests visit. Monsieur Hulot meanwhile lives in a smallish flat in an old building in an old neighbourhood, it may not be high in standard, but Gerard prefers to spend more time there, as her own house is not all that child friendly, the Arpels may be trying to mold M. Hulot more into the person they are used to in the upper class world. Charles offers his brother-in-law a job in the factory where plastics are manufactured, and Madame Arpel hosts a garden party, inviting him and trying to impress a few guests with her fountain and impressive home, but the bumbling nature of M. Hulot causes problems for their plan, but he may in fact help them in some way. Also starring Lucien Frégis as Monsieur Pichard Betty Schneider as Betty, Landlord's Daughter, Yvonne Arnaud as Georgette, the Housekeeper, Dominique Marie as Neighbour, Jean-François Martial as Walter and Adelaide Danieli as Madame Pichard. I will be honest and say that I didn't see much of a story going on, but I know that Tati gave a good performance as the nice guy that is clumsy, I did giggle at the obvious moments, like the water fountain being meddled with, and the luxurious setting looked cool and colourful, so it is a fun and watchable satirical comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mon Oncle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The house in which Mr. Hulot's sister with her husband and son live is probably the central character of the film Mon Oncle. The house is a modern and complicated one, you get everything at the push of a button and yet it is very difficult to live. It is a puzzle not only for out of place Mr. Hulot but also for his sister and her husband, the owners of the house. They don't get to hear each other because of the sound of machine, and they learn to cope with it. There are number of things that can go wrong at any time, the decorated trees, the fountain, the kitchen, the garage, the car, the garden, the gate ? anything, yet these are impossible to live without.Mr. Hulot himself is the most amusing among all of them. Throughout the film he doesn't utter a single word though seems to say a lot of things with his gestures. He looks very odd in his behavior, and always a misfit, be it in the house or in the workplace. But he is a completely unflappable person, nothing really matters to him. He is devoid of any human emotion. In fact, in some ways all the characters in the film are like dolls, it seems that nothing of this world can touch, move, alter or affect them.The film doesn't have a coherent story to tell, it's about bits and pieces put up together, mostly underlining its central theme of little everyday absurdities rising out of the meeting of contradictions. There are number of characters here and there, the street dogs, the kids, the factory, the school, the sweeper, the shopkeeper and so on and so forth with a little touch of mischief and amusement revolving around all of them.Mon Oncle has striking similarities with Modern Times and Jacques Tati with Charles Chaplin. The first similarity is off course the subject of the film. Second, Mon Oncle should be considered more or less a silent film that has music throughout like Chaplin films (though it has some dialog in it, but one feels nothing would have hampered without it). Third, in simple treatment of camera, and last but not the least, like Chaplin, Tati is also star/director/co-writer and producer of his project. There is probably one difference though. There are numerous scenes in a film like Modern Times that would make us burst out in laughter, but in Mon Oncle it is not so. There is not a moment which makes you burst out in laughter. What it does is something different, it holds you throughout, it amuses you and while watching you always find yourself with a quiet grin on your face. I have seen only two films of Tati (Playtime and Mon Oncle) and it seems to me that both of them could be a bit shorter in length. Probably that's the only negative criticism I have against him.There are number of reasons for which one must see Mon Oncle. It has got amazing sets, stunning lighting, and admirable use of color. It has jovial use of sound and music and brilliant cinematography. Mon Oncle is one timeless classic that can be seen time and time again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My uncle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Hulot (director Tati) lives in an old-fashioned and disorganized neighbourhood where people still travel by horse and cart and dogs can roam free on the streets. He frequently pays visits to his sister's family, the Arpels, who live in an ultra-modern urban house where everything is geometrical, empty and pretty uninhabitable. The family's young son Gérard (Alain Bécourt) likes Hulot, but the parents (Jean-Pierre Zola and Adrienne Servantie) insist his carefree lifestyle is not acceptable and try to hook him up with their uptight neighbour (Dominique Marie) and get him a job at a plastic factory, with catastrophic consequences.The comedic genre allows delicious exaggeration of the contrast between the two neighbourhoods. The pacing is slow and the long runtime allows a lot of focus to be put on small details that are often ignored as self-evident: the complexity of modern kitchen appliances, the tap-walking secretary at the factory, the stepping stones on the Arpels' yard, the pedalled lawnmower, the "eyes" of the house... On the other hand, the antics of Gérard's friends in Hulots's neighbourhood are presented as joyful and unpredictable, like tricking passers-by to walk into lampposts or enjoying the aftermaths of fender-benders that never really happened after all. Hulot and the other adults also have time to enjoy themselves by sitting in cafés and chatting with the easily distracted street cleaner.Even though there is a lot of dialogue in some scenes, Hulot stays silent throughout and maintains an unhurried attitude which is the best way to approach the film too. The sets, music, sound effects, props and other details are all carefully designed to fit the style and provide plenty to enjoy for a viewer that doesn't expect to be force-fed jokes every second. Even though at almost two hours Mon oncle may feel unnecessarily long at points, it is ultimately a rewarding experience. Personally I like it more than Mr. Hulot's Holiday (1953), so I recommend giving it a chance even if you're not sure if Tati's calm style is for you. Fans of Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean character may also want to check the film out, as Tati's influence on Bean is immense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tati meets the future, and he doesn't like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this classic movie from 1958, Tati plays his usual character Mr. Hulot. He lives in an old, rundown part of town, while her sister, married to the manager of a plastics factory, has a shiny futuristic house in the suburbs, with a lot of goofy gadgets. (Of course, what was presumed to be the future in the 50s wasn't always what it turned out to be, and that sort of retro futurism is fun). The movie has very little dialogue, a silent-movie like musical score, and a number of gags involving Hulot being utterly confused by the modern gadgets in her sister's house (though, to be fair, few of those gags are laugh-out-loud funny). Actually, what I found even more fascinating than the retro futurism in Mon Oncle, watching it now, is the look of the old part of town where Hulot lives (we see the France of the 20s and 30s, still existing in 1958, but soon to be razed down, as it has been seldom been shown on color film). And if Tati wanted to say that the old France was more humane than the new, ugly, futuristic France shown in the movie, well, he has my vote.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mon Oncle is one of those movies that you just can't stop watching over and over. The first time I saw it I came in half way through and was like- what the?? I couldn't stop laughing at the absurdity of the situations and characters and couldn't move until I'd seen the rest of the film. My second watching was amazing. The humour is so subtle, you can almost miss it, which is why multiple viewings are so important. Every time you watch this movie you pick up another joke, another bit of fun which heightens the experience. The scene where the dog growls at the fish in Mr Hulot's bag, I cried I laughed so hard the first time I saw it. What a beautifully crafted way to make a social comment on modernity, or on the superficiality that can become so important in our commodity focused society. This film doesn't date. It is still as relevant today as it was when it was released in the 1950s and I challenge anyone who truly understands this film to give it anything less than 9 out of 10. What a gem!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my kind of humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love to see all kind of art-house movies, and I knew some great key scenes of "Mon oncle" so that I wanted to see the whole thing. But I was really disappointed by the movie. First of all, I missed a plot that would be worth a full motion picture. The dialogs are extremely sterile and consists of mere loose remarks the actors have to work through. In fact, the loose talking even disturbs the quietness and flow of the visual takes! And nothing ever happens. The artificial set-up of eeeeevery scene makes everything so painful long-lasting. Most jokes are of that kind of unbearable flat humor (I also hate Mister Bean)... someone cannot sit in a modern chair, someone walks through wet paint and of course never notices, the ever lasting legend of the cheeky street guy is back and loads of peeing "funny" dogs appear.... this sort of humor and speed is not everyone's cup of tea.Above all, how can it happen that the same music tune is used again and again during two hours? I found that extremely tiring and frustrating!To say something good, and why I still give 5 stars are the visual settings. The villa Arbel, the love for detailed design, the humor in architecture, all the funny modern features are simply great. Generally, the whole movie is much more valuable for pure watching. After half an hour or so I switched to silent mode and forwarded with 4x speed. I might be a philistine - but it was the only way to make the movie work for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These days, almost all comedy is beholden to major expletives to get a rise from the audience. Jacques Tati's Mon Oncle is exactly the opposite of today's filthy-mouthed troubadors of trash. Physical comedy is probably the most difficult art form imaginable-yet Tati executes it flawlessly, demonstrating to the viewing audience that being on Comedy Central does not mean that you have arrived, nor does it mean that you're funny. Check out Mon Oncle and tell me you didn't laugh genuinely for the first time in years. Steve Martin can be credited with the quote, "Comedy is not Pretty", but from this perspective, it doesn't have to be laden with foul language, either. Mon Oncle is truly a comedy of historic proportions. I give it 5 popcorn kernels (out of 5).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching nothing happen...how funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jacques Tati movies seem to be just like Wes Anderson movies. Everyone seems to think they are hilarious to watch, while there is actually very little happening in their movies and all have a slow pace. The stories are thing and mostly consist out of quirky looking characters doing uninteresting things. I'm sorry, I just don't think there is anything funny about it at all.I'm actually really fond of slapstick comedy but Jacques Tati just don't seem to connect to me at all with its humor. This is most probably due to its very lacking pace. It's slow and it suggests that it's building up to something that just never happens though. No, I did not hated watching this movie but still thought it was seriously lacking in humor for a comedy.And really, what is it with Jacques Tati movies and a story. His movies just never seem to feature a main plot line. His movies are literally about nothing and do nothing but concentrate on a whole bunch of characters, going to their normal everyday routines. Of course some silly and humorous events happen and there are loads of returning gags in this but that is basically all that this movie is; the one intended humorously sequence after the other, while in fact most of those humorous sequence don't work out as funny ones because of its slow pace and the fact that just nothing interesting enough is happening.Strangely enough to me these type of movies really seem to connect to a whole bunch of people and critics as well. It must do something right and hilarious in their eyes, or else it obviously wouldn't had won an Oscar as well for best foreign picture but I just don't see what the appeal is of this movie. I rather watch a good slapstick from the early 20th century than a Jacques Tati movie obviously!5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mon Oncle" is very funny for its day. It was released in 1958. This comedy is remarkable considering it was made prior to all of the computerized imagery that is at our current disposal. Monsieur Arpel is played by Jean-Pierre Zola and does a very good job. Madame Arpel, Adrienne Servantie, is americanized and underplays in her satisfying role. There is comedy compatible with the Marx Brothers. And there are also delightful bits in keeping with a Charlie Chaplin style. The modern housing depicted in this film is clever considering the year of its release. For those addicted to modern cinema, it is not recommended, but for those who want to delve into true comedy in the late 1950's, "Mon Oncle" is a very satisfying viewing.</fullReview>

The other hour or so is devoted to generating the kind of ennui that makes suicide seem like an amusing and life-affirming alternative.Since I am obliged to write some extra lines, I should mention that any attempt to compare this laborious effort to a Charley Chaplin movie is a gratuitous insult to a truly funny and talented man. It puts me in mind of The Discrete Charm of the Bourgeoisie, an absurdist French effort (by Bunuel?) that I thought was a hilarious challenge to convention when I was fifteen and stoned, but which later proved to be trite, shallow, repetitive and dull.</fullReview>

I don't believe anything has been made like it since. It spoofed modern life.... although probably now we are way beyond the "modern" things pictured in the movie, I'm sure it would still apply.

I still think that a few of the jokes are repeated too often (especially the difficulties involving the gate and the buzzer which opens it; I also don't like the way some characters are constantly laughing at Mr. Hulot when others are oblivious; it adds nothing to have one character react to the jokes which we are supposed to be reacting to, if that makes any sense). However, I was never bored. I believe the setting in which I watched the film this time was much more comfortable. The film is quite rich in every way. It is not only funny, but quite intelligent and human. I raise my vote to a 9/10.PS: I get the whistling joke now!

In fact, I'd call this film almost a sequel to Chaplin's Modern Times, in that it is about a simple man competing against wacko modern inventions. There are at least two marvelous set pieces, especially the dinner party scene where M. Hulot accidentally breaks half of his sister and brother-in-law's modern home. I must warn those who are reading this comments and are interested in this film, I suggest you watch it, but it can get a little tiresome. A few of the gags are repeated ad nauseam, especially they fountain. And I never understood the whole thing about the whistling that made people walk into poles (if you get it, feel free to contact me). The film does get more interesting and funny as it goes on, so just be patient, and you will be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jacques Tati stars and directs the second in the `Monsieur Hulot' series, this one contrasting the simple life of Hulot with the technologically overwhelmingly existence of his sister's family. Tati brings some hilarious sight gags to life with beautiful simplicity and achieves his greatest success in his use of himself and his children. However, this film has lost its spark over the years mainly because of the insistence on using long shots and the burdensome acting of Hulot's sister's family and friends. Still sets a great example for films trying to adhere to the `less is more' theory, especially in its sparing use of dialogue. Preceded by `Les Vacances de M. Hulot' and followed by two other related Hulot films. Won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. Subtitled.</fullReview>
