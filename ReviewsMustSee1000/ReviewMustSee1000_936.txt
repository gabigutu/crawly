		<shortDescription>Small in scope, Grandiose in concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While book racks are brimming with thought provoking, high concept science fiction, the movie genre tends to be populated by invading aliens, intergalactic wars, and adventure, which makes Director and co-writer Duncan Jones' Moon that much more of an oddity.Not since Steven Soderbergh's much overlooked 2002 rendition of Stanislaw Lem's Solaris has a movie firmly rooted in the sci-fi realm delivered reflections on the human condition, which Moon does deftly.It tells the story of Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), the only inhabitant of an automated lunar mining base extracting Helium-3 from lunar rocks to be shipped back to Earth to fuel the energy starved planet.Sam's isolated three year posting is about to come to an end and he longs to return to Earth to see his wife. His only company throughout this sojourn has been that of Gerty, the base's HAL-like robot voiced by Kevin Spacey. Unfortunately, the final weeks and days are proving to be the most difficult, and Sam finds himself going a bit squirrelly, leaving both he and the audience to wonder if what's unfolding is actually happening, or merely a drama taking place in his addled mind.That's about as much plot detail as I'm going to deliver, for to delve any deeper into the story would give too much away. Be prepared, however, for a thought provoking narrative that touches on issues such as scientific ethics, corporate greed, human identity, and compassion.There are no aliens, lasers/phasers, wormholes, warp engines or jump drives here, just a lonely space age concierge, an unflappable monotone robot, and a whole lot of fodder for your brain to chow down on.This is what science fiction was meant to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Go see this movie! I've been lucky enough to have an opportunity to see this movie down here at SXSW and I am the better for it.You don't really stumble upon many riveting, independent, sci-fi films that look beautiful(let alone don't contain aliens and space magic) and capture major emotional themes successfully. Moon accomplishes this, and with very little CGI at that.Sam Bell is an astronaut working for a corporation on the far side of the moon. His job? Maintaining a lunar facility and the automated machines which are harvesting the moon's surface for Helium 3. The harvested material is then sent back to Earth to use as energy.Sam is on the very last leg of a three year contract and is quite anxious to return to his wife and daughter. Barring any incidents, Sam will be able to leave his solitude. But something does go wrong.That said, tremendous acting by Sam Rockwell carries this film - mainly because he is basically the only person in the movie. I'm not talking about Cast Away meets the moon? This film explores loneliness much deeper than that, and with much more emotion as well. Luckily for us there are no pieces of sports equipment on which the lead dotes, but instead we're blessed with a monotonous talking robot(voiced by Kevin Spacey) reminiscent of Hal from 2001 notoriety.I advise that people go see this film, not only to support Duncan, the director, and Sam, but also to explore to possibilities of space and the humanity of loneliness.Don't go in expecting to find what I have discussed, but go in expecting to find something inside yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In short, this is one of the best sci-fi movies I have seen in a LONG time. Sam Rockwell plays it perfect, making the viewer feel his isolation and lonelieness. For a low budget film, the few effect shots work seamlessly. I'm trying to remain spoiler free, so I won't bother to explain the plot. If you like older and more story/character driven sci-fi, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, than chances are you will love this movie. If you aren't a huge fan of sci-fi, take a chance with this one. You may find it a very rewarding experience. I loved this movie, and I can't stop thinking about it. In Moon, you may begin to think that everything is a big cliché, but than with all of the seemingly cliché plot points, Moon changes them into something entirely original and unexpected. It is an excellent piece of art and I have a strong feeling not enough people will see and appreciate it like I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic sci-fi driven by a Sam Rockwell tour-de-force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I attended a screening of "Moon" at the 2009 SXSW Film Festival in the legendary Paramount Theatre. There wasn't an empty seat in the 1300-capacity palace. Directed by Duncan Jones, "Moon" stars Sam Rockwell, one of our generation's most powerful actors. The notion of a film being unique seems unlikely in 2009. Not here. While "Moon" is a modern-day science fiction film set in the future, it pays homage to recent classics like "Blade Runner" and "Alien." Viewers will be dazzled -- fans of the genre will nod in approval. Science has developed a way to mine the rocks of the moon for clean energy here on earth. Private enterprise, in the form of a corporation, sends astronauts on a three-year work stint to carry out this ongoing mission. Sam Bell (Rockwell) is the latest to undertake this task, with the trusted robot GERTY by his side watching over the base's operations -- think HAL with a heart. Of course, things are not what they seem, and the viewer is mesmerized as puzzling and surprising events unfold. Cinematographer Gary Shaw contributes to the impression of the eerie stillness of life on the moon with the copious use of still camera and slow tracking shots, only using hand-held when necessary. Nicolas Gaster's editing is sure and steady, emphasizing the slow pace of Sam Bell's multi-year work assignment. Remember those pre-CGI days when special effects meant miniature land rovers on a bumpy table? It can still be done -- and be believable. "Moon" is evocative of the sci-fi greats whose visuals were done in-camera, i.e., on set as opposed to being created by computers in post-production. Sam Bell's unearthly home is comfortable yet aging like the patina of an old cottage. Nathan Parker's screenplay (Jones wrote the story but handed over screen writing duties to Parker) makes the most of Sam Rockwell's considerable talents. This was quite a physically demanding role, as well, and rarely has the actor been better (watch "Snow Angels," though). He doesn't just carry the film -- "Moon" is almost a one-man show and Rockwell conducts a master class. "Moon" is a classic, down and dirty (literally) science fiction film with a baffling mystery that challenges the viewer to live in the shoes of the protagonist. It's hard to imagine a better one than Sam Rockwell or a more effective, entertaining, and satisfying cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing short of astounding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the best movie I have seen in a very in a very long time and immediately jumps into my favorite movies ever. MOON puts a relatable human touch on an intriguing and deep sci-fi story that, while it originally appears to be taking the path of 2001 Space Odyssey, is a unique adventure. Sam Rockwell puts on a spellbinding performance and Kevin Spacey's GERTY voice-over is eery and excellent. I have never seen a movie that had me so engrossed and intrigued from beginning to end. Some may say the film starts slowly but I found the first half hour to be an important and gripping portrayal of what it would mean to be alone in space, without which the movie would not be as effective. I don't want to ruin the plot so I wont go into further detail. As an avid movie watcher who is not a sci-fi buff I would recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a movie that will take over their lives for 2 hours and have you leave the theater wanting to do nothing but discuss how beautifully layered it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent low-budget sci-fi drama with an amazing cast! ;)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, here's the basic plot (without the twist-spoiler):Place: The moon. Time: A future not long from now (2030-ish I think). Sam Bell, astronaut, is working on a lunar base of some sort. He is the only person on the entire base, only assisted by an all-knowing robot called GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). He has been stationed on the base for almost 3 years, his contract nearing an end, and with his flight back to earth scheduled only 14 days away, he can't wait to get back home to see his wife and daughter again. However, suddenly one of the automated moon-vehicles (harvesting rock-samples or whatever) goes awry, and he goes outside of the base to investigate it... but then something unexpected happens, and he has to change his perspective on everything.- End of basic plot summary.Bell is played by the brilliant Sam Rockwell, whom you probably know from "Charlie's Angels", "The Green Mile", "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind", "Matchstick Men" or the equally brilliant sci-fi movies "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" and "Galaxy Quest". This is probably his biggest part in a movie EVER, and I doubt if he will ever get a role as big as this again (not because he's not capable or worthy of it, but because it was a HUGE performance). If you're a fan of Rockwell (or perhaps of Kevin Spacey's voice), then you will not be disappointed, as they're both great in "Moon". For sci-fi lovers, this movie is really a blast. It takes some inspiration from such classics like "2001: A Space Odyssey", "Outland", "Silent Running", "Alien", and others, but still manages to be unique and original, something which has become increasingly rare in the recent big-budget/massive special effects/quick fix-tradition of Hollywood nowadays. "Moon" achieved something great for a budget of approximately 5 million dollars, which is ridiculously low by regular movie-standards, where a feature film usually would cost ten times that amount.As for the theme of the movie, the subjects of alienation, solitude, dehumanization and disbelief are risen (among others), which often leads to some of the best movies (in my opinion), as is the case here too.All in all, this movie definitely ranks among my personal top-20 all-time sci-fi favorites, and I will presume it will be placed equally high on most sci-fi aficionado's lists. An excellent debut directorial by Duncan Jones, and clearly one of the 5 best sci-fi movies made in the last 10 years. Already looking forward to his next feature film, which allegedly is also going to be a sci-fi movie (although with a much bigger budget).Final rating: 9.5/10 - a nearly flawless movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Sci-Fi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Moon has always been a source of wonder and mystery. It is so far away, yet much closer than the stars. Man has reached the Moon, but there is still so much that is unknown about it. It is a bridge between mystery and fact, and director Duncan Jones uses it as a brilliant setting for his science fiction film Moon.The movie stars Sam Rockwell as a lunar astronaut also named Sam stationed alone on the Moon for three years. He isn't entirely alone, because the AI computer GERTY (Kevin Spacey) is constantly following him. Energy companies have discovered vast amounts of Helium on the Moon, and they now mine that Helium in order to power the Earth. As Sam begins his last two weeks stationed in the mining facility, his mind begins to break down and he soon realizes he just might not be able to make it back.It is quite obvious that the main intention of Moon was to pay respect to the older science fiction movies like Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and it is a great homage to the genre indeed. GERTY is possibly one of my favorite AI computers ever in a movie, because it constantly shows its mood through a series of different smiley faces, and has Kevin Spacey's voice. The overall story of Moon is pretty good, and it definitely tugs a bit on your emotions because the main character Sam is so real and relatable. It is a bit more of an art film, but I have found that the mixture of art and Sci-Fi is a brilliant combination.The absolute key ingredient to making Moon was finding a capable actor because it is essentially a one man show, and they picked a winner with Sam Rockwell. Rockwell gives one of his best performances to date, and while it might be a little early to predict I can see him getting an Oscar nomination for his role. The other great thing about this picture is the special effects. Since the budget was so low this could have been a disaster, but the shots of the Moon Rovers and Harvesters were astonishingly realistic, and a typical movie goer would think this had at least a 40 million dollar budget. It is amazing how much more was accomplished with this tiny budget compared to the $200 million dollars poured into Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.Overall Moon is a complete film. It isn't groundbreaking, but it accomplished everything it set out to be, which are a great homage and a chance for Sam Rockwell to really show his acting prowess. I found myself leaving the theater with a great feeling of satisfaction that I have only received from a couple movies this year so far.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>half way between solaris and space-odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was led to this movie, partly because of a sort of dissatisfaction from what we've known as science fiction due to Star-Treks, Star wars, terminators and transformers. On my visit to the local independent movie theater, I was only expecting something like Apollo 13 and I would've been satisfied with just that.But the movie proved to be much more. It wasn't just the cinematography, few captivating shots of the moon surface, or the great acting performance. It was as if the movie took a while to ponder over philosophical questions that science and technology raise- something that every science fiction ought to do.This work won't be unworthy of a comparison with Kubrick's- space odyssey ? only that it is probably not as visually stimulating as the latter. It does make good use of classical music like Kubrick's. I found the movie to be a bit more accessible than Tarkovsky's Solaris in that it is much more fluid and entertaining (Solaris was 3 hr long ? executed very slow albeit with a similar idea). Like Solaris, the protagonist's recollections of the life on earth eventually result in some mental instability, but the movie stays away from getting into long philosophical debates on human experience or our place on earth.In general, do expect a lot more than space travel in this movie. To cite an example, the isolation of Sam made him more attached to memories of his life on earth. I don't recall many other movies that have expressed it so well that in isolation, nothing really means anything. Kudos to the director! Such existentialist reflections aside, there are many instances when the movie makes a statement about unethical corporate practices, evasive HR responses - almost to the extent 'Michael Clayton' did. I think that makes it more worthwhile to watch. Still despite all that, it avoids taking any stances on controversies that bother all of us in modern times. It puts us through the fears of the unknown, catastrophes of distrust and what arises from distrust and isolation and all of that.Still, somehow the movie isn't really as dark as the script might make it sound. There is isolation, mistrust, schemes, confusion, curiosities and despair, but the human experience probably transcends the realism of its existence ? that was the idea I carried back from the movie theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthwhile one-man show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally posted to titsandgore.com, April 2009:Moon is an auspicious debut from Duncan Jones (née Zowie Bowie), a talented new director who happens to be the son of David Bowie (let me officially be the first person to predict that every review of this film in the mainstream press will have the tagline "SPACE ODDITY!"). Sam Rockwell gives a truly remarkable performance as Sam Bell, a lunar miner who is nearing the end of his 3-year contract at a single-man mining outpost. His only companion is the station computer, Gertie, a straight-up HAL homage that tantalizingly suggests how a culture informed by decades of watching 2001 might choose to design a companion robot.To say too much more about the plot would be to spoil its central conceit, and while I'm sure many reviewers will talk openly about it, I want to preserve the surprise if at all possible at least until the film gets its theatrical release this coming June.Suffice it to say that Jones admirably mixes together stock genre tropes, paying tribute to a number of classic science fiction features while retaining his own idiosyncratically dark vision. Familiar filmic concepts of the "clean future" and the "dirty future" are mixed together to create a unique atmosphere; the milieu is suitably claustrophobic, the cramped quarters of the mining station serving the film's conceptual purposes while masking the shoestring budget. In fact, it may be hard to spare a glance at the meticulously designed sets with your eyes glued to Rockwell for the duration of the picture. His performance is utterly mesmerizing, inhabiting the role so completely that it is impossible to imagine any other actor having the chutzpah to pull it off.Which is not to say that Moon is without its problems; the pacing is hardly consistent and Jones' reliance on Rockwell tends to undersell his direction. Parts of the film veer dangerously close to identical thematic elements in Steven Soderbergh's recent adaptation of Solaris, without being as emotionally potent. But what it lacks in originality is mostly compensated for by the sheer audacity of its central performance and the careful economy of its direction.Moon may be dressed in familiar clothing, but it is a singular experience, a clever, darkly funny and genuinely moving journey into the nature of individuality. Jones is already at work on a second science fiction feature, and it is welcome indeed to see such a promising new talent continue to develop his voice by working in genre film-making!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sci-Fi department is a very hard market to break. Hence why greatness always seems to come from that genre......because normally when they are made, it usually takes millions of dollars to cover the special effects and what not......so the process of choosing the right script is somewhat limited, but they always leave their mark. However, this one is changing that pace.....in a rhealm of big budget Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica flicks, this movie chooses to take the independent route. By only spending 3 million for its budget, and using old school techniques for its special effects.....can a movie like this thrive in todays market? Well you know how i mentioned that the script selection for a Sci-Fi movie isa very tough market to break......and how the script better be incredible if it is going to make it anywhere........well this movie is just that. This movie was just plain brilliant. For those of you who have no idea what this film is about, allow me to shed some light on the subject.........In the future, our main character Sam Rockwell is living on a one man space station on the moon, whose should purpose it to retrieve and send precious resources from the moon back to the earth.....in this process he becomes very lonely and begins to uncover a horrible truth. The movie is directed and told in such a brilliant fashion......they never try to WOW you with its special effects, which are very moderate but pass with flying colors. Its script and method of storytelling are probably the best part. Instead of answering all of your questions all at once, they sort of draw them out and make you claw and scratch for the truth......but the thing that i like the most is how they approach everything.........they take a route that lets you know that you have seen all the other Sci-Fi classics, and addresses all of your concerns of what may happen or what is going to......and then just carries on like its hidding this secret from you.....almost like the movie knows what your thinking, but chooses not to correct you right away.......brilliantly told and shown in an even better light......and with Clint Mansell directing the musical score(Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain)......my god, how could you not be pulled in. Now the part that i am excited to talk about the most is the acting......because i really have not had anything to rave about so far this year.......but Sam Rockwell is hands down the best actor so far this year. He has already proved himself to me with "The Green Mile", "Frost/Nixon", and "Choke"......but he knocked this one out of the park. It was a difficult script to pull off for an actor, and he did it with leaps and bounds.......job well done. I will be very upset if he is not at least nominated this year. Bottom Line.......well, "Star Trek" gave you the action/entertainment portion of your Sci-Fi.......whereas this one gives you its underbelly. This is easily one of the best Sci-Fi movies i have seen in a long time, and that is saying a lot coming from me. There was not one thing wrong with this movie......maybe the end was a little sketchy, but it was still not enough to destroy this brilliant film. I urge all of you to go to your local independent movie theatre and watch this movie........you will regret it if you don't.......easily one of the 10 best movies i have seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The future can be bright and the future can be bleak. It's an area that has always offered writers and filmmakers have often looked at and brought us some real classics. Here is Duncan Jones' homage to the great era of Sci-fi from of the 60s to the 80s.In Duncan Jones' vision of the future the world's energy needs are solved by mining the moon for helium-3 which can be used for nuclear fusion. Living on the dark side of the moon is Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), who is coming to the end of a 3 year contract. He has lived in isolation, with only GERTY (Kevin Spacey), a robot who is programmed to serve him. His only contact from the outside world is video messages from his wife (Dominique McElligott) and the company. When one of the mining machines suffers some damage Sam goes out to fix it. However, after seeing images he crashes and wakes up after in the infirmary. GERTY tells Sam he is under orders no to let out the base and he has to trick the robot before being allowed out. In the open spaces of the moon Sam finds another version of himself. Both falls quickly into conflict, both arguing they are the real Sam and the other is a clone. But both also know something wider and darker is happening and they need to solve it before a rescue team arrive.Duncan Jones offers a strong and ambitious debut as a feature director. Sci-fi is not a genre that indie directors attempt and Jones does a wonderful job with a $5 Million budget. He shows that Sci-fi can be meaningful and doesn't resource to action and explosions to keep the audience's interest. It is thoughtful with themes of identity, isolation and the future of mankind. Jones keeps the mystery going and makes the audience exercise their mind whilst watching.Sam Rockwell has a tough job acting by himself, but he is a talented actor and does a excellently. He is allowed to show his range and can show a lot in his facial expressions. Kevin Spacey who is just a voice in this film offers a good impression of HAL 9000.Clint Mansell who composed an fantastic score for Requiem for a Dream has shown his musical talent again which a subtle, haunting score.Jones is an old fashion director, using models rather then CGI. It is refreshing to see in a modern film, is a lot more effective then CGI would have been on such a low budget. It reminds of films such as the original Star War films.Moon pays homage and has similarities to classic Sci-fi such as Alien, Blade Runner, Sunshine, 2001: A Space Odyssey (a must see) and 2010: the Year We Made Contact (a boring dud).Duncan Jones has a fine future ahead of him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dad, there's someone asking about Mom ? Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is ostensibly a one-man show featuring Sam Rockwell as an astronaut sent to the moon on a three-year contract to maintain a mining station that harvests the sun's fusion energy from moonrocks. We are thrown into the mix with only two weeks left in his tenure, the desire to return to his wife and daughter, whom he has never seen in real life yet, strong and his psyche all but ready to break from the lack of human interaction. Sam Bell has been keeping busy by utilizing a treadmill, watching old Nick at Nite type sitcoms, whittling away at a wooden model of his hometown with an X-acto knife, and conversing with the station's artificial intelligence GERTY. The live feed to Earth has been disengaged for a while now, leaving this monotonous voice and bright yellow smiley face?complete with changing expressions?of Kevin Spacey his only friend. Sure he gets to record video packages for his wife and bosses at Lunar Industries, and they reply back to him, but the distance needed to travel is great and the time between too long.Cabin fever has definitely set in as Sam begins to zone out and manifest a woman, first sitting down in his chair and then out on the moon's surface while he is out for a routine check. Both instances cause him to forget what he was doing, causing great personal harm and injury. When the real trouble occurs, however, is the moment?as seen in the trailer?he brings back a body from the surface that appears, for all intents and purposes, to be him. This is the point where talking about Moon gets a little difficult so as to not ruin the mystery that should be unsolved when you sit down to watch the film. The trailer portrays a story that seems to beg the question of whether the second Sam is truly there or only in his imagination as he slowly goes insane. I won't divulge the answer, but instead say that it gets solved fairly quickly. So, instead of the film becoming a psychological thriller with a big reveal at its conclusion, Duncan Jones' story becomes complete science fiction, bringing in moral questions about technological advances we in 2009 are just beginning to wrestle with.This aspect, while at first threatening to ruin my experience as I entered thinking the question of whether Sam number two was real or not would be the backbone to the tale, became so important to my enjoyment. Rather than a look inside the psyche of this man, isolated for so long, we are given a tense race against time as Sam must discover what is happening and think of a way to get out from under it all before the ELIZA rescue team arrives from Earth, an event that could have very dire consequences. I don't want to ruin too much, but let me just say that the clock is counting down to his death, an ending that could be caused by many different factors, (failing health, execution by those coming, etc.), that also begs the question of whether he is in fact alive in the first place. I have to say that Jones and screenwriter Nathan Parker put together a taut thrill ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The pacing is deliberate and rapid all at the same time, the art direction pristine, and the camera tricks very impressive.Sam Rockwell is a major part of this as it is definitely the best work of his career. Not only is he on screen for the entire run time, about 80% of it is playing opposite a computer or himself. The pressures being put upon his shoulders, the fear of what may be happening, about his very own existence, weigh down his emotional strength and it shows. The outbursts, the sarcasm, the joking around to anger his doppelganger, and the heartbreaking realization of what is going on show through with perfection. This is his shining moment, proving his craft and ability to act above and beyond the "funny guy" he is often relegated to play. Especially when pitted against such a stark background of clinical white futuristic rooms or the vacuum of space, the angst, joy, disbelief, and fortitude of his humanity are all that we are able to see, his performance is paramount to the film's success.I know that, as far as storyline goes, this review remains somewhat vague besides expressing the visceral tension and underlying mystery waiting to be solved, but I believe that is for your own viewing pleasure. While the trailer is not necessarily misleading, it posits a question that is answered early on as being the main crux of the entire film. That possibility of more than one Sam Bell or of a man who's hold of reality has been broken may be what you went into the film expecting to see. Well you will just see it sooner than expected and as a lead into the real story of survival, identity, and the idea of home. In that respect, having the trailer's mystery solved only means more time for unexpected story lines; it may have gotten you into the seats, but it is only the beginning of what this science fiction classic-in-waiting has to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sci-fi film where it's the acting that counts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by David Bowie's 38-year-old son (formerly known as Zowie), with a screenplay by Nathan Parker, 'Moon' is a curious and thought-provoking sci-fi story about a man working for an energy company, mining Helium-3 on the far side of the moon, who discovers, just as his three-year contract is ending, that he may not be going home. Sam Rockwell gets to do a virtuoso turn as alternative versions of himself (his character's name is Sam too, Sam Bell). Events are set in a traditional space station with a capacious, softly lit layout featuring the obligatory human-voiced and omnipresent computer -- mobile, not so big, a sort of clunky R2D2 -- creepily accommodating and voiced by an almost-human Kevin Spacey. It's a robot, I guess, and its name is GERTY. There are nice lunar landscapes outside where Sam sometimes rides around in a puffed-up Hummer-style Land Rover to explore or look over the machinery extracting Helium-3. Instead of the now all-too-usual and increasingly irrelevant CGI, there's more the feel of a giant mock-up in everything we see, which provides a better kind of background for what is essentially a Kafkaesque head trip. The interior isn't all modernistic chill. There's also a funky armchair reminiscent of the final sequence of '2001,' and cozy junk, even a college pennant, on the wall around Sam's bunk, sort of like a frat boy's quarters. Sam Rockwell's own appearance, his skin far from perfect and his expression a bit wacko, suggests an ordinary guy, just a worker, which is what he is, not some Astronaut.'Moon' explores the paranoia we feel about a possible future increasingly dominated by evil, pervasive corporations -- not Big Brother, but Big Corp. It also gets at something hauntingly explored in the movie Jones's dad Bowie played an alien in in way back when, Nicholas Roeg's 'The Man Who Fell to Earth': the terrible loneliness of being out in space away from one's own kind. Sam works on the moon all by himself, and some kind of radio blockage keeps him from being in direct electronic contact with people, including his wife. There's also another aspect of space travel where distances destroy human chronology: a distorted and confused sense of time troubles Sam when he tries to figure out what's been going on with his little family back on earth. It seems like it all happened a longer time ago than he knew. Or did it maybe happen to somebody else? Such questions may arise from time to time in other space movies, but the filmmakers are usually too preoccupied with stuff like conflicts among the crew, threats from hostile invaders, or technical meltdowns to go into the full awful anomie, mega-aloneness and paranoid delusion lengthy sojourns in space are likely to induce. 'Moon,' however, has no other crew members or invaders or technical problems. Everything seems to be operating according to plan; only it's beginning to seem Sam didn't know what the whole plan was, insofar as his future is concerned. When he's out checking on something not far from the module, the vehicle gets into some kind of accident, and when he wakes up, things start to go strangely wrong. This is where the full-on head trip begins, and we, and Sam, start trying to figure out what's going on. That's all I can tell you, because it's essential that the mystery unfold on its own.'Moon' doesn't dazzle but gives pleasure in its low-keyed conviction. It even made me think of Shane Carruth's 2004 virtually no-budget cult time-travel movie, 'Primer,' because even with relatively elaborate sets and effects, it still focuses on ideas, rather than razzle-dazzle -- on what Sam is going through, rather than what the filmmakers were up to.Hence the key work is done by Rockwell. Sam Bell is exhausted and lonely after three years alone on the moon with only GERTY for company, and Rockwell must go through a series of reawakenings and breakdowns after he hallucinates and has that accident in the vehicle and then becomes increasingly confused, angry, and frantic about what's going on. I'm not sure Jones or Parker make the most of the situation they set up, but Rockwell's quick reactions and mood shifts hold our attention very well. As we know from 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,' 'Joshua,' and 'Snow Angels,' Rockwell does great mental breakdowns. This time he does rapid physical deterioration equally well. In a sense, all the most important special effects come out of the actor's bag of tricks. But that's not to forget the satisfying simplicity of the lunar landscape design sculpted by cinematographer Gary Shaw and production designer Tony Noble, or to overlook Clint Mansell's evocative musical soundscape. And when Sam confronts other versions of himself, needless to say the CGI folks were needed to pull it off within single frames.Low keyed and a little slow, 'Moon' isn't for everyone and may seem tailored primarily for sci-fi buffs. But its disturbing exploration of identity goes back to a child's fundamental philosophical speculations: Why am I here? Who am I? How do I know I'm me?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly executed, fascinating, and involving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most important issue we may face in the future is whether rapid advances in science and technology will change human beings into disposable resources, utilitarian subjects manipulated by indifferent centers of corporate power. Moon, the thought provoking and thoroughly engrossing first feature from U.K. director Duncan Jones, son of the pop singer David Bowie, tackles these questions and raises others that have been pondered since man first set foot on this planet ? Who are we? Where did we come from? What is our purpose on this planet? Though the answers do not come as easily as the questions, Moon attempts to recapture the science fiction genre from the mindless action-adventure films we have become accustomed to and brings it to a level, perhaps not seen since the classic Kubrick film 2001.Filmed on soundstages in England and set in an unspecified future time, Moon opens with a mock commercial by the Japanese corporation Lunar Industries. The Corporation has developed a technique to use the rocks on the moon to produce Helium-3, a substance that can fulfill mankind's most pressing energy needs. Their mining facility on the far side of the moon is manned only by Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) and a Hal-like robot named Gerty (voice of Kevin Spacey) who communications emotions through a smiley face display while reflecting company programming. Lonely and emotionally at loose ends, Sam is nearing the end of a three-year stint and is looking forward to return home in two weeks to see his wife (Dominique McElligott) and young daughter with whom he is only able to communicate via video recording since direct communication is temporarily out of service.When hallucinations of his lovely wife standing before him cause Sam to crash his Lunar Rover, the film takes a strange turn and never looks back. Sam wakes up in the infirmary and begins his recovery process under strict orders from Gerty not to go outside of the base. Astoundingly, Sam sees a younger version of himself who claims to have arrived to serve the same three-year contract that Sam began many years ago. Raising issues about the nature of identity and the perversion of human life by scientific and corporate power run amok, the film becomes a desperate struggle against the clock to reclaim one's humanity before a so-called rescue operation arrives to set things in order.Moon is not preachy nor does it treat the corporation as the villain incarnate. Without special effects or bombastic battle scenes, this low-budget film simply presents the possibility of what could happen if human consciousness does not keep pace with advances in genetic engineering. As such, it is brilliantly executed, fascinating and involving, and contains an outstanding double role performance by Indie star Sam Rockwell who is completely convincing as the confused and lonely astronaut who plays ping pong with himself. Director Duncan Jones and screenwriter Nathan Parker have combined the intelligence of Solaris with the chilling power of Alien to produce a work that challenges us to reconnect with our souls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie If You Want It To Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is a philosophical film at heart, examining a variety of complex subjects and dilemmas with a precise and perfect manner, mirroring the voice of its robot servant Gerty and the emptiness of the base itself. This is both the source of its beauty and a few problems.(Spoiler Alert) Although the beginning of the film gives us the usual stark view of the "astronaut alone," common in all well-done space movies and in this case especially derivative of the original Solaris, it is in Sam's discovery that the film really takes flight and becomes something exciting and new. Sam Rockwell gives a stunning performance, playing multiple versions of Sam Bell with great care and delicacy, making each clone new and yet the same; totally different from the often unintentionally comedic performances a role like that can manifest.But the subtlety of Rockwell's performance, when combined with the starkness and quiet of the base, can make the film feel mechanical to the unprepared viewer. Rockwell doesn't force his audience to feel for him. It's something that occurs only when you take time out from the screen to examine just how lonely, terrifying, and unfair Sam's experience is. You have to explore Sam's plight on your own. It is up to you to unravel the multitude of layers and depths swimming beneath the surface of this intricate story or take them at face value, an aspect of the film that can potentially leave many viewers understandably unsatisfied and unmoved.One of the emotional surprises in the film does come from Sam's interaction with Gerty the robot, his only companion. Gerty is the best on screen portrayal of a robot "friend" to date. He takes great care of Sam, not because he feels for Sam, but because that is logically the best thing for him to do, and yet he does his job well. He is neither sinister or abnormally compliant, his emoticon "face" lending the film an at times eerie and other times emotive component that feels more realistic and effective then his counterparts like HAL or Robbie the Robot.I loved the film, was compelled as I watched it, and unable to easily leave it behind once I left the theater. But I also didn't leave with a strong emotional response, despite my understanding of the broad horrors of that Sam was facing. I'm not sure if that's a bad thing or not; maybe it depends on which version of me was watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this last night and it was fabulous. It's hard to discuss for fear of giving away any spoilers but I'll try.I thought it a magnificent film and when compared to the bloated, nonsensical 'lets have more pointless explosions' of Transformers 2 it shows that you can still have such thought, style and cleverness in a film for a fraction of the budget.Normally with the independent art-house films they are set on Glaswegian council estates. If remotely sci-fi they are almost forced to have a horror - sex element to help them sell to the teen market.This was so refreshing for demonstrating genuine craft and story telling. A film that even as your mind is racing ahead to predict the typical ABC outcome of film, manages to keep surprising you.There were no silly twists or WTF moments to make up for the writers lack of logic and it offered a subject matter that resonated with you long after.Sam's performance was stellar but it is frustrating that one can't elaborate for fear of giving stuff away. I know the film didn't have a big cinema push, well certainly not in the UK, and was only out to piggy back the anniversary of the lunar landings, but I really hope it gets some more exposure.Sam deserves recognition for his talent as does the writer and director. I've enjoyed some good films this year but that was certainly the freshest, most inventive and well executed one that I've seen so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Throwback Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is little that I can do by way of review. There is a minor REVEAL a third of the way through that, though it would not ruin the movie, would ruin some of the cumulative effect of the subtly clever tale.Sam Rockwell plays Sam (for some reason I love it when that happens) who is a one man show on a moon mining base for a Big Energy Company. He signed a three year contract and he is two weeks away from going home to his wife and small child.Kevin Spacey's voice gives life to GERTY, the helpful corporate robot. GERTY expresses himself with emoticons which are chuckle inducing.The brilliance is that writer/director Duncan Jones (son of rock idol Davey Jones. No, not that Davey Jones, but rather the one that took the stage name of David Bowie {which makes Jones' movie taking place in space... OK, nevermin}) lays delicate red herrings at various points where the viewer is suddenly convinced that it is going to be THAT type of movi... er, no, I mean OK, we saw that in 2001 it... er, no, that's like Solar... hmm.As I mentioned, The Reveal comes pretty early, but this is not a M. Knight movie, so The Reveal is not what drives the film. After The Reveal the movies turns into a quiet and contemplative commentary, maybe, or perhaps an extensional wrapped philosophical study. I'm not sure, actually, which is why the movie stays with you. It allows one to read quite a bit between gratuitously wide-spaced lines, take it at face value, or approach it in the abstract. It is more ambiguous in its purpose than something like 2001 which was purposely extensional and ambiguous, if that makes any sense.I must also add that the movie made me very, very sad. It's hard to explain why for the movie did not have a classic "sad ending," but the effect that it had on me bordered on profound. This is by far my favorite movie in a long while.And lastly, Sam Rockwell was absolutely amazing.The fact that my anticipation was so high for the film and still did not disappoint probably means it is even better than I am claiming. Do yourself a favor though: If it plays near you, go see it.10/10 *****/***** Three Thumbs Up and a Bucket of Popcorn</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Existential dirty dishes on the Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked it. The piano music played throughout kept the tone of the movie from becoming too sterile, lonely. This movie displays some dull life on the moon. The piano music will pull your heart strings alittle, keeping you in there. The moon scenes are very realistic looking. Although I was dead tired and sleepy, I didn't go to sleep during the movie! Now that is saying something for me! I feel that this is a classic movie. It attempts to touch man's identity, how we determine our worth. Are we what we do? Are we what we join? Are we our family? Are we illegal immigrants if we work on the Moon and then return to Earth? I didn't expect a science related movie to touch on existential subject matter. This movie will make you think about your family. It will make you think about how you put together your identity. No, it isn't merely a movie with crash bang action and explosions on the Moon. This isn't an action movie. It's a movie for thinkers..This movie is edited tightly. There is only one scene where there is some happiness. I suppose you could compare it to a movie about a lonely soldier in WWII who only has a few days to go before the end of his war time assignment. But because it is sci fi, and realistic, you have more to consider: The subject of human cloning comes up. The issue of "where is home"? ...is another matter to contend with. And even more, you must think about a business establishment's loyalty to its workers as an issue. I haven't given you the answers here so that you will see the movie. I consider this a true classic, one which may well be used as an example in film classes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moon - A must see film for 2009!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen Moon at my local independent cinema after it was mentioned that it won Best New British Feature at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. To be honest I did not read much into the film before I went but must admit I was totally blown away. This is a LOW budget film, I think about ?5 million and it is amazing the overall results achieved from such a low budget. I wont reveal much about the story but it is about the life of a loner Astronaut Saml Bell who is towards the end of this three year stint on the Moon. The story is intriguing and grabs your interest from the onset. Sam Rockwell plays an incredible role as Sam Bell within the film and Kevin Spacey as the computer GERTY is perfect. If you have any doubts about seeing this film. Don't. Just watch it and enjoy - this is not a dumbed down hi-budget Scifi Film. It is an enjoyable film which punches many surprises and I can now see why this has been receiving very good reviews. GO SEE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! This movie blew me away! I really didn't expect it to be as good as it was. I really enjoyed following the story and seeing how it all played out. I wish it was even longer or they made a part 2! It had a slight Blade Runner or Alien feel to it which the director, Duncan Jones, states. I heard MUTE will have more of this feeling so I'm really looking forward to that film. Now some people state that it was too slow paced. Maybe it's just me, but I found that enjoyable, and helped for the unexpected mysteries which lied within. Sam Rockwell played Sam Bell perfectly too. He deserves a lot of credit for nailing that character. It's like you're just following him on his journey trying to figure out and put the pieces together on what is really going on in his world. And, what a unique and fascinating world it is! I also enjoyed Kevin Spacey as the voice of "Gerty". What else can I say without giving it away except watch it! Hopefully you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, lame, predictable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Bell is stationed on the moon as the sole operator of a vast mining expedition. After a 3 year period of working, Sam starts to suffer from delusions and general physical impediment. He crashes his mining cart rendering him unconscious. When he regains consciousness and finds his way back to the base, another Sam bell seems to have taken his place.The movie is reasonably well produced but didn't offer an iota of original or interesting writing. The idea that somewhere along the way a person finds out that he's a clone, a hologram or a machine is so incredibly mundane in the realm of SF, that you cannot base an entire movie on just that. In fact, we need an abundance of additional story line to steer our thoughts clear from the unavoidable silliness this kind of space based story will ultimately confront the viewer with. Silliness that could have been avoided in this case, had it been playing out on for example Antarctica. The fact that it takes place on the Moon adds absolutely nothing to the story.Imagine the film The Matrix plodding on for 80 minutes with Neo having endless discussions with himself behind his PC and then, 20 minutes before the end, have the film reveal that he's actually in the Matrix, having him eat the pill, do a quick voice-over and end the movie right there. That's what the makers of Moon would have done with it.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy but ultimately unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting and worthy film but ultimately unsatisfying. I love sci-fi films especially budget indies and I would like to rate the film higher but unfortunately it wasn't for me.As a reasonably obsessed sci-fi fan I found the film to be a little pedestrian. I have seen many of the set-ups and pay-offs before. For example as a set-up for the fact that Sam Bell is a clones, the newly cloned Sam asks for sunglasses. This is a common clone set-up. New clones wear sunglasses due to the sensitivity of the eyes being used for the first time. As a set-up I found it a little common. There are other examples of recognizable set-ups running throughout the film. I was hoping for bit more ingenuity in the story and better pay- offs.Most applauded the reasonableness of the science fiction. Cloning and AI on the dark side of the moon is clearly more reasonable than Dunes Guild navigators that fold space-time by consuming vast amounts of a drug called Spice that gives them prescience to see across galaxies and into the future. I have no problem with science and magic. They are not mutually exclusive. As Arthur C.Clarke says "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."When I saw the trailer I was hoping for a Philip K.Dick style existential meltdown. Reality collapsing under the weight of it's pretension. Multiple realities layered on top of each other viciously competing for validation as they unfold into a desolate future. I'm a sucker for that kind of thing. Moon is not that kind of thing. I don't want to bemoan the film to much. It was excellently acted. The production is very strong. The best use of doppelganger actors I ever seen with the exception of Dead Ringers. The CGI was very strong and painted a vivid picture of the moon. The robot AI voiced by Kevin Spacey is very well portrayed. For all it's supposed Hard Sci-Fi I still feel it wasn't really hard sci-fi. Why didn't the AI have a face. It was a very sophisticated AI with great reasoning skills and somewhat of a personality of it's own. If the engineers can do this and synthesize flawless human speech why could they not give it a face instead of about 6 or 7 emoticons.The cloning seemed fishy as well. I can't understand they would not just clone a more drone like character that was happy to serve the company. Why and how would they even attempt to embed the memories, personalities and traits of another human into a clone I don't know. Good film left me cold. People say it was an adult film. I disagree it was a film for stunted adults lacking imagination and a basic sense of cosmic wonder. Watch Herzogs The Wild Blue Yonder a film for real adults.Didn't want to be that negative. My opinion is more a counter balance to the positive reviews. I can understand the positive reviews. For the audience that gave it 10 stars you do not see a film like this too often. A real science fiction story. I just hate reality I prefer to follow the Sun-Ra myth :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good idea, had potential, but is too dry and barren to enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see an idea in Moon, but I don't see a motion picture. This character driven sci-fi/drama which explores being human feels too cold, bland and overlong to work. It takes a while to make its point, and relies on our identification with a character who is portrayed with confused acting. The last time Sam Rockwell was in space was in Galaxy Quest. There he was a scream, here he is a yawn. Moon (I suppose) works in small chunks but the big picture feels dull and not very enriching.Sam Bell, for three years, has been running an energy station on the moon. The energy harvested there supplies an environmentally friendly Earth in the near future. Sam's only companion is the station's computer, Gerty (a more mobile version of HAL 9000, with a smiley face). One day/night, Sam is investigating a wrecked harvesting machine, and inside he discovers a body.... another Sam. What does this mean? Is Sam #1 going crazy from being on the moon for too long? Is Sam #2 a clone? Is Sam #1 a clone? Are there any more bodies out there? and whose side is Gerty gonna take?Moon probably sounded good as a pitch, considering all the questions that come up once you block out the plot. Unfortunately the movie never really comes alive. It has its moments, but it seems to lack any significant emotion or tension. As a result, Moon gets tiring with each passing chapter. It is such a shame when considering that the ending is the most exiting part, but ten minutes of solidity doesn't necessary warrant a time investment in eighty minutes of ponderous direction. Moon is tricky to recommend.</fullReview>

Also, considering it is a directorial debut, Duncan Jones (Think that's right) has done an absolutely tremendous job. The cinematography is second to none and the overall feel/atmosphere is the very gritty sort of space/spaceships we so loved to see back in the 80's in flicks such as Alien. This film doesn't lack anywhere except for perhaps the running time. I really would have enjoyed sitting there for a further 30 minutes or so. Heres hoping for a Directors Cut with extra footage!

		<shortDescription>Gerty Is Not Ash: Herein Lies The Problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Let's start with the basic problem, the plot. Now, show of hands, does everyone remember what Weyland- Mutani was like with its employees in the Alien movies? You know, crew expendable, killer robot, go check out grid 471, terraformers on the alien ship planet? SPOILER: Now, they have an army of clones doing mining on the moon. They keep these clones in the dark: 1. That they are clones, 2. That they are dying almost immediately upon birth, 3. That their memories are all implanted and unreal. Now, imagine you invested trillions of bucks for this base full of meat bags mining your valued Helium, whatever the hell it was. When Sam starts messing the whole program up by becoming self- aware, you: 1. Kill him right away, 2. ignore it and hope it passes or 3. You facilitate it with your helpful robot you sent as a lying, manipulating control? For those of you who haven't seen this, believe it or not, the movie's answer is 3. The first Sam is in an accident, we see the second Sam notice indications that someone is out there in one of those Space: 1999 vehicles. Now, right here Gerty could have nipped it in the bud, he controls everything: air, food supply, computer transmissions, what does he do? Nothing, absolutely nothing. He lets Sam unravel the mystery, falls for a trick that wouldn't fool an eighth grader, so Sam can go rescue another Sam outside. Sam now brings the clone back in for medical repair so that both of them are aware of the nature of their slavish existence for the company. Does Gerty kill them quickly by decompressing the inside, like Ash would have done? Nope, he helps them come to terms with their being living tools for the company, having phony memories and leading, inevitably, to their revolt against the company. Look, Rockwell gives a great performance, he made me laugh with many of his scenes, but the script is just awful. It builds to the most absurd conclusion ever filmed, the one Sam, closest to death, stays behind while the healthier one returns to earth. In what, you ask? In a non-pressurized sample shuttle. Now, do we all remember how far the earth is from the moon: 273,000 miles? Yes, he gets in the non- pressurized shuttle and flies without supplies back to earth, I S you not. I could forgive that, I really could, but the main absurdity is not overcome-able. You simply never buy a benevolent company who has an army of clones with a supervising, lying, manipulating A.I. who blithely lets a pair of them shut down the whole operation. They proceed to bring the entire mining operation to a halt jeopardizing the profits of a gigantic multinational with the help of that company's robot Gerty: does this sound realistic to you? Rockwell gives a great performance, he is all alone here; yet, even his acting cannot save the movie from a script that requires you to believe in a benevolent, loving multinational that sacrifices billions for the sake of a piece of living equipment: Have you ever met one on earth like this? Are the multinationals around us filled with philanthropy for others? I understand you disagreeing with what you may consider picayune objections, like the return trip, but the main premise is absurd. Everyone knows that the entire operation is predicated upon making money for the company; these clones are pieces of equipment. We all know what would have really happened, the minute the second clone discovered the injured one, by the clues in the station, Gerty would have killed him. This would have been followed by shutdown until those bozos got up there, get rid of the injured one, reset the fantasy, then Gerty would have awakened a new one. If you disagree with this you have to hold that a greedy, profit-driven global company would allow the interruption of its profits and the damaging of its warehouse of clones all for the self-fulfillment of a clone. Look, we are living non-cloned beings and they don't give a crap about our lives, please, give me a break. I am not a Rockwell fan but I liked his performance, with a better script this could have been a great movie. The effects were well done and Spacey was good as usual. This is an example of writing wiping out a movie. Tragically Overrated, Dropping From The 9 it was years ago. Trust me, in ten years it will be a five.

		<fullReview>Sam Rockwell.Sam Rockwell is one of the greatest actors we have right now so i was (obviously) impossibly excited for 'Moon' and I went to see it yesterday. In short, the film was so amazing that after it finished, I didn't want to move... ever again. I was also excited to see the film because of the director (Duncan Jones) and the fact that it was filmed in 33 days on a super-low budget. A low-budget space movie like this should have been near impossible, but Moon looks way more amazing than films with way bigger budgets. Sam Rockwell is impossibly good as 'Sam Bell' and watching him fall apart made me pretty emotional. He plays the character(s) like the roll of a dice, switching from angry and manic one minute to helpless and desperate the next. Moon is part 1960's/70's space movie homage, and this was a total throw back to the 'WTF is happening' sci-fi movies that kinda got lost with the new ways of cinema. The film isn't over-complicated but it throws you into the vast unknown and leaves you with unanswered questions, which is the best way to end things. The main question in Moon is 'What would you do if you met yourself?'... and I guess throwing space into the equation makes the whole thing even scarier to think about. You would still be lonely, even if there were more of you. I'd be lonely.Inside, I am completely geeking out over Moon. But I won't write it all on here because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Even if you're not that into sci-fi... I'd still really urge you to see this film. I'm still on another planet because of it... (pun intended) and Moon is pure space escapism at it's best.P.S Clint Mansell did the score for Moon, and he is ultra-beyond-everything-scanners-head-explode-genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is so much to admire about this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Moon" is an amazingly different film. First, the film is a sci-fi film that is set on the moon. It has exceptionally nice special effects--yet only cost five million dollars to make!! Second, it only stars one guy--Sam Rockwell. Along with the voice of the computer (Kevin Spacey), and BRIEF glimpses at others through memories or over phone calls, this IS the entire cast! Third, and most importantly, the film really kept me guessing throughout and is thoroughly original! The film is the first full-length film of Duncan Jones--the son of David Bowie (Bowie's real name, by the way, is David Jones). While he's only made one film since ("Source Code"), I cannot imagine him not getting many more opportunities because his skills are so evident in "Moon"--a film he not only directed but he came up with the story as well! This guy is something.The film is set in the near future. To supply the Earth's energy needs, NASA is mining Helium-3 from the Moon. On this moon base is Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell)--a guy who seems to be losing his mind. It's probably because he's been alone for nearly three years. What is obvious is that something is amiss--and he is either hallucinating or there is another version of him on the base as well! Yes, following an accident, he awakens to see another Sam Bell.At this point in the film, I KNEW exactly what was coming next. Well, I was 100% wrong!!! The film really took my by surprise and the dark turn really caught me off guard--and I really, really like that in a movie. However, I don't want to spoil it. See the film yourself and see a wonderful example of a film that is highly original, intelligent and cheaply made! A truly unique film--and one that is available now on Netflix. And, like "Gravity", it's a space film with a tiny cast that thoroughly kept my interest.By the way, my only complaint about this film, and it's minor, is that the movie is rated R. You do see Rockwell's butt and I wish that scene was chopped out--not because I am a prude but because a lot of teens won't be able to see the film due to it's rating and some adults might avoid it as well. As a parent, I would certainly let my daughters see the movie--it's really something special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant low budget sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to travel from cheadle to Manchester just to see this film but id say it was worth it, it was amazing Sam Rockwell is a brilliant actor and Duncan Jones should be getting more work as a director now that this film is out the effects although low budget looked better than some of the crap CGI effects they put in most films now and this films should also be the re-start of a few low budget sci-fi movies that hopefully be released over the next couple of years to give new directors a chance at being famous and hopefully making good films the only bad thing is that its pretty easy to see that they clone the guy before you see the end but its still a great movie all the same</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best unadvertised movie I've seen since "Below"....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never heard of "Moon" before checking the Internet that weekend to see what was playing in my area. When I saw it was rated R and filmed in England, that was a "Go" for me, and boy am I not sorry (although I did have to drive about twenty miles to the nearest cinema that had it). The problem for me here is that I would have to give away major plot points to discuss this at all coherently, and for the viewer the discovery of these plot points for oneself is a big plus. So here's what I'll say just to try to get you to see it in the (probably limited) time it'll be in theaters. Essentially a cross between "Silent Running" and "Outland" with elements from "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Solaris" mixed in, it features Sam Rockwell (last seen by me a decade ago as a death-row inmate in "The Green Mile") and the voice of Kevin Spacey as a robot. Rockwell's character Sam Bell works alone (or does he?) at a lunar outpost producing helium for use on earth. (The company for whom he works has a slick ad proclaiming their dedication to humanity's needs, so we know they're doubtless up to no good.) He has a three-year contract nearing it's end. He has pictures and recorded messages from his family (suspiciously, no live communication from earth is available). He has the robot attending to his every need; in maybe the movie's best touch, the robot has a "face" consisting of those excruciatingly annoying "smiley face" "emoticon" symbols (the voice is Spacey's trademark monotone). As Bell starts winding down his tour preparing for his anticipated replacement, he starts "seeing things," and that's as far as I want to go plot-wise."Okay," you may be wondering, "exactly what should draw me to this?" A virtuoso performance by Rockwell, making one wonder why he hasn't been a "big star" already; superb special effects--you won't believe this was shot in a studio in only about a month; a sustained mood that becomes ever more ominous yet poignant as it goes along; plot twists that shouldn't strain your credulity nor insult your intelligence; besides, to repeat, it's rated R (although I'm not sure why except for a few F-words). Come on, folks, we need to let the movie moguls know there's an adult market out here, and not just for horror flicks or sex comedies! One more thing: if you think a robot can't "act," watch for when this one gently puts it's mechanical arm on Bell's shoulder; stunning how effective it is...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard of this from commentators, it was along on the lines good effort from first time feature director, Duncan Jones, son of David Bowie.When I did finally come to watch it, this is not a good effort, this is a masterpiece. Not just a good compact script but Sam Rockwell delivering a blistering performance as Sam Bell, a technician living and working in isolation maintaning a Helium 3 mining facility on the moon, with the only real time communication is GERTY (Kevin Spacey), the ROBOT companion. With the help of a bizarre event involving Sam crashing his lunar rover, the truth of his existence dawns upon him as he nears the end of his 3 year contract.What can I say, this is just a good simple and meaningful storyline. And it does not pay homage to sci-fi flicks of the 70s/80s as Duncan Jones the director explains. It's in a class of it's own. It's amazing the director pulled this off on such a small budget, but perhaps, the lack of money for too many effects gives it the edge.</fullReview>

However was pleasantly surprised when the reason for this was revealed. I would compare it to Space Odyssey in terms of trying to portray an as realistic environment as possible. This included the base, equipment, etc. all look and seem believable. If only there were more films of this type. Highlights include: The acting The scenery The plot The cinematography. If only there were more films like this, but if it were up to me, with a more positive atmosphere. To conclude this is a definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Rockwell Steps Up in Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While space conspiracies have been done to death, Moon stands out as the most heartbreaking. Rarely has a science-fiction film made issues such as isolation and the notion of self so affecting. That Moon treats these issues with respect and that it does so with heart and humour makes astronaut Sam Bell's story all the more tragic.Earth scientists have discovered Helium-3, a clean-form of minable energy on the moon. Following the tradition of suspect corporations in sci-fi films, Lunar Industries sends astronauts to operate the mining equipment. Bell, played by Sam Rockwell, is at the end of his three year journey. Struggling with loneliness and betrayal, Bell's physical and mental deterioration is immediately noticeable, and gradually becomes poignant.While obvious influences include 2001: A Space Odyssey, Alien and Blade Runner, Moon diverges from the genre by focusing on the purely human element of space exploration. In a way its closest relative is Gattaca, delivering a pseudo-scientific approach to understanding humanity in a truly cinematic experience. Whilst director and co-writer Duncan Jones includes elements of sci-fi, and enough suspense and mystery to establish an intriguing storyline, the film draws its strength from Rockwell's hugely empathetic and surprisingly humorous Bell. Played by anyone else, Bell could easily be overly-pitiful. Rockwell succeeds in making him likable enough to warrant our affections, making his ultimate, and potentially clichéd, line, "I just want to go home", heartbreaking. Nevertheless the films strength, a focus on character over large scale special effects, could be its commercial weakness. Standard fans of sci-fi might be disappointed by the use of models and limited effects, although they have been used convincingly. Instead the movie is aimed at art-house patrons, and will hopefully garner a cult following. A character piece, Moon remains a sweet and much needed deviation from the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm over the moon about Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all saw Castaway. You didn't? Well you didn't miss anything. It was two plus hours of Tom Hanks pretending he was a good actor and talking to a volleyball. It was completely forgettable and utterly boring. Okay, maybe I'm being a little harsh, but it was a painfully average movie. Tom Hanks tried his best, but he just couldn't pull it off. And the themes of isolation and pain just didn't come through very well. I had a tough time feeling sorry for Tom and his absent wife (even when he got home and found her remarried). I didn't really buy him talking to the volleyball (it felt like he was just pretending to be a little crazy so he could instantly snap back to sanity once he was rescued, and we always knew he would be rescued), and I don't think anyone else did either. I wouldn't say I hated the movie, but I did completely dismiss it a few days after watching it. I absolutely cannot dismiss Moon. This is one of those movies that gets under your skin. It's one of those rare gems that leaves an impression, one of those movies that simultaneously impresses and inspires you. It's one of those movies that lifts you up only after beating you down. The drama is realistic, and it's filled with passion and anger and depression and hope. Sam Rockwell does what Tom Hanks couldn't do, he carries the movie mostly on his own. read the full review at www.tickleishpickle.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Sam Rockwell did one heck of a job in this movie. One of the best pictures of all time and the very best for 2009. Sam should have been nominated for an Academy Award and the movie for all the other attending awards, as well. Pity. Too bad it was a thinking person's movie. The scenes were haunting and the story kept me hanging on edge the whole time. I was trying to guess the ending but, alas, I was completely surprised at the end. If you are looking for a lot of bullets, chase scenes, wrecks and idiotic script then this is not the movie for you. If you want to be placed in deep thought as you watch this movie then see it. If you want to be taken on a cerebral journey, then it's for you. You will become completely engrossed in the movie. Its story and special effects will soon grapple and hold you tight throughout. It will cause you to realize that somethings the future holds for us are not too far fetched after all. You will like the challenge of answering questions that come to mind as you watch. Those questions keep you second guessing until you come to realize that you were a long way down the path of misunderstanding all along. There is no real misdirection as you may start to suspect in the beginning. It is a straightforward movie that will have you going over it in your mind for a long time to come. Settle in for a movie that reminds you of what movies should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man in The Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is the man in the moon. Sam is the lone astronaut on a moonbase on the far side of the moon. He's there to mine helium that is then transported back to Earth. The mining is done remotely, huge machines roam the lunar landscape vacuuming up rocks and dust, extracting the helium. It is Sam's job to retrieve the canisters of helium and ship them off to Earth for consumption. Sam's only companion on the moonbase is Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) which oversees most of the base's operations.Sam is on the last 2 weeks of his three year contract and eagerly awaits his return to see his wife and daughter. Sam is starting to feel the effects of his solitude, he's starting to hallucinate. On one of his runs to retrieve a helium canister and he starts hallucinating causing a collision with the mining machine. Sam awakes to find himself in the medical bay of the moonbase, unable to remember how he got there. He fakes a hull breach to get Gerty to let him outside the moonbase. He returns to the crash site and rescues an astronaut that looks exactly like him. Is Sam hallucinating again? Is he a clone? Is the rescued astronaut a clone? Can he even be sure of what is real? Or what is human? These are the questions Moon's director Duncan Jones presents his audience. While there are no overt references there are echoes of 2001: A Space Odyssey and maybe Alien. While Gerty isn't as malevolent as HAL in 2001 it is a distant cousin to HAL, and perhaps less duplicitous than MOTHER in Alien. Some of the sets seem a little reminiscent of 2001 maybe that's because Jones has been influenced by it. Jones has made an excellent, thought provoking alternative to the more vapid summer blockbuster movies. Go see this before Jones is swallowed up by Hollywood for Transformers 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It always feels like somebody's watching Rockwell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who could you watch in a movie if they were roughly the only actor in the film? It worked with Tom Hanks. "I am Legend" was a hit for Will Smith. Could probably work with Denzel Washington and maybe Brad Pitt. Who came up with the idea that Sam Rockwell, eternally under-appreciated lead actor often used in supporting roles, could pull off such a feat? If you're a Rockwell fan (I am), you know he's up to the task. He delivers big-time as a harvester of energy resources on the Moon, who encounters an unusual, yet familiar individual. There are obvious tips of the hat to "2001" all over this movie, but that's a good film to emulate. Director Duncan Jones does a great job at establishing the isolation of Rockwell's character, Sam Bell, left on the Moon to communicate solely with order-keeping robot, GERTY, voiced by Kevin Spacey.Let's go into everything above in depth. "Moon" doesn't pack the budget of a film like "District 9" or "Star Trek", but successfully creates a plausible Moon surface, lunar domicile and hi-tech mining machines. Its main asset is not in whiz-bang visuals, but in creating an eerie existence for its main character, Sam. In doing so, "Moon" hearkens back to a not-often-visited form of science fiction ? the thinking-man's sci-fi genre. Think of the great movies in this class ? "The Thing", "Outland" and "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". That's good company, and "Moon" belongs there as an excellent mood piece.Unsurprisingly, Sam deals mostly with boredom and restlessness as he finishes up a three-year contract mining The Moon for Helium-3. Space being a lonely place isn't exactly a new concept, but it's handled well here as Sam's reminiscence and longing for a return to his family is coupled with a mysterious (and perhaps nefarious) company that has hired his services. GERTY is Sam's only friend, but being a computer, GERTY is more interested in the tasks at hand than anyone's well-being.I know what you're saying, "Yeah, that's 2001". And you're right. I think the thing that makes "Moon" unique is Rockwell. I think this film benefits from his status as a not-so-leading man. He can embody all the different sides of Sam Bell with equal ease and a great sense of humor. All that time alone on The Moon allows Sam to get to know himself, and he gets more of an extra opportunity than most of us. And as Sam discovers how Lunar Industries is using questionable methods to prolong his employment, Rockwell brings real pathos to his situation, and makes "Moon", in the end, a moving film as well as intriguing science fiction.So, with all this praise, why not four stars? I thought the ending was a little abrupt. When such care is taken to build up this plot to the climax, I wanted a little more time with the denouement?and a cigarette. Finally, all the homage, in the end, makes "Moon" a touch too familiar to take me completely out of my comfort zone like "Blade Runner" or "Dark City" did. I think Duncan Jones proves with "Moon" that he can graduate successfully from commercials to features, and in the future, he won't need deference to great works in order to make his own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as awesome or as twisty as the hype suggests but certainly a very engaging and thoughtful sci-fi (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It happens frequently but the summer blockbuster season makes it worse. Critics are keen to jump on a bad big budget film to make it out to be the worst thing ever because reviews that lay into a film are fun to write. Conversely any film that is actually "good" comes as such a surprise that sometimes it can be over-hyped and over-praised to the point where one goes to a "good" film half-expecting it to be the most amazing thing ever. That has kinda happened with Mood in two ways. Firstly it has been over-praised but secondly much of the praise has been around the "twists" and avoiding talking about plot points for fear of "spoiling" the story.I can respect this approach but in doing this the suggestion is made that this is a film full of plot revelations and twisty surprises ? the former of which is sort of true but the latter is not. Moon does have a very good little story about it that is thoughtful, engaging and quite moving but it doesn't shock with revelations or twists and most viewers will be at least a few minutes ahead of where the film is going ? not because the film is "predictable" but more because it gives the audience respect that we will be able to follow and understand for ourselves to the point where the logic of the situation pulls us along. So, for example, the reason why "original Sam" is getting ill is not really a mystery because it is clear that the "3 year contract" really means "3 year shelf -life"; this is not spelt out for us and it is not slapped down on a table for us to see either ? it just is the case and it makes sense within the film's internal logic.I can understand why some viewers have found this to translate into "nothing happening" or being very slow in delivery but I don't agree with them beyond acknowledging that that was their experience and opinion. To me the simple concept is very well done because it is so focused and tight. Things do not fall into a space battle with guns and explosions but, while there is a forward motion with the plot, a good chunk of the drama comes from the feelings and realisations of the two characters. That said, it is not as smart or as well done as one would have liked. The "news coverage" conclusion feels like it was the easiest way to produce an ending to the plot but it seems too pat and, while it feels like it was meant to "answer questions", by "closing" the story it actually reminds the viewer how many unanswered parts there are to the bigger picture. The character drama is not as good as some would say either but it is helped immensely by Rockwell giving great performance(s). He is part of the reason we feel for his character(s) and are drawn into the film. He would have benefited a great deal from more scenes that stretch him (like the live video link to his daughter) and fewer where he is hanging around but he does still give good work. The supporting cast are limited in input but while Spacey does a good job with his computer, the others are solid enough not to distract in their small roles.Visually the limited budget does show but this appears to have been accounted for by giving the entire production a rather endearing lo-fi feel that does match the reality of the future. Too often everything is shiny, white and clean as if dirt has been eliminated and expense is not a limiting factor; it feels more convincing to have things done on the cheap and be worn and old. It has been said endless times already but it does have an engaging "70's" feel to it and, in the wake of the mindless, boring rubbish of Transformers 2, it is nice to find something good being made under the sci-fi banner. In contrast to the models though, the split screen effects are really very good.Moon may not be the perfect film that some viewers have seen, but this should not be taken as a criticism because it is still a very good, low budget sci-fi. It doesn't totally delivery in the keys areas of plot and character but, even as it falls short of what could have been, it still delivers enough in the way of intelligence, thoughtfulness, silent tension and plot to make it a very good little sci-fi that is well worth seeing if you get the chance. Or, to put it another way, a choice between this and GI Joe ids no choice at all from my point of view!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Of The Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely the most intriguing film of 2009. A study of one mans loneliness, isolation and longing to return home. I wasn't disappointed. The look of the base, the title sequence, the muted atmosphere all added up to a film with a style very similar to the first Alien movie. The director intentionally created it as a homage to such classic sci-fi, along with 2001 Space Odyssey. It succeeds on many levels. In fact, when the character Sam Bell finds and opens a hatch on his Selene base, I half expected Ellen Ripley to pop her head out with a flame thrower. Who needs Sig weaver though, uh? This film contains a damn fine performance from Sam Rockwell! A multi-layered character who is both rich and engaging. Oh, and Gerty is cute (although perhaps an unknown voice actor would have worked better than Kevin 'K Pax' Spacey). See it! My favourite film of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moon is about a future where the majority of mans power comes from harvesting the rocks on the moon and tells the tale of Sam Bell who has almost finished his three-year contract working there.The acting is probably the best and most distinct part of this film. Sam Rockwell is practically the only actor in the entire hour and forty minutes and shows so many sides to this Sam Bell its captivating to watch.The film looks the part. Its not revolutionary, its pretty much classic space station. There were some gorgeous shots of the moon though, the monochrome grey and long shadows very effectively created a sense of cold and isolation. The pacing was off. There was no real suspense leading up to the turning point and the way they dealt with the aftermath was predictable and boring.Granted, new ideas are difficult to come by, so there's nothing wrong with re-using some old one - only it's got to be done better. Moon has taken so much from other films but just hasn't added anything new or different or interesting.Moon is a good film but would be much better if you had nothing to compare it to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad science ruins this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad science ruins this film.First off, the clones. Unless clones and the supporting technology are ridiculously cheap, why would it be more cost-effective to keep an army of clones in reserve rather than put more people on the moon to take care of the base and each other? Previous hard SF treatments of industrial work in outer space always depended on the eccentricities of people to find those who were willing to work in extreme environments for long periods of time. Robert Heinlen was famous for his "space hardhat" individuals like "The Green Hills of Earth"'s Rhysling and the construction workers in "Delilah and the Space Riggers." J. T. McIntosh's "Hallucination Orbit" even goes so far as to put men in orbit around Pluto for up to seven years, figuring they'd do it for the money even knowing the dangers of such isolation.This screenplay treats humans as so vulnerable that a three-year stint only light-seconds from Earth is beyond their capacity, and so expendable that the corporation is willing to kill someone every three years rather than spend the money to replace them via ship or just have a few more people around. If the technology exists to fuse He-3 and create clones with implanted memories, why wouldn't it be a simple matter to just replace a crew every few months? What about the original Sam Bell? Why would he be willing to let copies of himself be killed every three years? Rather than a study of what makes a human being, this is more a representation of what happens when human life becomes cheap. Do the clones have no rights? Does Earth even know about this process? Apparently not, given the voice-overs at the end of the movie, which makes one wonder why the corporation is wasting this technology to produce throwaway superintendents rather than getting rich in the medical line.At only one point did the movie engage my emotions, and that was when clone-Sam-1 had the conversation with "his" teenage daughter and realized that his whole life had just been stolen from him. Maybe if the script had dealt with a few of these side issues, and then focused on how people would truly behave to discover that their lives were a fraud and of no worth, then perhaps we would have had a great film.Instead, we are left with a superficial treatment that might have made a good 30 minute "Twilight Zone" episode.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man and Machine vs. Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the science-fiction films that have been shoved down our throats this summer, I find it most fitting that the best of the lot is a low-budget import from Britain. Moon is this year's Wall-e. Both films arrived with little expectation and are so much better than their competition that I won't sully them by describing how they are superior. Both appear like others in their genre but offer a surprising and well-executed twist that distinguishes them. Wall-e has a positive outlook following an apocalypse. Moon is more "conventional" science fiction. Dehumanizing loneliness and the tyranny of Big Brother are present but Moon is a 2008 picture. The identity of Big Brother, if you could call it that, has been appropriately altered. As in many futuristic space films, humanity has established a base on the moon. We are extracting some chemical or another to power our technology at home. I'll be happy when writers think of a new clichéd plot device. Even though Wikipedia does mention the actual name of the chemical and describes its real-world usage, I want another reason for us to be on the moon. Whatever, I'll save my ranting for a review of a poor film. The only person in this base is Sam Bell, who is under a 3 year contract to extract chemicals before he returns to Earth. His only companion is a nearly sentient computer named GERTY, although he receives electronic messages from his wife and infant child. Bell has an accident at work and awakens to find himself hospitalized. Perhaps due to the familiar plot, there is one large plot twist that I cannot ethically reveal.The duality between Sam (Sam Rockwell) and GERTY (Kevin Spacey) is remarkable. Like other films in which a person communicates with a non-person object, Rockwell is forced to display a wide array of emotions and actually manages to do it. Spacey's voice gives GERTY a contrived innocence that is seemingly sinister but ultimately sympathetic. Sam does not appear to have volunteered for this duty and GERTY doesn't either. Both of them are machines of sorts trapped within celestial prison. GERTY may not have emotions but is capable of understanding humanity better than we are. His character was the source of scorn when science fiction was in its heyday 60 years ago. What science fiction films criticized then has ceased to be a legitimate threat. GERTY is now a hero, who along with Sam must face new Big Brother: the corporate megalith. Big Brother may not be the correct term. This evil spirit doesn't matter what you do as long as you work. Authoritarianism has evolved into disinterest. In this film, evil is not defeated. It's a bleak feature that fits the times in which we live. The overarching antagonist, like the protagonists, is an extension of us. Moon ignores the pervasive underwriting of generic Del-Ray novels and Doom clones. It is a must-see film in a year of impostor and villainous sci-fi movies.Note: Moon (2008 film) is unrelated to Moon (2008 video game), despite their similar subject matter and release date.</fullReview>

It made me think, it made me sad and a plethora of emotions rushed through me while watching the film.Sam Rockwell seriously got screwed over at the Oscars, because his performance in this movie is just magnificent. Duncan Jones, the director of the movie really set the bar high for his next movies, because this is a science fiction masterpiece. Especially considering the relatively small budget they used for the film. They just milked every penny out of that budget to create this and I can really appreciate it when filmmakers do that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Solaris, only a lot less absorbed and more absorbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am reluctant to label this film as "sci-fi". It is a film about loneliness, loss and identity which uses space as a convenient metaphor.The basic plot is very quickly summed up, and does show many similarities with Solaris: man is working alone on a commercial mining expedition to the moon. He is about to be sent back to earth after completing his three year contract for a Korean energy company. His job appears to be basic maintenance of automated mining equipment, and he spends his days carving wooden figurines, growing plants and talking to the computer that helps him with everyday tasks. He is clearly a very lonely man, and comforts himself with dreams and pictures of his wife and daughter back on earth.Shortly before his return to earth, strange things start happening, and this is where the story really starts. The initial assumption, much like in Solaris, is that he is losing his mind. Unlike Solaris however, Moon offers a real, gripping storyline full of unexpected twists from this point on. It has a very similar focus on the inner life of the main protagonist, but explores this both more broadly and more clearly.The central concern of the film is asking firstly what makes us human, and secondly what makes us ourselves. While it does have a satisfying (if cheesy) answer to the first question, it has no answer to the second. It explores the potential human and moral issues involved in exploiting new technology, and asks what we actually value in life - if we don't know who we are, or why we exist, why do we still care? Possible criticisms are that some elements of the plot are never fully explained, and I found the heavy handed socialist theme of the "evil corporation" a bit tediously predictable.Overall, it is an emotionally touching film that nevertheless has a very tight plot and pacing that keeps the suspense up almost to the last scene.</fullReview>

This little gem was made for $5 million, which is paltry by todays studio standards.It was full of special effects and costumes, but didn't need to crash, shoot and smash it's way across the screen.

		<shortDescription>Slow to start, but ultimately gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of this excellent movie is easy to sum up. Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, apparently a technician nearing the end of a three-year assignment at a mining operation on the far side of the moon. His only real company is the operation's talking computer, nicknamed Gerty. One day, he is involved in an accident on the surface, wakes up in the infirmary - and that's when the story really gets going.There's not much to say about the cast since it basically consists of 98% Sam Rockwell and 2% everyone else. Rockwell handles the challenge of playing the same person twice for much of the film with aplomb, being alternately irritating and sober. The scene where one of his incarnations is bopping to pop music while the other is trying to talk to him about their situation is great. The talker resolves it in the best way possible, short of bloodshed! I think it may have been a mistake, however, to have a well known actor (Kevin Spacey) voicing Gerty. Such things work better ? for me, anyway ? if someone less well known, preferably kept anonymous, does the job. Then I am listening to what the voice says rather than the voice itself.In these days of CGI and other hi-tech gizmos, the clunky special effects portraying the lunar surface (loved that starry sky) had a certain nostalgic charm. But the sets were great, with just the right combination of technical sophistication mixed with wear and tear.Watching this reminded me of Noah Kadner's high-quality, but depressing, short film "Today's Life". Luckily, though similar in theme and temperament, this piece kept the quality, but avoided the depression.Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Calling a film "the antithesis to Transformers 2" may not seem the most obvious complimentary statement, yet that has, comically enough, been the most common plaudit bestowed on director Duncan Jones' Moon. Most critics have heralded the film as a welcome bout of intelligence in a summer where science fiction is generally synonymous with explosions. Which is entirely true, and would be an unremarkable compliment, were it not for the fact that to distill Moon to simply being an intelligent film released in a season where thoughtfulness is a rare quality in mainstream cinema would be a notable instance of short- sightedness, for Jones' film is a rather remarkable concoction, and one well worth seeing regardless of the season or year. While the science fiction genre is known for examining the future, Moon, while set 15 years from present time, clearly has its eye on the past. With a wonderfully nostalgic lo-fi veneer, complete with chunky lunar buggies and medical style white walled space station, Jones picks his influences well, paying homage to the wealth of slow burning, existential science fiction ruminations of the 1960s and 1970s (most obviously Kubrik's 2001), both visually and thematically without ever drifting into over the top excessively cheeky referencing. And yet, Moon proves an appealing contradiction, as, despite its lofty, challenging ideas, they are presented in a format far more accessible, unpretentious and easy to follow than most of the past efforts it emulates, as if determined to meld a mainstream template with a more elaborate, art cinema aesthetic. The hybridity works, making Moon far more than a mere throwback film, and a far more beguiling and intriguing take on content both familiar and new.The word of choice is sparse, as Jones captures the cold isolation of solitary employment on a space station with particularly chilling efficiency, using expansive yet claustrophobia inducing sets to deftly craft a sense of continual unease and discontent, exceptionally amplified by Clint Mansell's minimalist piano score. But what makes Jones' film stand out amongst countless other science fiction efforts with coldly pristine visuals ruminating on the essence and meaning of humanity are its welcome moments of warmth and humour. From the blinking smiley face of robotic companion GERTY (superbly voiced by a monotone Kevin Spacey) to protagonist Sam Bell's teary fondling the screen while playing a tape of his daughter back on earth, seldom do such films dare to engage with the heart as much as the brain - less detached and far more engrossing through its emotional resonance. Above all else, it is the exceptional performance of Sam Rockwell which anchors the film. Stuck with essentially a solitary show in a static location, Rockwell delivers a triumphant character study without unnecessary showboating, compellingly portraying Bell's intense loneliness, boredom and gradual mental instability through perfectly calculated frantic bursts between manic energy and subdued pain. Never anything less than riveting while quietly unassuming, the always wonderful Rockwell has rarely been better, and his work here proves concrete testament of his star calibre charisma and presence. Thought provoking yet accessible, slow burning yet consistently engaging, Moon proves the ideal reprocessing of the science fiction of old, blending familiar visuals and themes with recent ones into something fundamentally new. While it may not quite be profound or innovative enough to mark a new staple in the genre, Moon marks a large step for the contemporary relevance of science fiction, being easily worth examining for those seeking out intelligent life in the dark recesses of modern cinema. -8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely one of the all-time greats!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went along with great expectations for this independent sci-fi film - having read the reviews online and in several publications, drawn up some idea of the concept and background, noted that it was by Duncan Jones......all these thoughts whirling in my mind as I took my seat in the cinema.Nothing - repeat, nothing - can prepare you for this movie.Yes - compare it to 2001, or Solaris, or any other great pedantic sci-fi film. Yes - marvel at what has been achieved for so small a budget ($5 million).But....this film left me awestruck. It takes you up and involves you from start to finish, never exploding into mindless violence or loud fiery explosions. It shows just how a single person (if you could call Sam Bell that) is affected after near three years of isolation on the dark side of the moon; how the big corporation milks the small man (possible dig at the big studios????) until that person can no longer operate in a normal, day-to-day fashion; how the progression of the human race can actually be backtracking at times.Do we not all lose a little of ourselves with each passing year? Imagine doing that when all of a sudden you discover that you are not who you think you are and the only honesty emanates (eventually) from your only companion in that isolation, an A.I. unit.The scope of the whole film remains small but the greater aspect of its message is huge - as at the end when Sam has to decide between himself (!!) what to do for the greater good whilst also wanting to be reunited with his family.....which still turns out to throw up greater questions back on Earth.I was blown away by just how thought-provoking the film was. And yet it presented the future with that great 'retro' feel, that sums up many a great era of film, as Sam Bell repeats the same processes, the same daily grind, holding on to the thought of finally meeting his baby girl..I thoroughly recommend this film to any person with even a minor interest in film - yes, go watch your big blockbusters, but to see a truly great film, MOON wins hands down every time.Given nine out of ten for this - there are a couple of noticeable slips and errors but they do not detract from great storytelling.</fullReview>

If not for Moon, it at least adds to his body of work. For someone wanting a tight story with a clear and clean beginning, middle, and end - I suggest something in the kids section. I enjoy movies that make me think and feel. "Moon" definitely succeeded. One could explore the nature vs nurture debate while also studying the interplay between each of the characters. Like most good sci-fi, it's more about psychology than lasers and aliens. The film definitely raises important questions about the individual and what we value in life. Work? Family? Self?

		<fullReview>Nicely pulled off by all concerned though I kind of missed a more mindful treatment of our moon's low gravity.I once asked an official from NASA why we hadn't set up a listening station on the far side of the moon. He mentioned in his answer that psychologically it would be extremely difficult. This movie seems to explore that notion though it's unclear to me whether it's actually supposed to take place on the far side or not.I would have rented the movie if I'd heard it was some long unrelenting saga of psychological deterioration (which I need like a hole in the head). And, though it definitely spends some time on that, it also delves into much more entertaining stuff: Things like questions of identity and what is permissible in our mindless pursuit of profit.I'd have to admit, however, that my wife was bored. Space sagas aren't really her thing and she nodded off a couple of times. I on the other hand enjoyed every minute of it, and I know there are a great many other sci-fi fans out there who would too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Films Of The Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After weeks of waiting, I finally got the chance to see Moon tonight at a local theater. I have to say, I was not disappointed, and it was worth the wait. This is one of the best films of the year, and one of the best Science Fiction films I've seen in a long time. There are some very complex issues that are dealt with here that one rarely sees nowadays on film, and especially in a Sci Fi film. Ethics, morality, sacrifice, and even hope are all examined with care and consideration. I would say that Moon is the very antithesis to a film like Transformers 2, a movie that was almost all special effects brawn, with very little brains. In Moon, an intelligent story is told that was very well written. And although there are few characters, they are still characters that the viewer comes to care for. Sam Rockwell deserves any and all awards that will be given to him for this role. If I had to use only one word to describe his performance, it would be this: Powerful. And when the best picture noms are handed out in January by the Academy, I would be very surprised if Moon is not on the list. Kudos to Duncan Jones for crafting one fine motion picture, and for having the guts to tackle a difficult genre for his first feature length film. This is one that will make many other first time directors green with envy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Rockwell is the Entire Film, Which is Really the Biggest Plus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Moon, the first film by Duncan Jones, David Bowie's son, recalling 2001, or does its excavating station on the far side of the moon just happen to date back to the 2001 epoch, which was indeed eight years ago? I'm prone to the second theory. After the mission carrying Dave Bowman vanished beyond Jupiter, the human race decided to concentrate on the moon, where we were already, you will remember, directing activities. In Moon, the inside architecture of the new lunar station was inspired by the 2001 ship, and the station itself is supervised by Gerty, more of a companionable version of HAL 9000 that elusively bolts around.One can't peg the story's period, but this station on the far side is geared by a single crew member, Sam Bell, played by Sam Rockwell. He is the entire film, which is really the biggest plus. As an actor with such pure and natural presence, he has been criminally underused, and now we are trapped with him all alone with absolutely no one else around, and he must carry the film all by himself, much to our delight. He's working out the final days of a three-year contract and is near breakdown from isolation. Talking to loved ones via video link doesn't do the trick. The predominantly computer-programmed station traverses lunar rock to extract Helium-3, processed to supply Earth with pollution-free power.I want to take a step back and consider some latent issues in the film. In an era when our space and distance barriers are being pushed way outside the human comfort zone, how do we cope with the trials of space in real time? In reduced gravity, how do our bodies handle the diminishing of bone and muscle mass? How do our minds deal with such seemingly infinite cycles of seclusion? The 2001 ship dealt with the corporal trials of its centrifuge. Dave and Frank had each other and HAL. Sam is all on his own, save for Gerty, whose voice by Kevin Spacey proposes he was programmed by the same voice synthesizers used for HAL. Gerty seems sound and affable, but you never know with these cybernated things. All Sam knows is that he's past his best before date, and about to be reprocessed back to Earth. Space is a bleak and desolate hole without mercy or care. Sam has no reliefs at all. Who would enlist for this assignment? What kind of a corporation would ask him to? We, and he, eventually catch on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm deeply impressed by 'Moon', an intelligent science-fiction movie that tells an entertaining and plausible story instead of indulging in sci-fi pyrotechnics. 'Moon' reminds me of '2001' and the first 'Alien' film, and that's high praise indeed.SPOILERS THROUGHOUT. 'Moon' depicts the isolation and the gruelling routine of Sam Bell, the lone human worker serving a three-year hitch in an isolated base on the far side of the moon (so he can't even see Earth overhead), apparently in the year 2026. Pre-recorded messages can be sent to or from people back home on Earth, but real-time contact is not possible. (More about this below.) Sam's only companion is GERTY, a HAL-like (Halloid?) robot which for some reason has a female name but a male voice and identity. (This is never explained, especially since most male workers would prefer to interact with a female voice.) Gradually, we and Sam discover that all is not as it seems. Actor Sam Rockwell is excellent in what's largely a solo performance. (Or a two-hander, as we'll soon see.)Although many aspects of this movie impressed me, I'm especially impressed by the splendid 'exterior' shots of the moon. The S/FX team do a fine job of depicting sunlight on the moon (not remotely like sunlight on Earth) as well as the moon's horizon, which would be much closer to the observer than an Earth horizon. Less effective are the brief attempts at depicting the moon's lighter gravity.The production design is superb: I was impressed by the Eurostile typeface in the moonbase's graphics, and the use of Bank Gothic in the highly original opening credits.Some scenes are confusing when they shouldn't be. Early on, when Sam is alone in the moonbase, we see him in bed while -- for several seconds -- we hear someone running. If Sam is alone, then who's running? Then a cut to the next shot (of Sam on a treadmill, in a later sequence) reveals that this was an audio transition preceding the image transition, but there's no good reason for the discrepancy.Some aspects of the story are intentionally confusing. As in 'Alien', the spaceman learns that the glutcorp on Earth has betrayed him ... although here the betrayal is more plausible and arguably defensible.For much of this film, there are two of Sam Bell on screen in the same shot: is one of him a clone, or an hallucination? And which is real? In these sequences, the split-screen F/X are seamless. I was particularly impressed by a long sequence of the two Sams playing ping-pong rapidly. But why would a moonbase intended for one crewman contain a ping-pong table? (Does the robot play ping-pong?)More questions: why do all the clones of Sam Bell have the same facial mole? (Moles aren't genetic; they occur randomly ... which is why I hate all those movies where relatives have matching moles or birthmarks.) Water must be vitally precious on the moon, so why does Sam have a water shower instead of a sonic-wave device to clean himself without using water? When Sam discovers the moonbase's secret lower level that he's not supposed to enter, why does it conveniently have breathable atmosphere and Earth-strength gravity already running so he can explore it? We eventually learn the glutcorp's false reason for why real-time transmissions between Earth and the moonbase are not possible ... but then, when Sam finally phones his family on Earth, the conversation is in GENUINE real time, which IS impossible: there would be a delay of a couple of seconds while transmissions cross the 250,000-mile gap between Earth and the moon. To say nothing of requiring a comsat in selenosynchronous orbit, since Sam's base is on the far side of the moon. This is a highly intelligent film with a mature story and two solid acting performances by Sam Rockwell at its centre. I look forward to more films by Duncan Jones. My rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>quietly intense, claustrophobic mood piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eschewing the big budget and CGI special effects of most sci-fi films, Moon is a quietly intense, claustrophobic mood piece about the loneliness, isolation and paranoia of an astronaut who has spent too much time alone in space. Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is an engineer manning a mining station on the moon, which is providing vital resources for an energy starved Earth of the distant future. But after an accident leaves him severely injured, Sam comes face to face with a clone of himself, and begins to question his mission and even his own identity. Rockwell delivers a mesmerizing and convincing performance in what is virtually a one-man show. Kevin Spacey provides the voice for GERTY, the computer which controls the moon station, and he sounds alternately caring, controlling or vaguely ominous. Heavily influenced by sci-fi classics like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey or Silent Running, this debut film from Declan Jones (the son of legendary rock star David Bowie) is truly something of a space oddity.</fullReview>

A one man mission with a three year contract. The current employee of lunar industries is coming up to the end of his 3 year stint and is desperate to get home to his wife and newly born daughter, however all is not as it seems. Upon investigating a damaged piece of machinery he discovers another person, himself. Sam isn't sure whether he is mad or if there is something more going on.Something of an emotional roller-coaster, not in the least bit pretentious with the plot, rather focusing on the moral end ethical implications of Sam's predicament. There are many scenes where holding back tears can be rather difficult.Overall, this is one of the best films I have ever seen, made even better with Clint Mansells haunting soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite film of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody that knows me knows that I'm a sucker for a Sci-Fi story. Just two years ago I was bowled over by Danny Boyle's shimmering spectacle "Sunshine" which provided human drama And Made for one intense thrill ride. Two years one and Duncan Jones releases "Moon" a low budget, human drama that just happens to be set out in space starring Sam Rockwell, who happens to be one of my favourite actors working today. All of these ingredients should mix perfectly to create a film that's highly emotive, beautifully acted and a sight to behold but is this moon landing a giant leap, or just a small step.An astronaut miner extracting the precious moon gas that promises to reverse the Earth's energy crisis nears the end of his three-year contract, and makes an ominous discovery in this psychological sci-fi film starring Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey. For three long years, Sam Bell has dutifully harvested Helium 3 for Lunar, a company that claims it holds the key to solving humankind's energy crisis. As Sam's contract comes to an end, the lonely astronaut looks forward to returning to his wife and daughter down on Earth, where he will retire early and attempt to make up for lost time. His work on the Selene moon base has been enlightening -- the solitude helping him to reflect on the past and overcome some serious anger issues -- but the isolation is starting to make Sam uneasy. With only two weeks to go before he begins his journey back to Earth, Sam starts feeling strange: he's having inexplicable visions, and hearing impossible sounds. I could go into more depth about the plot of this film but, honestly the less about this film you know the better.Photobucket Firstly the film looks sublime. Much like Danny Boyles "Sunshine" this low budget spectacle uses effects to enhance the story rather than distract from it. Mix that with some harrowing shots of the environment and you've got a film that both looks fantastic and, thanks to Clint Mansell's superb score, sounds great too. Sam Rockwell is a versatile actor, his range is absolutely phenomenal. One moment he is relaxed and friendly the next he's ready to slit your eye open with a pocket knife...but let's not spoilt that for you. Simply put. This is a Oscar calibre performance My only major grip with the film was with Kevin Spacey as GERTY who, does a good job, but often distracts you from the realism that the film strides for. All of these elements work just great, mixing together to display some fantastic presentation. It's the story and the direction that leads me to believe that this is the greatest film of 2009.The story is told at a steady pace. The film never ruses and the pacing feel organic, but its this slow pacing that made me feel distinctly uncomfortable while watching this film. The filmmakers never shy away from showing you a deserted hallway (cribbing heavily from "Alien)and calling it disturbing is a severer understatement. So much so that once the film decided to give us answers you're so involved that seem personal to you. The film never shies away from pulling on your heartstrings either; a phone call to earth makes for one of the most emotional moments of the year. You might not think that "Moon" is the greatest film of the year, the things I've described may not appeal to you. However, don't dismay this film. Even if it doesn't sound like it for you please go see it. If just to make your opinion on it.Verdict: Moon is a stunner on many levels. The direction is methodical and precise mixed seamlessly with the tour de force performance from Sam Rockwell. An eerie, disturbing and moving film, but not without occasional bursts of humour, Moon is a refreshing antidote to the dumb action-orientated futuristic fodder has dominated cinemas in recent years. For these reasons alone "Moon" takes it's place as one of my favourite films of all time and my favourite film of 2009. 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this with a group of fellow film students, so they were ready to bash the film as we were standing in line at the concession stand. There were a lot of negative/mixed commentaries about set design about homages to Blade runner and the pacing that I heard after the movie, but to me it stood as a really fantastic indie (well not really it's still a 5 million budget) a true directorial debut of Duncan Jones, the movie has great poetry to it in my opinion which is hard to achieve in sci-fi movie. Love the idea of the script - certainly something that hasn't been exploited as much in indie films. It did run a bit too long but as I think about it you kind of needed that to play it as a character study rather then a suspense sci-fi movie. I get the thinking process behind casting of Spacey, but that was a bit of a problem for me personally just because he is enormous and his voice is so overpowering in this scale of a film your mind jumps to that immediately when you hear him for the first few times. The movie to me also had that great feeling of an 80's sci-fi mainly because of set design and the fact that this genre lately has only been done with ridiculous budgets. Please see it and judge for yourself because it makes an unique impression on pretty much anyone who sees it</fullReview>

Although not entirely original such as things like the Hal style computer etc, it made up for with its story and amazing direction and acting.Its easy to think that it would have been put together easily as it flows seamlessly, but when you think that many scenes would have been filmed separately with Sam Rockwell playing 2 characters and interacting with himself filmed from a prior shot and then edited/acted as if in the same room, having the same conversation. What a feat it must have been. Its been done before, but i haven't seen it given this degree of authenticity before especially for a whole movie.I absolutely LOVEd this film. I also loved SUNSHINE, but (spoilers...) The burnt man with super strength at the end was ridiculous and spoilt a near perfect film for me, his character was also unnecessary. MOON however didn't cheapen itself like that. The whole thing was plausible and it didn't need to resort to an OTT grand finale to win blockbuster points.I loved the slow pacing too, it really puts you there with them and lets you feel the space around them rather than blinds you with any quick cut forgettable action. Moon is a film that every scene i remember weeks after seeing it.Also welcome to the big screen is MATT BERRY (Garth Marenghi's Darkplace/IT Crowd etc) He is my favourite comedic actor in Britain, and it was a pleasure seeing him in this film. Though it was only a very short and fuzzy cameo, and wasn't comedic, i still laughed out loud just for the audacity of having him appear on screen. Imagination kicked in at that point i guess. One gripe, I would rather MATT BERRY been the voice of the computer rather than Kevin Spacey. Now that would have been interesting.Another great thing about moon, is that almost everything that happened i didn't see coming. It felt predictable a lot towards the end, but none of what i predicted happened, it curve balled instead and changed course. This was refreshing, (if not a little disappointing at times, because some of the predictions would have still been pretty cool.) Anyway, One I cant wait to own on Blu-ray, and it would be a great box set twinned with Sunshine, a prettier but inferior film.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old style sci-fi for people who like something to think about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent sci-fi, particularly notable for its use of physical model work rather than cgi to create the moon base and lunar landscape, giving a reality often missing from todays bigger budget offerings.Also Sam Rockwell's performance is nicely understated with an immense amount going suitably unsaid to add yet another layer of reality that over scripting his characters thought process would most likely have removed.If you like Bladerunner, 2001, Solaris and other similar films, you'll love this. If you're looking for big explosions and girls in tight rubber, you're looking in the wrong place, but go and see it anyway cause you may be surprised at how enjoyable true sci-fi can be.And as sci-fi should, the film has something to say about technology that may loom only just over our horizon as well as about current attitudes to humanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zowie Bowie (a.k.a. Duncan Jones) has completely knocked this one out of the park, to use a baseball metaphor. He has conceived and directed this art-house science-fiction masterpiece, which I'd rank right up there with all my favorites. I'll happily go see whatever he decides to direct next.(To give this some reference point, my favorites tend towards the dark and thoughtful and include Blade Runner, Silent Running, Dark Star, 2001, Iron Giant, and Gattaca, in no particular order and for various reasons.) This film surpasses them all for existential musings, corporate malfeasance and the most understated zinger of an ending. Pay _real_ close attention at the very end.The acting is excellent. Kevin Spacey is superb as the voice of Gerty 3000, as is Sam Rockwell as the excessively flesh-and-blood Sam Bell. The science part is pretty good, mirroring some very real strategies for mining the moon. And, I just can't say enough about the story. Rock solid sci-fi for real old-school sci-fi fans of dark fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those people who say this film is a knock-off from 2001 A Space odyssey, please go see this film... yeah there is a computer that talks in this film and yeah it takes place in space. There are many films that contain these basic elements, but none of those movies come close to the clever film-making that was involved in Moon. This goes to show that films do not need a high budget in order to be good. The acting by Sam Rockwell is amazing and has inspired me to watch some of his other films. The visuals are incredible and the overall story was breathtaking. This movie unlike many has an emotional impact from beginning to end that makes you want to watch over and over again. I for one cannot wait to see this film again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realist, contemporary sci-fi drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An impressive debut feature with a super central performance from Sam Rockwell. The film is unashamed of its predecessors which are clearly: 2001 (a Hal-like character called GERTY); Solaris (the existential drama of dealing with a doppelgänger); and Alien, for its realism.If there's one serious criticism to be made of this film it's in the handling of the dialogue. It's a treacherous path that Duncan Jones must tread between making Sam into a terse paranoiac or a cipher for our own misgivings about what's going on, i.e. whether or not he should engage GERTY in dialogue to exposit and (possibly) explain his situation. There are focus-drifting silences which, whilst frustrating, may be part of the aesthetic but never really feel right one way or another. The Moon is not a player in this film but the stage on which new dramas are met and struggled with.This apart, the rest of the film is overwhelmingly assured, troubling but always tending towards some sort of positive narrative &amp; moral outcome. Rockwell brilliantly manages to create two marginally but consistently different personae. Yet not once does he resort to great melodrama or epiphany, keeping all his discoveries and actions within the realism that is such an asset overall. This film is a sci-fi film but doesn't use anything otherworldly to shock us. Instead we are presented with a number of conundrums familiar from the films listed above as well as present-day scientific advances which require universal, moral - and emotional - adjudication.The production design deserves a special mention, Tony Noble creating a believable Moon-surface and industrial building, well-shot by Gary Shaw. I also rather liked the 'smiley' idea for GERTY's VDU, which is well-used without being glib. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Great Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was ridiculously fortunate to see this film at NASA JSC, with Duncan Jones providing pre and post movie commentary. We did try to have a brief discussion about Helium-3 and the lunar regolith, after he teased us about being worried that he had made all sorts of scientific errors and expected to be ripped apart with technical questions. It's a great movie that dabbles in a little morality, and the human psyche. I knew nothing about it going in, and I thought the twist was excellent. I was really glad Duncan Jones was there afterwards for commentary. I'm looking forward to taking some friends to see it (so I can watch it again!) and I really can't wait to get the DVD with the commentary. It did get just a touch racy - but nothing standard TV doesn't show, and of course the language is fairly strong. We did have an age range from infant to elderly in our audience, and Duncan Jones was kind enough to tell the parents before the movie started (and he apologized - he was so sweet). So younger children beware.That being said, here come some "spoilers" I guess...As a sci-fi nerd, I loved the nods to the classic sci-fi. I thought GERTY's parallel to HAL 9000 was very clever. I also like the resemblance of the communication towers to the obelisk. Some interesting tidbits: The ghost figure of the girl on the moon is supposed to be Eve, Sam is having one of a few 'twin-moments' with his original self.The name of the base is written in Korean, and if I remember correctly it means "Love" - a tribute to Jones' then-girlfriend.Read the default Sam-clone's T-shirts. ^_^Jones gave a lot of thought to the design and layout of the base, (though I didn't get to ask how the base maintains artificial gravity ^_~.\/.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One truly Solitary film of ones own illustration of the soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to drive a far distance to be able to watch this movie because of the limited release. However the fact that it was being released here on the exact day of my birthday and knowing I would not be disappointed I had to make the trip to watch this.Boy was I glad I did what an exquisite film! This is no Michael Bay explosion fest, it is a dramatic sci-fi thriller with thought provoking ideas and what would be considered immoral and non ethical for humanities future. Think of such themes to help describe the movie, Man vs. Man, Man vs. Nature, Man vs. Machine. This has easily become top 10 movie of the year. Duncan Jones did a fantastic job but what really stands out like no other is the brilliant performance by Sam Rockwell. Such an ability to play emotions is a thing of beauty, and if he is not recognized by the academy this year it would be a crying shame.This Movie's premise is that it is the distant future and we are using Helium 3 that we harvest from the dark side of the moon and transport over to earth. The entire station is run by a machine named Gerty and one man named Sam Bell who is on a 3 year contract. Sam has 2 weeks left before he gets to fly home and be with his family but a series of events lead to a hidden mystery revealed and the abuse of technology is truly a horrific thing. Sam's push towards finding himself and what is most important and defines his life drives this movie forward. Without giving away anything there are turns and ethical boundaries that are crossed and just imagining yourself in his or the company's shoe it would make you think twice.A real intellectual film that we have been lacking as of late with all these summer action block busters, I highly recommend watching this movie not only to support the independent market but to show your appreciation to all who worked on it and promote Sam Rockwell's performance. One of my Favourites in some years.10/10 ~XTC</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great sci-fi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was debating a 8 or 9 and the only reason I was debating the 8 was because nothing really popped out for me as being a fantastic moment in the movie. It was a collection of great ideas and some top-notch acting, but there was very little that made me stand up and go this is fantastic except for the music. There were a few moments when the score really added to the film and I loved the variety and how the score was approached in a fairly simplistic manner. There always seemed to be a main instrument underlining the score for any particular moment and was not over powered by the rest of the instruments. I am always watching DVD extras where the composer describes how each character has its own instruments, but honestly it is always lost in the viewing of the movie. This was not the case here. There were some great piano melodies and a sweet bass part in the beginning. Also the lullaby type melody at the end when Sam1 is looking up at the stars is a piece and fits the movie perfectly. So enough about the music. The movie is a great debut from a director which I will keep my eye on in the future. The story is original and presented in the way that keeps the viewer guessing what happens. SAM ROCKWELL. What can you say about this performance. It is spot on and I literally could not believe my eyes when it come to seeing the different versions of Sam. You could see it, but wow. The way he held himself and really allowing himself to play two different versions of the same actor will go down in history as the way to play twins or clones from this point on. I hope for a Oscar nomination for this. I have not seen another performances this year that have stood out like that (or in a long time for that matter). The last great one was probably DDL in There Will be Blood. I love the fact that this movie is the perfect place to begin debates on a lot of topics that are actually becoming relevant in our society and culture that people are not aware of or decide to ignore. The obvious being the morality of cloning, but there are a lot more. I am perfectly happy with this movie and will recommend it and would like to sit down and watch it again at some point. Good movie. I hope we will get more good sci-fi like this in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really science fiction, but exploration of our practical near-future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie that brings something new, as a thriller, a drama. It is not merely science fiction. I have to compliment the filmmakers on excellent writing, a gripping, suspenseful mystery that leads us on clever plot twists, and wonderful acting.For those who may not keep up with current space developments, this film is an incredibly timely, thoughtful scrutiny of what it would mean to make money off of probably the only potentially commercial resource in space, the Helium-3 on the Moon. There are real, practical questions that people are working on NOW to make this a reality. Fusion energy from He-3 is still only a theoretical idea, but it is definitely there in theory and under development. Other issues not resolved: Can we set up space colonies for people to live in, or is this a pipe dream, the reality being that it is way too expensive to support human life on a non-habitable planetoid (where are your tax dollars going for NASA's manned missions?). Can people really survive mentally in such isolation away from our home planet? Is human labor still better to have than robotic labor in space? What would be the international commercial protocols for exploitation of resources on the Moon -- can one company be granted such a monopoly, and does this inevitably lead again to corporate exploitation of labor or subjugation of people through manipulated political consent and deceit, as happened with oil? With regard to other life support issues in this film, there might be some quibbles, but I won't bother, otherwise I'd have to write some spoiler and give away the mystery, and I think the suspension of disbelief is okay in this case, anyway.This is not really science fiction at all: it is a fictional exploration of current research questions, ethics issues, business ideas, and political debate! What a relief from all that tiresome guns-and-battles science fantasy.A film with solid content on real issues, in a well-structured, entertaining story with a sympathetic character, and excellent acting. This film deserves much wider release. (Dang it, why didn't I think of this story? Great idea!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A limited budget and multiple referential nods (most notably, and rather effectively, to the 'countdown timer' plot device in Outland) do not detract from a relatively original main premise that is beautifully handled by Duncan Jones. If there is a flaw in the film, then perhaps it is in the lack of urgency shown by the main character(s) in the face of a rapidly approaching sticky-wicket destiny, together with some (I felt) improbable dialogue between the double leads; but then, who knows what you'd say to your doppelganger, should you ever cross paths? But this is mere hair-splitting, for the work is a thoroughly engrossing ride, demonstrating once again the old adage that no amount of special effects budgets can replace a good story well told. In particular, I felt the director generated enormous compassion towards Sam once he becomes aware of his origins/predicament, in a way that I'd perhaps only previously experienced in Blade Runner. A worthy addition to the 'man alone in space' sci-fi genre; 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having a slight (huge) obsession with space, I can't believe I hadn't heard of this film until browsing the movie store about a year ago -catching my eye because of Sam Rockwell.It is now on my 'never be the same again after watching this' list.Watching it home alone on a rainy dark afternoon, I experienced the full impact of the designed purpose of this film: to really FEEL the crushing yet silent extent of isolation and disconnection drowning Sam Bell. It was absolutely haunting. The sole location of storytelling being the Moon is pivotal for succeeding this, and seeing Sam exist only either surrounded by airtight walls, airtight vehicles or airtight suits brings an overwhelming feeling of sadness and a heightened awareness of your own surroundings. A short 5 second dream sequence Sam has, shows the camera sweep over the sleeping, peaceful forms of him and his wife, before zooming under the bed sheets to a distraught looking Sam clutching at, trying to grab hold of the bodies of himself and his love is truly one of soul piercing moments that depicts this.Sam Rockwell is sensational as Sam Bell, his performance is so effortless and kept me never knowing how he was going to behave with each new revelation. The first event of the film which sets things in motion is very intelligent and you are left with the feeling that something is not right, which progresses to what the hell is going on, before reaching - Oh My Dear Space Nuggets! And keeps you reeling until the final few and tense moments of the film. Sam makes you laugh and relate to, yet specific scenes at differing intervals will form a horrible lump in your throat and have you quietly sobbing thanks to the execution of Rockwell's impeccable timing and ability, particularly after the discovery of a certain hidden area of his moon base. Gerty, the Robot on base voiced by Kevin Spacey is amazing, having you wondering at times if his intent of 'I want to help you' is really what it seems. Yet even this mechanical character will bring on a tear or two toward the finish.The visual effects are strangely realistic, which really makes this harder ( in a good way) to experience as it is quite confronting. This film has no heavy action, fancy space guns, or otherworldly sinister beings, but is in many ways more satisfying - rather than having you fear what is out in the entities of space, it has you afraid of the doings of a place you call home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reviews Of Unusual Size!Re: Astronaut Sam Bell, who has spent the last few years on a solitary assignment on the moon, watchdogging a mining conglomeration of machines, is nearing the end of his shift. He's fallen into a decent, if claustrophobic routine, sculpting a small village, checking the machines, chatting with his computerized nanny, GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). But he starts to have some problems. Spiralling deeper into what may be insanity, Sam starts to question almost everything, including his very existence.Outstanding: This movie was fantastic. Rockwell is amazing and funny and tragic, sometimes all in the same scene and GERTY, with it's animated emoticon screen and deadpan voice is pitch-perfect. Unacceptable: The only thing that I think is unacceptable about this movie is that I can't watch it every night.Summary: Jones directs this with a calm hand, swooping through the abandoned base smoothly, giving the entire movie a bit of an alien feel and Rockwell,, who I like in a lot of things gives one of his best performances. I'm not normally a huge Sci-Fi fan, but movies like this really hook me. A fantastic movie.5/5Notes: Duncan Jones is the son of David Bowie, and his second film, Source Code has just been released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar worthy performance and film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot in just 33 days for a paltry $5 million by first time director Duncan Jones, MOON is as much of a breakthrough for this unknown director as DISTRICT 9 was for (relatively new) Neill Blomkamp. Yes, it's THAT good.Clocking in at only 97 minutes, the film also gives a sense of urgency to a situation that easily could have been snooze inducing. Instead, Moon will have you on the edge of your proverbial couch, cheering on its main protagonist(s) and asking tough questions about big business, genetic research, and what it means to be human.Sam Rockwell (FROST/NIXON) is in almost every frame and pulls in an Oscar caliber performance (although I doubt he'll get nominated since this isn't a big budget flick and hit only a limited number of theaters before going to DVD). Rockwell plays Sam Bell, a lonely man. In fact, he is the only man at a moon-base that collects Helium-3, a valuable energy commodity that gets shot back to Earth. Sam's only companion is a Hal-9000-ish machine called Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey, RECOUNT) who's sole job is to protect Sam. But not for long, because Sam's three year contract at the lunar base is coming to a close and he's ready to return to his beautiful wife and daughter back home. But an accident injures Sam and he awakens in the infirmary with Gerty caring for him.Memory gaps and surprisingly good physical condition (after such a bad accident) allows Sam to get back to work quickly. But he soon discovers a stranger trapped in a vehicle, and this stranger looks a lot like Sam.As the two Sam's fight, argue and eventually gain an understanding of what they are, a terrible realization hits them both. It is a poignant, graphic and horrible moment that will have many a hair standing up on peoples' necks when they see what has happened and what lengths a corporation is willing to go to in order to minimize expenses.The time spans are fascinating and leave much open for discussion. How long can one truly last living alone on the moon? How much radiation exposure would you get? And how long, genetically, was Sam designed to last? None of the answers are readily available, but most viewers will be asking themselves these things long after the movie has finished running its final credits.Congratulations must be given to director Duncan Jones for chasing after Sam Rockwell to do this role; he was, no doubt, the absolute perfect person to do it. Also, the miniature moon-scape scenes were phenomenal and never looked cheap or forced, as did the lunar station.The music was the perfect mix of creepiness and forlorn so that you really don't know how to feel about Sam and his predicament at the end. Empathy is there for sure, but what good it does is anyone's guess.Looking for a great independent film that you won't soon forget? Shoot for the Moon.</fullReview>

I liked the contrasts between the environment so sterile and this guy, installing chaos, just by being alive and struggling with isolation and solitude. What a beautiful idea to use Kevin Spacey voice for the computer, not anymore a machine but something rather human in its cold and moderate way. Beyond the ethical question of cloning, the confrontation of a man with himself, "In camera", is oppressing first, because of the time difference between them/himself, but it's so much a reflection (!) on individuality and differences as well. At the end there are no clones. I had some good laughs too, as it seems Duncan Jones and Nathan Parker share a good sense of humour. Oh and by the way, we'll have a blue moon soon.

		<shortDescription>A truly extraordinary sci-fi film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first sight, Moon looks like an hybrid between 2001 and Silent Running, but I think it would be unfair to say that, because although it shares some narrative and stylistic elements with those two classics of the sci-fi genre, its story is totally different, and it presents fascinating ideas about human identity and the function of memory as the individual basis.Besides, this extraordinary film has brilliant moments of suspense, humor and a perfect atmosphere of loneliness.Revealing too much about the story from this film is forbidden, because big part of its attractive is on the gradual discovery of data and events which clear the situation from the main character, and they offer a fascinating psychological study.And something which helps that psychological study to be so interesting is Sam Rockwell's phenomenal performance.His performance is so credible and natural that the spectator feels identified with the events his character lives.I think this is Rockwell's best performance to date, something which means a lot when we contemplate the fact he has brought many excellent performances as interesting characters like, for example, the pusillanimous cowboy of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford or the multifaceted murderer from Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.I hope that his monumental performance in Moon will get recognized by the Oscars and other awards, because he would really deserve it.Even though we only hear the voice from Kevin Spacey, he also made a very solid job by finding the perfect grade of personality and indifference the robot GERTY needs to express the "feelings" trapped between conflictive directives which test its conscience.I also have to applaud the detailed models which represent the lunar surface, and the perfect cinematography which complements the illusion of scale and deepness.I liked to see that, on these times of visual excesses, someone decided to exploit the innocent tools from decades ago, corrected and improved by some digital touches.The best elements from this film are definitely Rockwell and the brilliant screenplay, which challenges our expectations and is based on fascinating ideas in order to express a deep and interesting message.In the tradition of the best science fiction, Moon combines intellectual challenges with an excellent narrative to bring a reflection on human condition.This film is a real masterpiece, and it is one of the best ones I have seen this year.So, Moon deserves the most enthusiastic of the recommendations, because it is hugely entertaining and it leaves us thinking at the same time.We need more movies like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film exploring the dynamics of hope, faith, morality, and greed. Above-average script-writing, a refreshing lack of overdone clichés, decent leisurely pacing that didn't rush the film and excellent acting put this heads and shoulders above other films from the get-go. I liked this movie more than I expected I would. The theater I watched it at was almost full so it seems good word of mouth has gotten around about this film. I liked the space base setting other recent sci-fi films have shiny surfaces that are mechanistic with impossibly perfect technology, I liked the almost retro chunky technology feel of the set it really humanized it. I loved Gerty's simple low-tech emoticons, it added to the film. The two Sam's interacting with each other was compassionate and almost brother-like especially when the "older" Sam teaches the new Sam to carve. Surreal moments like where the two Sam's play Ping-Pong helped lighten the mood. I loved the ending with the media as I cheered for the Sam that made it. Slight Biblical references with names like Eve, and the mining machines are named Matthew, Judas etc. but this is a Western movie so it is to be expected. To put my review in context I hate the latest Terminator Salvation movie, but loved the Star Trek movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a year so many weak and disappointing movies, this is a gem. It not only stands out among movies released in 2009, it stands out among science fiction movies in general. And let's make sure we're on the same page with the term "science fiction." Lord of the Rings is not science fiction! It's fantasy. Why people would confuse that I have no idea. Star Wars is a gray line. Space Opera (which is how Star Wars is defined) is fantasy in the guise of science fiction, because it's not about scientific concepts, it just uses motifs borrowed from science fiction in a fantasy context. Fantasy is all about magic and the impossible, science fiction (that is hard science fiction) is all about what is possible or may be possible within the realm of science as we currently understand it. Moon is science fiction, and it's a rarity. It's very simply a story about a guy up on the moon by himself. Which on paper looks like it would be very boring. But it's not. Actor Sam Rockwell carries the entire film by himself and does an amazing job at building a very suspenseful plot.This is a limited release, so you have to hunt it down, but it's worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a true marvel that Moon got made at all when it is so out of step with current film making trends and its all the more remarkable that it turned out to be an excellent film showcasing everything that can be good about low budget independent cinema and announces débutant director Duncan Jones as a real talent to watch in the future. The film stars Sam Rockwell as Sam Bell, the one man crew of a mining station on the dark side of the moon on a three year contract with only an endlessly cheery computer GERTY, voiced with brilliantly creepy calm by Kevin Spacey, for company. While the base is mainly automated Sam is required for maintenance and monitoring. His live communication link to Earth is down and he relies on video messages from his wife and child for comfort as he comes up to the end of the contract and the limits of his sanity. Whilst on a routine repair mission to one of the base's remote harvesters he suffers a bad accident and well, to reveal further would ruin the movie.Sam is one of Rockwell's best performances in a roller-coaster career, here he is able to constrain the 'zanier' aspects of his performances whilst still portraying someone on the ragged edge of their soul. His character wears the psychological scars of such extreme loneliness with such pitiable sadness that within minutes of the film's opening the audience has to question what kind of man would submit to these conditions, that reveal, when it comes, is a quite brilliant turn. Whilst praising Rockwell's performance I have to mention Spacey's voice acting that uses age old sci fi conventions about thinking computers to twist our expectations and encourages the audience to speculate ad constantly re-evaluate GERTY's motivations. GERTY'S design also evokes sci fi of old with his clunky panels and simple smiley face screen, a facet reflected in the base itself. A sparse and dirty environment, giving the impression of industrial space exploration, not the sleek lines and lens flares of the modern Star Trek but a vision of corporate exploitation. Everything about the base, from its single person crew to its basic food and living quarters and its clunky moon buggies reeks of a company spending as little money as possible for the biggest profit. The whole piece represents a throwback to the paranoia of the 1970's, sci fi's boom years, when space was seen as just another place ripe for exploitation by greedy corporations and authoritarian governments.When sci fi was created it was typically used as a means with which to examine humanity in extreme circumstances and the universality of the human experience. That has become lost lately, and notably this summer, as it becomes a tool for Hollywood to create ever larger explosions and ever shallower characters. This summer has already seen Wolverine, Star Trek, Terminator: Salvation and Transformers 2 assault the senses to varying degrees of success but with hardly a moment for the audience to catch their breath between them they epitomise the ultra high tempo of modern sci fi film-making. In that context Moon slow, thoughtful approach comes as a real shock to the system, here characters engage and discuss, they contemplate in silence as they try to comprehend the enormity of their discoveries and when the twists come they are slow reveals that the audience are trusted to understand without a flip chart and diagrams. Moon is one of those interesting, neat films that come along every so often to show what sci fi can still achieve and is destined for a long life on DVD. A thoroughly recommend sci fi slow burner on the nature of identity, find it, watch it, discuss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A welcome return to sci-fi core values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Moon' represents a very successful return to sci-fi as those of us who *read* sci-fi understand it. There are no monsters, no disembowelling, no gratuitous sex, no car chase equivalents. What's more it's an original story, rather than yet another poor adaptation of a sci-fi novel! There is simply one man in extreme and somewhat inhuman circumstances trying to understand what it means to be human. There is no attempt to shock or revolt us just to get a reaction, instead we are treated as intelligent and discerning viewers with the ability to reflect on what we are seeing and our own responses to things.The film moves slowly in a way that invokes '2001'. There is time to be thoughtful, which some viewers seem to find "boring". It is a reminder that once upon a time films did not flicker by with epilepsy inducing rapidity, bombarding us with light and sound and action until thinking is not even an option. 2001 is invoked in other ways as well but Jones decides not to follow the masses down the well worn road, but cuts a new path that is quite a delight. There is plenty of time to experience your own reactions to the dilemma which is quite rare in sci-fi movies.Moon raises serious grown-up issues and leaves you to decide what to do about them. It's not a polarised good/evil, light/dark kind of Hollywood movie - it is about a subtle moral issue, and again this seems to leave some viewers confused and flailing.Sam Rockwell is a credible actor, and some of the special effects (again muted and fully in context rather than the usual blare) are really very clever. As the truth dawned it occurred to me that Duncan Jones is a talented writer and director, and that I can hardly wait to see what comes next. Let's hope he's not a one hit wonder as I really want to see more of this kind of thing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is much to admire in this film; everything from Sam Rockwell's tremendous performance to the special effects on the lunar surface (all done with miniatures). The musical score by Clint Mansell is also excellent; slowly building until the end where it really cuts loose. I thought it was good back in 2009 when I had a 30 mile round-trip to see it; but it was even better this time around. I don't know whether it's because I've seen so many other films in the mean time or what; but it really struck a chord with me this time! If you love your sci-fi then it's one I can heartily recommend.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 9.6/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Moon" is a brilliantly psychological film driven by Sam Rockwell's utterly incredible performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I want to go home" Duncan Jones' Moon is a magnificently beautiful character study and a dazzlingly complex and ambitious sci-fi film. Aside from some rather subtle similarities to other genre classics, the film rarely feels unoriginal, mostly due to the masterful storytelling and superb direction. The pace is never compromised by trite or useless scenes, but flows rather seamlessly from one harrowing moment to the next.Sam Bell is an astronaut miner stationed on the moon. He's nearing the end of his contract with Lunar Industries. A diligent employee for three arduous years, he has been made to remain separate from his family and all interaction with others. His home has been Selene, a moon base where he has spent his time. The only one he talks to is a computer named GERTY. Spent in complete isolation, he ponders his eventual return to earth and his family. Two weeks prior to his return, his communication with earth fails. After an accident occurs, Sam discovers something that forces him to doubt his own sanity and edge closer and closer to the breaking point.Duncan Jones and co-writer Nathan Parker are able to constantly keep things fresh and exciting throughout. Although slow at times, the deftly hypnotic pace allows the viewer to emotionally connect to such a degree that the film never becomes boring because of it.Sam Rockwell has been one of my favorite actors for a number of years and has been brilliant in quite a few films, and yet he manages to completely outdo himself here. His portrayal of his character is hauntingly emotional and layered to the point where every single scene he's in is perfectly compelling. His performance is absolutely riveting and is clearly one of the best performances in a film in recent memory.The cinematography is consistently breathtaking and wonderfully assists the direction. The score by Clint Mansell is another beautiful piece of this genuine work of art.Duncan Jones is an amazing director who has debuted with an incredibly thought-provoking, hauntingly complex film that deserves any number of awards it hopefully receives. It is truly an outstanding achievement that should be recognized for years to come as a genre-defining masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Sci-Fi thriller that will make you think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me explain to you what a great movie Moon is:Some movies are great because of the supporting cast. Some have tremendous soundtracks that set the tone for every scene. Some have perfectly timed and well executed hilarious gags.Moon has none of these. The cast is made up of five total people on camera, plus the voice of Kevin Spacey via computer. Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, a man contracted to mine the moon for precious resources that are shipped back to Earth, providing 70% of our planet's energy. He is nearing the end of his three year contract, and cannot wait to make the return trip to our blue marble and see his wife and daughter.As he prepares to come home, with under two weeks left, he suddenly starts having some strange hallucinations and his mind plays tricks on him. His lunar rover crashes, and when he returns to base, he meets another person who looks and sounds just like him.I'm going to stop summarizing the movie here, to avoid SPOILERS, though a few may trickle in.I haven't seen any of Rockwell's other movies, to the best of my knowledge, but I can assure you that this is his finest performance. He is in every scene since he is the only living person on the moon. Spacey does an adequate job as the helpful computer, devoid of personality. All of the computer's lines are delivered via a stoic smiley-face image, which adds a touch of humor. The film has a budget of approximately $5 million, but it does more with that amount than others do with $200 million. The base is well constructed, and the outside shots of the rovers and miners on the surface look very professional and like the work of ILM or something similar. SPOILERS RESUME NOWThe scenes where Rockwell has to interact with the other Sam are excellent. The timing is spot on, and they don't try to cheat it with tricky camera shots and such. They fight, high- five, and carry each other in various scenes. The plot really gets going and touches on corporate greed, cloning, and various conspiracies, large and small. It is not difficult to follow, but the film doesn't hold your hand and show you everything. You do have to make some assumptions and think for yourself. And like all great sci-fi films, the ending provides us with a true hero who's last choices and actions put a perfect bow on the total package.Moon is similar to Cast Away, but there is no second setting, such as the shipping plant or Tom Hanks' house. No, the entire movie takes place on the moon, and the entire movie is excellent. Be patient with this film and enjoy this Oscar-worthy tale of suspense and action.Ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful achievement for science fiction and movies in general.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(possible spoilers) When I first started to watch this movie, I became enthralled instantly. After about 30 minutes of the movie and especially after the scene of the crash I actually became skeptical about the plot though visually, aesthetically, and atmospherically the movie did not disappoint me in any way. I continued to watch having faith in the movie because of the many aspects of the movie that I credited towards being phenomenal. This movie didn't let me down at all! Not only is the story one of my favorite parts of the movie, it should be noted that the pacing and execution of the story is perfect.The entire movie never goes outside its realm to pay homage to or otherwise drift apart from its successors, such as the obvious 2001. I also enjoyed many tribute scenes such as Sam launching back to earth in an array of colors and lined shots of the moon and earth. It all worked for the movie. Sam Rockwell was amazing in his roles. One of the best main characters I've seen in a movie in a long time. He managed to take the movie from the beginning to end, again remaining perfectly in the boundary set by the movie, playing two lead roles convincing me and I'm sure many others that the two characters on the screen were dynamic and separate entities.As for the visuals, I can't say enough how much this movie captured what I love about science fiction movies. The technology used in the movie is credible and believable and fits the theme of the movie to a tee. GERTY is a wonderful and emotional character and dare I say, more intriguing than HAL could ever hope to be? The decisions made by this character are felt but again, never drift into a place that makes him feel like he has anything above AI. He also provides some great comedic relief and I just all around enjoy the design of GERTY.The music is enticing and catchy. Not only does it fit the mood but it develops everything on screen into something beautiful that the viewer can connect with. It's not obnoxious and overplayed but it's used sparingly at key moments to push the story. I especially loved the pick up of the music at the end and the tie in with the main piano loop to create a mysterious but much needed intensity that would've been otherwise lacking.All in all I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The criticism that this movie might receive for being cliché or being too much like its successors is mislead because the movie's originality and beauty push it to mean something more. It's not just a tribute film, it's a film that can be enjoyed on any level. It's not just a scifi film, it's a story that's gripping, intense, unique and most of all, makes us think and question many things about ourselves and our world. It delivers so much emotion and sucks you into this other world. It's the very reason I love science fiction and in that, becomes not only a tribute but a major player in the films that inspired it.I give 10/10 gladly for this movie. I don't think it deserves anything less :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this multi-layered drama and was very impressed.Sam Rockwell, who is Oscar-worthy on this one, is a lone worker on the Moon, mining for what turns into energy on Earth. We see his daily life and the toll it takes. Although the entire film is very strong, this period of the story is the weakest. Frankly, it raises too many logistical questions to elevate it to a 10.After having a couple of visions (that prove to be of no relevance), he crashes into one of the mining vessels. He then wakes up in the infirmary of his base and is nursed back to health by the companion robot, voiced by Kevin Spacey.Finally the story kicks in when Sam sneaks out and goes back to the site of his crash and finds---HIMSELF! Taking the person back, this 2nd Sam is nursed back to health.The two then have to figure out their dilemma and what exactly is going on during the body of the film. The relationship between the two Sams was a fresh, low-key direction vs. the predictable.It sparks a lot of questions of one's relevance and the value of life itself. There is a new look of fear and mortality in this movie. It presents a very scary "what if?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the not to distant future, Astronaut Sam Bell(Sam Rockwell) works for Lunar Industries, he has to live on a space station on the moon for 3 years, mining it's resources and sending it back to earth. His only company is a talking computer named Gerty(well voiced by Kevin Spacey). When his third year is almost up, Sam is eager to get back to his wife and daughter. One day while working Sam has an accident, and almost dies, but somehow is saved. But things begin to take a turn for the weird, when Sam sees the person that saved him,that person looks amazingly like him, and he asks him who he is, he says he's him 3 years earlier. So is Sam in some sort alternate time line, or has been cloned, or is he just going crazy? A well made film. Some might compare it 2001(1968), and it does not beat around the bush, that it was inspired off it, but when you see it, you'll come to find it's pretty much it's own movie. Sam Rockwell gave quite a performance, you really got in the moment with him every time, he really gave it his all, I hope he won't be missed by the Oscars. And Kevin Spacey has the voice of Gerty was also great, the best computer character next Hal 9000 and K.I.T.. Duncan Jones is such a brilliant director, he is such a visionary. All in all, Moon is a great film, the best film of 2009 so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curiouser and curiouser, though this might be familiar territory for sci-fi buffs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon (2009)At first this will seem like a poor man's 2001: A Space Odyssey, then with a touch of the American Solaris thrown in. But it's grittier, and has an everyman quality rather than an ethereal one, and so it makes you sympathetic as well as curious.Curiosity is a big part of this kind of movie, where you are on the moon (literally) and don't know quite why, or how it works, or how it is that a single person (Sam Rockwell) could be operating this sprawling operation (one of many implausibilities you just overlook). The HAL-like robot (with the voice of Kevin Spacey, no pun there, I suppose) is made less sinister and cuter, for sure (and dirtier, a nice touch) but his role takes on some nice twists later, so in a way, there are two characters. Or maybe three, or four, depending how you look at it--I'll not give that away.None of this is flawless. If the everyday qualities make you comfortable with the lead character, they also make the tension and bizarreness less intense. There are moments when I think we should be just blown away, and yet (maybe because we've seen this in other movies too often) we are just made to perk up a little. The movie is, in fact, interesting, and it's not overlong, and so it does succeed. It just doesn't find the beauty, or sci-fi wonder, or human tragedy, of a great movie, whatever that might be. Maybe some people will discover some ideas about life and identity spelled out here for the first time, and in that case this could be a completely memorable, even meaningful experience. I hope so.Otherwise, it's still a fun, well made, different experience. And Rockwell, in the lead role(s), lets it all hang out. Impressive acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good science fiction does not grow on trees</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good, serious science fiction is not really something we are fed up with. Looking back at the history of American sci-fi cinema we see a pretty meager landscape. Over the years there have been one or two signs of life. But no organism big enough to have a body, the genre is very much still an embryo. It's like the ape in Kubrick's 2001 threw the bone in the air, but nobody was there to pick it up. Therefore, this feature debut from British writer-director Duncan Jones is a movie pretty alone in it's kind, which would seem fitting given it's plot involving one man alone on the moon. Sure, we can find some hints and homages here and there. Suffice to say, if you were at all fascinated by Solaris, Alien, 2001 or Blade Runner, you will enjoy this movie. But that's also as far as it goes. One could say, if you enjoyed those movies then hurry up to catch this one because they don't come along very often. As far as movies go, quantum wise, it's lonely in space.Any admirer of this genre will approve the setup of the movie. In some close or parallel, would-be future, we energize the planet with solar energy, taken and generated from the sun to Earth, from generators located on the moon. There is one job vacancy for an administrator up there. Thus, within the large facilities we meet Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) who has been up there for three years and now has but two weeks left of his contract. He is beyond homesick, talking to himself and several plants and gazing at loved ones through video messages through cold machines. His loneliness has even driven his health to a shaky state. What was that? Am I alone in here? Probably just imagining things. Right, exactly. His only company is that of Gerty, a friendly computer moving by the ceiling, expressing his mood in smileys and carries the voice of Kevin Spacey. Gerty seems to be a very sweet and innocent baby brother of HAL 9000s but geez, everybody knows you can't trust any kind of artificial intelligence in space. The movie, exceptionally well paced from start to finish, gives you the morning (and evening) routines of Sam's and then we start the plot mechanisms when Sam has a little accident, is knocked unconscious and wakes up at the medical ward. "How long have I been gone?" he asks Gerty's happy smiley. "Oh, not very long" is the reply. But it looks like Sam has got some initial problems moving his legs and if you've seen Kill Bill you know enough to get suspicious. The story that follows is pretty much impossible not to follow with interest and excitement.This is a movie you can't really make much of a review of, since so much of what happens in it is for the viewer alone to find out about. But there are certain things worth mentioning. Much of the content in Moon are things that have been the subject of many science fiction movies, even campier ones, and I guess if anything holds it away from being truly great and "merely" enjoyable it's that it moves within it's own comfort zone, not breaking any significant new grounds, specially in contrast to the perplexing heights at which real sci-fi masterpieces have gone. Perhaps this is a beginner's trade. In any case, it's a highly notable first feature. What probably struck me as the very most impressing thing in the movie though, was Sam Rockwell's one man show (or, "one" man show if you will... or maybe one "man" show.. nevermind, you'll get it later). It's been clear to me since a while back that he is a quality actor - variating his roles to that of alcoholic looser/hair-trigger in Snow Angels to Zaphod Beeblebrox in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - but this time he really holds up much of the entire movie on his shoulders. Without spoiling anything, I can say he gets to use body language, psychological presence and provide action from his character facing intense and unimaginable emotional situations. I hope he feels proud of his work in it, because it certainly comes off as hard work.It's difficult not to recommend a movie like Moon. It is rare we see movies of it's kind, and for any fan of the genre it's definitely worthwhile. It's a well made, adequately thought provoking, proper science-fiction movie, it's only actual flaw being that it's not better than Solaris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the future, the Lunar Industries, Inc. is the largest producer of fusion energy in the world, supplying 70% of the planet with clean- burning helium-3, the energy of the sun trapped in rock harvest by machine from the far side of the moon.The entire facility is operated by one man only, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), and the computer GERTY (voice of Kevin Spacey). The three year-contract of Sam with Lunar Industries is near to the end and Sam misses his beloved wife Tess Bell (Dominique McElligott) and his young daughter Eve. His only contact with Earth is through Tess and Sam is anxious to return home. A couple of weeks before the scheduled day for his voyage back to Earth, Sam is a little disturbed, having visions and daydreams. Sooner he has an accident with his vehicle, crashing a harvest machine, and becomes unconscious. When Sam awakes in the infirmary, he is without recollections and having difficulties to move, and GERTY keeps Sam on the berth in observation. However Sam decides to walk and overhears GERTY reporting the incident and updates to the representatives of Lunar Industries. Then GERTY evaluates Sam and the Lunar Industries management informs that they will send the Rescue Unit Eliza to fix the damaged machine and bring Sam back home. When Sam goes to the stalled harvester, he finds a man wearing astronaut suit trapped in the damaged vehicle and he brings him back to the facility. When he asks who the man is to GERTY, the computer tells that he is Sam Bell. Sooner he finds the hidden secret of the lunar base. Till now, "Moon" is the most original sci-fi of the Twentieth-First Century, with a dark and gloomy story totally believable considering the state-of-art evolution of science and technology. The impact of "Moon" is comparable to the 1997 "Gattaca", and like in the 2005 "The Island", shows a scary view of science, ethic and society in a near future and makes the viewer to think how cloning process shall be discussed by the society and controlled through well-studied lawsSam Rockwell has the role of his life, performing multiple clones with different personalities. GERTY, whose mission is to keep Sam safe, is a great tribute to HAL 9000 from "2001: A Space Odyssey".

		<shortDescription>Valiant Effort, Flawed Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoiler Alert*What can I say? Based on the high praise that Moon received from critics and fans alike, I had high expectations going in. Sam Rockwell gives a fine performance as the hapless Sam Bell(s), the miniatures- driven special effects are very well executed, and Duncan Jones has definitely done his homework- referencing sci-fi greats like 2001, Outland, Blade Runner, and others. So what's the problem? For starters there's definitely some flawed story logic. I find it very difficult to believe that cost of training and employing new workers for the mining operation would be that prohibitively expensive, especially considering that it only takes one person to staff the base. Overlooking that, if Lunar's goal was to save money by not having to train new workers for their mining operations, why not simply automate the entire process? By the looks of things, the operation was already almost completely automated. GERTY (the computer) seemed like a sufficiently sophisticated AI to oversee the day to day operations and fix problems as they arose, and with an abundant fusion power source they could have had a fleet of redundant "mining bots" ready if one of them encountered a catastrophic mechanical failure. In the rare event something did go wrong that required human attention, they could simply send a repair team. In any case, either one of the above scenarios would be much easier and less expensive than: A) Developing human-cloning technology. B) Finding a way to prematurely age the clones to adulthood. C) Finding a way to "program" their brains with the memories of a particular individual. D) Creating hundreds (if not more) copies of them and keeping them in cryogenic stasis.This seems like a highly-implausible level of technology for the near future, but assuming that Lunar had cracked the secrets of directly programming the human brain (in all it's incredible complexity), this only bolsters the idea that they could have programmed some type of AI to run the operations, rather than creating an army of human clones. I realize of course that the idea of clones and their ethical treatment is central to the premise of the movie, but I just wish that more thought had gone into making the circumstances more plausible.My other main gripe with this movie is that I feel that many of it's devices seemed derivative. I know that the similarities between the look and portrayal of GERTY to '2001's HAL were a bit of intentional audience misdirection on Jones' part but come on...could he have at least tried to be subtle? The countdown to the arrival of the repair team/assassins was right out of Outland. The concept of artificially- created humans with a built-in short lifespan was right out of Blade Runner. Unchecked capitalism and devalued human lives...countless movies within the sci-fi genre, but most directly lifted from Alien(s) and Outland. I'm not saying that it isn't okay for directors/writers to pay homage to other science fiction films or touch on classic oft-explored themes, but please do so with enough restraint so as to prevent the viewer from engaging in an involuntary game of "spot the reference".I really wanted to like this movie, and I hate to disparage it when it's clear that Jones' was making an honest effort at creating the kind of intelligent science fiction so often ignored by Hollywood. Better luck next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one set of words that should be banned from usage on this website I'd vote for 'Thought provoking'. A phrase that is once again littered throughout an unfathomable amount of positive reviews this clunky effort at filmmaking has somehow garnered. A film so bereft of ideas worth exploring and executed with such inauthenticity, it really has to be seen to be believed.Let us even forget about the shoddy outfits, the borrowed sets, the stolen characters and the standard Casio Keyboard demo-tunes trying desperately to masquerade as a soundtrack. Let's not even begin to dissect the very premise of the movie which makes as much sense as there being a bar in Saudi Arabia called 'The Shoplifter's Arms'. And let us not ponder the rationale of the first act that wants us to believe that a costly mining operation on the moon would be left in the capable hands of one fully dysfunctional and psychotic human clone with a operational lifespan of apparently 2 years but going on 4.People, it's time to call a spade a spade and this is just turd-fiction, aimed pointblank at the lowest common denominator. People who have never read a science-fiction book, have never watched a star trek episode and to whom 2001 is just a date on a grub-stained calendar still clipped to the fridge. Why is it nowadays, that unoriginality is uniformly praised, blatant theft of ideas is applauded, asinine plot points are gulped like morning coffee and vapidity is so readily mistaken for often the exact opposite? This movie scores well on this and other movie related websites, the relevance of its services soon warranting total disregard and ridicule.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of seeing Moon on a lazy Wednesday night with high expectations, and I was totally blown out of the water. It's hard to know where to start explaining, but let me start off by saying that this movie has a living, beating heart. If you think that this is just a typical sci-fi movie that is only clever because a twist ending, then you have no idea how wrong you are. This movie leaves behind such a muddle of emotions that it leaves you gaping at the screen. Moon gives such a convincing delivery of the claustrophobia and desperation of being isolated for such a long time, and an even better delivery of the heartbreak of losing everything you've ever known. The sense of accumulating dread Moon delivers leaves you with a roller coaster pit in your stomach. The only other movies that had made me feel this is Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream and the ending to The Mist. This movie is truly, truly heart-wrenching. Moon is really a one man show, which is really easy to either succeed at or fail miserably. In this case, Sam Rockwell has definitely succeeded by showing the desperation and instability of his character so genuinely. He has his moments, like his heartbreaking video call to his now fifteen-year-old daughter. Also, juggling two personalities at once is pretty difficult but it works flawlessly for Rockwell. His performances are really something to behold and it's a shock he hasn't even been NOMINATED for an Oscar. His co-stars have limited roles but are excellent too.Another great aspect of Moon is that you could analyze it for hours. Duncan Jones has left in important details here and there which begs for a second view to pick up. Its characters are so three- dimensional as well because he has deliberately gave them nearly two hours of screen time for development. GERTY, the intelligent computer is very interesting to analyze when it turns on its own programming to "help" Sam. Moon doesn't make you stop thinking after its run time, like so many Hollywood movies do. It creates such a thought provoking look on your morals and beliefs that it doesn't let go until weeks after viewing. And if you ask me, that is how a movie should be made. The fact that it is made on a budget of 5 million is truly impressive. It is a wonder on how they managed to show such beautiful shots and such impressive set pieces on such a shoestring budget. So many sci- fi movies with ten times the budget fall short to deliver such an effective movie and get stuck too far up its own ass (Jupiter Ascending, I'm talking about you). Duncan Jones seems to be a lot more experienced with coordinating movies than all the other veteran directors and I would be looking forward to seeing more films of him in the future. Moon is an unpretentious and unflinching dive into one man's downward spiral of beliefs. Trust me, it is far from a shallow sci-fi flick which relies completely on visual effects and action to entertain. The difference is that Moon makes you FEEL. It conveys the desperation and gradual loss of hope so effectively that you don't feel like talking to anyone for three days after viewing. That's how draining it is. In fact, after I was done viewing I had called my parents on the phone and asked them how they were doing, which I haven't done in a year. It's easy to criticize and nitpick on the editing, cinematography, plot holes, etc. but you you can't deny that this movie is very well done. Unfortunately words can only say so much, so I dare you to give Moon a viewing. After watching you'll definitely know what I'm talking about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Rarest Gems &amp; Most Under-appreciated Works Of 21st Century Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies don't get anymore underrated than Duncan Jones' feature film debut. An incredibly polished, downright original &amp; thoroughly engrossing effort that's brought to life with remarkable care, brims with endless passion &amp; stays firmly grounded throughout its runtime, Moon is a masterwork of science-fiction filmmaking that presents the first-time filmmaker in complete control of his craft, is deftly scripted from start to finish, and is all the more boosted by Sam Rockwell's heartbreaking performance &amp; Clint Mansell's sensational score.Set in the near future, the story of Moon presents a world in which Earth's power crisis has been solved by Lunar Industries through mining an alternative fuel from lunar rocks. Stationed at their almost entirely automated lunar facility is Sam Bell whose 3-year work contract requires him to maintain operations and his only companion all this time has been an artificial intelligence named GERTY who assists with base's automation. Things are set in motion when Bell encounters something personal towards the end of his stint.Co-written &amp; directed by Duncan Jones, Moon is crafted with confidence and the director's creativity shines above all as he manages to give his project a very sophisticated look &amp; feel despite its modest budget. The story taps on our familiarity with the genre yet puts greater emphasis on its plot &amp; characters instead of revelling in its futuristic sci-fi elements. In short, Jones has done an amazing job in transitioning this story on the film canvas, maintains a fine control over every single aspect, and paces it with such finesse that everyone will be able to get on board with it.From the technical standpoint, this is a film that isn't affected by budget constraints and successfully manages to come up with creative ways to realise its envisioned tale on the film canvas in its entirety. Production design team deserves kudos, for their expertly designed &amp; meticulously detailed set pieces add an authentic vibe to the film's settings. Cinematography is another highlight, as the fluid camera-work, apt colour tones &amp; clever lighting provide an added intensity to its images while Editing makes sure that each scene is relevant to the plot and unfolds it all in a streamlined fashion.Coming to the performances, Sam Rockwell is an absolute revelation in the role of Sam Bell, and delivers a neat, suave &amp; wonderfully balanced input that still remains his best work to date. It was a bold move from the director to let the fate of this film be decided by a single performance but Rockwell plays his part so well that it's difficult to imagine someone else in the given role. Adding more flavours to this key aspect is Kevin Spacey whose calm demeanour &amp; relaxed voice gives GERTY a soul of its own. And last but not the least, Clint Mansell's emotionally-stirring score elevates the experience to a whole new level, and is one of his finest compositions.On an overall scale, Moon remains one of the rarest gems &amp; most under-appreciated works of 21st century cinema that not only ranks as one of the best films of its year but also deserves a place amongst the finest examples of its genre. A smart, slick &amp; promising start to Duncan Jones' directional career, scoring high on both scientific realism &amp; storytelling aspects, and overflowing with existential themes that paint a heartfelt portrait of what it means to be human, Moon is science-fiction in its purest form, that discards the usual distractions &amp; focuses entirely on the emotional journey of its character. Outstandingly directed, deftly written, gorgeously photographed, tightly edited, beautifully scored &amp; brilliantly performed, Moon comes strongly recommended. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all - i loved this movie.It is original (original enough anyway..) and a true science fiction movie. Not just some fantasy movie in space or so.Acting, sound design and visuals are spot on. Storytelling is done through acting and not some voice over - but the story itself is not really that complicated. What i really loved about the movie is that it avoided action for the sake of action (actually it avoided action completely) while never being drawn out or boring. But there are a few things that did not quite work in terms of logic.Considering the size of the cloning facility .. it is very unlikely that this concept of perpetual qualified work is more economical than to train someone else every 3 years. - Not only would it be terribly expensive to build what looked like a MASSIVE cavern beneath the base - but the whole effort to keep it secret seemed rather strange.If the "excuse" was that the training was too sophisticated and expensive to do each 3 years. - Well .. it is kind of hard to tell what work Sam was meant to be qualified in. We do not see him do sophisticated stuff. Most of the base runs on autopilot - and he is not able to fix the live feed or circumvent the problems. (after all, they can still receive messages - so for a trained engineer - i do not think it would be an impossible task to build a sender strong enough to reach an earth satellite)However - those are just nitpicks that do not spoil the story or movie. And so i am happy to say it was a delight watching Moon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film though quite predictable, very underrated and for sure worth watching. In the film where Same is taking it all in learning about his wife and children it really reflects how good of an actor Sam Rockwell really is. The idea itself is very unique and a good plot overall. Not only that, the viewers somewhat question some motives, such as the motive of GERTY (which I thought was poisoning/killing Sam, which was not the case) and Sam 2 which I thought only wanted to get out. Seeing the progression of each of the characters is amazing as well, since one is seeking to find the truth and the other wants reality.Overall, I highly recommend this movie for anyone in a mood for a somewhat predictable, but nonetheless entertaining and creative plot line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the movie and have seen it 3 times already!Of course, realizing they are on the moon inside of the station and watching them walking and acting as if they are walking on Earth (gravitation wise) can be a bit disheartening. But, forgivable.The only REAL problem I had with the film was WHY make the clones sick? I don't think it was ever addressed as to WHY make them sick and WHY near the end of the 3 year contract? I mean, a healthy Sam can climb into the return vehicle thinking he is going home just as easily as a sick Sam could. Either way he'll be vaporized. So, WHY make the clones sick? That really bugged me.And, the first clone was about to reveal to the second clone about the return pod (or vaporization chamber) but never got the chance to explain it to him. That would be great information for the second clone to have back on Earth. He needed to be told. I have a hard time with the first same just saying something like "You know the return vehicle?" and then just dropping the subject after that.All and all, though, it was a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Multi-layered, thoughtful film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is one of those movies that I had only heard about through word of mouth by people of trustworthy taste. I finally gave it a watch and can see why it has a cult status. There is not a lot of action. Instead it delivers a slow build up resulting in mind blowing, climactic scenes. Sam Rockwell delivers an outstanding performance throughout every scene which gives immense credibility to his actions throughout. We witness a man who is completely alone in space - with only the focus of the job in hand and the prospect of returning to his family at the end of his three year contract keeping him mentally strong, and able to keep going. We are encouraged to comprehend such levels of isolation and lack of human interaction and how that can affect the psychology of a person. I genuinely expected the movie to build towards a continuing mental unravelling of Sam Bell resulting in full blown madness - but the story line takes a direction that I would never have anticipated. The result is poignant and tragic. Sam Rockwell totally delivers as a person torn apart by circumstances outwith his control. The madness - it turns out - is not within him - it is in what he discovers and he is prey to it. The movie raises a lot of ethical questions, and is quite rightly a sci fi cult classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique sci-fi movie with a memorable lead role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>''The Moon'' is an American film that was released in 2009.It stars Sam Rockwell as the main character Sam Bell.It is a drama about surviving on the moon with limited resources and time.Sam Bell,who is an astronaut, is working on a lunar base of some sort. .Energy companies have discovered vast amounts of Helium on the Moon, and they now mine that Helium in order to power the Earth .He is the only person on the entire base, only assisted by an all- knowing robot called GERTY who is voiced by veteran actor Kevin Spacey.He has been stationed on the base for almost 3 years, his contract nearing an end, and with his flight back to earth scheduled only 14 days away, he can't wait to get back home to see his wife and daughter again. However, suddenly one of the automated moon- vehicles goes awry, and he goes outside of the base to investigate it... but then something unexpected happens, and he has to change his perspective on everything. Bell is played by the brilliant Sam Rockwell, whom most people probably know from "Charlie's Angels", "The Green Mile", "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind", "Matchstick Men" or the equally brilliant sci-fi movies "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" and "Galaxy Quest". This is probably his best part in a movie ever, and I doubt if he will ever get a role as good as this again. Not because he's not capable or worthy of it, but because it was a one of a kind performance. If you're a fan of Rockwell or perhaps of Kevin Spacey's voice, then you will not be disappointed, as they're both great in "Moon". The special effects are gorgeous and there is something very simple but realistic about them.The only thing that I find lackluster about this movie is its soundtrack,its very dull and boring.Overall Moon is a complete film. It isn't groundbreaking, but it accomplished everything it set out to be, which are a great homage and a chance for Sam Rockwell to really show his acting prowess. There is isolation, mistrust, schemes, confusion, curiosities and despair, but the human experience probably transcends the realism of its existence ? that was the idea I carried back from watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid if sad sci fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this basically-British (and quite cerebral) film from son of the late David Bowie, Duncan Jones, it's 2035, and some technological process has allowed Earth's energy (and climate?) problems to be resolved by the simple expedient of crushing up the Moon's surface to obtain Helium-3 for fuel. You may think it best not to ask too many questions about the plausibility of that, but in fact you're wrong - it's a real possibility readily findable on the European Space Agency website. Asking questions about the morality of that - in terms of how we treat other worlds - might be a slightly different matter...Anyway, the Moon of that future, less-troubled Earth remains a remote, lonely and occasionally hostile place (though mostly just dull), yet for some apparently implausible reason they've (which means a giant mining consortium has) decided to make it a one-man-run operation. One says "apparently implausible", since in fact the concern (called Lunar Industries) has got things very well worked out indeed - down to a fine art in fact. And just how that all works out is the gradual process of discovery engaged in by our hero "Sam", played in a not-especially-appealing but very realistic way by Sam Rockwell, and of course witnessed by we viewers. Needless to say, in this out of sight and out of mind kind of place, there is every possible opportunity to raise business efficiency and to cut business costs...Without giving very much more away, the aforesaid discovery process is a somewhat sad, depressing and shocking affair, so this film is definitely light on laughs. But it is well done, and raises quite a few questions. (Not least a nagging, if perverse and unwelcome feeling appearing hours later that just conceivably there might be a grain of sympathy for the company's rational, pragmatic solution)!Part of the pleasure here lies in the interaction between Sam and the robot GERTY (played by Kevin Spacey in typically dour and enigmatic style). There's a definite air of (HAL-like) menace about GERTY, yet Sam's life is in its (his?) hands, and those famous Laws of Robotics kick in as they should to ensure that GERTY enlightens Sam - or keeps him in the dark - in line with (a robotic conscience's view of) what's in his best interest. For much of the time, GERTY - notwithstanding a status as a "company man" - is the best and only friend Sam has got, and the robot actually proves its worth, time and again - and it's quite touching.There are several other moving moments in what is ultimately a dark and rather understated piece, but one which achieves a look of plausibility and authenticity. One could never say it was fun to get through, but there are nevertheless compensations. In particular, one can at no point say that: "that's just stupid". It really isn't that kind of film, and very welcome for that...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why crash the antenna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if I should say I liked it or not, however, an interesting Sci-Fi.Yet, aside the good acting and the idea of using clones to replace astronauts which could have led to a film dealing on economy or savage capitalistic economy even in space, there are things which needed to be developed. For example,when Sam Bells contacts his daughter and she cries out to her father someone is asking questions about her mother, I assume the father is Sam himself, probably the first of the cloned Sam Bells.Seems that years have gone by therefore making Sam Bells on the moon station the third of many. Or, when the last clone, before leaving for earth crashes the lunar jeep on the antenna, why? Considering it is a Sci_Fi movie, I understand that to make this movie a science fiction, the idea of insanity due to a long solitude is better than dealing with space economy and using clones (in our earth's future-robots) which is less threatening as a subject since insanity to long periods of solitude is far from our reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've giving it a solid 8/10, as personally I enjoyed it far more than I had anticipated. I'd be given this as a gift a couple of years ago and only just got around to watching it. What a great movie, the story is simple but well woven, the limited use of effects, possibly due to the smaller budget is welcome as it allows more time for Sam Rockwell to do his thing. He is the movie in so many ways, makes it enjoyable, sad, exciting and infuriating all at the same time. Great acting.One thing that stood out for me was the use of engineering, Sam actually WORKS on the station, he's not just sitting about on his backside all day. You get a sense of his routine, his intimate knowledge of the station he's been at for years, whilst being pulled along on his own personal story of discovery.Great film, I would highly recommend watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Rockwell is one of the most underrated actors alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Rockwell brings Moon up alongside Locke, Buried and Gravity in the category of movies made brilliant by their leading actor commanding the screen all by themselves. Rockwell plays Sam Bell, an astronaut deployed to the Moon to harvest resources for 3 year rotations. However, after an accident, Sam is rescued by a man identical to him and learns (as do we) that both are actually clones of the original Sam Bell (never seen). Throughout Moon, Sam 5 (our original protagonist, who is reaching the end of his lifespan of three years) and Sam 6 (newly awakened) interact and unravel the lie that they have been fed all throughout. As Sam 5, a lonely shell of a man who is clinging to the desire to go home, Rockwell will break your heart. As Sam 6, Rockwell is commanding, tough and a bit of a prick. A theme throughout Moon is Sam's relationship with his wife back on Earth, who constantly makes references to how the two of them needed a break. Sam 6 is Sam at the beginning of his stint, Sam 5 at the end. Its easy to empathise with him, yet we also understand that they did indeed need time apart. When playing against himself, Rockwell makes the two men so distinct that its easy to forget that they are both played by the same actor.Also along for the ride is Kevin Spacey as GERTY, Sam's robot. A clear throwback to HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey, I found GERTY a fascinating character and expected an examination of artificial intelligence and ethics. Spacey's detached, polite delivery of GERTY's words, combined with a simple emoticon face, are perfect in keeping GERTY distant from Sam and giving context to Sam's loneliness. However, I couldn't help but be disappointed that the film ends without GERTY contributing more than exposition. Right until the film's credits, I expected GERTY to turn on Sam for some cold or calculating reason in the way that Skynet from Terminator and Ava from Ex Machina had no ethical or emotional restrictions.Jones crafts the world as a director to create effect. Without Gravity or The Martian's budgets, the space effects leave a bit to be desired (there's not depth, making it look like a mere poster), but there's an incredible shot where Sam 5 breaks down and sobs that he wants to go home while the camera is fixed on Earth, millions of miles away. There are also incredible scenes that play almost like horror - where Sam learns of his predecessors' fates and where he loses a tooth. As a writer he spins an ethical dilemma for the ages, which is capped off by perfect dialogue like "You're not going to kill him. You can't. I know that because I can't." His teasing reveal style works to varying effect - sometimes he gives us clues to things we've long figured out courtesy of exposition, and in others he lays traps that will boggle our brains on a second watch.Its easy to escape into this story thanks to Tony Noble's incredible set, and the makeup team of Louise Coles, Karen Dawson and Richard Muller do an exceptional job of showing Sam 5's decaying physical appearance. The limited lifespan of the clones is something not touched on enough, and as a result, the schmaltzy happy ending for Sam 6 didn't feel appropriate for me. I also did not care for the tease regarding the original Sam Bell. I don't mind that they leave his fate ambiguous, because it plays superbly into the ethical grey area of the film's subject matter. However, I don't feel like it was deliberate - the only thing we have to go on is 15 year old Evie calling out to "dad" off screen. Had the film ended on Sam 6 visiting "his" house and opening the door with a cut to black, I think I'd have been blown away. What we got I think is more credit to my imagination than Jones' intention. The clichéd happy ending newsreader voice-over trope also felt a bit gallish after the slightly horrifying, thrilling film I'd just watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In-validity in cloning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cloning is a rising phenomenon in modern society. From a microscopic level using bacteria to macroscopic ranges where entire mammals are fully cloned. Often the biological implications of these experiments are closely monitored, but not the actual psychological effects. With the hopes of returning to your family after a three-year hardship of not only laborious work, but also isolation, two weeks until returning home is a journey that seems like a lifetime. Although what if that return never happened? If it was all a complete lie? It is haunting to implant memories and experiences into a person's mind and then restrict them from all tangible parts of that life. It is slavery. An act that no one deserves to endure. Moon delves into the concept of autonomy and essential rights, and offers a unique perspective on an otherwise untouched subject. Cloning happens everyday and it's only time until it reaches one of us. Once that day comes, there is no difference between the clone and "original"; we are one.Whether cognizant or not, onus for equality and morality lies on those that do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather small and intimate movie, set on a very large stage, The Moon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of this movie being set on the Moon, it is actually a small and intimate movie. It only has two characters that mean anything, and one of them is a computer/robot named GERTY.This is set only far enough in the future that we have been able to establish a base of mining operations on the Moon, with a base station and one man operating it. Along with his trusty companion GERTY who has a lens for an eye and, suspended on tracks from the ceiling can travel all over the base station.The scientific premise is the mining of Helium 3 (normal Helium 4 is what fills balloons) which can be used in fusion reactions to generate power, enough that this mined He 3 is sent back to the Earth in dedicated rockets. Large machines roam the surface of the Moon, spewing rocks in its wake. Ostensibly it is collecting and concentration the He 3 that is estimated at 0.1 ppm. That isn't much He 3.Sam Rockwell is Sam Bell, who handles the Moon operations much as an experienced operator would handle an oil refining unit back on Earth. He is anxious and happy, his 3-year stint alone on the Moon is coming to an end and he looks forward to returning to Earth to his wife and young daughter.Kevin Spacey is the soothing voice of GERTY, reminding me a lot of HAL in "2001: A Space Odessy". But GERTY is clearly on the side of Sam and never turns on him.I don't really want to say what this movie is about because I think it is better to view it knowing nothing. I found it interesting, as a character study. But still science fiction and not as profound as perhaps it wants itself to be. Good entertainment.SPOILERS FOLLOW: As the story unfolds and the 3-year target looms closer Sam starts to behave strangely. He has visions. He goes out to service a harvester and is injured in a wreck. He has physical problems, he spits up blood, a molar falls out. All this are signs that he is wearing out, he can't last more than three years, because he is a clone. In fact, when he awakes from his accident he finds he was rescued by another clone, just like him, and with the same name. Together they figure all this out, no one ever goes home, they are destroyed when they wear out and one of the dozens of clones below deck is awakened by GERTY from its suspended animation to become the next Sam. Memories are implanted into their brains so that each new clone believes he has a family back on Earth and will go home after 3 years are up. At the end they convince GERTY to awaken one additional clone, and the still healthy clone uses an escape module to send himself back to Earth. But what will he find there? Will he expose the operation for what it is?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm convinced that no genre is more connected to the reality of our lives than science fiction. The levels of visual and contextual abstraction demanded by the genre are so high that you can only do good science fiction if you root its essence on what we are, outside the life of the film. You take out the comfort of recognizing places (most of the times), of understanding moods, contexts, ways to live. But you're still left with people, or beings that stand for people (planet of apes) or better still, moodiness, and context that suggest people's state of being. That's our link, that's our portal to any interesting sci fi built world. Méli?s. 2001. Blade Runner. Now this. It is a great addition to the filmography of 2009, and eventually the greatest achievement in sci fi of this finishing decade.This is a sort of 2001 meets Blade Runner, two threads of science fiction which i hadn't seen mixed ever, and doubted it could be done. It's better than that. It doesn't mix. It just makes you believe it mixes. The film deceives you all the way, puts you in the same sort of unawareness Sam Bell is supposed to feel. So the film is what it is telling.1 - This is where we start; Minimalistic, 2001 based imagery of the space. Open spaces, emptiness, isolation, meditation. That's the starting ground. the man and the machine (Sam and GERTY). We're led into believing we'll watch the battle for control, who wins, who's in charge? who deceives who?. What is the machine hiding, Is it hiding anything? The power over narrative control of the story, that's what it is.2 - But than, we're included Sam's doubles in the story. True or false? are We being deceived? Are the doubles real or a product of Sam's imagination? Is any of what we see any real depiction of what's going on, or are we left already into the delusional imagination of a homesick isolated man? 3 - the unfolding of the previous point. Yes, the doubles are real, physically real, at least everything indicates so. So, if every clone is Sam Bell, if every clone has the same past, who is Sam Bell? Who is any of those human beings, who can share among them the same emotions, the same feelings, the same remembrances. Here it invades completely Dick/Blade Runner territory. replicants. here we have the reversed story of Blade Runner, the world according to the replicants. Not a dubious depiction of whether Harrison Ford was a replicant himself, instead a hard exploration of what being one means. Invented memory, stuffed emotions. And all that those things mean to us, as human beings.All the visual work has a coherence to what is being told. There is not a visual reference that outdoes the others, and that's actually a good thing. We may have a great new filmmaker here. We certainly have a worthy film here.My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason that I knocked off a point is because the director either missed the memo about the low-gravity on the Moon, or he forgot to explain why the main character seems to be walking perfectly normal throughout the 'flic. Because I have seen this in other movies of the same genre, I really don't care too much about this detail.Other than some obvious miscalculations when it comes to the gravity, this movie was marvelously-techie. It has the most original sci-fi screenplay I've seen since forever, and there is a delicious twist that you'll have to wait and find out yourself.See this movie if you liked movies such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Silent Running", because this movie is a worthy homage to both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Sci-fi movie of the year (and in years)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best sci-fi (drama) movies I've seen in a long time. A small-scale movie with a brilliant concept is presented really well by Jones. It is a dialogue movie which just gets better and better as the full scale of the intriguing plot emerges.Sam Rockwell gives his career best performance, and I sincerely hope, come awards season, his efforts are recognized (he could well be a dark horse for the best actor Oscar as well). Other than the great story and acting, the music supports the movie really well also.Overall, this may not be a movie for everyone (especially non Sci-fi fans) but it is definitely worth giving a shot. The story will get you thinking about the movie after you view it, and Rockwell fans (those who felt he deserved a break-out movie) are in for a treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film, my first comment here at IMDb SPOILERS!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished watching this film... First of all, I am going to say it right of the bat, I never been touched by a film like this before, I am a 47 year old movie lover, this Moon, has now a special place in my film appreciating hearth... What a concept and what a production, and what unparalleled performance by Sam Rockwell. The fact that this was achieved in what is considered a low budget production only adds to the achievement of this amazing film. Here for the spoiler part of my comment: Thinking of another you, same memories, same personality, same hearth.. same everything... to meet yourself, to befriend yourself and to ultimately, protect yourself against anything adverse, as a team, this is an extremely provocative and awe inspiring situation. It invited the thought of what would it be like, the guy you usually see in the mirror, being actually another palpable human being that after the obvious awkwardness of this all, and after the acceptance, becomes your ultimate friend and ally.....WOW!!!!!!!!!!! :)Oscar for Sam please!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That is the movie, which shown sci-fi at its real face. Movie shows sci-fi drama as it is, without millions of polygons of enemy spaceships. More than sci-fi it is real beautiful drama -- not very difficult, but very intense.I like this kind of sci-fi, like Butterfly effect etc., where story is the main and most important thing. I don't say there is nobody who cares about thick-budget 3D movies, but I think that is every last sci-fi, which was made. So I accepted this fresh change with happiness.There are no bigger mistakes, which I was seen and which disturbed me. Alright, a few little is here, but it is just "cosmetical" :-)But ... okay, one for all: I never, I am really telling that, I never seen movie, where space was with vacuum since 2001: Space Oddyseyy ;) ;) I think many very beautiful views may be better without sound. It is very effective and I think here should be positive (like in 2001: S. O.).Great Work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpectedly unique!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just finished watching "Moon" on DVD. At first, I didn't think it was going to be anything out of the ordinary-Sci-Fi-spaceship-kind of movie.But it was growing and growing in intensity until I was completely immersed in a brilliant performance by Sam Rockwell, more proper of a theater soliloquy than a spaceship.The moral standards keep bouncing back and forth. And you start wondering what's right or wrong. I started the movie ignoring GERTY, then that feeling became hate, and I finally loved that smiley robot. Kevin Spacey always display his remarkable style in every film he's made (one of my favorite actors ever, by the way), even if he's just a voice in the movie.I never liked considering that movies should give us a moral at the end or be philosophical, but if the script is good, the acting is great, and it ALSO has that extra magical thing that leave us thinking about it for a while after you walked out of a movie theater or turned your TV off... I might say: "It's worthwhile to be recommended".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How bad would it hurt to find you best memories are a lie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt very sad for the main character(s) . It was heartbreaking to find that all of his memories were someone else s, and that he has been used as a disposable tool all of his short 3 year life.I rate this as one of my top ten greatest science fiction movies. It is right up there with Blade Runner and Alien. I loved how the AI was developing feelings of loyalty and did what it could to protect it's charges.Kevin Spacey does wonders with just his voice, as the voice of the AI. By his nuances, you could see the AI was doing what it could to befriend and support astronauts.The sound track is fantastic! It in combination with Kevin Spacey, bring to mind American Beauty, another feature that haunts ones consciousness for ages after viewing.A few small details I would have done differently, perhaps some subtle hints that he was not the first one there, like furniture being worn, or other small personal details left behind by his predecessors.I really like the juxtaposition of the two slightly different twists on the same personality and how they reacted differently to the initial meeting stress.Another small detail, but it is implied in several places that the 'astronauts' are wearing out near the end of their 3 year 'contracts', yet the two never discuss this angle.Leaves a sequel wide open, how-ever, it would be a completely area to explore, like what do you do when you know you have 3 years to live? The little voice over at the end, makes you wonder if the pro establishment talking heads are similar tools.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardly dull watching Sam and Sam again - Sam Rockwell rocks in Duncan Jones' intriguing debut film "Moon" masterfully done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Rockwell assuredly delivered all the variations and range of an astronaut Sam Bell in director Duncan Jones' debut film "Moon". Yes, it is a space sci-fi based on a story by Jones. The storyline seems to deal with some sort of version control. Could it be a renewed (or rewind) version of the same previous rendition that gets repeated (as programmed)? There is Gerty (calmly voiced by Kevin Spacey). It is much more friendlier than "HAL" of "2001: A Space Odyssey". Gerty the computer-brain is quite clear in what he is supposed to do as instructed. He is to help Sam. He is to do what Sam asks him to do. Come to think of it, Gerty probably needs a friend (someone to talk to, play chess with) since he and Sam are the only two working 'units' at the space station (a rather conveniently clever 'techno-arrangement'?) Rockwell is ever so interesting since I first saw him playing opposite John Turturro in Tom DiCillo's "Box of Moon Light" (1996). Sam Bell is rather lonely being the sole space worker human on the spaceship three years hence. It's getting into a mindless rut of routines, with occasional delight in reminiscing of family members from home on earth and viewing their video messages. Is ground control becoming callous and neglectful of him? Is Sam truly human in the flesh? It sure seems that way on screen, whether he's inside the ship or outside exploring the moonscape. God forbid he's an android in plurality. No programmed robots are expected to have feelings, let alone 'think' for himself. A computer unit like Gerty may momentarily display a certain degree of 'fondness' - though Gerty masks it by saying he's only doing his job in taking care of and carrying out Sam's requests and needs. Perhaps some scientific 'techno-breakthrough' in cost-saving solutions in optimizing cloning? Not dull at all. "Moon" is absorbing and definitely thought-provoking sci-fi. You may say it is a bold follow up to Stanley Kubrick's sublime "2001: A Space Odyssey" which was very much ahead of its time in 1968 and still rings true today. So Duncan Jones' 1995 bachelor of philosophy's independent study thesis titled, "How to Kill Your Computer Friend: An Investigation of the Mind/Body Problem and How It Relates to the Hypothetical Creation of a Thinking Machine" - how coincidental that "Moon" contains elements and queries suggestive from the title! There's possible influence from Jones' father, David Bowie, with his famous 'Space Oddity' song lyrics of "Ground control to Major Tom". The film does remind me of Douglas Trumbull's "Silent Running" (1972) where Bruce Dern is also playing solo in space. I recall also British author Dennis Potter's extraordinary TV series, "Cold Lazarus" (1996) when the realms of the mind &amp; memories are exploited and 'frozen in time'. You will enjoy "Moon", sci-fi fan or not. It has made me appreciate and respect Kubrick's '2001' masterpiece much more on repeat viewing, and I continue to ponder on the story of Sam in "Moon" - wishing for more enlightening, intriguing sci-fi fare from Jones to come. (And it seems a possibility, so 'wikipedia' noted.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absorbing psychological sci-fi drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had accepted I wouldn't be able to see this, as it was on limited release, but luckily, I found out a cinema about 45 mins away by bus way but it had only one showing at 8:30pm so I decided to go.The film begins with a ad showing a montage of children, space and how power from the moon can be used, I think. Then the film begins proper with Sam's solitary mission on the planet itself.Acting: Rockwell is convincing and believable as this lone astronaut. He single-handedly makes the film compelling as it is he we watch over the majority of the running time, which is no easy feat. A small cameo from Scodelario (Skins' Effy) who speaks with a very dodgy American accent pulled me slightly out of the spell the film had put me under, but her acting in that brief scene was fine. I only had problems with the accent.Plot: Obviously inspired from 70s sci-fi such as Alien, Silent Running et al so it's probably not doing anything original but in a year where sci-fi hasn't been that cerebral, it's nice to see a film that resembles the more old school sci-fi, made on a low budget.The main twist in it could split audiences down the middle, though. Personally, I thought it better to do it the way they did as the other way to do it has been done to death. I'm being as vague as possible so as not to give anything away, as I know from experience that spoilers that aren't warned from the outset are very unfair on unknowing people.Cinematography and SFX: For a low budget film, this certainly in my eyes has a polished look about it that doesn't betray it's modest budget. The sets, costumes, dust falling in the air etc don't look out of place to a more expensive film, to my untrained eyes. The shots look beautiful and I'd love to own a framed still of the surface of the moon from this film.I especially liked the emoticon faced robot voiced by Spacey. He seemed to nail the disembodied, somewhat emotionless voice needed for such a machine. Score: Mansell, whose Lux Aerterna from Requiem For A Dream has been so overused over the past decade to make sure the royalties he's got to be receiving will almost certainly keep his many future generations rich or at least comfortable makes a haunting, piano-led with strings(in some tracks) minimalist score that fits the film like a glove.Overall: I couldn't take my eyes off the big screen when I saw this. With an acting masterclass from Rockwell, this promising debut shows what sci-fi used to do before directors saw it as an excuse to showcase the newest advances in CGI.Shall be getting it on DVD/BD to watch it an infinite number of times to pick up things I missed, as this is one that needs numerous watches to fully understand and appreciate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive, intimate science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Moon", for all the comparisons to cerebral SF films of the past, boils down to essential human drama, albeit with a neat twist. The feature debuts of director Duncan Jones and cinematographer Gary Shaw aren't always impressive, as what initially seems to be a deliberately grungy look is proved by awful use of slow-motion and some very clumsy transitions to be the result of inexperienced direction, while Shaw's work is consistently dull and plain. The effects work (model miniatures used) is not too impressive either, even considering the low budget for the film. However, the screenplay by Nathan Parker is absolutely excellent, with superb story development, dialogue, and characterization, and some very good ideas which are, contrary to what many critical reviews say, pretty well-explored (and subtly, too). Sam Rockwell's performance is sublime, and while the aesthetic does let the screenplay and performance down a bit, Jones does succeed at creating a great, suspenseful atmosphere and deserves credit for Rockwell's performance as well, surely, and the film is very nicely-paced. Very good score by Clint Mansell and voice work by Kevin Spacey help the film succeed. A minor gem.</fullReview>

Lone astronaut/operative nearing end of 3 year contract overseeing the exploitation of the moon's surface for clean energy for Earth.What a great surprise! I came to see this film because of Sam Rockwell, but feared another Polaris. How unfounded these fears were. Intelligent script, superb lead protagonist, and kudos to Kevin Spacey's 'Gerty'. Forget all the fancy CGI, monsters, explosions etc that you usually find with Sci-Fi. It Felt authentic, and that made it more personal.Go to see this if you want to immerse yourself in a film. Not a switch your brain off movie in the slightest. It made me think, and feel. Great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Man and his Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The debut feature of Duncan Jones, Moon is extraordinary. Small in scope, but beautifully formed, framed, designed and executed, it is a constant delight. Despite dealing with the very nature of existence, it is never heavy-handed, never hectoring or dry, always intriguing and interesting. And all this with essentially only one character, Sam (Sam Rockwell), a character whom throughout the film we actually learn very little about. We are given glimpses, snapshots of his life before the moon-base, but he remains for the majority of the film a cipher, a sketch of a character. But this is an incredibly complex sketch, and one which retains it's subtlety throughout the film.Moon is very aware of its sources, but it draws upon the best of the genre: 2001, Silent Running and Solaris. The plot is not original, but moves in an altogether unexpected direction, while continuing to explore similar themes to its influences. The nature of existence, identity, loneliness and the manifestation and corruptibility of memory are all tackled here, with the deciding vote being left at the discretion of us all. Jones does not patronise us with coherent answers or polemics, he provides the vehicle for the discussion and keeps us engrossed in the trials of the central character.Moon is a very humanistic film, quite unlike 2001 in terms of the behaviour of the characters. We have no men developing machine traits, and no machines becoming more human. The humanity of the piece is best encapsulated by Sam's single urge - to return home to Earth. He is no happy spaceman, he has lost all pioneer spirit by the time we are invited into his story. His exploration is limited to minor forays out onto the surface of the Moon in armoured vehicles, and he does not identify himself as anything out of the ordinary, despite his location. He displays little ambition, other than to return home at the end of his contract with his sanity intact, but this allows us to have a clear mind concerning his travails, without the usual distractions and smoke and mirrors. Every emotion which is betrayed has a thematic purpose, and this is of great credit to the director and writer.I feel that Moon will reward repeat viewings. This is an intricate work and one with depth, a picture which is unafraid to trade in philosophy and ethics, a picture which eschews broad strokes for delicate handling. This is not Star Wars and all the better for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instant Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How wonderfully surprised I was to see this film.. I felt as if I had stumbled into an art film house in the seventies. It's an instant classic. These film makers went back to a very simple and trusted idea that modern films have wholly forgotten ? "it's the script stupid!" Tell me a story. A good story is entertainment all by itself. Forget all the hoopla about special effects, and explosions, and blood ? nudity. Tell people a good story, and that's how you make an instant classic. As far as sci-fi/sci-fantasy goes, it's up there with "Metropolis," "THX 1138," "2001 A Space Odyssey, "Blade Runner," and "Millennium." I thought the art direction was fantastic; it looks like the Moon. Great job guys! There are so few modern films worth watching in a theatre ? go see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the 40th anniversary of the U.S. Moon landing looming,the time is right for this nicely written &amp; directed film on a what seems like a future Moon mission. Astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell)has been on the Moon for the last three years,harvesting materials to be sent back to Earth for renewable energy. Sam is long overdue to return to Earth, missing his wife &amp; young daughter. Sam starts to experience nagging headaches,persistent hallucinations &amp; worsening health. The fact that he's seen a younger version of himself only manages to make things worse (space fever,loneliness,etc.?). Kevin Spacey adds his voice to all of this as the voice of the on board computer,GERTY (an evil spawn of HAL?),who seems to know what's best for Sam. Duncan Jones (son of David &amp; Angela Bowie)directs a mighty fine tale of space madness &amp; evil corporate goings on that will keep you guessing. Rated 'R' by the MPAA for raunchy language,some violence &amp; the unpleasant effects of space madness. Probably advisable to keep the young ones home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As other posts have noted, it difficult to discuss much of the film without giving away some juicy and crucial surprises. Yes, some aspects of this movie are derivative, but that's unavoidable given how many space films have gone before. They key aspects of this film are uniquely revealed and resolved. And you will have to pay very close attention. (Don;t expect everyone to be into this kind of cerebral film -- after wards, my wife just kind of shrugged her shoulders, and I spent 20 minutes explaining the plot and real-world implications on the drive home.) A couple of interesting notes: 1. "Sarum" and it's prevalent Hangul characters seen in the main lunar station and elsewhere mean "love" in Korean. 2. One of the actors playing one of the central control team members back on earth is Benedict Wong who was a crew member in the British sci-fi film "Sunshine" and it was his mistake that started the downward slide in that one. Perhaps he overlooked something again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci Fi film on fast track to classic status</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With just two weeks to go on a three year hitch mining minerals on the moon an isolated man (Sam) awaits a return to earth and his wife and young daughter. Spare and stripped down to the essence of the central conflict (Man vs. technology) Moon shows a heavy 2001 influence but the Sean Connery film "Outland" is a precursor as well as the film introduces corporate greed into the equation. The story involves Sam talking to "gertie" a computer voiced by Kevin Spacey. Gertie pretty much calls the shots but what really gets Sam confused is when he awakens in the infirmary to find a carbon copy of himself going about duties on the station. He is exactly the same as Sam except he appears to have just started his tour of duty. Is one of them a clone? Is Sam still alive? Is this a dream? Moon asks a lot from the viewer in terms of paying attention but for those who stick with this acting tour de force will be richly rewarded by a conclusion that makes more sense the more that you think about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great sci-fi debut from a promising director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Rockwell is the sole human caretaker of a clean energy mining base on the moon, due to go home in two weeks, when strange images start to haunt him. Is he just a little homesick, or is something strange happening? A simple premise, and in the hands of amateurs this $5m budget sci-fi indie flick could have turned into a predictable series of space clichés, but the inspired acting of Sam Rockwell and the creative force of Duncan Jones (formerly Zowie Bowie, and a near-ringer for his dad) turn it into a compelling, thoughtful film dealing with issues of technology, corporatism, loneliness, human identity, and long-distance love. I saw this tonight at a British Film Institute screening in London, which included a Q&amp;A with Duncan Jones. He explained some of the challenges and solutions of creating low-budget, meaningful science-fiction films in a world populated by Transformers and a powerful but largely safe mainstream sci-fi industry. His obvious devotion and keen knowledge of science fiction shows through in the film's homages to classics of 1970s/1980s sci-fi, retaining the darker feel of those times while bringing the story right into the 21st century. This is a must-see. Fans of this film will be happy to know he is working on another sci-fi project called "Mute" set in a futuristic Berlin, and one doesn't need to read the zodiac to be certain this is one director whose star is definitely ascending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when this came out and being excited to go and see it. Not sure what happened but I never did. Fast forward, and last week I watched it for the first time. It is now my favourite movie. Sam Rockwell was so good in this and made the characters so believable that I haven't been able to stop thinking about it or them. There has been a lot of mention that the saddest part was when Sam1 found out from Gerty that he was a clone or when he made the call to Eve in the truck, but I found that when Sam2 took Sam1 back to the crashed vehicle and left him there to be the most devastating for me. Also when Sam1 told Sam2 that he was so lonely... his eyes looked desperate. I love all aspects of this film, the direction, score, using miniatures, but Sam Rockwell's acting has made this my favourite film. It's my favourite piece(s) of acting from any film. The ending was spot on too. Please Duncan can you make a sequel, or give us something more. I think the reactions and motivations of the original Sam Bell would be really fascinating. Why did he do it? Does he meet Sam2(clone6)? What about all the many clones still up on base? So many questions!! Still, it holds it's own regardless. Love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting and thought-provoking movie, that, however, isn't always entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if science fiction movies aren't your cup of tea, some products of this genre manage to move and entertain you way beyond the simple idea of life in outer space. 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of these films. Blade Runner or Solaris as well. And the newest addition to this small amount of movies is the debut by David Bowie's son, Duncan Jones. The Briton explores life in complete solitude with Sam Rockwell doing one of the best turns in his career in the hugely affecting Sundance drama Moon.An obviously HAL-3000-commemorative electronic pal named GERTY who has his voice lent by Kevin Spacey tells Rockwell's protagonist that his days without any interactions with other human beings are coming to an end in one of the first scenes of this movie. The three-year moon mission he's been doing is in its final stadium and he, sharing the first name with the actor that plays him, can look forward on seeing his wife again and his young daughter for the first time. It is clear that Sam isn't in his peak form, yet he is a sensible guy that doesn't show any alerting signs of illnesses. For now. A couple scenes later, hallucinations start to kick in, and they turn out to be the reason for a momentous crash that starts the detection part of the movie. A mindblowing explanation for everything that happens in Moon is revealed, but in parts, so that the audience can utter their wows in an even order. While the introduction scenes in the movie seem to foreshadow a too realistic and thus boring approach to the story, Jones reveals his talent for creating suspense later on and while becoming more and more confused, the audience also develops a greater bond to the protagonist respectively the movie itself.Besides the amazing one-man-job that Sam Rockwell delivers, the subliminal references to the sci-fi classics that influenced writer/director Duncan Jones, or the realistic design the team managed to call into existence, the distinctly biggest asset of Moon are the many important questions it poses. To reveal them would be a spoiler in a lot of cases and I think that it becomes clear what you should think about when you're watching the movie. To just give you an impression of the movie's philosophy (without getting into spoiler territory): How much do people need other people to survive? What does it mean exactly to be human? Where are the verges of morality?I personally found Moon to be a very interesting and thought-provoking movie that was also deeply stirring and emotional. The great score by Clint Mansell (the genius behind Requiem for a Dream's music) gave the scenes an auxiliary touching effect and, as I've already mentioned, Sam Rockwell acts absolutely masterfully. The visuals are definitely not as interesting as in some other movies of its genre, yet the look is quite an achievement if you consider the small budget. An issue that pretty much everyone will face while watching Moon is that it tends to be quite tedious and you will really lose interest during some of the long wordless shots. However, that didn't bother me that much since there were lots of other well-made scenes and the general feeling I had while watching the movie, which was an unsettling sadness. Moon is relatively unique and impressing and I'd recommend it to everyone who appreciates material to think about when watching a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trapped... In The Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Duncan Jones's 'Moon' is perhaps THE most underrated movie of 2009. Not that I consider these film awards highly credible but how can an obviously remarkable movie like this one get overlooked? Jones's film pays homage to many sci-fi classics but 'Moon' is very much its own film as the story is original.Made under a tight budget, Jones has used models rather than depend completely on CGI and that only gives 'Moon' a rather authentic look than the CGI world one has so often witnessed in other sci-fi films. That said, the special effects department have done a terrific job in being minimal and subtle. The score is also very subtle and highly effective. The sets are simplistic but they really capture the detachment of the atmosphere and the loneliness and sense of isolation of Sam Bell. Jones has put a lot of heart into the writing while Parker has done a great job with the screenplay.Jones specifically wrote the part of Sam Bell for Sam Rockwell and what a gift and honour it must be for an actor to have someone write a movie especially for him. It's a bit disappointing that Rockwell's tour du force performance has been criminally overlooked as it's easily one of the best (if not THE best) performances of the year (easily beats 'Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner and maybe even 'Up In The Air's George Clooney).'Moon' certainly isn't your average science fiction film. There are no aliens or explosions or save-the-world missions. It's been a while since I had seen an original science fiction film since 'Sunshine' and then comes 'Moon' like a breath of fresh air, a movie that is exhilarating, poignant and inspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great but Flawed Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MOON is perhaps one of the most difficult of films to judge because the basic plot outline and the emotional messages are so penetrating and compelling that like THERE WILL BE BLOOD (2007), the performances and the story are so intriguing and captivating that the movie's flaws seem to be washed over, if not away by the end of the movie. However, there are enough inconsistencies and issues with MOON that while this movie is great, it likely misses being a classic, like a blemished diamond. However, overall, MOON is a powerful movie with a strong story that is involving, surprising at times and more down to earth than initially meets the eye. There are resemblances to a number of other movies, especially 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and the set design is strongly suggestive of parts of Nosotromo in ALIEN (1979). There are also a spattering of themes from SOYLENT GREEN (1973), OUTLAND (1981), BLADE RUNNER (1982), and THE MATRIX (1999). One problem is the expanded room scene using fake background illustrations, though a bit better than those in the next to the last episode (a haunting one at that) of the original STAR TREK - "All Our Yesterdays" (1969) and the corridor of vast computer library. There are also problems with moon tracks in the dust which really would have given away too much for anyone really looking. It's also too bad that plot ideas from MULTIPLICITY (1996) couldn't have been used to lighten things up. Even with the few problems with this movie is it very entertaining and by the end a rewarding movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fresh Take on the Sci-fi Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon has been labeled an "indie-sci-fi film". And with a directorial debut from Duncan Jones, very little CGI, and a budget of 5 million dollars, it is just that. If you were like me and don't quite know what to expect from this film, you should be pleasantly surprised. Yes, Moon is a sci-fi film, but its focus is 100 percent on character and psychology. In a way, it is reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey (without question the greatest science fiction tale ever put to film). There is spectacle in both films, but it takes a back seat to some very original, human ideas.Moon is set sometime in the future, although we are never given a specific year. Fossil fuels and common sources of energy on earth have been completely used up. Luckily, the moon's surface is rich with some kind of helium, which can be used to make energy through nuclear fusion. The company in charge of this mining process, Lunar Industries, employs Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) to supervise all the mining equipment on the moon. Sam is under a three-year contract; in his solitude he watches television, grows plants, and receives video messages from his wife and newborn daughter. His only companion is the computer GERTY (appropriately voiced by Kevin Spacey) who too closely resembles HAL from 2001. The film begins with the final weeks of Sam's contract. It would be difficult to continue explaining the film's plot without ruining it, so I won't even attempt to do so.Within 30 minutes, the film rejects traditional sci-fi elements and turns into something you would never expect it to be. It also requires some close attention; some twists are explained so quickly that you may be scratching your head by the end of the film. Pay attention to the last lines of the movie. It raises some ethical Blade Runner-esquire questions while setting the film up for a sequel (which Duncan Jones has already confirmed).The most important thing about a film like Moon is the performance. There's a lot of chatter within the internet community about Sam Rockwell's performance and a possible Academy Award nomination. Rockwell (who forever will be "Wild Bill" from The Green Mile to me) is a very solid supporting actor, but doesn't have the type of screen presence to carry an entire film. Don't get me wrong, he gets the job done. In a one-man show like Moon, Rockwell has a lot of masks to wear. However, an Oscar-worthy performance should keep the viewer transfixed, and by the end of the film, I just wasn't quite sold.Although it has its flaws, Moon is unique, enjoyable, and a must see for viewers looking for something fresh in the sci-fi genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>split subjectivity, on the moon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We were kind of relieved that the space-creepiness turned into a more philosophically rewarding plot about clones, loneliness, and human rights abuse. Really, great plot. It seems like more blockbuster movies these days from Moon to Avatar are realizing the corruption of the corporate-military-technology complex and how there are no limits to the means it would adopt to make more money, from genocide (avatar) to self-destructing clones (moon), as long as it can keep it secret or have good PR. Moon is probably even more explicitly critical than Avatar about our contemporary political situation (a nod to the immigration debate in a last broadcast from earth).The movie posed some interesting questions related to my research interests about the social constitution of subjectivity: how we need people to mentally survive, even if we project personhood onto machines or even get only the most limited images/videos of other people from the Jupiter link. We are social beings. Thus the most endearing moments of this movie are when the clones finally start to work together and have empathy for each other's sufferings. Another question is about identity itself: is the self a unity or a disunity. I interpreted the plot as an allegory for split subjectivity: the two clones are really the same person but notice their hostility towards each other. In other words, the self is not a unity, but can be at war with itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moon is a fine film with a story which is plausible and well produced. Sam, played excellently by Sam Rockwell, is approaching the end of his three year contract on the Moon, where he has been extracting Helium-3 to resource Earth with energy. GERTY, a computer system, who will inevitably be compared to HAL is Sam's lone companion on the Moon, whose purpose is to ensure the safe and continual extraction of Helium-3. I like the idea of Moon, that the Earth depends on a single man and a lone computer to provide energy. It has a somewhat comforting feel and we are not distracted by environmental concerns or other characters. The special effects and score are both able to conjure an unsettling feel. Moon thrives through its fine production and focus, and is an intelligent and a very good sci-fi film with real heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Rockwell carried this movie by himself SO well. He plays an astronaut on the moon harvesting a mineral to be sent back to Earth. Machines run by themselves and when they have collected a full tank of minerals, Sam takes a rover to change out the tanks and send the full tanks back to Earth. His only companion is a machine voiced by Kevin Spacey. Each astronaut is given a three year tour aboard this space station and it is almost time for Sam to return to Earth. Shortly before that time approaches, Sam starts to see things. It could just be cabin fever...or not. Sam Rockwell shows all facets of his acting abilities in this movie, weak, strong, funny, angry, silly, he shows them all. The only thing that bothered me was how pristine the station was and how dirty GERTY was. This movie was perfectly cast and well written.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A compelling sci-fi in the cerebral mode of 2001 and Solaris (with a hint of Ishiguro thematically), Moon explores themes of loneliness, belonging and identity in an intriguing and entertaining fashion.Sam is the sole worker on a mining complex on the dark side of the moon. Approaching the end of his three-year shift, his isolation is exacerbated by technical problems hitting the link to his earthly wife and child. He is left with only GERTY to talk to, his HAL-like computer.Sam Rockwell nails all aspects of the put-upon astronaut, who swings episodically between rage, bewilderment, despair and enchantment. Jones handles pacing and plotting impeccably. Spacey voicing of GERTY is both eerie and comforting.Like most films, the less you know about the premise of this one, the better. Destined to be a classic of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pays homage to sci-fi classics of the 70's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I didn't know that the director of this movie was David Bowie's son, Duncan Jones, until I read about it in here. It wouldn't have mattered, a good film is a good film, no matter who did it.This film reminds me heavily of sci-fi classics from the late 60's and 70's. I was reminded of "2001", "Silent Running", and even the TV show "Space 1999". This might be because I think the special effects were achieved through model-making like they used to in the 70's, rather than computer CGI as they do nowadays. It shows that there's still a place for model-making, and in certain circumstances it looks more realistic than CGI.The filmmaker even uses our knowledge of these past films against us. For example, we're all used to the evil computer HAL on 2001. So when we watch the computer on this base, GERTY, we have certain assumptions about its motives, and thus we're surprised by its actual motives in the end. Even the use of the actor Kevin Spacey, as the voice of GERTY aids in the illusion, since we know his roles from the past where he's played some very strange characters, makes us think this is going to be similar to one of his old roles.Sam Rockwell's performance was excellent, as Sam Bell. And we shouldn't forget Robin Chalk's performance as a young Sam Bell. I would say that the actors, Rockwell, Spacey, Chalk were actually part of making the special effects illusion work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been waiting for a film that is as good as 2001-Space Odyssey, Moon comes close. With a similar theme but based on a more realistic scenario this film brings a possible future situation nearer when we are looking for good commercial reasons for returning to the Moon and the urgent need to find alternative sources of power. The excellent acting by Sam Rockwell and directing by Duncan Jones shows that SciFi's films do not need aliens and zombies to produce excitement, tension and visual drama. Gerty, the computer who looks after Sam Bell, the sole inhabitant of an automated lunar mining base extracting Helium-3 from lunar rocks for Earth's Fusion reactors, is, like Hal in 2001 but not so sinister. I liked the exciting twist at the end which I will not reveal as a spoiler. I hope the success of this film will enable money to be found for a sequel or a similar film about Mars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and directed by Duncan Jones, Moon is strangely unique because while it contained a series of familiar clichés, it still managed to string itself together in an engaging manner, also in a large part thanks to Sam Rockwell's stellar one-man show, acting against himself with the occasional banter with a computer voiced by Kevin Spacey and represented by a smiley emoticon interface.In the future, Man has found that we can power our planet harnessing the H3 gas found in abundance in our moon. As such, Lunar Industries had begun sending astronaut contractors to the moon in order to oversee the harnessing of the vital resource. Each contract lasts 3 years, and we are soon introduced to Sam Bell (Rockwell), who has 2 weeks more to the end of contract, and just cannot wait to get out of his career isolation, where the live communications link has been severed, and his contact with the outside world relies heavily on pre-recorded messages being sent to and fro.To say anything more would be to spoil the story, since a major turn of events happen very early, and from then on it's the posing of questions ranging from existentialism, to the circle of life. The plot elements in Jones' story are nothing new, and in fact quite overused in contemporary science fiction films of late, though the advantage here is that its quiet, soundless environment provides plenty of room for thought as opposed to loud action films. It allows its ideas to sink in, while at the same time, thanks to Rockwell's tour de force performance, allowed you to buy into his plight, and experience the same level of despair and disbelief of the truth, and that degree of loneliness should you happen to be in his shoes.The production sets and miniatures used are intricately designed, which will provide space junkies a field day in just gawking at the level of detail, which is quite impressive given that it's shot on a relatively shoestring budget. And who can fail to mention the magic of Clint Mansell's score which once again provides an additional dimension with its extremely memorable theme that would set the entire mood and tone for the film, which hypnotically guides you through the story and move you.Moon has plenty of positives going for it, especially if you prefer a thinking man's science fiction film with great acting against beautiful sets accentuated with a wonderful musical score, and despite some familiar themes, you'd find yourself appreciating this simple work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very encouraging to see that movies like this can still be made today because the future of film has been looking very bleak lately I had a discussion very recently about how suspense has disappeared from movie making, and how movies even as recent as Alien would not be made anymore. This discussion was prompted by district 9 which I found to be 100% show and no substance, a quite ludicrous movie Moon has certainly restored my faith in cinema, and especially in lower budget cinema. This film is low on show and all about substance - fabulous acting, story, direction. With understated but artistic visual effects and sound It's rare that art movie meets sci-fi, and the two come together spectacularly well here. The result is that we have a sci-fi movie that actually has something to say about an extremely relevant and under-discussed issue, that of cloning (you know the growth of stem cells and the leeching of life, so that Joe Celebrity can have a few less wrinkles on their botox) and the questionable ethical future that we might be building for ourselves as a species It makes me smile when I read comments from people that find this kind of film making boring. If that is you then no worries huh? You can take your pick from just about every other movie screened this year, i.e p^ss off and go watch Transformers. Heathen</fullReview>

Not long left till he leaves (or so he thinks) and then some drastic revelations throw the whole thing into a spin and leaves our central character with a shocking dilemma.Won't give much away, as the movie revolves a moral issue which is extracted to give the viewer some big to chew on. Sam Rockwell is fine and a very sympathetic actor in the lead role, whilst Kevin Spacey lends his hypnotic voice to the voice.The only issue is that it was not going to be easy to put an ending to this film for the writers. Personally, I wasn't enthralled by the ending, however the rest of the film makes up for it.I enjoyed it, and there are fewer more intelligent films out there than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best sci-fi since forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How long have we waited for a true sci-fi movie? Ten years ago the world was introduced to The Phantom Menace, which killed the sci-fi genre as just being eye candy for kids. Moon is a true sci-fi movie, best since Blade Runner. The film is about this guy called Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell) that gets a job harvesting resources on the moon, for much needed resources on Earth. He has been living and working there for almost three years, and will go back to his family in two weeks when suddenly he starts seeing things. His robotic assistant named Gerty assures him he is just imagining things, but he continues to see these illusions and gets into an accident. After he recovers, he discovers someone else that looks exactly like him, and isn't an illusion. The production design is through the roof, especially for a film with this low a budget ($5,000,000? Looks like $100,000,000!) and uses barely any cgi and mostly models. This is really well directed, and I can't wait to see more from this director. Sam Rockwell's performance is terrific, really deserves Best Actor of the year. The rest of the cast is good too, for the three minutes they appear. It really feels Human, and I admit I got teary-eyed whilst watching it. It's in very few theaters, so try to find it on DVD (not pirated, that'd be wrong) and it's truly the sci-fi us true fans of the genre have been waiting for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers Below*Moon is an excellent and refreshingly original Sci-Fi film. It tells the story of Sam Bell, a lone employee of lunar (a multi-national energy company) who is under a 3 year contract extracting H3 from the moons surface and sending it back to earth. During his daily routine he starts having hallucinations followed by an accident which reveals some shocking truths about his existence.Sam Rockwell gave a fantastic performance, the story was clever and you really felt like you were going along for the ride. In parts the pacing felt a little slow but I think this actually helped accentuate the loneliness and isolation Sam was feeling.Another thing I liked a lot about this film was the fact that the robots/computers were not evil sentient beings that caused problems for the crew. It felt more realistic and it also prevented the film going down a 2001 route that so many films have copied.The modern futuristic but dirty look was really nice too; it felt more authentic and believable.Overall I give this film an 8/10 - if you are a fan of Sci-Fi you should definitely watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hal had the ultimate poker face. A yellow pupil of sorts ensconced in red light, the rogue computer who commandeered the Discovery in Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" was unreadable; a mere orb, an "eye" that looked into the eyes of its crewmen, and lied. Just before Hal makes a fallacious prognosis on the spacecraft's well-being, this inscrutable piece of conscious hardware projects its own misgivings about the Jupiter mission onto Dave(Keir Dullea), who doesn't realize that the computer is downplaying the veracity of the moon excavation findings. Late in the film, we learn that HAL knows about the monolith, which vexes him, as does the ongoing sojourn to the stars. When HAL says it's "protecting HIS own concerns" about the mission, the crewman misses the malevolence in this statement. In Hal's unnervingly modulated voice, belies the hatching of a murder plot. If only HAL had a face, then maybe the hapless astronauts would stand a fighting chance of guessing at its duplicity.The computer in "Moon", GERTY(voiced by Kevin Spacey) has one of those "have a nice day" smiley faces that may, or may not, correspond to what its "feeling". It's the second face we're interested in, the one with the ulterior motive, underneath that pixelated smile which assures Sam(Sam Rockwell) that "he's" the next best thing to being human. Whereas HAL was remote and carried an air of condescension towards Dave and Frank(Ken Lockwood), GERTY seems nurturing and approachable, an illusion created by the representational face on its screen. While GERTY isn't a murderer like HAL, this affable piece of technology is definitely complicit to the murders on board the ship. When the Lunar Industries employee(who sends moon-based energy back to Earth) communicates his excitement about returning home over breakfast, GERTY puts on a happy face, knowing full well that Sam is a clone, and will die in space. Unlike HAL, however, this computer can be outsmarted. The new Sam discovers his predecessor in a wrecked lunar vehicle after convincing GERTY that the ship needed some outside repairing. Unlike HAL, this computer tows the company line. The new Sam overhears GERTY talking to its terrestrial-based bosses from a live feed purported to be inoperable. They're on the same page: for the economical virtue of profit, both man and machine work together to prevent the laborer from learning the truth. Unlike HAL, when GERTY goes rogue, and this is the biggest difference between the two artificial intelligences, the computer's agenda is to save, not kill, like a subordinate the machine is purported to be. But GERTY's conspiratorial decision to keep Sam's recovery a secret from headquarters lacks motivation. In spite of the film's anti-Bay approach to science fiction("Moon" has the tone of Douglas Trumbull's "Silent Running"), this admirably restrained indie, compromises itself, much like the Spielberg/Kubrick joint venture "AI", in the sense that GERTY plays like a Spielbergian take on HAL. In other words, "Moon" starts off as sharp cheddar, and ends up like a soft brie. The second Sam convinces the computer to wake up another clone so he and the first Sam can avert certain death at the hands of the company's fast-approaching trouble-shooters. The second Sam wants to kill the new Sam and stage his corpse inside the lunar vehicle. And that's where "Moon" starts to wobble. Late in the film, the second Sam explains to GERTY that humans aren't programmed, and yet, by participating in a potential murder plot to save lives, the computer acts as if it's already made the distinction between man and machine, therefore not care if the clones lived or died. GERTY turns out to be more like "E.T.", than the cold and calculating HAL. Whereas HAL needed to be shut down(the computer feared that a higher intelligence than himself awaited them in Jupiter), GERTY voluntarily powers off, and reboots, to erase all traces of the earthbound Sam. The difference between GERTY and HAL reminds me of the moment in "AI", when a moon(pure Spielbergian imagery), reveals itself to be an aircraft on the prowl for runaway androids in the woods(Spielberg gone dystopian). It was a perfect synthesis of Spielberg and Kubrick's filmic, and philosophical sensibilities. "Moon", however, didn't need the former's influence. But still, the film is pure science fiction, and is the best of its kind(more "speculative fiction" than space opera) since David Twohy's "The Arrival".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great opportunity to utilize an under-appreciated actor like Sam Rockwell to create a thought provoking look at the subject of cloning. Unfortunately, a great individual performance goes by the boards in a less than original si fi treatment of this controversial subject. Space has often been used as the playground for artists hoping "suspend the disbelief" of their audiences allowing them to consider the nature of a film's focus. Neither the use of Kubrick's menacing computer "HAL" nor the images akin to hallucinations did justice to either the aforementioned Kubrick or the Russian film Solaris. Both of these films used space to examine human nature. Moon never reaches these depths. Gerty, the not so menacing computer in this film, is sort of devious and kind of helpful. Rockwell's discovery of a clone of himself aboard the ship is a little unsettling, but within moments the two are playing ping pong. The film fails to capitalize on the psychological turmoil caused by isolation not to mention the ethical and moral delimmas cloning poses. With one character and a setting confined almost exclusively to space station, the director just couldn't bring himself to peel back the skin and bore into the human psyche. Very odd and disappointing conclusion to the film attempting to "wrap things up" in the last five minutes or so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I think of the word moon I don't just think of our moon, the Moon, but a distant body floating along, slightly disconnected but close enough for contact. That is more what Duncan Jones' debut film Moon is about.It stars Sam Rockwell as Sam Bell, the one man crew of Lunar Industries energy base located on, you guessed it, the Moon. He is alone with the station's computer/robot Gerty (voiced marvelously by Kevin Spacey) for three years and is only two weeks away from his return trip home. He has a wife and child he has yet to hold back on Earth. Everything seems to be going well.Then it happens. An accident while checking one of the harvesters. He wakes up back in the base and is bombarded with tests by the computer. His memory of the incident is gone and all that he knows is there has been an accident and he is not allowed back outside. He is determined to get outside.What happens next I don't want to get into. Watch the trailer to try and get an idea for yourself. What ensues, at least to me, is one of the best psychological science fiction stories of all time. It asks so many questions about what is right and wrong, the value of one's life, and how far is too far for science to go. This film shows what happens when a man is pushed to the limit in a place where the limit is very confined.This is Rockwell's defining moment as an actor. His characters up until this point have been surprisingly good (especially in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), but this is the one. You can read his face and know exactly what he is feeling. There were times when I wanted to tell him everything will be alright, even though I wasn't sure. I can only imagine what three years in virtual isolation can feel like.The real winner here is Duncan and his spectacular approach to this genre. He uses very recognizable technologies tied in with futuristic advancements that are a stretch, but not by much. From a visual standpoint you will be hard pressed to find a more realistic looking sci/fi film. I'm guessing he used a combination of green screen, models, and some CGI to create such a realistic lunar landscape. It gives the story an added boost.From start to finish this is an impressive film from both a technical standpoint and a stylistic one. Moon is that rare piece of science fiction that tinkers with the way you look at the world we live in and not just the future. There is a good amount of deep thinking that can be dredged up from watching this film. Some people might find that annoying. I think that is what makes film so enjoyable. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie before it leaves the theaters. Waiting for this one to be released would be a mistake.</fullReview>

Moon looks and feels like so many other films before it, with certain elements that appear to be directly copied from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Solaris, Alien and more. However, all of the cloned bits in this film serve the purpose of setting up the viewers expectations for one thing and delivering something else instead. The upshot is that this film is a more than welcome entry for a sci-fi genre that is mostly dominated these days with shockingly high budgets poured into creating mindless violence and excessive special fx served up at brain-numbing speeds -- all intent on giving you absolutely nothing to think about. Sam Rockwell gives superb performances, as always. And Duncan Jones (David Bowie's son), despite several loose ends and questionable choices that in other films might have ruined the movie for me, makes a promising feature film directorial debut. I recommend the film for fans of sci-fi who like to use their brains.</fullReview>

Some of the things in this film actually could happen in real life. Some other things are not within our realm of knowledge, but could be very soon. They are already working on downloading people's memories. Although there are hallucinations in the beginning, this film is not about the hallucinations. It is about a man's relationship with himself. I liked this film a lot. There were some obvious references to 2001, but I think this was done intentionally as a tribute to that film. For example, in the beginning he is seen running on a treadmill, the computer is clearly a parody of HAL and in the end he is seen traveling through space and vibrating with psychedelic colors, just like the end of 2001. All in all a well done film made by David Bowie's son.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big Questions: Can director Duncan Jones, David Bowie's son, get out from behind his father's shadow with his own space oddity? Is "Moon" the thought provoking, 2001-esque science fiction flick it's being billed as? Will Sam Rockwell, being the only person on screen for most of the time, be able to anchor a film all by himself? Rockwell plays Sam Bell, an astronaut working for Lunar Industries, a company responsible for 70% of the Earth's energy, which they harvest from the moon. After a good three years of sending parcels of energy back to Earth, Sam is just two weeks away from being able to see his wife (Dominique McElligott) and young daughter (Kaya Scodelario) again. The three years of isolation, and only having the ship's computer Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) to talk to, have not done Sam's state of mind any good as he either talks to himself or starts seeing things at different points of his day, his wife included. Just a very weird thing happens after being bombarded by a storm of rock while on a mission at one of the mechanical harvesters. Injured, he is awakened later in the infirmary thinking that Gerty saved him. He's told that a rescue team is on the way and that he must stay inside until they arrive, but disobeying orders he heads back out to the harvester and finds another him, unconscious. He brings the other him back to the ship where a lot of questions lay in front of them both.Nathan Parker's screenplay is nothing mind blowing but if you're in the mood for a good psychological drama, this one more than fits the bill. It's slow moving but your head will be working a mile a minute trying to figure out the secrets that lay in store here. Which one of the Sams is the real Sam? Has all this isolation finally driven Sam loco? Could the company that Sam works for be playing with him, putting him into some kind of experimental test or something? Jones proves to be an expert in paranoia, creating a claustrophobic and weirdly surreal situation. It gets so crazy at one point that the two Sam's even start a fight with one another. The production design is really good too, the lunar rovers and the space shuttle, with its dirty white walls that somehow add to the suspense in their own way, are like throwbacks to old movies such as Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and, in a way, the movie is kind of an ode to both.And Sam Rockwell is terrific here, taking on the dual roles with a level of quirky craziness and moving vulnerability that keeps Sam compelling. Kevin Spacey also gives a good robotic vocal.Moon will alienate some with it's slow-moving, overly-thinky subject matter but if your in the mood to give your brain a work-out and be prepared to talk about it afterwards, Jones' first directorial effort is a major success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Rockwell at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon has been one of my most anticipated films of the year ever since I saw the trailer a few months ago. Everything about the trailer pulled me in. Sam Rockwell looked to put in an incredible performance, the score sounded incredibly solid and fit the film like a glove, and it just looked like a really amazing sci-fi film. Have you ever walked away from a film completely satisfied? That feeling you have when you see a film that just sticks with you as its most memorable moments play through your head and you smile a little as you walk to your car? That's the feeling that pulsed through me after seeing Moon. A feeling that I've only felt a handful of times (The Dark Knight, Benjamin Button, Up, and Moon come to mind).Sam Rockwell is really in top form here. I've always wanted to like him, but had always seen him in films where it felt like he was holding back and not showing his full potential. Moon definitely corrected that as Rockwell is really able to portray his acting range and how wonderful he really is. When I saw 1408, the first thing that crossed my mind after it ended was that John Cusack really carried that film. It was just him alone in a hotel room the majority of the film and he was able to make that worth watching. What John Cusack is to 1408, Sam Rockwell is to Moon as it's just Sam reacting to himself during the film's duration.It's not often that I get to say a film met my expectations or satisfied me in every way, but Moon did just that. This is Sam Rockwell at his best. The film pulls you in as soon as the opening scene hits with Sam running on a treadmill and that familiar music from the trailer kicks in. My craving for an incredible and original sci-fi film for quite some time was met with this and it delivered in every aspect. This film has a limited release that will surely only be available for a limited time until it hits DVD. If it comes to a theater near you, be sure to see it. It's definitely in the running for my favorite film of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>9 out of 10 for being well-done and an attempt at serious science fiction. But as a film, at best 8 out 10 (maybe 7.5).Nicely done, nicely played, very nicely acted. But the story has holes bigger than the craters on the moon. To name them is to give out spoilers, and the movie is so nicely done and so captivating that you don't necessarily recognize the story line flaws until late in the movie, or even after the movie has ended; you know, one of those "hey, how could that have happened?" or "wait a minute, why did they do that?" moments. It's too bad, as the story could have been without many of its essential flaws and inconsistencies. The external shots are nice, but in many cases look like models rather than the "real thing." Still, a valiant effort, and worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indy Scifi for Adults...You Will Enjoy It !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love an Indy Scifi that tries so hard to be believable. In a time of big budget bombs aimed at 12 year old's it is refreshing to see something aimed at the adults.The special effects were great for a low budget movie. This movie had the look and feel of a real moon base with just about everything you would expect. It looked better and was more realistic than many modern space movies.The script and the acting were great. I would have added a few lines of dialog to make things more clear but overall it was well done. I think the characters should have been a little more sleuth like in their endeavors and their questions, but perhaps that's just me. Given the short time frame to "take it all in" perhaps I wouldn't have done much better.The pace of the movie was pretty good, but did have a few slow spots. I know this was just to expand on the characters but I think it could have been sped up a bit and a little more action or sleuthing thrown in.Truly, it should have been a PG-13, not R rated. I guess it is OK to see people get blown to smithereens or vaporized but not to say the F word. The language wasn't even that bad in this movie. The R rating is a little silly here and shows that you can't trust the rating system at all. And as long as it was going to be R, the director should have gone all out and made it even more adult.Originality could be seen as a bit troublesome here. You could say this movie borrowed from many Scifi movies (Replicates in Bladerunner, HAL in 2001 Space Odyssey). But the story here is different and has a more claustrophobic feel to it. I applaud their use of ideas from other scripts. If it works then why not? My only gripe is they didn't expand on the character GERTY to show that it wasn't HAL in disguise.Overall, I have to give this movie a 8/10. Perhaps it isn't perfect but it was well worth the time and money. I am going to have to watch the Indy house near me for other cool Scifi movies. This one wasn't advertised at all and I almost missed it. Do go and see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is a surprise for the Summer of 2009 which has already included a 3D Ice Age, a second Transformers and pretty much a never-ending series of underwhelming, boring movies. Bearing more similarity to the bigger, gaudier Star Trek, Moon is the rare movie that makes you think. Unfortunately, you will find yourself, occasionally, outsmarting the filmmakers and their choices. But man oh man, does this movie ever have about 80% pure cinematic and narrative genius. Though the trailer spoils many of the film's surprises, you'll still find yourself, hopefully, sitting in a theater watching this tightly crafted, contained yet unclaustrophobic thriller to the satisfyingly upbeat ending.But it's main missteps, in my humble opine, were it's confused half-step toward gritty realism AND white-washed futurism. The moonbase of the film is both believably grungy but unnecessarily futuristicky, like the set-designer really battled for some whammo props and sets while the director fought to dress everything down a notch. If you come looking for an Alien-esquire truly working-class worksite, you're half there. Unfortunately, many of the architectural embellishments in the base are also inspired by the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars. So the result is a bit muddled.Secondly, the trailer is a bit of a tease in that it promises a smarter, more psychologically compelling story than it can deliver. I wanted more isolation, agony and dread - what I got was a too-neat reveal of the conspiracy of Sam Rockwell's bosses, but then the movie pulled back again, like it didn't want to give away too much (even though it already had.) Again, it felt like somebody (the writer or director or somebody) didn't want to make a choice and left the film feeling a bit muddled.But that brings me to the film's saving grace. Sam Rockwell. He MUST WIN the Oscar this year for this is a truly mesmerizing feat of acting. All these criticisms, these problems I have with the film, they can only be considered after watching because I was completely on-board due to Sam's total commitment to the characters (eeh, spoiler!) he created. How any Oscar voter could miss this as the best performance of the year (so far) is beyond me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Think Therefore I Am</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the interest of full disclosure I posted this comment on the movie as a message on a general posting thread, and being somewhat lazy I did not want to make-up and entirely new one for this section of IMDb. So here it goes...At one point Sam Rockwell's character observes that "we are people not a programme" (I am paraphrasing here)...and this single truth defines the substance and essence of "Moon".This was the first sci-fi movie in a few years outside the Star Wars or Star Trek universes. The last movie I saw in theaters was Danny Boyle's "Sunshine". That was a fine film, but in its last act it kind of descended in pure weirdness and not in a good way, just an all-over-the-place mumbled and non-cohesive ending, for the sake of weirdness. It is too bad because the movie started promising enough.Over the past couple of years we saw a few of these movies trying to fit into the more purist take on science fiction and eschew the sci-fi space opera genre. We had some unsuccessful attempts like "Mission To Mars" and "The Red Planet" and some which I quite like, I'm thinking of the excellent but highly underrated "Solaris" by Stephen Sodebergh and James Cameron which I truly enjoyed and liked, and consider better than Tarkovsky's version. As I read Stanislaw Lem's novel, I found Sodebergh's version to be much closer to the vision and essence of Lem's work...Now we get "Moon", and yes it is quite a good movie, although its limited release will ensure very few people will get to see it and enjoy it. On line downloads as well as a DVD release should see that situation at least somewhat redressed. It deals with some interesting and provocative themes and ideas and its take on the subject matter is quite well and effectively presented in a great and solid but understated manner.Yes the comparison to both "Solaris", and "2001: A Space Odyssey" is warranted as the movie does borrow certain elements and ideas from those previous movies. But I still found it really interesting and worthy of at least one viewing.Sam Rockwell is really good in his role and I surely hope that an Oscar nomination is in the cards for him. I have not rated it as high as the average here on IMDb, but I can say with confidence that this is one of the best movies I have seen so far this year. As usual it will get drowned by the summer blockbuster cavalcade and the mindlessness of its much bigger and I daresay stupider cousins like "Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen" and "Terminator Salvation". It is curious that this movie was released during the summer, I would have thought that a fall release would have been more appropriate for such a movie, since that is traditionally the period when award contenders are released. This year those are so far and few between.I hope more people see this film and give it a chance and not shut it down because they see it through the Kubkick or Tarkovsky/Sodebergh lens. It might make you think a bit and teach something at the same time, and these days that is indeed priceless!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific 'throwback' to the more thoughtful sci fi of the '70s and early '80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tough to find "Moon" in a theater, but if you are a fan of '70s sci-fi films such as "Silent Running" "Solaris" "Alien" etc then it'll be worth the hunt. I, for one, LOVE those kinds of more thoughtful, meditative sci-fi films that are driven by character and the human condition as much as plot mechanics. This is a delightful return to that era (with a healthy dose of Peter Hyam's early '80s efforts such as "Outland" and "2010" thrown in for good measure). The plot is very much a Philip K Dick-style of story; a real mind frak. In the near future, helium 3 has become the world's largest renewable energy source and abundant quantities of the resource are located on the moon. A mining corporation sets up a one-man lunar base (run largely by automation) that regularly ships the stuff directly to earth. Sam Rockwell is Sam Bell, the singular miner on the base who, against the judgment of the station's computer Gertie (reminiscent of 2001's "HAL-9000" and voiced ambiguously by Kevin Spacey) retrieves a nearly-dead version of himself in a crashed mining vehicle outside the habitat. Complications ensue when the truth about his doppelganger threatens to unravel Sam's tenuous grip on reality. Rockwell is incredible as he invests each "Sam Bell" with such different attributes, you'll feel you are genuinely watching TWO actors in different roles. Some may be off-put by the film's seemingly languid pace, but this is deliberate; to feel Sam's anxiety, isolation and loss of self. Also of note, the director is Duncan Jones; the son of David Bowie (singer/performer of both 'Ziggy Stardust' AND 'Major Tom'; VERY appropriate lineage, I must say). If you miss the 'good old days' of "Outland" "Silent Running" and the like, you'll feel you've come home (which is another theme of the film as well; the urge to go home....as Sam discovers home is where you FEEL, not necessarily where you were born). The film also reminded me of how important establishing mood used to be in science fiction. You could wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray release if you can't find a theater playing it, but that would be a bit of a shame; a lot of the exquisite miniature work (yes; healthy use of miniatures AND CGI) would be somewhat diminished on a smaller screen, as well as the enveloping 'coldness' that a large, darkened theater adds to the lunar landscape. "Moon" is a challenging, old-fashioned, thoughtful science fiction film (much like another recent throwback; the equally impressive "Gattaca" from 1997) made on a micro budget of just $5 million (Jim Carrey's on-set Starbucks' tab would be higher than that) and it really delivers the goods. Puts many of the $200 million toy commercials that pass for science fiction films these days to shame!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best Science Fiction movie I have seen in a long time. It has bits and pieces of Alien, 2001 and a couple of other science fiction movies. The acting was superb, the plot tight and the premise very realistic. The most unrealistic part of the movie was the robot. By the time we do put a station on the moon, we would not stick a robot that looked like a mobile compactor. If it was a straight man we put on the moon, the android would be female and have all the moves and parts that the dude would need. Or to save some money they would just stick a gay dude up there and build an android with male parts. Which would be the less expensive option probably. Actually I think they would not stick just one person up there, it would just be too boring and all that isolation is a recipe for disaster.But besides that little quibble, this movie has made my top fifteen science fiction movies of all time...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Sci-Fi Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone that is tired of all the shamelessly hyped,un-realistic sci-fi mumbo jumbo that is offered today 'Moon' is definitely the right film. In the great tradition of '2001' everything in 'Moon' is based on science fact and is plausible, unlike most of the silliness that passes itself off as science these days.Let's face it. most present sci-fi fare is not even believable let alone science. Stephen Hawking and Ray Bradbury both criticized current sci-fi for having too much fantasy and not enough actual science in it. Most sci-fi films are usually just a lot of unbelievable fantasy gobblygook that has very little to do with real science speculation. 'Moon' is first rate intelligent sci-fi that won't turn your brains to mush like so much of the stuff out there today.Sci-fi should be realistic. leave the over-wrought fantasy stuff to the kiddies. It was terrible the way the sci-fi channel took an intelligent,believable sci-fi classic book and film like the 'Andromeda Strain' and turned into silly half-baked fantasy.Everything about 'Moon' is outstanding. The realness, the special effects and the incredible Sam Rockwell giving yet another amazing performance. This should be the buzz film of the year, this should be the film everyone wants to see and is talking about, not the over-budget sci-fi junk that everyone is into.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Rockwell, in a tour de force performance, stars as an astronaut, preparing to go home after spending three years on the dark side of the moon, working on the base, harvesting sun-bathed rock, shipping the material home to Earth as an energy-efficient resource. After an incident involving a rover crash, Sam Bell(Rockwell)discovers that he has a clone(..the clone found him unconscious in the rover)and the two of them uncover startling truths about what happens to them after their three-year mission is over. Starring in dual performances, able to successfully craft two completely different, distinctive characters despite their being clones from the same person, Sam Bell, Rockwell deserves all the credit in the world, somehow pulling off the incredibly difficult task of carrying a movie almost entirely by himself. Accompanying such a sterling accomplishment are the visual/special effects, sets, models, computer graphics, all shot in Shepperton Studios, stellar, fantastic work from all involved. The score perfectly relates the situation both Sam Bells face, their mood and environment presented to us in a sombre, depressing way. Kevin Spacey is the voice of Gerty, a robotic machine(..with a smiley face)who sees to Sam Bell's every need, both physically..and emotionally. Spacey's voice is soft and articulate, gentle and warm, and it's this tone that Sam Bell needs in order to remain suitably sane and controlled. The film's primary aspect of suspense is the eventual arrival of three astronauts from the Lunar Incorporated, sent to kill the Sam Bell clones for having discovered each other. Throughout the remainder of the film, it is often reminded to Sam Bell(s)..and us..that they are due to arrive at so-and-so hours. Moon has a very definitive message about human cloning and how those created are people, with souls, feelings, and a desire to live. Like Sam Bell(s), we ourselves go on a journey of discovery, and understand why they covet life and human contact, how isolation breeds desperation and longing for home. A key development is the older clone Sam's deteriorating health condition, coughing up blood among other things. If you love the NASA white art direction, then Moon is certain to make you salivate, it did me. The comparisons to 2001 are bound to surface.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie with basically one set, and one main actor with the voice of Kevin Spacey as a computer that will remind anyone that saw 2001 a Space Odyssey of a sane version of HAL. The moon is now used to harvest Helium 3, it's mainly automated, with one man overseeing the operation with the assistance of the base computer/robot. Themes you will notice borrowed come from Outland, Blade Runner, 2001, but they manage to put a spin on the plot that is unique and that keeps it interesting.This is a psychological drama, it is not an action movie, it is not a date movie, this is the sort of movie you probably will get the most out of if you watch it in the dark by yourself without interruptions. The mood needs to build in order to get the full effect of the script. Suffice it to say that all is not what it seems on base, and our main character starts to feel a bit stranded on the moon, wondering what will become of him. He gets help from the most unexpected of places, but is it too late? You can't really describe this movie without giving away essential plot elements that are better left discovered by the viewer by watching it... which is what you should do, this is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget the sci-fi aspect, this movie is a just does a great concept of bizarre reality. All told in a very neat and tidy storyline, it flows well. Without giving too much away, it really portrays a sense of isolation and of how important memories shape our feelings.The movie wasn't adapted from a book, but actual science concepts about moon mining and clean energy researched by Duncan Jones and developed into a storyline by both he and Nathan Parker. The fact that it is done in a style of 70s science fiction deliberately avoiding CGI gives it unique style in this day and age. An independent production filmed on a small budget, Sam Rockwell, as Sam Bell the moon engineer, carries the film all the way through as he slowly learns his fate or fates, with GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) as a companion, a computer that controls the station.I was going to give this movie a 9/10 because I wanted to be mean. Maybe they overdone the 70s sci-fi genre, or maybe the scale of production for a sci-fi was too small, but who cares, the film is overpowering... and refreshing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Renews the audiences' belief that GOOD sci-fi films are still alive...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sci-fi is alive...and kicking! Watching Duncan Jones' surprisingly good sci-fi film "Moon", I can now confirm that Hollywood can still produce a profound and moving sci-fi story, and that it takes the work of a true creative crew to produce it. In an era where sci-fi films are an excuse to attack audiences with a long and uninvolving demonstration of special effects, Jones attempts to revive the genre and add an involving story and well-developed characters to it, proving that special effects aren't everything, and that the old days of "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Solaris" still have an effect. Like a famous critic said, truly good sci-fi films aren't dead, they're just hiding."Moon" introduces us to a near future, where humans have found an important source of energy called Helium-3, which comes from the moon and is trapped in lunar rocks; these rocks can be shipped to Earth and can be harvested to release a potent and natural power source which helps over 70% of the planet in an ecologically-benefit way. On the moon, there's a space station that controls the machines' harvesting of Helium-3 rocks, and this space station is manned by a single man called Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell, in a surprisingly effective performance). Sam is completely alone in the station, and he supervises the harvesting and the well-being of the station, fixing the problems which seldom take place, making sure it all goes according to plan and sending periodical reports to Lunar Industries on Earth, updating them on the situation on the moon. The only company Sam has are the casual recorded messages he receives from Earth, and the ever-present Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey), the station's computer, a sort of Hal 2000.Sam is incredibly lonely, of course. He's spent three years living by himself at the moon station, talking to computers. The film is effective and troubling at showing us the critical mental state of this man, who's practically isolated from human contact, and who confirms, day by day, the meaninglessness of his personality; he's desensitized and goes about his daily routine monotonously, sadly, the wear being most apparent in his face. There's a moment early in the film where we see him get a recorded message from his wife and his young daughter; the amount of emotion and heart-break in this scene is the work of a genius, and we just KNOW that this is more than just a sci-fi story, but a true exploration into human emotion.On one of his outings supervising the harvesting machines, Sam sees something strange against the luminosity of the sun's rays, and he crashes his lunar vehicle against the harvesting machine. He loses consciousness, and then he wakes up in the recovery room at the space station...but here's where the story takes a weird and disturbing twist: how did he get to the recovery room from the place of the accident? Why is he suddenly feeling so strange? And why does he get the sensation that he's NOT alone in this space station? That's all I can say without disclosing any spoilers. Suffice it to say that from the moment he awakes at the recovery room, the film takes a steep and disturbing dive into tension, and challenges Sam's sanity to an unspeakable degree. The suspense of the plot mixes with Sam's uncertainty and the terrible toll it's taking on his mind to deliver a veritable tour-de-force to the viewer. Duncan Jones (who, by the way, is David Bowie's son) makes an excellent directorial debut in this film which challenges conventional storytelling and feels as fresh and as intriguing as anything you've seen before.The story is involving (I mean it), and it doesn't rely on your typical plot twists to gain its tension. It delivers the facts straight to the viewer, hiding nothing, but in the truth it conveys it forces upon our minds countless questions that we just can't wait to have answered. Rockwell is simply fantastic in his portrayal, and it is his performance, more than anything, which drives our attention. Spacey, with his coldly sweet voice, gives Gerty an ominous presence which we can't overlook, and we sympathize with the ship's computer and fear it at the same time. More than a sci-fi story, this is an exploration into the characters' mind, which poses questions dealing with the importance of human relations, human importance and the meaning of life.The only conceivable downfall of the film is the fact that it deals with such deep and intriguing topics, but after a moment in the film, it ceases to probe deeper and focuses on the plot instead. This is good, don't get me wrong, but it could have been done better. Nevertheless, as Jones' directorial debut, I believe he has fared much, much better than other débutant directors.The cinematography is very good, giving us wide-range shots which absorb the nothingness and the solitary expanse of the space station, forcing the feeling of loneliness and claustrophobia on the viewer; Clint Mansell's score is muted but effective, and this is good because it doesn't force itself on the viewer or the story, but it crawls beneath Sam's character, to a point where it becomes one with his personality. The editing is at a bit of a flaw, though; it tries to enhance the emotion by focusing too much on certain objects, but it fails at times (for example, there are way too many focuses of an animated smiley which appears on Gerty's screen, and this doesn't even come close to the tension we experienced by, say, the lingering shots of Hal 2000's red eye in "2001").Still, the small flaws the film might carry don't overshadow the overall power and depth it conveys. It's truly satisfactory, and like I said before, it renews our faith in the existence of GOOD sci-fi films. I thoroughly recommend it! Rating: 3 stars out of 4!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised with this movie! The story is interesting, acting is solid, plot is convincing and character development is very intriguing (old, tired clone meeting the new, enthusiastic one with conflicts arising between them before they gradually realize they have both been misled). Even GERTY (the robot-supervisor) has some positive character development - a fresh move from clichéd, evil computers which have plagued sci-fi movies since HAL 9000.I would have given it 9, maybe even 10, but the ending was rather inferior compared to the rest of the movie. I mean, launching a human being, from Moon to Earth, in a simple canister delivery vessel, without any life support?! How are we supposed to believe he arrived to Earth alive? Check Apollo 13 to see how difficult is to bring a human from Moon's orbit to the Earth, even in a fully equipped (but malfunctioning) spaceship. And even if he actually survived the trip, would Lunar Industries let him live to see the trial? It's obvious from the story that the Lunar Industries is a totally unethical company and Sam must have arrived to their facilities on Earth (precious helium-3 wouldn't be delivered elsewhere, I suppose). Would they rescue him and let him live to testify against them and ruin their highly profitable helium-3 business? I don't think so.If I was writing the screenplay, Sam Bell would have escaped with a moon-rover and managed to reach (or at least contact) other humans on the Moon, perhaps a small colony or a research outpost (NOT operated by Lunar Industries). They would have rescued him and sent him to Earth in a proper spaceship. The movie would be then maybe 10 minutes longer and the production a little more expensive (depicting the colony, more actors included etc), but the ending would be much more convincing. It wouldn't cast a shadow over an otherwise highly recommended movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can see Kubrick's Space Odyssey influence all over this movie, it is certainly a piece of art in line with Kubrick's visual symphonies and deep, thought provoking messages. It may be a low budget but they used every cent wisely and delivered accurately.The movie starts off slow but you will feel the cerebral momentum building up, you'll find yourself up against one question after another from the get-go and although you might guess the right answers but you won't be sure or have time when the questions seem to build up one after the other. The subjects it tackles in answering the questions are certainly worth the thought. Sam Rockwell rocks in this one! He brings the serious, the humane and the humorous all at the same time.All this is delivered in the tidy, near perfect, frames and sharp visuals and the theme score is brilliant! It gives you the sensation of the movie, light-hearted yet deep...and did i say thought provoking?Any movie that leaves you sitting there while the final credits roll, just thinking and reflecting on what happened and what it criticized ...is a movie worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Space Odyssey meets The Truman Show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the best I have seen in a very long time and you don't have to be a fan of Sci-Fi to appreciate it's depth and quality. It had me hooked right from the get-go. A lot has to be said for Sam Rockwell's one man show. He more than deserves an Oscar nomination for this performance. There's no point going into great detail about the plot - just watch it for yourself. It is such a captivating and interesting film to watch and see how things unfold and it definitely succeeds in playing with your emotions. It stimulated every one of my emotions from humour to sadness and fear. This must be seen in Blu-Ray to fully appreciate the films visuals and compliment the top-notch acting and direction. I'm always very critical of films but this is getting 10 stars from me because it's just utterly fantastic and it's such a relief and a breath of fresh air to see that people can still make good movies these days.Just watch it and enjoy it. I guarantee you will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Science-Fiction films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can definitely say that Moon is the film that resembles 2001: A Space Odyssey the most. Since I saw 2001 around two years ago, I have declared it the best film ever made. While I doubt any film will ever take that spot, no other film made me feel the way 2001 did besides Moon.Moon's plot revolves around one astronaut, Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell), who works in Lunar Industries and is waiting until the day he sees his family again. However, after a hallucination causes serious implications, his whole plan changes. I do not want to give more away, because I think the less you know about the film before you see it the better. Moon has a solitary and somber tone to it, one that haunted me and amazed me. This is Duncan Jones' first project, and he proved he is a director to watch. The beautiful look of the moon and the cinematography were captivating. The colors supported the film's tone, and as did the great music score by Clint Mansell. While it is true this film owes a lot to other films, particularly 2001, it stands on it's own. Whereas 2001 was more about human evolution and technology, Moon is about the loneliness and despair of one man. It is a much more character-driven film than 2001. Sam Rockwell is brilliant. He plays his character with different depths and feelings, and I thought he was the perfect choice. Kevn Spacey voiced GERTY (the similar character to HALL 2000) with the perfect amount of emotion, or sometimes lack of emotion. The film was unpredictable, and as it went along you realize more and more about what the industries are about, and learn more about Sam Bell.Moon was a compelling debut from Jones, and I found it hard to believe that the budget was just $5 Million. Definitely one of my favorite sci-fi films, and probably the decade's best, along with Donnie Darko (if you can call that sci-fi). A beautiful and exhilarating film, the best yet of 2009.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare Jewel in modern Sci-Fi drama. One of the best film of the decade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen the last decade. I can't help but feel that the movies in the genre hasn't been to good this decade. Honestly there has been so few good Sci-Fi films lately I have only been able to enjoy the classics. But "Moon" proves that the genre isn't dead at all. This movie will definitely be considered a Sci-Fi classic in the future and won't be forgotten.Also this movie had a very low budget, but it doesn't show at all. Also you'll eventually realize there are very few actor in it. Which also makes the movie impressive if you think about it. i was also very impressed when I realized that this movie has very little CGI. All the scenes with the moon base or the lunar rovers, are in fact models. It's great to see the good old ways in a modern film. it also proves that models can be better than CGI if handled properly.And of course Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey as Gerdy is just amazing. And what a great start for Duncan Jones who apparently is new in the director business.I won't spoil the story, the IMDb synopsis speak for itself. But honestly don't read it, just watch the movie, its great.This is among the best movies of the decade, it has a classic feel to it, and is still modern. I can't think of anything to give this movie but a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moon - The Film Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into 'Moon' not knowing a single thing about what I was going to see, other than that it was about a man who lives by himself on the moon. If you think you might watch a film like that, you may want to stop reading now ? I reckon it was much better for being unspoiled. But then, what film isn't? It's a free country, so you can do what you like. Read on...I'll keep the spoilers mild, and you might get one or two laughs.For 'proper' film fans, 'Moon' is a real feast. It looks great, and the atmosphere (no pun intended) is bang on. It's deep, serious science fiction; sci-fi for the mind, sci-fi that's more about the human condition than cool space ships shooting at things. At first, it put me in mind of 2001, but that wore off, and there's no real connection. He does talk to the computer, and that's something I wanted to discuss... for some reason, overly nice robots always creep me out. Even 'Furby' used to give me chills, and so did 'Gerty', the robot here, at first, with his slightly-too-wide smiley face, and other creepily innocent expressions. (He even cries at one point, which did make me feel a little strange.) But amazingly, by the end of the film, I had got over my robot prejudice, and actually started to like him.Besides Gerty, the majority of the film was a one-man show, with Sam Rockwell putting in a meteoric (no pun intended) performance. And here come the spoilers...the film is about clones. The first Sam gets injured when fooling about in a lunar rover, and when he returns to the base, it has simply grown a new Sam to replace him. At this point, Sam (the actor) goes from being in every scene of the movie ? itself a huge challenge ? to being in every scene of the movie twice. Towards the end, he even appears a third time. He has such a difficult job here, playing all the characters, with no chance to react to the opposing performance... it's an actor's dream and nightmare, rolled into one.But it really does work, and in retrospect that's a surprise ? and a huge achievement. All the interactions with himself were totally believable; I'd quite like to see Rockwell win the Oscar for 'best actor,' and 'best supporting actor.' The opening credits told me Kevin Spacey (no pun intended) was in it too, and I spent the entire film trying to spot him...only to find out later that he was the voice of the computer.It's quite a serious film, but did get some laughs from my 20-strong Scarborough audience, not least when during the 'turn off your phone' message someone's phone rang, and the man answered it by saying 'I can't talk now, I'm in the cinema! I'm watching 'Moon!'" Sam's choice of alarm clock song got a chuckle first time round, and a bigger one the second time, with its already ironic meaning turned around in deliciously amusing fashion. There was also a scene straight out of something like 'High Fidelity', where original Sam is listening to 'Walkin' On Sunshine', and second Sam keeps turning it off, only to be ignored and have it resumed immediately. This did feel a little out of place in a serious sci-fi flick, though it did prove you don't need two people for a double act.This is not going to be a five-star review, so I'd better get to the downside. I don't know if I was just having a stupid day, but I spent a good fifteen minutes feeling extremely confused. This was brought on by how casually the reveal of the clone is dealt with ? when they first meet, original Sam just asks the other: 'hey...how's it going?' I didn't know if they thought clones were normal, or if one them actually was a different person who just looked similar. For a while I even thought the ominous 'countdown to rescue' that runs through two-thirds of the movie was actually a herald of something good happening. To be honest, I thought Kevin Spacey was going to turn up in a rescue ship, saving both of the Sams. I was wrong.And, there's some weird apparitions early on, of what I think was a dark-haired woman, which weren't explained or even mentioned afterwards. Big spoiler alert now - It may have been his daughter, or the ghost of his wife, trying to stop the cloning madness, but I'm not really sure the supernatural was ever a theme. Maybe it was just to show us he was going a bit mad.The ending was very different, an interesting technique where two months of story are mumbled to the audience in about five seconds. I only barely realised it was important to listen ? though in fairness, the ending does fit in perfectly with what preceded it, and wasn't disappointing or predictable. I looked up what was said, and actually it was a satisfying conclusion.The biggest laughs of all came when me and companions retired to the pub afterwards. The first song playing was 'Rocket Man' ('I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife'), immediately followed by '...ground control to Major Tom.' We asked the landlord if this was planned ? if the pun was intended ? but apparently it wasn't. I don't think he even knew Scarborough had a cinema. Anyway, this time I highly recommend a viewing of the film in question, and am proud to award it a lunariffic four out of five.</fullReview>

Like an epic tone poem of the classic "TWILIGHT ZONE" but with some more prickly underpinnings (i.e. playing God) are at the epicenter of this intriguing and very cool sci-fi flick that echoes of "2001" (thanks largely to the robotic computer system, GERTY, an emoticon sporting co-hort ? voiced with sonorous calm by Kevin Spacey ? a kissing cousin of HAL) yet stands alone as a singular tale told with style and grace by rookie filmmaker Duncan Jones (nee Zowie Bowie, yes, son of "Major Tom" himself, David Bowie).

Sam Rockwell's performance was 100% or shall I say 200%? What a talent he is, very believable, he made me care about the character he was portraying, and he moved me deeply. The story was very good and brought up a few troubling issues, no, not nightmarish stuff, but just things that we as society should really think about before going forward, 'just because it can be done doesn't mean we should do it'.. and I think this film will have added to the discussion just like GATTACA and others like it.I am glad I saw this film, it was an enriching experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark side of the Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is an engrossing intelligent small film that repays a bit of knowledge of its genre. Referening a host of the 70s cult sci-fi films (Dark Star, Silent Running, Solaris, Outlands, Alien, Blade Runner, 2001 etc.) we are given what appears to be a man and his robot minding a corporate lunar mining venture.With a Clint Mansell soundtrack, (which I'm listening to on Spotify), this film sounds great. Unfortunately it sometimes looks a little sub par because, well, the limited budget. You will wince a little at the use of miniatures for the outside moon shots. But stay with.Sci-fi has always been used to explore social politics, and this film touches on various borderline issues but in a fairly close, emotional and involving way. Which is why maybe Silent Running is its true parent.In order to deliver the homage, we do get the old pat and outdated clichés; corporates are all bad, computers can understand humans, unnecessary countdowns etc. This doesn't stop the enjoyment, but makes me appreciate the recent well financed TV series sci-fi for taking the time to push the envelope a bit. I hope the producers trust the makers with a touch more cash to really make something a bit bigger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humanistic space odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's nice to have some decently crafted science fiction still being made. The increased availability of CGI and digital effects for even low-budget productions along with its better quality has finally reached the level where we can do something important with it: focus on the human.Moon is a movie about an astronaut on a three-year solo job in space. He is harvesting moon rocks for energy (something explained concisely at the beginning), and staves off boredom by exercising, growing plants, building a model of his home town, and talking to his wife via belated signals. As he nears the end of his term, he begins to hallucinate and gets into an accident. When he wakes up, he finds himself. Literally, as in he finds himself still crashed in the accident and saves himself from a cold lonely death. The problem is, now there's two of him, a crashed harvester unit, and a robot who seems not the least bit logically put off by his doppelganger presence.Sam Rockwell gets to do the Dead Ringers duty here and play off himself, which is fun, and also brings a strong sense of dynamic to what was almost a movie about a single guy alone in space. Duncan Jones does a good job directing his first feature film, and on a tight budget creates a realistic lunar landscape that you'll see no flaw in. Kevin Spacey is perfect for the voice of GERTY 3000, a kinder, gentler, and more humanistic HAL 3000 with a smiley face instead of a big red eye. Music by Clint Mansell will be playing in your ears long after you leave the theatre.All around, a quiet science fiction hit. It could have done without the newsfeed ending that turned a rather flat political message onto a perfectly hopeful and open ending. GERTY's personality or programming was a little too deus ex machina, but on the other hand was a refreshing change from the general technophobic cliché of most robots straining to follow orders at the expense of the sanity or lives of their cares. The rest is all nitpicking.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Gripping from the starting."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This in no way looks to be a debut film of the director. The amount of professionalism displayed in the film is highly praising. The story is set entirely on the moon. It tells you a story of a time when humans are using the resources present on the moon. The station for harvesting the resources on moon is highly equipped and is self-operating. However there is need of just one man. Sam is stuck there. Although there are an abundant number of things for him to do, among which he finds joy in going out of the station on the moon. He is missing human touch for most of his time. The story seems to be little confusing in the starting but when the film is nearing finish, you will adore the story. The film is not to be missed.PROS:You have an astonishing performance by Sam as Sam in the film. The beautiful part of the film is that it relies entirely on art direction, acting by just the one person, and the cinematography. What makes it respectable to me is the use of minimum resources. At some times it will give you the feeling of Home Sickness. The guy is stuck at the place without the contact with humans for 3 years. There is a moment when in the view we have the blue planet (Earth.). And we hear the cry of the character, where he just wants to go home. That feeling was too intensified by the way earth was shown to us with a slow zoom. How the world crumbles around you when you find out that your whole life is a lie. The feeling when you find out that your existence doesn't matter. That unbelievable truth is an integral part of your life. These are some of the ideas explored nicely in the film. The ending is full of twists. It is a science fiction film presented with such awesomeness that you rarely get out of that atmosphere.MESSAGE: "Learn to live with some unbelievable truths."VERDICT: "Most recommended."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now don't get me wrong... Moon is a good movie, but I think the 9 and 10 scores from many of my fellow reviewers are a bit over-the-top. Having said that, I enjoyed watching the movie, but I don't have any desire to see it again.The message of space loneliness and the cold, somewhat soulless void that we call space, is well delivered in what is generally a cold and soulless movie. It's like watching and endless scene shot in a pristine hospital operating theater. Stark and clinical. But I guess spacecraft and space itself is very much like that.I have no gripe with the acting or the set design, nor with the (not totally believable) lunar surface shots and machines. The all-knowing, slightly sinister on-board computer was also fine. But as I watched, I couldn't help thinking that the director was trying too hard to make a masterpiece and a modern-day 2001 space puzzle. The plot certainly gives food for thought, but the answers to the questions are weak and spoil the intellectual chase. Imagine if Mr. Kubrick had explained everything; would his movie still have been a masterpiece? Moon is entertaining and original. For sure it is worth watching. But is it "One of the best sci-fi movies ever"? Maybe, but only just.</fullReview>

Scenes of Earth hanging on horizon, or the vehicles crawling around the zoom, are as well-done as any similar shots since Alien. Acting was quite solid, differential characters and character traits being well delineated and separated.

		<shortDescription>A good solid pulp science fiction film but I don't think its the next great all time classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Duncan Jones, who is the son of David Bowie, this film has been hailed as the next coming of the great SCIFI God. Its been compared and any number of classic films. Much as been made of the fact that the film feels awfully familiar, it borrowing bits of other films looks for its look. I think its familiar because it a place I've been before.The plot has astronaut Sam Rockwell coming to the end of his three year term as the only man on an automated mining base on the far side of the moon. His only companion is Gerty, the computer, voiced by Kevin Spacey.. He dreams of his wife and just wants to get home so that he can see his young daughter. However the isolation is getting to to him and when he wakes up after an accident things have become different.I could tell you more but thats as far as most people writing on the film have taken it, so I will bow to their line in the sand and leave it there (though many who insist that the less you know is better reveal "too much" by comparing it to a certain now classic film from the early 1980's). They seem to think that what happens after that point is some huge revelation. I don't think so I think what happens, while perfectly in keeping with the story isn't as important as what that sets in motion.I really like this film. Its a good solid pulp science fiction film about a man alone in space. I do not think this is the next "great" science fiction film. I don't think its revelations are mind blowing. I think its a well thought out film with a great deal to say about man and mankind. I really wish that people would stop placing this film on a pedestal, because it doesn't belong there for the reasons that they are claiming. The film may, some day earn a place on a high but for right now, its the idle chatter of people who really haven't seen too many science fiction films, or if not they aren't versed in the golden age of pulp scifi stories that bled over into the golden days of radio and the early days of television. I kept waiting for the film to hit me with some grand revelation, but it never came. In all honesty it wasn't until the accident and the film got down to doing what it does that I stopped waiting for something the film wasn't and took it for what it is.Don't get me wrong. This is a really good little film, its just not the next big thing.There is much to like about the film. Sam Rockwell is very good in a role that is nicely restrained and not out in left field. Its one several recent performances that have me warming to him and his style. The look of the film, borrowed from films like 2001, Space 1999, Solaris, Outland and others has a nice lived in feel. I love Kevin Spacey's Gerty. I'm going to kind of give a spoiler here and say I like his performance as a sort of anti-Hal 9000. There are moments where he will move you. The plot, when stripped of the hype is actually quite good and it raises all sorts of interesting questions (Which I won't get into since they might reveal late in the game plot points). And while the film does have a couple of plot bumps, nothing is major and the film hangs nicely together.Recommended for anyone wanting a good science fiction yarn. Let the hype go and just go and enjoy it. (Frankly comparing it to things like 2001, Solaris and other great head films is a major mistake since it shrinks your audience who won't go thinking its one thing-as I did- when in fact its something else.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cloning glimpses of sci-fi classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to William Eubank's 2011 "Love", a sort of mega-clip "inspired" by Kubrick, Malick (and Aronofsky ?), Duncan Jones' 2009 "Moon" is clearly a better movie. It is also clearly more "about something" - not necessarily meaning this "something" is anything special or new. To quote James Berardinelli, " 'Moon' illustrates a truism forgotten by Hollywood : the best science fiction films are about SOMETHING. This film does not feature explosions(...), endless mind-numbing chase sequences. Instead, it (...) respects the intelligence and attention span of the adult. (...) It is intelligent, thought-provoking material." I quite agree with Mr. B., but his rating surprises me. To give a movie 3,5 stars out of 4 just for being "about something", respecting the intelligence of the adult and recycling "thought-provoking material" ? After all, I think there's more action in "Moon" than necessary, even including a couple of minor "explosions". It IS an action picture veiling itself in a "thought-provoking" toga - a patchwork in fact, not so far from Hollywood : here "2001" again, there "Solaris", next to it "Silent Running" (with a glimpse of "The Prestige", maybe ?). Ideas or images from these and others were cloned and skilfully put together (with addition of one talented actor in a sometimes - unintentionally, I suppose - caricaturing double-role) into a little sci-fi thriller, partly effective, but more manipulative than emotionally powerful, and in the predictable second half with cogs creaking in the screen writing department.It has been two days before watching "Moon" that I finished reading "The Invisible Pyramid" by the great Loren Eiseley. There's no actual astronaut (anti)hero in this book, and yet it tells so much more about us conquering Moons.... It costs the reader more than 97 minutes to get from beginning to end - but it's worth the effort !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts out pretty good. The moon setting and the idea of isolation from the rest of humanity is a tried and tested plot. However the movie became extremely predictable right after the rover crash and the clone was shown for the first time. The one thing going for this movie was that it was not regurgitation of the 2001 space odyssey man vs machine. But even the aspect of a helpful computer (Gerdy). Gerdy in the beginning won't answer Sam's questions and then about half way through he 'decides' that he will tell Sam the whole conspiracy that the lunar company is trying to pull off. All and all, this movie was boring, predictable, and fits right in with Hollywood's sup par film making that has regrettably become the norm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One lonely film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to disagree with the high ratings for this film.The story, as it has it, is quite far out when it comes to logic. There is no lunar gravity inside the station, and the implausibility of this base being staffed by 1 person, who discovers that there are a whole bunch of clones with his DNA being stored and readied for action, and eventually the eventuality that he is not the original.There is quite an emotional touch in the film, however, one which the core of the film revolves around, involving the family of the central protagonist that leaves his family and finds himself removed from having live contact to his daughter and his wife, only to discover he was unable to message them directly. A heart moving sequence reveals what has actually happened in the duration that this clone of Sam has missed while been away, which is touching and eerily depressing.I found myself wanting to stop the film due to the sense of loneliness prevalent in it and sterile 'HAL' (from Space Oddysey) interactions, but found that I wanted to play it through to the logical conclusion to reveal what actually happened, and to see the protagonist reunited with his daughter, and righteousness restored. None of this is covered, however, and you're left with a blank with only a few lines of text to explain the story of this clone that would have occurred on his return. So the situation is never resolved, and thinking about this draws a bit of a mental blank. In essence, the film leaves you feeling that this barbaric act of cloning a single miner on the moon is something that would still be continuing, without anybody on earth raising some sort of alarm about the situation, and thus this morbid act continuing on forever. Not a happy film by any means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you, Moon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is one of the most refreshing films I have ever seen. Since it was made in 2009, it was a complete joy to see a film that respected what the science fiction genre was all about. It's not often that we get a sci-fi taking place outside of earth that doesn't rely on aliens and explosions to be considered within it's genre. It's a smart, slow building psychological thriller that puts in the effort to include mind-bending elements into its innovative storyline. Yet another thing I found refreshing is how GERTY, the artificial intelligence of the film, was presented (besides the character being played by Kevin Spacey). What impressed me is that the movie didn't call for it's viewers to be emotionally involved with the robotic character, which makes some modern movies fail. Because of all this, the film reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is way before my time. Luckily for my generation, Moon is not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually I rated 9 because Rockwell was amazing as usual and the story is so inspiring in the simplest style of Sci-fi however it is so sad to get to know the fact of the government using people in that horrible way, not caring about anything at all but finishing their project!The idea of implanting the memory as it is in each clone's head isn't that bad but the emotional part is the disaster. When he discovered that "Tes" died several years ago and his baby daughter "Eve" is 15 years old was a huge shock, they used to deceive him with the non network covered station and old video messages to retain his memory stable!The Question now is: The main Sam which the movie started with "the clone that had spent 3 years on moon and was about to get back to earth" what was his order between other clones?And when "Eve" shouted for her dad saying that some one is asking about mummy, was that the real Sam or another clone??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alone on the Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is a movie from Duncan Jones from 2009. He is the son of the great director David Bowie. Duncan also acts his role as Sam Rockwell, a lonely guy on the moon station, spoken by Kevin Spacey. Moon is a science-fiction drama. Sam has to work alone on the moon. He works on a mine every day but than he has a crash and finds out a bad secret. I really like the animations because it really looks like the movie was filmed on the moon and there are nice light effects and other things. I think Duncan Jones is a good actor and did his roll very good. The plot is OK but sometimes a kind of boring and difficult to understand because some things happen again and again. Also one time something happen and later on you understand what happened. The costumes and the design are very nice. I like the music of "Moon", it assists the tension of some scenes really good. If you like science-fiction movies and don't't need much action, I recommend you to watch this. But "Moon" hasn't the strongest plot and you have to pay attention to understand everything. I give the movie "Moon" seven out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Moon" is a compelling work of science fiction. It dives into the aspect of a psychological thriller and implements it well. It pays a tribute to classic science fiction movies by combining different elements to make one of the best movies of 2009. Sam Rockwell's great performance drives the movie even more. It starts off like a simple case of cabin fever. But astronaut Sam Bell spirals into madness due to bizarre things he experiences that make him question what's going on. As he discovers more about his surroundings, tension rises as his life becomes more critical. Throughout the whole movie, the viewer constantly thinks what else does the movie have in store for the characters? The movie is somewhat tense throughout. It has a great soundtrack that raises tension even more. The constant feeling of being alone creates a great and chilling atmosphere. It relies on its plot twists but in a different and unique way. Director Duncan Jones has made a great name for himself by this superb work of science fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An astronaut miner extracting the precious moon gas that promises to reverse the Earth's energy crisis nears the end of his three-year contract, and makes an ominous discovery in this psychological sci- fi film starring Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey. For three long years, Sam Bell has dutifully harvested Helium 3 for Lunar, a company that claims it holds the key to solving humankind's energy crisis. As Sam's contract comes to an end, the lonely astronaut looks forward to returning to his wife and daughter down on Earth, where he will retire early and attempt to make up for lost time. His work on the Selene moon base has been enlightening -- the solitude helping him to reflect on the past and overcome some serious anger issues -- but the isolation is starting to make Sam uneasy. With only two weeks to go before he begins his journey back to Earth, Sam starts feeling strange: he's having inexplicable visions, and hearing impossible sounds. Then, when a routine extraction goes horribly awry, it becomes apparent that Lunar hasn't been entirely straightforward with Sam about their plans for replacing him. The new recruit seems strangely familiar, and before Sam returns to Earth, he will grapple with the realization that the life he has created may not be entirely his own. Up there, hundreds of thousands of miles from home, it appears that Sam's contract isn't the only thing about to expire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a while since I've seen a good movie in this genre. And the Moon is that. On the first sight it is a bit constrained, minimized story. A guy, a big rock, robot, machines, that's all. But that's just about enough to develop a story that tackles fundamental questions: who we are, what make us human, what are the companies capable of doing for profit. Great performing by the lead actor. Also, having Spacey for robot's voice was a good idea. I'm very satisfied, indeed, for watching such classic after several shoot-cut-rocket shallow movies. The movie also showed what original sci-fi is: the future and technology form barely a context for revealing what we are in our essence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dramatic masterpiece, one of the greatest science fiction films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, after my third viewing of this film, I think I've finally taken in enough from this film to do a spoiler-free review of it.This review could be a lot longer if my reviews included spoilers.Moon is a fascinating film. It's one of those special science fiction films that does a lot more than "Hey! Look at all this technology we're using that doesn't exist! IN THREE HOURS!" Moon is a poignant and moving story about an astronaut on the end of a three-year stretch alone on the moon, with only an AI by the name of GERTY with him. The film is led by two fantastic performances, one being Sam Rockwell as Sam Bell, the lonely astronaut awaiting the end of his three years on the moon, and Kevin Spacey, who gives a haunting yet mechanical voice acting performance as the artificial intelligence "GERTY".The cinematography, CGI, set design and score come together to bring a indescribable feeling of isolation and dread.I would talk about what I loved about the plot and different genres put into the film, but I'm not going to spoil anything, because the "spoilers" start coming early in it.As for flaws, the only thing I can think of is maybe the plot rushes itself, similar to "Drive", which could have been avoided with a longer run-time. Anything else I had a problem with is so minor, it's not worth noting.</fullReview>

Oh, well...Sam Rockwell is an actor I can pretty much always appreciate, and that goes double, well triple, here. The premise isn't very original, but how things are worked out here, was quite satisfactory. Just that final conclusion ("either he's an illegal immigrant or crazy") felt like an overly contrived and easy reference to something social-critical on which I don't feel like dwelling.A good 7 out of 10 for a successful spacetrip.</fullReview>

I remember watching Solaris and 2001 and their ilk and the loneliness and silence of space, and I got that same eerie feeling all over when I saw Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) at the fag end of his 3-year long mining stint on the moon. Sam Bell ventures out to study a leak, and finds himself next at the sick bay in the base station. Ventures out again to the crash site, and finds himself ? or a copy of himself ? at the site ? alive. Succeeds in hatching a plan to return to earth and succeeds in bringing the diabolical plans of The Lunar Corporation to light and put an end to the trauma of clone usage in the mines of the moon, all clones that have been implanted with memories of lives back on earth that were never theirs to begin with. A science fiction movie that is convincing, touching and flawlessly executed by Sam Rockwell in two concurrent avatars, and Kevin Spacey as the voice-over for GERTY, the resident robot who faces moral choices ? and chooses right</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that it is damn hard to review this film without any spoilers, but I'll do my best. From what I gathered from the trailer, etc., I assumed that this was going to be a film about a man gradually going mad as a result of his loneliness, since in the trailer you see him finding himself and understandably going a little crazy. Surprisingly, this all has a rational explanation which is dealt with within the first 45 minutes.For me, sci-fi is always a dangerous genre, and should actually be split into 2 categories. Fantasy and drama. There are sci-fi movies like Star Wars set in distant galaxies with aliens and crazy fighting and special effects, and then there are sci-fi movies that deal with 'what if?' questions, such as films based on Philip K. Dick novels, or stuff like Flowers For Algernon. I've never cared about the first category, but I'm a real sucker for the second. This is one of those films.What's amazing about the movie is that you're really only watching one man (Sam Rockwell) for an hour and a half, but he proves that he has a brilliant range even though he's playing the same character all the way through. Inevitable parallels will be drawn to 2001, what with the monotone computer voiced by Kevin Spacey, but Moon manages to distance itself very successfully by having a computer which doesn't go crazy (I'd like to think that's not really a spoiler). When the 'twist' occurs about half way through, you really feel sucked in, imagining what it would be like to be in that position, and you remain there for the rest of the film. This film succeeds not through fancy special effects, but through the empathy you feel, and that is the mark of truly wonderful picture.I gave the film 9/10 because although I loved it, I don't feel that it's necessarily a landmark film, and it didn't leave me as drained as, say, 'Requiem For A Dream', but I will undoubtedly watch it again and again. In other words, see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Moon!! Yes, at last we have a science fiction film that isn't all about sfx and visual fireworks. This is a brainy scifi flick that will leave a lasting impression. The director of the film was very much influenced by Alien and Blade Runner,you can see it in the production design which is toweringly immense. Sam Rockwell plays the part of a man stationed on the moon for a 3 year contract. We join him in the final two weeks of his stay and witness some pretty odd goings on. Kevin Spacey voices the computer in the film which will have done wonders for the promoters but i think this is the only drawback. In films like these, you don't need stars, we don't need to be reminded of Lester Burnham or John Doe from Se7en but its a small gripe in an otherwise tremendous film that is a joy to behold from start to finish. Moon is well worth paying for.</fullReview>

GERTY is a perfect comedic relief and great support character, as it seems to be as real as you can expect it to be.

		<shortDescription>How did I miss this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've gotten a sci-fi bug recently and started re-watching older science fiction movies that I enjoyed when I was younger. The most recent of these is Silent Running, the Douglas Trumball classic that contains everything I love about futuristic space movies albeit with a rather creepy but excellent Bruce Dern. My problems with Silent Running are only about the things that date it. The Joan Baez soundtrack, the rather basic and obvious models. Even Huey, Duey etc don't really stand the test of time. This then brought me to Moon, in the hope I would find something fresh. I read a little before watching and was sceptical about what was possible on a ?5 Million budget but I persevered and actually knew very little about the story. It's one of those films that definitely works better the less you know about it. Sam Rockwell is superb throughout and the space station set design is fantastic. I loved the story although I did have some questions about the reasons why the corporation did the things that make the movie, but that didn't over shadow a great story and a very well directed piece. Basically, if you loved Silent Running, I guarantee you will love this. Also after watching, google Gavin Rothery Moon design. His blog gives incredible insight to the making of the movie, worth a visit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Astonishing in ALL Aspects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was intrigued to watch this film for a while, predominantly due to the fact that one of my favourite (and undoubtedly underrated) actors, Sam Rockwell, stars in it. Furthermore, the film is directed by Duncan Jones; who has previously impressed me with 'Source Code' and has since left me wanting to explore more of his work. Essentially, I went into this film with high expectations, and oh boy, were they exceeded.'Moon' takes place on the moon, surprisingly, and explores the isolated character of Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell) nearing the end of his three-year stint on the moon, whilst working alongside his friendly computer GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). I'm not going to give away any more details of the plot, as with all films, it's best to go in blind or with as little information as possible in order to simply 'experience' the story unfold. This film most definitely deserves that approach, it captures isolation and human emotion on a genuinely profound level, and Rockwell's riveting performance is undoubtedly an Oscar-worthy one. Even Spacey's voice acting as GERTY is strangely satisfying to me; evoking this calming yet intriguing tone throughout the film which additionally helped to stabilise the drama, combined with Sam Rockwell's truly magnificent acting preventing this film from falling into a feeble melodrama.Everything works perfectly here: the cleverly written script, the visually pleasing set design and even the slightly slow pacing which I didn't see as a flaw whatsoever. The pacing was perfect in this film; it made it feel all the more real and thus enticing, along with a captivating soundtrack to create an utterly fascinating atmosphere throughout. This film is without a doubt, truly astonishing in all aspects, and certainly exceeded my already high expectations. Duncan Jones' direction and Sam Rockwell's amazing performance (he absolutely deserves all of the praise) combined with a compelling plot result in a masterpiece of a film that doesn't shy away from exploring human emotion and struggles on a deeper level, whilst delving into two of the trickiest genres to pull off. I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates good cinema, not just the fans of Sci-Fi.</fullReview>

This atmosphere is to be thanked to Sam Rockwell, the well- designed base, kevin spacey and the great direction, not forgetting the music. I don't even remember the composer's name, but despite some strange tunes, it's definitely the best movie for this atmosphere; when you get to know that this movie has been written by Duncan Jones only because he wanted to collaborate with sam rockwell at all costs, you see how great-talented this director seems until now.Slowness could be an issue to many, but I strongly think that this movie gives it all anyways.

		<fullReview>You don't have to be a Sci-Fi fan to truly appreciate how beautiful and inspiring Moon is. Directed by Duncan Jones (AKA Zowie Bowie), Moon is an independent masterpiece that takes the audience on a psychological journey that explores the concepts of humanity and isolation. Starring Sam Rockwell (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), Galaxy Quest (1999)) as Sam Bell and featuring the voice of Kevin Spacey (American Beauty (1999), House of Cards) as GERTY the robotic assistant, Moon is one of those rare gems that proves you don't need a big budget to make a beautiful movie.In the film, Sam bell is the sole employee on a lunar base responsible for mining and periodically shipping helium-3 back to Earth. After a three year mission left alone with his plants and emoticon-savvy robot (GERTY), Bell has naturally begun to talk to himself and has developed several other quirks as a result of his isolation. He has no real time contact with anyone except GERTY, though periodically he will receive messages from his employers and from his wife. With three weeks left in his contract he is eager to return to Earth and to his family. However when he's in a accident while out surveying, he awakes to find he is not alone and quickly begins to have his world unravel.Moon is an absolute must-see in my opinion and is a prime example of the power of independent film productions. Duncan Jones has created a smart, humbling vision of the classic space-station story reminiscent of Solaris or 2001: A Space Odyssey. The visuals are phenomenal and Rockwell is absolutely superb as the lonely miner. Even now as I listen to eeriness of Clint Mansell's theatrical score, I'm reminded of being captivated by my first viewing of Moon. You'll find no lasers or space battles here, but rather a simple yet powerful representation of what science fiction is all about.Read this and other reviews on DriveInZeppelin's website</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Debut in Directing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is a sci-fi epic featuring Sam Rockwell and the master Kevin Spacey. As far as debut directing goes, this is up there with Reservoir Dogs and American Beauty. Moon is beautifully made, beautifully written and tackles questions on free will and a man's sanity.More and more directors are experimenting with the one character feature, where for the entire feature you only see one person. Admittedly Sam Rockwell has a clone and the calming voice of Kevin Spacey as his companionship but is still experimental none the less. Sam Rockwell gives the performance of a lifetime and is so underrated as an actor and Moon definitely proves he has the ability to run with the alphas of acting.The visuals of Moon are outstanding, the CGI used looks so real, and the space station itself reminds me of a modern 2001 (not to mention Kevin Spacey reminds me of HAL). Its no wonder that Duncan Jones won his BAFTA because this movie looks stunning from start to finish and you don't find yourself losing interest or getting distracted, keeps you completely hooked from the get go.Overall this film deserves all the acclaim it has received in all aspects, script, visuals and direction. How it didn't get at least one Oscar nod is beyond me but that isn't what makes a film a classic. Moon has cemented itself as an extraordinary debut and one of the best sci-fi films in years.</fullReview>

It really shows it doesn't matter how much money you put into a movie for critical success, and the praise for this story comes from the amazing "performances" of Sam Rockwell, and the vocal performance from Kevin Spacey.In the future, we've discovered a new fuel source on the moon's surface via the suns rays. A company builds a mining facility run by Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), who near the end of his three year contract has an accident in his lunar rover. Suddenly, he awakens back at the plant without any memory or recollection of how he got back. Due to limited contact between him &amp; the people back on Earth, the company sends a message planning to make their way to fix something broken and should arrive within three days. Leaving Sam to figure out what happened.It's a great looking movie, that has captivated me many viewings. The dialogue scenes between Sam and A.I. "GERTY" (Kevin Spacey) are great, and Duncan Jones's previous commercial work help create impressive effects on a budget. Final things to mention are the wonderful influences to past classics like "Silent Running" (1972), and a fantastic score provided by Clint Mansell.Final Verdict: It met all of my expectations and beyond. An amazing debut from Duncan Jones. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpredictable ride with the great Sam Rockwell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Rockwell has been one of my favorite actors for a long time. He has showed his range from playing a villain in Iron Man 2 to the laid back somewhat role model in The Way Way Back to the obscure prison mate in The Green Mile. He just has great charisma on screen and it shows here in Moon. Not many actors have the ability to carry an entire movie by themselves. Kevin Spacey helps carry a conversation as the robot/computer Gerty.At first glance it seems this movie is an updated version of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It plays off as if the astronaut is being manipulated by the robot and eventually will fall at the 'hands' of the smarter robot. But this movie brings something different, and I'm glad that they didn't copy too much. Sam Bell (Rockwell) is at the end of his 3 year contract, and just wants to go home to see his family. Little does he know that the end of his contract will be the end of him.Halfway through the movie, you start to find out what's at stake here for Sam, or at least the Sam we know. I didn't know much about the story going in so I was pretty shocked at the whole clone aspect. I just thought it was more hallucinations. You also start to forget that Sam Rockwell isn't talking to another person while filming. The fact that he had to film both parts of him separately and make it work flawlessly is a tribute to how well its directed and acted. I really cant believe no Oscar wins or even nominations were given to this great achievement.I really don't have any complaints, other than maybe it could have longer. I wish they would have shown Sam walking among the people of earth, or maybe given us more to the story before he got there. Considering the reveals in the movie, I realize it would be tough to do more to the story beforehand, but possibly through flashbacks.This film is no doubt a great watch and I recommend to all. 8.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been scouting this movie ever since Sam Rockwell was attached....I finally got around to watching it and I was impressed! While the movie itself is a little slow and at some times not interesting the dynamic acting performance from Sam was enough to win me over and keep me into the movie until them credits started a rolling.The movie centers around a lone man on the moon collecting energy for earth...gripping plot line with a subtle twist thrown in. The use of intelligent camera angles and bold sound usage made this movie not an instant classic but none the less a great movie. It does not have enough action or mystery to make this a breakout movie that is adored by millions but if I was to see this playing on TV I stop and watch it every time. Very Creative, even for a moon plot. Give this one a watch and laugh at the funny faces GERTY makes =), =o, =|, =D, ='.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moon Is An Impressive Sci-Fi Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is an impressive sci-fi drama with thriller elements from writer/director Duncan Jones whose admirable in making this movie that has a compelling story and equally impressive special effects which help bring the film to life. Sam Rockwell is very effective as the lead. He's the only major character and Rockwell carries the movie well. Sam continues to show his talent as an actor with this one. Kevin Spacey provides his voice for Sam's loyal robot Gert. The rest of the cast including the actress who played Sam's wife are okay in their cameo roles. Moon impressed me with how good this movie was and how the special effects really helped make you feel the isolation of being alone on the moon. With a running time of 97 minutes the film moves at a steady pace so it doesn't drag on forever. The character Sam plays in the movie is well developed because you care about him and his struggle. There are a few twists one of them is revealed a little early but it worked none the less. Overall this film was better then I thought it would be and it's sure to please any die hard science fiction fan. Moon has character development, drama, a little humor, and an exceptional performance by Sam Rockwell who makes it worth the time to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Rockwell Soars Over the MOON</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Bell (Sam Roackwell) works on the moon for a company called Lunar Industries. In the distant future, the Earth's natural resources are all used up. Lunar Industries has decided to farm the dark side of the moon for He3 which is then sent back to Earth to use to run the planet. Sam Bell's job is to make sure all the equipment is running well. At the beginning of the movie we join Sam, who has 2 weeks left on a 3 year stint. The only source of camaraderie that Sam has, is his robot GERTY (voiced perfectly by Kevin Spacey), who seems to be a distant relative of HAL from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The only way Sam can communicate with his family, wife Tess (Dominique McElligott) is through video postcards. during one of Sam's ride in his moon rover, he gets in to an accident. After blacking out we are taken to a few days later when Sam wakes up in sick bay. Sam doesn't remember what happened or why he is in sick bay. GERTY tells Sam that his bosses have said for him to rest and they are sending a rescue ship to fix rover and collection vehicle that Sam crashed into. After a few days, Sam is able to talk GERTY into letting him outside, and he visits the crash site. Upon looking in the rover, he finds a body there. Sam brings the body back to home base, and the person he finds is, Sam Bell. The viewer doesn't know if one of the other is a clone, or a figment of Sam's imagination, or a dream. Duncan Jones (who also directed and is the son of rock legend David Bowie) and Nathan Parker co-wrote an amazing piece of cinema that makes the viewer think. You're not sure if everything you've seen is real, and that's the way it should be. You can see that Jones and Parker have been influenced heavily by 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, from GERTY, to having classical music playing when Sam goes out to walk or drive around on the moon, to the lonely worker. Sam Rockwell does an amazing job of acting only against Kevin Spacey's voice and himself. This is essentially an actors movie. If you are looking to see how to be a great actor, Rockwell's performance is one to be seen. It's a real shame that this movie was released in the summer, during the time of the blockbuster, because this is certainly a movie that should be seen by everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible feat in the under-appreciated genre of sci fi!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First time director, Duncan Jones, makes a movie that is reminiscent of many other sci fi gems but takes what worked in all of them and combined them to create one of 2009's best movies. Set on the Moon, in a future where we harvest our energy from the chemicals in the Moons soil, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) lives in a station by himself. He makes sure that all goes well and fixes any problems that happen on the Moon. Shifts of 3 years, these over-watcher's have the duty to just to make sure all is well. Without delving too much more into the plot, the plot takes an interesting turn when something unexpected happens outside of the base. Duncan Jones creates a near masterpiece when it comes to storytelling but there is one thing that I have yet to mention. Sam Rockwell's performance is one for the books. His performance elevates this film from being lost in the sea of sci fi movies to one of pure genius. Lets just say that, Rockwell really shines in the second half of the film. Moon provides a movie experience like no other and should be looked back on 20 years from now as a standard of how sci fi movies should aspire to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Rockwell stars as an astronaut named Sam Bell in Moon. From I think newcomer Duncan Jones(David Bowie's son). Well, to be perfectly honest, I see where he gets his genius. If this guy is actually related to David Bowie, probably one of the greatest musicians of all time, then I want him to do more films.Well, I hate to say this, this really saddens me, but I think this is one film that is going to be overlooked. It hasn't been nominated for any Golden globes. Who cares about them though? Well, It's a bad sign anyway you put it.Moon, though a little slow and confusing, is brilliant. There are so many twists and turns that just pop up in your face. Though it might take you a bit to realize what they are.Moon is probably one of the most creative movie of the year. It is so sad to hear it isn't going to get any nominations. Is it going on my ten best of the year list? No. But it is really a neat and never boring film experience.Sam Rockwell does an excellent job as Sam Bell, an astronaut who has been in space for three years. Actually, I don't think he's been up there that long. I think he was supposed to stay up there for three years. So as Sam starts to spend his final days up there, he starts going crazy. At first I thought he was having hallucinations of himself. Then I noticed that he starts to decay. And eventually, I didn't know which Sam Bell was which.Moon tries to make you think. Oh it does really well with that. Because for a lot of the film I had no idea what was going on. I also wasn't sure why it was a sci-fi. But then as I continued to watch, my questions were answered. This is a brilliantly acted film. This is a clever film. This is a well crafted movie. Now I don't know how director Duncan Jones could've came up with something so clever. Oh wait never mind he's related to David Bowie. If this is Duncan Jones' first film ,I wonder what else he could do? Moon, though not one of my favorite movies of the year(It is definitely on the top 20) it is still genius.Moon: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bowie should be over the 'Moon'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Bowie's son directs his debut film. Duncan Jones comes out of his fathers' shadow and into his own in this low-key sci-fi which is destined to become a classic.The style is without a doubt influenced by Silent Running and 2001: A Space Odyssey. You could argue that there is also a hint of Gattaca in there, but this does not detract from the strong emotional story line. Sam Rockwell's subtle and edgy performance is Oscar worthy, as to are the effects. As Duncan Jones first film it certainly doesn't show, it screams traditional in the modern sense of film-making. Kevin Spacey voices the robot GERTY, his smooth tones and look are reminiscent of 2001's HAL and his monotone voice adds tension.The film is not an action; Moon is a well-rounded package, almost pure sci-fi, and thought provoking playing out a believable premise. It's a tighter 2001 for a 2009 audience, compulsive viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kept putting off watching this, for days I kept trying to busy myself with other things, such was my trepidation for it. I didn't want to not like Sam Rockwell as he is one of my favourite actors or indeed dislike a small indie film from an English director (indeed son of our Starman Mr David Bowie) So it was a while before I took the plunge and settled down to it.How foolish did I feel thinking Sam Rockwell can be anything less than brilliant. In a small claustrophobic film such as this where he is the focal point of everything that goes on he is sublime. Indeed at times he reminds me of Edward Norton in Fight Club as he battles with the circumstances around him.Do not put off seeing this, it is easily one of the films of the year and deserving of the praise it and its new director will receive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A character piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting to see this movie for over a year and now, having seen it, I have mixed feelings. The story is solid and original from a movie perspective, but not from a general sci-fi point of view. The very scenario depicted in the plot crossed my own mind thinking about the consequences of some of the technologies in the film. I can't really say too much about the subject without spoiling it, but that in itself says something about its complexity.Bottom line: a very well acted movie - considering it only has one actor and a robot with Kevin Spacey's voice, it has no choice - and a deep and moody atmosphere. The plot is ingenious, but very simple, making the whole film a character piece, well supported by Sam Rockwell. It has flaws, though, mainly that after the big twist is revealed, most of the film is fairly predictable and it felt slow. I am glad they didn't resort to over-theatrics to compensate. A good film for a quiet night, but it could have been just as well an episode in a series like Outer Limits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's so good when you finally see a movie that you've been eager to see and it doesn't disappoint so I must admit that I was rather tentative when finally going in to my viewing of Moon, a movie I had been looking forward to since first viewing the trailer some time ago. Thankfully, it did not disappoint.Things start off with us being introduced to Sam Bell (played, brilliantly, by Sam Rockwell), a man working away in a moonbase all on his own with only the company of recorded messages from Earth and the humanised computer system, GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). He only has a short amount of time to go before being able to return home but the isolation seems to have affected his mind as visions appear and things start to get curioser and curioser in ways I couldn't possibly divulge here lest it spoil the experience for anyone.This is brilliantly crafted sci-fi at it's very best, using the setting and technology to muse over ideas of identity, memory, emotion and more while also providing increasing tension as things move to a conclusion you just hope will work out the way you want it to.Despite the other names listed in the cast here, this is all Sam Rockwell's show and he handles every moment magnificently. It's one of the best performances I've seen in recent years, certainly in the sci-fi genre, and it's good to see the man finally show the range I have long suspected he was capable of. And Spacey does well in his voice-only role too.Director, and writer of the original story upon which the movie is based, Duncan Jones (son of David Bowie, as most other reviews point out so don't want to break any rules here) certainly does not show any trace of inexperience. He handles everything with a great feel for both what the genre needs and also what any great movie needs. While all of the trappings are there, and used well, this COULD have been made in a different environment and given a different spin but I think all of the decisions made here were the right ones and can barely find fault with anything I have just enjoyed watching.See this if you like: Gattaca, The Prestige, 2001: A Space Odyssey.</fullReview>

The science behind the Moonbase is all plausible. I feel I could watch this movie again. I thought the technology used was appropriate to how it would be; no Buck Rogers 'Twikis' in this.

And that may very well be why I really was bored at first. I just did not know what to expect.But after said half hour it all started to make sense and as you can see, I ended up giving it an 8, and an earned one at that.But be warned: This is not a movie to "just watch", like you would do with your average popcorn-flick. And it gets even better, if you really start thinking about it, especially the things you don't really see and the general implications of it. I also quite liked the ending, even if it might not be everybody's taste. For me, it just leaves room for imagination ... very well done indeed, son of the thin white dude!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark Side of "Moon"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Roman Polanski ever considered bringing his trademark obsessions (isolation, paranoia, delusion, hallucination) to the science fiction arena, the result would probably be close to what Duncan Jones achieves with "Moon," a deliberately off-kilter study of an astronaut's descent into neuroses and existential delerium. Sam Rockwell (in the first truly outstanding performance I've seen from him) plays Sam Bell, who mans a corporate-owned space station on the moon (its function? to divert environment-sustaining elemental capsules to Earth); in the final 3 weeks of his 3-year commitment to the job, his grip on sanity begins to erode. An automated robot named Gerty 3000 (voiced with chilling lack of emotion by Kevin Spacey) is his sole "companion" (whose only "expressions" are confined to creepy Emoticons). The strength of Rockwell's performance is amplified by how convincingly Jones conceives the barren surface of the moon--there are long shots that carry a hauntingly chilling emptiness, and only underline the inner frailty of his protagonist. While "Moon" certainly isn't for all tastes (its deliberate pace and design seems destined for cult status), adventurous fans of cerebral cinema will find much to like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly effective low-budget sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon was a surprisingly effective low-budget science fiction film. It's the story of Sam Bell, a lone astronaut assigned to duty on the moon where he mines the helium that will supply the Earth's energy needs. Sam's sole companion is Gerty, a computer that invokes memories of Hal from 2001. Sam has almost completed his tour and is looking forward to returning to his home on Earth when he starts to have strange visions of other people.Upon hearing the above scenario, I expected a sort of sci-fi psychological thriller where things weren't what they appeared and the purpose of the movie would be to uncover the truth. Well, all I'll say to that notion is that Moon took a path that I wasn't expecting, but one which I found to be unique and refreshing. And that uniqueness is really the film's biggest strength.Moon is a bit different from your typical sci-fi flick. It's light on special effects and space isn't quite the last frontier or intergalactic playground presented in other sci-fi films. Here, it's more like a empty void that separates us from the ones we love. This is a character-driven movie where the focus is on the characters and how they react to a highly unusual situation. The pacing is slow, even leisurely at times. As the story plays out, thought-provoking questions are raised around the topics of ethics, isolation, home, identity and even the purpose of one's life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting concept, well-made low-budget but a bit naive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise is great, the acting, directing and set decoration are excellent, but I personally found that Moon lacked some edge. The big flaw here is that Gerty the robot is too much benevolent and tractable to create tension. Maybe Kubrick set too high a standard with HAL-9000, then Tarkovski introduced too much intellectualized poetry before Spielberg capped it all with his heavy sentimentalism. Unfortunately Duncan Jones seems more at ease with these two than with Kubrick's inescapable noir vision.Moon feels more like these naive "flower power" SF movies of the seventies (Logan's Run, Silent Running) than like a sharp homage to 2001. Even Saturn 3, despite its flaws, is way more edgier.In the end it's OK because it is so well done, but it could have been much better with a script polish delivering a better suspense with increasingly more actual danger for the hero.</fullReview>

I must say this is a very plausible scenario, something like this could happen in the future - and that is scary! The movie raises ethical questions concerning clones: "Are they less than human than a natural born human?" "Are they human at all?" "Should clones be used in labor to replace humans in dangerous jobs?" "Are they anywhere near the same person that they were cloned from?" -- many more questions come to mind.On a personal note: I side with the clones. My heart was bleeding for them. I felt it was totally unfair to them... they are humans.*************************************** I think a bonus to the movie is it has an over all retro look and feel to the film.

Less is more they say and this is certainly the case with moon. The film is simple it has a beginning which is hugely absorbing leaving the audience not knowing which direction the film will go in a middle with character development and an ending which like a nice desert finishes the story perfectly.

		<fullReview>This is absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen and is in my top ten list for the long run. Sam Rockwell is giving an outstanding performance (best of his career so far) that really comes through and moves you deeply if you let it. As far acting goes Kevin Spacey has to be mentioned as well, who is only playing with his voice but still manages to leave an impact with it. Great story to the movie with a not that predictable twist. Despite the small budget the film was made of there can be no complaints regarding the visuals, the locations look stunning from the first minute to the last and you really get the feel of that out of space loneliness. Clint Mansell does it again as always. In fact I would go as far to say that this is his best work up to date. Maybe its because the movie is so good and the music as well, everything just goes together perfectly. Well anyway its a personal favorite of mine and I'm recommending it to everyone. It has a slow pace but it is really worth the waiting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been trying to see this little film for awhile now. Now that I've actually seen it I can say that it did not disappoint. The one problem going into it though, I already knew the "surprise" that was in it. Although I can say that I was surprised it came at the end of act 1.Moon has many themes playing around. Long distance relationship, big business corporations taking advantage of the little guy, discovery about one's self, etc. Moon was able to jam pack so many things in a little run time and it never felt like it dragged on. In fact I was surprised that it was near the end of the film, it feels incredibly short because of how involved I was with such a minimalist story. Rockwell does a tremendous job in dual roles. He plays the one part in a cocky, self assurance way, while the second feels more characterized and on edge. Two varied performances from one person in one film. He carries the entire film on his back and he did a great job. It's hard not to compare GERTY to Hal, they share so many similar things, yet they effectively made it different enough to be slightly original. The machine is voiced by Kevin Spacey, it a warm, yet still cold and machine like calmness. The use of both miniatures and CGI was a wise choice. You can notice that they are miniatures, but it works for this type of film because that it what they drew their inspiration from. Films in the sci/fi genre that used miniatures, and it works well here. The film bridges both old school and modern ways of filmmaking. Duncan Jones is a filmmaker to look out for, I expect great things in his career and look forward to his third film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard good things about Moon, so decided to check it our recently. I'm not a big fan of Science Fiction films and only tend to like those that are more intelligent than the norm. I was pleased to find out that Moon is definitely more intelligent than the average Sci-Fi film.The film follows Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) who is mining on the moon for the earth and is alone except for his computer Gerty, voiced by Kevin Spacey. He is serving a 3 year stint and looking forward to returning to earth and his family.I believe the film was made for a low budget and bearing this in mind looks quite good. The acting is nicely played with an interesting and involving script. The film is well worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll nail my colors to the mast right at the start by saying that I am a long time science fiction fan, so when a rare sci fi offering comes around - and they are few and far between - I'm predisposed to feel positively towards it. And whilst there have been some fairly lukewarm reviews for Moon, personally I really enjoyed it. The movie hinges on a really very good, very strong performance from Sam Rockwell as the 'hero' Sam Bell. It's a pity that sci fi very rarely gets recognized by the panels who select nominees for awards, because Rockwell's performance here is really outstanding. He IS the movie, it's nothing without him.I last saw Rockwell in one of 2008's stranger offerings, Choke, the story of a guy who spends his days working in an historic re-enaction theme park, and his evenings pretending to choke in restaurants so that people will save him. He was also pretty good in Brad Pitt's recent Jesse James film. In Moon he simply IS the whole movie, and he is compelling to watch. Few other actors can command our attention in that way. I just find him an utterly believable actor.The story is fairly standard sci fi fare, but enjoyable. The director successfully creates the feeling of claustrophobia that I can well imagine must exist in such a confined space as a space station. It's basically a movie about worker exploitation, hardly a new theme. Yet put in a new setting, it is fresh.I must be getting old, but when I was a kid reading about astronauts living in space for months ? or even years- on end, it was all just total fantasy. Now of course, with the international space station, we barely register anymore when a new crew blasts off, or someone returns after several months up there, in orbit above our heads. It is almost routine and we only seem to take much notice if something goes wrong. Has space travel lost its mystery and excitement, are we too jaded for a film like Moon? I hope not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Indie Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is great sci-fi flick and will be put in my section of indie sci-fi. Solaris, Silent Running, Soylent Green, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Sphere have found their place there. Moon does a good job confusing you at the beginning and makes you ask some good questions about what it means to maintain perspective on life. Watching Sam Rockwell in the science fiction realm playing a dual role like in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was fun. The scenes where he plays ping pong with himself were very well done. In the scenes where he talks to himself it seems more stressful than necessary, but the fleeting madness of loneliness which turn out to be fleeting moments of clarity was brilliant. I especially had fun looking for the signs of age amidst all the sterility and white decor like the coffee stains, stick-em notes, permanent marking on walls and the oddly placed arm chair were nice touches. Not too slow with enough plot to keep you interested and small touches here and there for the human quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phasing the mind with lunacy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Robinson Crusoe in space? Well, apparently not, this is far deeper than the basic isolationist narrative. Set on the surface of the sleeping satellite, this is as far reaching from home as it could be. For all things indifferent, this plot could well have been set in a deep mine, the highest tower or the most offshore island, but the moon it is, it makes for a fitting and just location for paranoia, confusion and lunar lunacy.At first, it seems that we have a Silent Running (1972) scenario here, minus the crews, but as we delve deeper into the life of Sam Bell, it is apparent that it is he alone who has the arduous task of keeping his strength and sanity at the forefront of his mind, body and soul. As this space flick progress, it becomes apparent that it has more in common with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), albeit similar internal settings, the singular space crew and the infamous independent thinking robot assistant, here called GERTY as opposed to 2001's HAL. It is all in a setting and scale that can be very quickly assessed that this parallel world to 2001 is only as strong as its own blend of involvement in this genre.It's a fine visual environment that when seen on the big screen has its impressive moments that any half-decent sci-fi movie can throw at you, a moderate set-piece and the wide shots of the lunar surface and that of the far distant earth does not miss the mark. It may not be as deep and as rich as Sir Ridley Scott's mother-ship we see in Alien (1979) or complex as Daiana Win Jônzu's house with legs in Studio Ghibli's Howl's Moving Castle (2004) but Moon is centred not on aesthetics and wonderment but inner sanctum.The wonderful tone here taps into the subject of isolation and a slow uncertain doubt that brings on the traits of a lifestyle of living alone for three years and the breakdown of the mind and impending madness. However, all is not what it seems, we know that Sam Bell works for the "Industry" and that his three year work schedule has just two weeks to finalise, but at the same time his mental state is, strangely, becoming more unstable, more degenerative as this two week wait is coming to its end.To confuse matters still, there is the arrival of a doppelgänger, the walking, talking reflective self that has materialised from thin-air, a second body with identical features, both internally and physically exact. Who is this second Sam Bell? How did he arrive at this moon station? Why is he here? More importantly, why does he look, sound and behave exactly as the first Sam Bell? Probing questions for those who think themselves sane and in control. This, the underlined narrative, is what Moon sets out to achieve, are we truly in control of our destiny, our lives, and more to the point, our own demise? It is with solace that Moon has the answer, from turning away from self-pitying loneliness and turning outward to rejoin the human-race by relying on dedicated alliances of instincts of survival and comradeship. The moon is a dead, soulless satellite, and as metaphors go, it works well, the connection between lunar life and lunar (Luna, Latin for moon) thoughts is a fine line.Reconnecting back to the human-race and denouncing the industrial age and its technologies, and all that it entails, is that binds us, and at worst, bleeds the soul dry of individuality and purpose. This too is the under current of Moon, a small claustrophobic setting set against the vastness of the human spirit. To survive. To live. To be human. This blurring of the soul into a Fritz Lang Metropolis (1927) with man and machine, George Orwell's "Animal Farm" of man and pigs and Steven Spielberg's reworking of the Carlo Collodi's classic Pinocchio fable with Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001), where puppet instinctively knows the difference between controlled actions and free will shows that the eroding self from conformity and complacency can, in time, do irreversible damage. Moon shows the positive aspects of life, even in the darkest, furthest regions of space, mind, body and soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serious sci-fi, serious tedium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came away disappointed from this movie. The reviews made it sound a great deal better than it was. Some of the comments about the movie are inexplicable. Good special effects? Some scenes look like they were stitched together from Thunderbird out-takes. The low production costs of the movie are apparent throughout.But good movies don't need good special effects. The trouble is this movie has other failings - such as any sort of pace. It plods along. The middle section, in particular, feels like Purgatory.I wanted to give this movie 6? out of 10 but gave it 7 because, at its heart, it is a serious science fiction film with something, maybe not very much, to say about humanity and consciousness. Several interesting themes run through it, but most are confusingly presented and none are very well developed.I agree that it's a good first movie and Duncan Jones has potential. It's a pity they don't give you a discount on the price of a ticket because of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No words can aptly describe the wonders of this film. It's so engaging that you feel as if you personally know Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), you WANT him to succeed, and it get's quite sad and depressing as you watch his losing battle with insanity and a strange illness. There are no lasers, aliens, space battles, light speed or anything like that. This film focuses more on the humanity of it all. This is truly a wonderful masterpiece and Sam Rockwell pulled it off so well. I'm not going to delve into the plot, but there a a few MAJOR twists. You really connect with the couple of characters present in this film. This is definitely worth your time. What an amazing film. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of all time - to create such a sense of community and helplessness, in this isolated location is outstanding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite films of all time! It is an amazing film which depicts some clones struggles to try to understand the situation that they are in. The isolation is a key aspect of this the fact that they are on the moon and cant talk to anyone on earth other than by recorded messages, is something that really helps to show the isolation.Sam Rockwell is truly amazing in this film, he really does carry it through, and its especially interesting to see what happens when two Sam Rockwell's are out in a room together - the result they start fighting until on of them vomits blood. But really the awkwardness of the relationship at the beginning into realising how essential each other is something that is amazing through out this film.Not to forget the crucial role of 'Gerty' the lovable computer played by Kevin Spacey was exceptional, his ability to keep tone and not give any emotion away was amazing instead he always kept the same tone, and so the only was we could know his feelings were by the faces that appeared on his screen.I really liked the fact that 'Gerty' was a mix of completely computer, and computer with emotions, as films often get this wrong, but Spacey really does get ti exactly in the middle which is really enjoyable to watch, and see the development of the relationship between Spacey and Rockwell, its brilliant.One of the most amazing parts of this film is the moment of realisation that first they are clones, when Gerty tells them about half way through the film it is amazing, because they really done know hoe to react. Other highlights are moments such as when Old Sam cries about how he wants to go home, it is a really emotional scene and helps to set the tone, showing the helplessness of the clones.Finally is the moment that New Sam re-routes the harvester so that it will destroy the 'jammer' so that future Sam's will be able to contact earth, it shows the compassion between the humans and that they aren't programmes they are people and this should not be forgotten.All in all one of the best films out there, with such a small cast to create such a feeling of community and helplessness is outstanding, a definitely much watch for anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've expected too much...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...because of good stars, and I must say that first half of the movie lived to my expectations quite a bit. But then somewhere from the half-point on holes in the plot started to emerge and grew bigger toward the end. As much as I find idea good and storytelling intriguing, authors just didn't succeed to make good job. The result is a movie that is pleasant to watch but real sci-fi fans (and by that I mean people who read sci-fi, not just ones who watch it) should tell the difference between good sci-fi story and movie like this. But there's feeling in the air that much better job still could have been done with the idea, resulting in sci-fi that actually stays in good memory for years after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most original and thought-provoking sci-fi movies of recent years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Moon" belongs to that tradition of science-fiction films that drop the flashy effects and breath-taking action in favour of the more subdued intellectual approach that suggests an idea and invites the audience to consider its moral and philosophical implications. The setting - an isolated space station, its psychologically unstable lone inhabitant, his robotic companion (a humane, and thus inevitably flawed, version of Kubrik's "Al") - sound all to familiar, and at different stages the film seems to fall into one classic storyline or another. There are hints of the "Space Odyssey", particularly felt in the quiet atmosphere and sluggish pace (maintained with the aid of the beautiful score). The growing psychological ambiguity, hallucinations and the shocking revelation that follows are all reminiscent of Tarkovsky's "Solaris", and certainly "Moon" evokes many of the same questions and themes as the Soviet masterpiece, albeit with considerably less ambition. The final stages of the film are bound to draw comparisons to another cult sci-fi classic, The Blade Runner, and though there is certainly a case for such comparisons, they may actually distract us from the movie's finer and more original aspects.Though it does take a while before the story really begins to develop, I wouldn't necessarily call it too lethargic or dull. If anything, the lack of action works well to convey the main character's boredom and mounting depression on this empty extraterrestrial island. Much of the credit for the film's success should go to Rockwell, who once again proves himself one of the most versatile actors around, acting solo for the majority of the film (bar Spacey's voice). As he dives deeper into the mystery of his mission, his reactions to some truly disturbing discoveries are anything but generic or predictable. Though one would expect the audience to sympathize with any character that finds himself in such a situation, Rockwell is able to create two distinctive personalities, yet both equally sympathetic. He certainly has a big future ahead of him if he carries on in this vein.The movie boasts some beautiful though rather spooky CGI landscapes of the moon, with the silent harvesters endlessly scouring the satellite's surface. There is some dark, absurdist humour, originating largely in the "dialogue" between Sams, as well as some truly touching, poignant moments. Some of the issues that it raises, like "are we free if we believe in this freedom?", or "does knowledge provide true happiness", are certainly not new, but Duncan Jones gives us a fresh and interesting take on them, which is certainly worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most sci-fi movies nowadays are about alien invasions,intergalactic wars,in general-the main subject is something of epic proportions."Moon" is the exact opposite.It focuses on the life of just one man-Sam Bell.At first glance this may look like a step down,but I think it's rather refreshing to see a different type of sci-fi movie,plus,"Moon" is a very well thought out movie.The first half hour of the film moves at a rather slow pace and it made me think that the movie was trying to rip off "2001:A Space Odyssey".After these 30 minutes have passed,however,you will see that that was not the case at all.In my opinion,"Moon" had one of the best plot twists I have ever seen.I won't spoil it for you,but it is truly mindblowing."Moon" manages to be innovative and well structured.I strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original, scary and claustrophobic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What are the chances of making a sci-fi film with a low budget, with virtually non existent CGI, with just one actor playing out most of the plot? Furthermore, what are the chances of that film doing exceptionally well at the Sundance Film Festival after having been filmed by a rookie director? Co-written by Duncan Jones in his directional debut, this is one such film that goes on to prove that expensive budgets and mind numbing effects are not always a sure fire guarantee in the sci-fi genre. What works for Jones is the simplest yet best formula there is in cinema story telling, which in this case happens to be a well written script matched only by the actor it is written for. And that actor is Sam Rockwell, perfectly cast as the only human on the surface of the moon. Due to the current energy crisis on planet Earth, Sam Bell is an implant on the moon with the sole purpose of mining lunar soil for harvesting helium-3, a clean energy source he sends back to Earth. Assisting him in this solitary project is an artificial intelligence controlled robot called GERTY aptly voiced by Kevin Spacey. GERTY is also Sam's only companion, programmed to monitor his tasks while vigilantly watching over his health and daily supplies. Nearing the end of a three year contract, Sam is eagerly anticipating his return to Earth, more to reunite with his wife who was heavily pregnant on his departure, than to get away from this isolated existence. But due to a communications satellite failure, live video conferencing between home and the moon are limited to recorded messages sent both ways, but only occasionally. Now with just two weeks left for his return, GERTY does not recommend fixing the satellite relay, but maintains priority in extracting energy. It is at this point when Sam's health starts to fail with unexplained hallucinations. On a routine mining trip, he sees a young girl in his direction and crashes the rover in distraction. Awakening in the infirmary, Sam overhears a live communication feed between GERTY and headquarters on Earth, arousing his suspicion that all is not as it seems. Worse, Sam arrives at a startling conclusion that he may have never been alone all along. For a sci-fi thriller that lacks any of the grand splendors we have grown to expect from the likes of "Star-Trek" and "Star Wars", Jones adopts a technique most active directors would easily avoid only for its retro feel. Although 2009 has left its mark as the year of the sequels (was it Star Trek 6?), Jones has the definitive edge in terms of originality of content and fluidity of context. Having said that, Stanley Kubrick fans are in for a nostalgic trip down memory lane with certain similarities to "2001: A Space Odyssey". GERTY, eerily voiced by Kevin Spacey more than pays homage to HAL 9000. Then there is the disorientation and hallucination associated with solitude as last seen in Steven Soderbergh's "Solaris". But Jones isn't done yet, in fact by the time we start to unravel his diabolical twist towards the end, he has only just begun to narrate how unique we as humans really are. And by the time he's done, there awaits a shocking lesson in corporate ethics versus human identity; homework if you will, for us to mull over long after the credits go up. This again, is masterfully penned into Nathan Parker's screenplay, adapting from Jones' original story. Two other aspects seamlessly blending in are Clint Mansell's score and Gary Shaw's believable cinematography. Remember, CGI is at a bare minimum, yet that sinister feeling of being the only person living on the moon is well rendered. Ironically, sometimes you even feel Sam's claustrophobia when there is everywhere to run, but no where to hide. And this is when Mansell's score heightens that alarming sensation.For a film that starts slow, it sure packs a stinger of a blind-sided punch in the end, one that will have viewers reeling in thought and drooling for more. Good thing then, that Jones is already planning a prequel and a sequel, thus broadening this narrative into his own sci-fi trilogy. If he stays on course as he does here, I'm betting hands down that the sci-fi genre is about to witness another colossal battle; Duncan Jones as David versus J. J. Abrams as Goliath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*maybe a minor spoiler but still just in case*After watching this movie I felt like I did when I was younger and watched Alien over and over again. The love for Sci-fi and the scary thought of just how isolated you are in space came right back. The station was almost identical to that of Alien, the mere thought of something "alien" suddenly came into the station without you knowing it and the mere thought of how far away you are from Earth is the same. To me this is an instant classic sci-fi movie. Excellent story with a twist i really didn't see coming...or sort of did. The good thing about the story is more that you get to think. It doesn't tell you the plot directly, it lets it dive in and give you some hints to what it could be. Is he mad? is he not? Who is he? What is real and what is not? I like movies that let you think and doesn't just tell you right away what you are supposed to think. This is just a classic slow paced sci-fi with the limited action as it needed without any stupid explosions or clichés that can ruin a sci-fi. A classic Sci-Fi for those who want to think and want a good story. In short: Brilliant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sci-fi movie I've been praying for...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me explain to you why I love the movie Moon so much, why it is such an important film for me and what I hope it means for the future of science fiction cinema.I was born in May 1971 so as I grew up I was exposed to all these new movies full of imagination, creativity and beautiful futuristic designs. 2001: A Space Odyssey, Silent Running, Alien, Blade Runner, Outland. These and others embedded themselves in my mind, and as I grew older and revisited them year after year I was impressed on not only an entertainment level but an emotional one as well. A few years ago I began to miss these kinds of films ? in fact, the only one I saw that even remotely reminded me of them was Soderbergh's 'Solaris' from 2002, and even though I enjoyed it I found my appreciation of it slightly discoloured by Andrei Tarkovsky's 'Solyaris' from 1972, a film I was never a huge fan of.I blame Star Wars for the decline in thoughtful, story- and character-driven science fiction films. Don't get me wrong, I was eight when I first saw it and I was fully wrapped up in the Star Wars love explosion ? in fact, I still am. I still love it and still watch it. It's just that Star Wars changed the nature of these kinds of films. It started the trend of summer blockbuster action-adventure laser explosion battle movies that we see now. Some of these were great movies but the decline, even the extinction, of deeper meaningful science fiction movies was to upset me for many years.I think I realised this after Independence Day came out in 1996. It's everything I hate about blockbuster science fiction ? it had bland characters, an unoriginal storyline, overbearing special effects, awful dialogue and a badly realised conclusion. It was then I realised how much I missed science fiction with much more cerebral content. I wanted to think about what I had seen for days after, be amazed or terrified by the experience. Fireworks are over in a second, inspiration lasts a whole lot longer.I was overjoyed when Soderbergh made Solaris, I'll not deny that, because I saw it as a return to more thoughtful science fiction. It was excellently realised and shot (the fact that I wasn't a big fan of the original was my own baggage and shouldn't have reflected on the quality of the movie) and kept me thinking after the credits had rolled. There was just something missing, something I couldn't put my finger on. Maybe, in some strange way, the movie had tried too hard to be deep and meaningful.So now I come to 2009 and Duncan Jones' movie Moon. Here we have a man who grew up with the same movies as me (in fact, he's only six days younger than I am) and not only wanted to make his own film but also capture the feel and atmosphere of these older flicks. The set design, the story, the special effects were all of the age; models instead of CGI, on-set camera trickery, an involving emotional plot, great design and visuals... this was it. This was the film I'd been waiting for since the mid-1980s, when I'd already exhausted repeated viewings of the old movies and was beginning to become desperate for something less filled with popcorn. The great thing is that I consider Moon to be far better than any science fiction movie that has come out in the last twenty years, and it was done as an independent movie on an incredibly low budget. If these guys can produce this kind of quality film with the resources and talent that they had then this also means that others can do it. Low budgets and cheaper technology means accessibility to filmmakers other than the ones employed by the big studios. That can only be a good thing and promises a great future for science fiction cinema.So thank you, Duncan Jones and all those who helped you make this fantastic, insightful and emotionally charged film. You managed to create something that the Great Movie Machine has failed to do for the last 30 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shot for the Moon. Missed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Independence Day was released on the 4th of July (1996). Tim Burton's upcoming post-apocalyptic animation feature 9 will open on 9?9?09. So you'd think, wouldn't you, that a movie called Moon would have come out on July 20? But no, evidently Sony Pictures Classics figured that, after 40 years, missing by only 3 days wouldn't be that big a deal.Of course, as we know from actual flights to the Moon, the 1st 400,000 km is the longest part, but not the hardest; if you're off by a tiny fraction of a percent on arrival, you crash. And that attitude, regrettably, also shows up in the movie itself. They start with an absolutely dynamite idea ? the sort of SF story that I always beg and plead to have made into a movie ? and fritter away all that potential with gaping logic holes during the execution.Sam Rockwell stars as Sam Bell, who is (we think) the only live person represented on screen, since he's the lone (and lonely) tech on site at a mining operation on the far side of the Moon. It's vital that he be there, since Earth has nearly exhausted its supply of fossil fuels but continues to maintain its materialistic lifestyle thru profligate use of fusion power ? fueled by the Helium-3 found in usable quantities only on the Moon (as we learn from the film's opening sequence, a "commercial" touting Lunar Industries Ltd., the megacorp that runs the helium mine).Recent coverage of the Apollo 11 mission reminds us that the video camera that captured the stunning live pictures of Neil Armstrong's historic "1 small step" was itself left behind, as was all the other stuff the mission designers could reasonably unload. That's because basic physics and economics dictate that it's horrendously expensive to boost mass up out of Earth's gravity well, so you do it as seldom as possible, and pack as lightly as you can.This is exactly the thinking of Lunar Industries, which has signed Sam to a 3-year contract. As the movie opens, he's looking forward to going home to his beautiful, loving wife and adorable baby dotter in only 2 weeks, when he reaches his "sell by" date. However, as it turns out, that's not just an awkward play on words, since Lunar had something else in mind. It costs money to ship mass back to Earth, too, y'know.Sam starts seeing other people, people who can't possibly be there. Normally a rock-steady performer (psychologically screened for the job, we readily assume), he's increasingly distractable. His health starts deteriorating, similar to the way the equipment is starting to wear out (most distressingly, the lost communication signal from Earth). He worries that he's losing it.And here ends the plot description, because there are several plot twists (not just one) the rest of the way, and I don't want to spoil them. They are the elements that, as I said above, made for a dynamite story idea.Normally I'm thrilled when movie-makers give the audience credit for some intelligence and imagination, and that's the case here. The automated helium harvesters that Sam superintends are known prosaically as 1?4, and we're left to infer from casual conversation that Sam calls them Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The fonts and abbreviations used in the command center are identical to what Stanley Kubrick used on Discovery in 2001, and director Duncan Jones just puts them out there as Easter eggs for the cognoscenti. There's even some sly meta-humor in naming the movie's production company ? Lunar Industries!But here's the thing. If you expect the audience to be sophisticated enuf to pick up on those subtleties, how will they not notice such glaring incongruities as equipping Sam with a large supply of whittlin' wood (way heavier than MP3s)? Or a ping-pong table (for a 1-person camp!)? Or the idiot use of multiple large antennas, evidently for the sole purpose of jamming communications ? something that the base's robot intelligence GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) could easily have accomplished for a tiny fraction of the effort? And it's not giving away too much to say that, if you see the film, you too will wonder "Why so many of them?".It's one thing to find yourself thinking, an hour after having left the theater, "That didn't make any sense.", "No, they wouldn't have done it like that.", or "Man, no way all that stuff could have happened in that short a time.". It's quite a different thing when those thots keep running thru your head when you're actually trying to watch the movie.Too bad. Coulda been great. Shot for the Moon. Missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies like this, ones that have open seams, are made for me.This happens to me a lot. This is a story with no intended ambiguities. A solitary man on the moon discovers he is an expendable clone, discovering then conspiring with one of his siblings. There is some plotting and a successful escape. We discover things slowly as our hero does, knowing only what he does. It is not complicated.But. But, the thing starts with dreams, and visions brought on by a three year weary solitude. There is a companion supercomputer voiced by (this time the aptly named) Kevin Spacey. We have some hints that we can enter "his" mind as well. There are three solid plot seams where we could be entering an imagined or artificial world of the clone's and two seams where we might similarly be entering the computer's. None of these contradict, and we could easily be watching a ping pong match (one is shown) where alternative universes driven by urges are buffeted by different consciousnesses. I do believe that strong stories have these seams, even though the writer expects few people to nuzzle into them. That some do, that I do, possibly adds to the richness for the average viewer, knowing that there is danger outside of the station.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i saw this film after great critics and attention.i was very frustrated,after i was bored of course.no inspiration at all....a film that you forget even before it ends...for me a one man in a whole film is very interesting,zemeckis did excellent with tom hanks and Boyle with James Franco,but this was a failure.and that because in that kind of movies it is needed heart and pure inspiration from direction and story.in this film there was only philosophical stuff as if it was a boring speech in hall somewhere.I'm surprised with the 8 that has by the public.i think they take it as something that it isn't.the director has no talent and his famous dad is his only passport.lets see what is stronger,talent or passport to the system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moon Movie Review from The Massie Twins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An engaging sci-fi enigma provides a thought-provoking premise, but too many unanswered questions and too many similarities to superior staples of the genre leave Duncan Jones' Moon simply a platform for compelling performances by Sam Rockwell and Sam Rockwell. It's almost a two-man (or maybe one-man) mystery and the creepy, lonely setting (heightened by a brooding score) might have worked more effectively had the film ventured further towards thrills than morality, but it's rare to see a complex and intelligent science fiction film not bogged down by overwhelming predictability.With only two weeks left of his three year contract on the moon-based mining compound Sarang, solitary crew member Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) can't wait to return to his family on Earth. But the mind-numbing isolation and utter detachment from human contact has already taken its toll on the miner, and bizarre visions and troubled dreams disrupt the efficiency of his work. Strange occurrences with communications systems and abnormal behavior from his robotic assistant GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) put Sam further at unease. After a perilous accident with one of the excavation units, he awakens to find that he may no longer be alone in the mining facility...Moon explores the very heart of science-fiction through the most quintessential themes, many of which mirror possible realistic futures, straying away from the more outlandish subjects. There are no aliens or heavily armed spaceships, no time travel, warp drive, black holes, or dwarfish, wizened green men who tutor in ancient sorcerer's ways. Instead, the ideas of isolation, loneliness, the value of human life, productivity, solutions to global energy crises, artificial intelligence, and cold corporate business practices are examined. While materially futuristic, the setting is one of the key elements that make Moon pure science-fiction.It's hard not to make comparisons to Silent Running (a solitary man strikes up conversations with his plants while watering them) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (Kevin Spacey's calmly eerie voice all but duplicates HAL 9000), along with several other less notable precursor sci-fi films. Sam Rockwell steals the show, and considering he's practically the only cast member, it's a good thing he's such a likable, believable actor. Accompanying his performance is pleasantly foreboding music that perfectly sets the mood, masterfully placed throughout the most spellbinding moments by composer Clint Mansell.Moon is one of those films that rely heavily on a shocking discovery by the only main character, which can't be discussed in detail without spoiling considerable realizations. While mulling over hallucinations and a mysterious doppelganger, Sam is slow to interrogate and doesn't overreact like he ought to. His reactions are generally not inquisitive enough. It's an effort to draw out the plot in the form of a terrifying conspiracy, but the result delays answers to the hundreds of questions forming in the audience's minds - some are sated but others are left open-ended. In the end, Moon engagingly sets a bleak, scarily inhumane atmosphere that is interesting but not spectacular.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average sci-fi flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on reviews and overall rating, I was expecting another Kubrick's Odyssey. In this context, the movie is a letdown.The environment is very well done, although there are some unexplained simplifications, like different levels of gravity inside and outside of the lunar base. Sam Rockwell does a very good job, especially toward the ending of the movie. The movie has a very good main idea, but the screenplay does not capitalize on it. All the "twists" and surprises can be seen from miles away, and it fails completely in building any suspense at all. It is one of those movies where you know what could be better immediately after watching it.But it is a decent sci-fi flick, worth watching once, if you like the genre. But keep your expectations low somehow, this one is not gonna make it to history books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how many different ways to say the same thing in order to get up to the minimum amount of lines required for a review but Ill try and say this as clearly as i can this is a bad movie. It bores the hell out of me,its not moody,its not arty,is not beautiful desolation its just mind numbing. A unbelievably straight forward story masquerading as deep and meaningful with lots to say on the human condition.The only thing it says is the people behind this have never read a science fiction book in there lives and don't know how to make a good film. Sam Rockwell strays from boring to annoying whilst making time for a few choice moments of being tiresome. I would avoid this movie as one would avoid all over rated faux original art</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like the Moon itself - big, pretty and largely lifeless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon opens with an advertorial that informs us that the moon has been identified as a huge source of energy for Earth, and that "friendly" big corporations are doing their best to provide us with reliable pure energy.It seems one of these energy production centres on the far side of the moon is staffed by a lone maintenance guy named Sam Bell, who is at the tail end of a three year contract. His only companionship is a computer called Gerty who is sorta like the mechanical arms from Iron Man, only he has Kevin Spacey's voice.As Sam is all by his lonesome, he fills his time with hobbies, exercising, TV, tending to his garden and waiting for dispatches from employers and his family on Earth, which are delayed as the far side of the moon gets no live signals due to inaccessibility. His only action is when one of the many "harvesting" machines is experiencing malfunctions or needs maintenance.On one of these call outs things don't go according to plan, and Sam wakes up afterwards in an infirmary.And this is where sh*t goes pear-shaped.I'm not sure how SPOILER free people want their movies these days but as some key info is about to be outlined. WARNING! HERE BE POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Sam is quarantined on base by Gerty, but he gets a bit toey and manages to con his way out with a plausible excuse, at which time he goes to investigate the crash site. The evidence from the accident is all around, and indeed there is still someone in the vehicle that requires urgent medical attention.It is Sam.The remainder of the film revolves around the obvious questions and dilemmas that would arise when one unexpectedly co-habits with an exact replica of themselves.? - Who is the clone? ? - Why is there a clone? ? - What is real, and what is imagined, (or implanted)? ? - Who has caused all of this and why?So Sam(s) ultimately team up to work out just what the hell is going on, and what is really behind this perceived deception. They search high and low, on base and off for clues and evidence, which of course lead to conflict and disagreement between the Sams, and to them putting in place a daring plan?I got bored.I didn't care which Sam was real, which wasn't and why. The first plodding hour put paid to that. Other reviews have lauded the technical skills shown in having multiple Sam Rockwells on screen at once, and that is honestly impressive. Also impressive is the on-moon shots that look especially realistic and cool, but the action (if you might call it that, I wouldn't) is so slow that when the plot does advance rapidly near the end I was already out of patience.I have consulted the IMDb boards to make sure I "got it" when the movie wrapped up, and I am pretty sure I had most of it right before I went to the internet cheat sheet. That revelation alone was disappointing, as the fact that I did understand what happened and still wasn't blown away was annoying, as I waited 90+ minutes to get to that point.I'll leave it to the individual to decide if the ending gives merit to what came before, and I hope others get more from this film than I did.Ultimately this was a fine acting performance by Sam Rockwell wasted on a lightweight twist that seemed to be only a mild surprise when it finally arrived.Final Rating ? 6.5 / 10. I think I am pussing out on this, I want to give a lower score but can't help but feel there must be more than I saw. I won't spend another 100 minutes of my time investigating this though.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap-Shot!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with most films, there is a requirement on the part of the audience for some suspension of disbelief. There are varying degrees but generally the better Directors make these leaps of logic invisible as they service the plot or heighten the drama. "Moon" begins with a leap of logic that is too nonsensical to ignore. Why is the main character alone in a moon base? Within the first few sequences he burns his hand, bangs painfully into a robot and ultimately crashes a moon buggy. The use of 'technical advisers' would have immediately shown the premise of "Moon" to be utterly implausible. Yet this is of no consequence for the Director. He assumes and rightly so judging by the overwhelming praise this movie is getting, that the audience will be 'too stupid' to question the very premise of the story.The 'hero' has visions of a dark haired woman in the first part of the film but these visions are conveniently forgotten for no explicable reason. When the clones introduce themselves, they do so in an almost casual way, which is at odds with the gravity of the situation. The original clone is weak and confused while the new clone is angry and strong. Subtlety of performance is not an issue.Talking of 'gravity', would not our hero move in the same way inside the moon-base as out side of it?The angry clone decides to wake another clone to essentially murder it, yet he has the moral authority to reprimand the computer for considering humans as machines.On a technical level, the production design is a direct homage to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey yet the question arises that after 50 years, is there no other way of designing interior space sets?The CGI effects, especially those that incorporate the moon buddy, are unconvincing. Ultimately "Moon" is very predictable because every idea it has, has been used before and better, in almost every science-fiction film that has preceded it. Here are a few examples: Solaris for the visions of a 'loved' ones. 2001: A Space Odyssey for a malevolent computer with detached voice. Silent Running for solitude, facial hair and madness. The list goes on.The ending feels rushed and leaves the impression that this could have been an episode of the Twilight Zone rather than a full length feature film.The score is very repetitive and the use of the song "I am the one and only" is a cheap shot.In fact I think that is what this film is, a cheap shot. It lacks originality and imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a lower budget film, it has set the new baseline for all movies in this class. This is truly Rockwell's Mona Lisa. Acting is great, storyline is excellent, and the whole plot makes sense. It is truly unfortunate this film didn't completely rock the box office. I'm hoping anyone who likes sci-fi sees this film. Without giving too much away, Rockwell and Spacey deliver an awesome movie, without having 100's of people, or millions of dollars in special effects. It just goes to show you, great movies do not need all that, and oftentimes can ruin a movie, i.e. Jupiter Ascending. Plot matters, story matters, liking the characters matters. This film has all of that and more. Go see it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is the first good film I've seen in while. Firstly, I'd like to mention that the movie is very enjoyable despite the fact that the story is not entirely unique or surprising. Honestly the entire plot is more or less clear in the first 20 min. However, what makes it all stand out is the execution. The pace and style of the film is wonderful and pleasant. So is the cinematography and directing. Also the acting of both Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey is marvelous. They were able to seamlessly portray difficult and complex characters. Especially Rockwell whose role was so intricate and subtle.Overall I'd recommend Moon to all who love outer-space films that explore solitude and (to an extent) even the very nature of being human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love this movie, A Sci-Fi classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loved Kevin Spacey as GERTY, The HAL-like character, but with so much more heart. You can tell by the whole Smiley face as a face, which was perfect.Sam Rockwell is an under rated movie star, I don't know how he feels about it, but that's the way I like it. It allows him to do interesting stuff like this. Is it more difficult for the actor being such a center of attention? It's more difficult from the view of the audience but Rockwell is definitely the type of actor that can hold our attention for 97mins.The set design was perfect adding to making this a Sci-Fi classic. I've never been to the moon, but the set designed makes me feel like maybe no one has cause they did it on the same sound stage as this movie (NOTE: I don't really believe that!)Silent Running comes to mind when I think of this movie, though I saw Silent Running after I saw Moon. it's that same Blue color worker in space with no one to communicate with but a robot, theme. Notice a similar thing going on with Moon and Duncan Jones follow up, Source Code with the hero being told he's doing one thing cause his mind could not handle what's really going on. In the case of Sam Bell discovers some interesting fine print in the three year contract he signed for mining the moon for Earth's power supply.It's a great low key Sci-fi film about Blue collar workers done on a actual set. destine to be a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Moon" is impressive in that, despite (or due to) a limited budget, it's able to tell a compelling story in a suitably realized setting. Because of the isolation of this one character laboring on a remote moonbase, it really does add to the feeling of being out there - as space-faring cinema goes, at least. It also helps tremendously that there's a lived-in quality to the sets, turning the clinical corporate facility into a workaday environment.But the centerpiece here is Sam Rockwell, who really does carry this film all on his own as (essentially) the only character in the story. He pulls it off beautifully. And the power of his performance (and the script) is making you feel for something that's so disposable. It's not the plot twist that resonates with me, it's the undeniable human angle.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but very frustrating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is near the end of a 3-year job on the Moon when some issues begin to arise. He's become pretty lonely and maybe a bit crazy from the prolonged isolation but finally he'll get to go home in a couple of weeks. This movie starts out very interesting and engaging. But soon enough, it becomes another vague thriller that's more about making us feel a certain way than earning those feelings through detailed and polished story-telling.Some thoughts. If he's the only man on the Moon, doing this important job, how much is he getting paid? The company is clearly making millions or even billions. Clearly he should be earning heaps if he's not completely naive. And is he the only one that could do this job? Why would they only put one person on the Moon, is that really safe and reliable? What if he gets sick or hurt? Why would he agree to it? It would make more sense to have rotations, regular visits to Earth to keep the mind and body healthy. It's not like they don't have the energy resources.Naturally, he has a wife and young daughter back on Earth. That maximises the emotional resonance of his loneliness - brilliant, right? I guess they couldn't have picked another candidate with less attachments... And conveniently, the communication is severely limited. How sad for him! All this energy and even artificial gravity but no reception! None of this is explained or explored. We know very little about him, his life, his interests, memories, hopes or regrets. That might not matter if the movie was full of things happening. But it's really just him. We need to know him.The movie got especially annoying towards the middle. It became confusing and ambiguous. Plot points would eventually clear up but then I'd wonder why they didn't just make it clear from the start. This is what happens in bad horror movies. The characters get upset or frustrated and do stupid things. They don't think. They make things worse for themselves. They fight with each-other. They lie and make assumptions. They investigate a little bit but then give up. They are stupid and you want them to die.The problem is that Moon has a perfectly logical and interesting plot but haphazardly reveals it while you sit there confused. I predicted several things and waited for them to awkwardly be revealed over time. Moon is padded out with artificial moments and plot devices.There are similarities to 2001: A Space Odyssey but they're more off-putting than inspired. 2001 is a separate movie, why not let it be? It's nice when a great new movie pays homage to the classics of the past. But Moon pales in comparison to 2001 so the "homage" is distracting - I end up wishing I was watching 2001 instead. Guardians of the Galaxy brought humour and silliness. Moon doesn't push any boundaries. I was also reminded of Interstellar and the fact that it blew me away and was far more ambitious and original.I think Sam Rockwell is a good actor but maybe he just ends up playing too many similar roles. He always seems edgy, sort of halfway between likable and a jerk. I think a more stable and upbeat personality would have worked better here, to contrast with the desolate environment and confronting plot developments. Someone we believe is good so we care when we see their difficult choices and possible corruption.There also could have been a fair bit of humour without taking anything away from the plot. Moon is a bit dull and serious in tone. People in isolation would develop more of a dark sense of humour to cope. The film-makers didn't think about it that much it seems. In fact, there's very little to show that he's actually been there for 3 years. Very few details. All he has to show for that period of time is a small town model that he's carved. Why not anything more fun or colourful? Movies or music or games or sports? Why does space invariably have to be so depressing and plain and white and clean?The special effects are very good. They're seamless and don't draw unnecessary attention to themselves. It simply looks like you're on the Moon. It's very cool. And it's refreshing to see beautiful sights you wouldn't normally see. The table tennis scene was slightly impressive but unnecessary. It *did* draw attention to the special effects (which is bad).Moon is a movie with a good idea and a good actor. It touches on thought-provoking themes and has some very interesting plot ideas that could be discussed a fair bit. It's technically well-made but the script is just too weak and flawed. It's the way the emotions are handled and the artificial unfolding of the plot that ruins it. I have to still give it a 7 because in spite of its flaws, it's interesting and pretty original. The deep frustration stems from its wasted potential. It could have been a really great film but instead it's an interesting sci-fi plot bogged down by typical melodrama and countless plot holes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As this is an existential and psychological SF drama, rather then CGI packed blockbuster, i'd expect a little more depth and logic in the whole story. The biggest problem for me is the AI of the assistant computer/robot. If it was built and programmed by the employers, it definitely wouldn't allow some of things to happen as they did. There are certain points where the whole mission could be in great jeopardy and that's when mission priorities would be definitely more important then the well being of the employee. Besides this bothering moment for me, the rest is quite OK. The camera and the atmosphere are of course inspired by Kubrick and well executed, the acting was very good and realism of the whole setting too. Nice way to spend an evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You look like a radioactive tampon... like a banana with a yeast infection."Great sci-fi film filled with ideas and concepts and an excellent performance from Sam Rockwell. Found this film really interesting and gripping, although without spoiling anything I found the ending far too neat and brief after such a tense build-up and unfolding of the story. The ending is good in some ways in that it doesn't go for a cop-out big final twist, and is sort of unexpected and hopeful for such a bleak, claustrophobic film.This film is inventive in so many ways, combining old and new ideas from science and science fiction about identity, memory and the nature of existence. The set design is suitably sterile and claustrophobic, and along with Sam Rockwell's performance conveys a sense of crushing loneliness. There is relief in between, as the two Sams, one arrogant and impatient, and one transformed into a total hermit, fight and try to figure out what's going on. There's an uneasy sense of shifting reality in the film. I'm not sure whether a lot of it was intended to be taken metaphorically or literally, but I think it works on both levels. Best sci-fi of recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Refreshing sci-fi experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon may seem inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey which is without any doubt the god of sci-fi films but this one explores its depths quite differently. In the future mankind is exhausted all its energy resources and energy requirements on earth are fulfilled by synthesizing helium-3 from moon soil. Astronaut Sam Bell works for Lunar Industries and his job is to manage he activities of harvesting helium-3 and send the harvested mineral back to earth at the base named 'Sarang' on the lunar surface. It is explained he is serving a three year contract and currently is almost at the end of his contract. He is badly missing his wife and is mentally deteriorating by loneliness. Live communication with earth is also not possible due to a damaged satellite so he sees only recorded messages from his wife and the employers of lunar industries from earth. A midst all of this, he is accompanied by a computer(similar to HAL-9000 from space odyssey) named GERTY who helps him with the various tasks to be performed everyday and acts a like friendly companion on their base. Well this the base plot with which the film begins and introduces for about half an hour. But then just as there are few days left for the end of the contract we encounter a confusing twist in the film for which answer gets slowly revealed over the remaining length. Its suspenseful and also has great emotional as well as scientific depth which is a key ingredient for any sci-fi movie.A lot can be discussed about the film as it has pretty much understandable story making it not open for multiple interpretations. But revealing more of it here will destroy the feeling of awe when you watch it first time.Sam Rockwell as the lonely astronaut Sam Base is rock solid and carries the film on his shoulders efficiently. He is the only main character in the film having major screen-time, each of the rest of cast is there for hardly few minutes except GERTY voiced nicely by Kevin Spacey. Despite having a low budget the shots of the lunar landscape were very effective and the sets of the 'sarang' base also looked nice(again inspired by sci-fi epics like space odyssey and alien). There are no great special effects with lasers, blasts or alien creatures just plain simple story of a man on moon filled with deep sci-fi ideas making you think about what will happen if we encounter such situations in real life. This is how science-fiction is enjoyed the best and it is my favorite genre alongside fantasy. The script is tight and focused and doesn't hinder into unnecessary subplots. Duncan Jones and Nathan Parker flawlessly dwell into the depths of the story and debut director Duncan Jones completely absorbs us into the movie making you strongly root for the astronaut.The background score is quite nice giving the space feel as required. And even in its short run-time of about 90 minutes it explores a lot. The pace in the first half is bit low which may bore some who are not much into sci-fiction films.Apart from that I did not find a single moment where I got bored. Moon easily gets into my list of best sci- fi movies, it may be inspired but is original in its own way.Rating:[4.5/5]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is near the end of a 3 year contract to mine He-3 on the far side of the moon for Lunar Industries. He is the only person on the base with no direct link to Earth. His only companion is the computer GERTY. He gets recorded messages from his wife Tess (Dominique McElligott). He fears that he's hallucinating. Then he crashes one of the harvester. When he wakes up, GERTY is keeping him from leaving. He finally goes to the crashed harvester and finds another him. The first Sam Bell wakes up frustrated at finding out that he's a clone.The movie has a bit of eerie mystery at the beginning, but the movie isn't necessarily trying to hide anything. Everything from the clones to the end is obvious. The good part of this movie is the performance of Sam Rockwell. He's great as always. In this, he's playing two distinct characters. However without a big mystery, the drive for the movie is diminished. It's just a matter of watching Rockwell acting against himself.</fullReview>

Cut off from the earth below and his beloved wife and daughter he becomes injured in an accident and subsequently learns that he is a clone.The story then proceeds to see the clone come face to face with another clone. The two come to realise that the station is a cloning facility and with the help of the machine they plot to escape and return to earth. Towards the end the one clone manages to reach earth but before breaking the communication jammer that prevents mining station from receiving incoming signals from earth. The next clone to awake will learn of the events transpiring on the surface.This film is hard hitting Sci Fi and with a minimum of cast members truly delivers an interesting story that is compelling right up to the end which goes to show you don't need a lost of characters to make movies work. The Blair Witch Project and many other small cast movies work just as well given a good story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever, Suspenseful and Never Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rare for a science fiction film to be slow paced, yet remain entertaining. Last year's Moon is one of those exceptions in that although there is little action, it is clever, suspenseful, and is never boring. When most people think of science fiction films they think of a fast-paced, technically stunning experience (i.e. Avatar, District 9, Aliens), yet Moon was made for a tiny budget and still manages to be visually ravishing. This is caused by the impressive camera-work as well as the futuristic setting.The film follows astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), who is only a few weeks away from completing his three-year contract with Lunar Industries, the company responsible for extracting helium 3 (Earth's main energy source after all oil has been depleted) from the Moon's surface. Sam has been completely isolated during his stay on the Moon with the exception of a robot named GERTY (Kevin Spacey). He does keep in contact with his family via video transmission, yet the transmissions are not live feeds because of a failure with one of the communications satellites located on the surface. After Sam wrecks his Moon rover into an harvesting machine, he is saved by another suspicious astronaut. After recovering he is bemused to find that the astronaut who saved his life turns out to be himself. Throughout the rest of the film it is up to Sam to figure out whether the other him is indeed real or simply a fragment of his imagination. Now I know that you are thinking that this movie sounds confusing and weird, but somehow director Duncan Jones pulls it off. In fact, the most interesting part about this film is trying to figure out what is happening to Sam. Is he being cloned or has being completely alone for 3 years simply lead him to lose his mind? This question posed by the filmmakers is what makes Moon more suspenseful than most science fiction dramas.Overall, Moon is a superior small budget film thanks to its original story, clever dialogue, great visuals and a fantastic performance by Sam Rockwell. Besides District 9, this was the best science fiction film of 2009.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MOON is a very fine example of a 'sci-fi' movie made on a low budget on studio sets. This is the way films used to be made.This is a first time directorial and writing effort as well,.Duncan Jones wrote the original story &amp; directed; his partner Nathan Parker wrote the screenplay. WE WILL see more of this creative teams work.Sam Rockwell who has given fine performances for over 15 years in film &amp; on TV. gives what actually amounts to a SOLO performance. He should have been nominated for an Oscar, He was nominated for a BAFTA award.Sam WILL win an Oscar one year, It would be a shame if he did not.The only other major name in the cast is Kevin Spacey, he is the computer voice &amp; of course does a fine job.The story takes place on the far side of the Moon, in a large space lab. If you let your imagination loose, you will feel you are in that lab.There are few fancy space type shots, that we see in similar films.This is a fine 2009 low budget film like they used to make.Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 96 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very intriguing straightforward character-oriented sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The buzz I've heard around "Moon" is that it's a throwback to the more tasteful and intelligent sci-fi films of the 70s, films that didn't tend to feel the need for big action scenes with special effects to put across a theme and an idea. But I felt that it was less of a throw-back than an all-around aberration, because the story and the ideas are so straightforward that they defy also the gimmick-heavy rules of the 1970s cycle. Sam Rockwell plays astronaut Sam Bell, a man who seems less of a scientist in the classic sci-fi sense than a technician; his job is to maintain energy gathering robot facilities on the Earth's moon, a job which is supposed to last 3 years. A delayed communications system enables him to keep in loose contact with his wife and daughter on Earth. But when a crash while repairing one of his units leaves him incapacitated, a chain of events is set into motion whereby he will discover his true identity and purpose in life, achieving a kind of existential wisdom at the expense of all possibility of happiness.While it's starting to feel as if many of the ideas in these movies are played out ? clones, artificial intelligence, space exploration, etc. ? this movie took a different tack by using a very tasteful and measured narrative approach so that the character would stand up stronger than the shopworn ideas. In terms of what could actually be called "sci-fi ideas", this film is no more advanced than something like Michael Bay's "The Island" and closer to "2010" than to "2001." I found myself not caring too much because the point of the film seemed to me more based around character and story than ideas. The people behind it didn't feel the need to use a whole ton of action scenes and CGI effects just for the sake of impressing people; they just let the story be what it is and told it in a very direct way. This may be to the distaste of some sci-fi fans and also some effects fans, but I think it was an admirable effort that makes the film stand very much on its own. Rockwell's performance is very impressive, managing to convey two different personalities present in the same person, to play the same person at two different times in his life in very different ways. The element of the story with the robot GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey, of course) looks and sounds a lot like HAL in "2001", but of course this story doesn't just take itself in the same direction but rather plays with our expectations that it might. What I really like about this movie the most is that it seems so devoid of "movie moments" ? it seems unpredictable simply by being sort of predictable. I feel that the sci-fi is merely the setting for a good character-oriented story, and in that sense it's a more mature sci-fi, compared to most effects spectacles out there it's like "The Naked Spur" compared to a Gene Autry movie. It's sci-fi world is not so much a future world, or a chance to get political about energy shortages, as it is an existential examination of one man's relationship to his environment and himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I have to say that Moon is sad &amp; somewhat depressing. There isn't much here that is uplifting. Unfortunately, Moon is also frighteningly prophetic. At least I think it is. It's sad how Mr. Corporate has infiltrated our society to a degree that movies can depict with strikingly accurate assumptions of what we can expect in the future. It's hard to find an argument about what we are seeing and the theory behind it. It almost makes one feel that death, when it comes, might be a blessing in disguise but enough of that.Moon is well done. The acting is very good. The sets are wonderful and I have to say that the idea is very interesting. However, would I want to sit through it again? Nah. The quality of the film is there and for that I'd give it a 9. As far as how much I enjoyed it? I did but not a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every so often you stumble across a movie that speaks genuinely to you about everything it's trying to show you. Moon is very much a movie like that. the only real negative comments I've read about this film seem to be people nit-picking small concepts and expecting something that this film isn't. This film is not a movie with a HUGE twist at the end (like every other Psychological Thriller), yet by the middle of the film there are so many questions buzzing around in your brain. I won't say anything about the plot because that would not be fair. That being said, I have seen this film multiple times and it doesn't detract from the experience, rather with each viewing, one gets a little bit more and sees parts they missed the first time around. This movie is not with out its flaws, but those can be overlooked as overall the acting, writing and directing are all masterfully done. Sam Rockwell is Brilliant in this film as he is in most everything I've seen him in before. What really shines is the writing and the Interesting way in which they show character development almost playing with a dichotomy of themes as we slowly unravel this "mystery" in space. This is a must see for anyone who likes to be entertained and think while doing so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poignant and moving film that requires a couple of viewings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is nominally in the sci-fi genre but it belongs to those films in the genre that merely use the sci-fi setting to explore issues about life and humanity, films such as Silent Running, Solaris (the original version at least) or even to some extent Bladerunner (but without the action of the latter). It has very little in common with large budget action style sci-fi in the vein of Star Trek, Star Wars and so on.Speaking personally, I found the film to require two viewings to really appreciate some of its subtleties. After the second viewing I concluded that this is a moving portrayal of the maintenance of human dignity in the face of corporate cruelty. The corporate cruelty element is very obvious. The human dignity element emerges more gently during the film as the interactions between the clones evolves and they learn to show love and compassion towards each other despite their situation.And I agree with other comments that the acting is excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moon is, at last a sci-fi movie that is one of the best of this decade. The twists and turns keep you guessing right up until the very last minute, and when it comes you are knocked for six. Awesome scenery help establish the mood and ambiguity of the whole film, and makes the viewer feel uncomfortable and uneasy at the most eerie scenes in the film. With the help of great direction and music that is from a bygone age, it's hard to imagine Moon to not be a likely contender for one of the best films of the year. The lack of an ensemble cast really helps drive the film forewords and it's because of this that, at the most suspenseful of times, becomes harrowing and very bleak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very presently surprised by this movie I must say. Having not heard much about it other that it was good I just sat back and let it flow over me late one night. I did not lose interest for one second during the entire film and other then the fact that it was a tad confusing when the switch came and some of the interaction between the two Sam Bells was a little trite, it moved along so well and really gave me the feeling that I was with them in their enclosed Lunar habitat. I am surprised that this was not a bigger hit and seemed to fall under the radar. This is the best thing that Sam Rockwell has ever done and except for a few images on the video screen of his wife and bosses this is a one man show, or should I say two. This might be the best example of the twins interacting trick I have ever seen. Kevin Spacey has a perfect voice for the rather sad GERTY who just wants to help if you only ask the right questions. I have read the comments that this is a 2001/Solyaris rip off but having seen both and being a huge fan of 2001 I feel it was just a bit of a tribute. No aliens here. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ground control to major Tom? Moon is directed by 38 year old Duncan Jones, son of David Bowie. So maybe it's not a big coincidence that his first feature film is Moon with Sam Rockwell.I think Rockwell is a much under-appreciated character actor of the past 15 years. I'd first dismissed him when I saw the Green Mile and believed that this guy was basically a typecast actor who always played the role of the out of control crazy guy. How wrong I was. Rockwell has been amazing in movies like Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Snow Angels and Frost/Nixon. He's definitely not a one note actor.In Moon he goes where Tom Hanks went in Cast Away and Wil Smith went in I Am Legend. He is basically alone on screen except for the comfort of his HAL-like computer, Gerty. The difference between Rockwell and Wil Smith is that Smith was laughable in I Am Legend and Rockwell can hold his own on the screen.I've often complained in the past that science fiction has turned into science fiction action. We only need to look at most of Wil Smith's more recent work to see that this is the case. Even when movies are adapted from old source material like "I Am Legend" and "I Robot", the movie becomes an action-packed, ray-gun totin' adventure where the body count is high and the story is limited.This isn't the case with 'Moon'. It's a pretty old fashioned sci-fi story which kind of has a Twilight Zone episode feel to it. This isn't to say that the sets, production design and special effects aren't great because they are, but they never overwhelm the story.There were a few sequences where I was looking at it trying to see if I could see the strings and wires but then I stopped looking because the story was actually pretty engaging. This movie could have actually been done on a much lower budget and still been as effective.The story is pretty simple and is predictable at times but it's still fun to see Rockwell on screen. There are a few surprises of course and at the end we're left wanting more. That's a clear sign of a good movie in my books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this move for the most part, even though you had to kind of stretch your imagination to believe a lot of it. Throughout the movie, you're kind of asking yourself if it's a genuine plot or simply another way for Hollywood to do some kind of social commentary on the state of our planet and where we are going with cloning. I have always been a Kevin Spacey fan (Se7en is one of my top 5 favorites) and it would have been nice to see him as a character instead of just a voice. The scene where Sam Rockwell is having his hair cut looks like this thing called the Aircut that I saw on YouTube (you can find it by searching for "aircut"). I bought one, not believing that it would work for me, but go figure it works great. Wonder if in the future, we'll all be cutting our own hair with one of these... :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2009 has been a fairly awful year for cinema. Moon stands out in a year when six months prior nothing has excited an audience member who has a problem watching sexist, machismo driven blockbuster drivel. It is hardly an exceptional film. It does not homage so much as copy many of the great science fiction films of cinema. 2001, Silent Running and Alien are all clearly on screen. The threatening artificial intelligence of the onboard computer, the day-to-day environment threatened by corporate orders, the claustrophobic setting. Unlike Danny Boyle's Sunshine which seems eerie even before any of the peril sets in, Moon takes a long time to really go anywhere interesting.That is neither the fault of Sam Rockwell or Duncan Jones' direction, which are both impressive and suggest greater things beckon for both, particularly Jones who seems unable to have an uninteresting image on screen. The script which spends a long time enforcing the monotony of Sam Bell's day-to-day activities and once its slow pace, that served Alien so well, is broken by incident it forces the audience to pay attention again and much is lost. It requires a second viewing not simply because a lot is lost in a first viewing but to simply help the audience understand what they missed when dozing.That said it is a science fiction with ideas aplenty about identity and man's place in the world and given other science fiction films this year that are entirely about spectacle it is refreshing to see something with brains.Clint Mansell's score however is utterly brilliant. Haunting and ethereal it is instantly a classic and makes the final scenes of Moon all the more memorable and moving. Whatever Duncan Jones does next will be certainly worth watching and will be more interesting than every other film of the summer, unless Christopher Nolan has a film out. This is the beginning of Duncan Jones' career and it cements Rockwell's reputation as a sterling actor who demands more zeroes to his pay cheques. But they have a long to go Moon is only the beginning. They still have a long way to go. Jones isn't Kubrick yet, nor is he Ridley Scott. But he can only go up...or so I hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moon is an instant classic, a sci-fi masterpiece. Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, an astronaut nearing the end of a 3 year contract aboard a lunar space station that's used for mining energy for Earth. The only interaction Sam has is with the station's computer, Gerty, voiced by Kevin Spacey. Gerty's eerie, monotone voice will make you wonder if he's not a relative of 2001's H.A.L. While out on the moon to check on one of the harvesters, Sam has an accident in his rover. To say anymore would be ruining the plot. Moon is a rare thought-provoking, intellectual drama that succeeds in holding your attention for the duration of the film. Not an easy thing to do considering there is essentially only one character in the film. This is a testament to Sam Rockwell. A true Oscar snub in every sense of the word. While watching Moon I couldn't help but feel that this film was pulled right from the early days of science fiction. It could have easily existed 80 years ago. Moon deals with some pretty interesting issues like what it's like to be alone and the toll it can take on the mind. It also deals with the treatment of the blue collar worker. All in all, Moon is one of the very best films of the year and deserves to be seen by all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Duncan Jones's first feature length makes you keep guessing. It is a film that requires a lot from the keen viewer and at ninety three minutes, it isn't asking for much.Existential delusions the loneliness of space and time and darkness make this film one of the best science-fictions out there; a shoe-string film that surprised everyone.Thirty minutes into the film and I had lost sense of time. The film is woven with care, the models crafted with much trouble. Having said that, the quantity of character(s) in the film ? at times ? holds you back. From what I read it was a financial thing. However, Jones and Rockwell pull it off pretty nicely. There is also a robot (Kubrick's HAL 9000 has become an integral part of our subconscious) named GERTY voiced by Kevin Spacey. I also happened to finish 'Se7en (1995)' a couple of hours back and the guy is invisible yet, the guy is all over the place.Of genre-trapping, there had to be some, only if to come to terms with a plot this thoughtful. The script written by Jones and Nathan Parker becomes retro yet very real when the finished goods are for taking.The moon-landscape is lifeless and dreary even though the 'moon-surface' images are full color and taken from the Japanese lunar orbiter, SELENE, they still appear to be monochrome, lifeless &amp; in stark contrast to culture and romance; things that make us human. Sam Rockwell does a pretty decent job for a character this complex. He plays the decaying astronaut with skill and rhythm. The ending, I feel, is being overrated by people calling it 'a major confrontation' and 'grand'. The film and everything about it is an idea, an unbalanced idea, a film that does not have an end or even a beginning for that matter. It leaves you questioning your beliefs and conditioning; the memories, who do they really belong to? Does it make a difference to the immortal clockwork when we are being sent back to Earth?Heavy fuel, I know; I loved watching Rockwell's undaunted performance, which added to the film's success. He is a fine one.The film also gives homage to films like THX 1138 (1971), Solaris (1972), Alien (1979) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) among other genre- bending ventures into space. An eccentric, poignant and a thoughtful watch that asks how long will you live for?'250,000 miles from home, the hardest thing to face...is yourself''; tag-line for 'Moon'</fullReview>

What confirms MOON as high-quality entertainment is that it holds up very well even when you know the plot, as I discovered watching it again on DVD last night.Budgetary considerations probably determined the choice of miniatures for most of the exterior scenes. They seem to me to be the only weak spot of the film. Although they are well executed, their artificiality is in stark contrast to the believable interiors. There's compensation, though, in the form of other photographic effects which are extremely impressive.The heart of the film is an astonishing, virtuoso turn by Sam Rockwell, who deserved every award going but who had to be content with admiring reviews. If you're unacquainted with the work of this superb actor, then MOON is a great place to start. If you're a fan, you'll have seen it already, but never mind - see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid sci-fi debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the feature directorial debut for Duncan (Zowie Haywood) Jones, formerly known as Zowie Bowie and son of David Bowie, and was shot with a relatively modest budget of $5m. That pushed the seven star rating I would normally have given this film up to an eight.The story is set in the future and follows Sam Bell who is a miner approaching the end of a three-year contract working entirely alone at a lunar mining base. He has only an intelligent robot called GERTY (remember HAL?) for company, plus occasional video messages from his wife on earth. He is cracking up from loneliness and looking forward to leaving in a few weeks when a accident while working sets an unexpected series of events in motion.Jones has clearly tried hard to evoke sci-fi classics from the 1960s up to the 1980s, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Silent Running (1971), and Alien (1979). That is visible in the writing, with the futuristic sci-fi context being used only to support the story rather than being allowed to take over as so often happens nowadays with special effects such a focus in sci-fi. It is also visible in the cinematography which uses the enclosed spaces of the lunar mining base to great effect and the colouring work done on the movie has given a real retro feel to the images. Gavin Rothery who worked on visual effects for the movie has some fascinating background on all of this on his blog at http://www.gavinrothery.com/moon-blog-index . All of this works really well and is impressive given the limited resources.Where the movie goes wrong for me is that after a great build-up, it seems to fizzle out in the last quarter. There are many questions created in the mind of the viewer but never answered, and suggestions made that are not followed up, and many possibilities for deeper explorations of the reasons, meanings, effects of the issues raised that are never pursued. And so it leaves and unsatisfying taste in your mouth. Perhaps the story should have been paced differently to keep the big reveal of Sam's mystery until closer to the end? Or maybe the pacing was right and we just needed more depth of detail towards the end, which could have been dropped due to the tight budget of course.Anyhow, this is on the whole an enjoyable, thought-provoking and solid sci-fi flick and I'll be watching out for Duncan Jones' next feature.p.s. Since I've focused only on Jones, I should say that Sam Rockwell was excellent as the one proper character (Sam Bell) in the movie, and GERTY is ably voiced by Kevin Spacey also.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a Sci-Fi Drama...yes they exist. Many of the good Sci-Fi movies have a element of drama, to make you identify with the character. This movie engulfs you in the life of a single person living/working on the moon. The only real company he has is the main computer called GERTY. The movie has resonances of Space Oddessey 2001 combined with a twilight zone episode. Every time I hear a computer voice say "I'm sorry" I feel the chill through my spine from "I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that" that HAL utters in 2001, to this day one of the all time bad guys. I have liked watching Sam Rockwell in his many roles, and I give him props for this movie. Rockwell basically is doing a one man show and must transform emotionally and physically during the movie. He deserves an Oscar for this performance. Sadly most people now days do not have the patience or appreciation for one man dramas. The movie is a reasonable 90 something minutes but because of the small cast feels longer. I will say the story could have moved a little bit quicker. I thought the set production and cinematography were outstanding making you think he was in a large space station and traveling on the moon surface. Worth Renting just make sure you are not expecting lots of explosions or lasers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can often see movies with my brain switched off. Not this one. Score one for Moon. I can tell when a movie had an effect on me when I keep it in my head well after seeing it. Score another for Moon. Score another when I care to see it again. I *need* to see this one again. There are a few dots I still need to connect.While some said it was "slow", I thought the pace was fine. Why does it have to be "fast" I wonder?I'm a story over CGI guy and this one satisfied that need.If I say any more, it would contain spoilers, which I prefer not doing.See this movie and leave your brain switched on.Update: Just saw it again. It went from very good to excellent.And finally, why wasn't this movie more widely distributed?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... the clones only last 2 weeks? If he thinks he is going home in 2 weeks, then has a n accident which he wakes up from, the new clone has to think he is leaving in 2 weeks, too.I am not sure if this has occurred to anyone, but I do see that if they have so, so many clones, and it takes a ship from earth less a than a day to arrive, then they must have an idea of the shortness of life of these clones. The energy to sustain clones in limbo would not be cheap (although, they are making their own energy). So I suspect that there must be an idea that the clones do not last 3 years.Also, how could long range comms be out for 3 years!? Would not make sense to a 3 year clone, but would to a 2 week one.What do you think?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) works for a company called Lunar Industries, which is harvesting an energy source, called Helium-3, from the surface of the moon. He operates the mining station on his own, with only an intelligent robot named Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) to keep him company and tend to his daily needs. Sam's contract is for three years and he's only two weeks away from returning home to his wife and young daughter. When Sam accidentally crashes one of the station's all-terrain vehicles, he wakes up in the station's infirmary. Gerty's evasive answers to his questions about the accident lead him to investigate further - and he makes a disturbing discovery. Directed by the son of David Bowie, Duncan Jones, this claustrophobic, slow-burning thriller builds in tension as secrets are revealed. At its core is a rather simple idea, and it's executed with finesse. The mining station's isolation becomes increasingly heavy and is the perfect backdrop for the intriguing drama that ensues. Sam Rockwell, as always, is brilliant to watch and Kevin Spacey's polite, genial Gerty is unsettling. Jones' minimalistic approach is crucial and perfectly delivered, allowing the gripping mystery to unravel. The sets feel intensely real and special effects are used seamlessly and sparingly. Moon has the palpable qualities of a film from the 70s and is filled the visceral nuances. Moon is ultimately a chilling film that maintains its vision until the final credits. It asks some important questions about our future and an impending desperation for natural resources. It's a very impressive feature debut from Jones. The DVD release has a comprehensive set of special features. There are three audio commentaries, a short film by Jones called Whistle, making-of and special effects featurettes, and footage of live Q&amp;A sessions. All in all, a release worth owning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moon quite wonderfully captures the sheer vastness of science fiction and yet works as equally well, if not better as, a stripped down and simplistic study of the human condition. Moon is a project all about the sorts of themes, ideas and emotions that have been, and will always be, acquitted with humankind; whatever the year and wherever the locale. On this occasion, the emotions and thematic elements of isolation and loneliness are explored under the watchful eye of the science-fiction genre and unravel on Planet Earth's sole Moon. And then there's the word 'Moon', merely four letters long but used to describe something so big; so exciting; so mysterious and so seemingly far away. Jupier get something ridiculous like sixty of the damn things, we only get the one.Here, the titular satellite orbiting our planet is used as a backdrop for some rather humbling scenes revolving around raw human emotion; some confusion and ambiguity as the lines between drama and horror are blurred as well as a scathing attack on the working commercial world in which we live and work. "Where are we now?" asks the voice in the opening scene, a montage of the vast technological developments of our time. Where indeed are we now? Going by both Moon's content and overall study, the developments over time in regards to modernity have aided those big, evil corporations by expanding into space and putting people through the proverbial sausage factory without them even realising. Without spoiling anything too greatly: "Where are we now?" ? technology and the ability to travel into space and set up on the Moon has advanced in the world of this film, but the same old humankind ideologies of working for a set period; doing your time; outliving your usefulness and then being 'replaced' seem to have stuck.You get that feeling writer/director Duncan Jones identifies his setting as a wide, eye-opening and somewhat beautiful place if you looked at it right, and yet deliberately keeps everything restricted; locked down and focused on those within the small space centre in which most of the events unfold. Jones' ability to cover so much ground and yet essentially keep his characters within the parameters of half a dozen rooms is extraordinary, yet again acting as an example that sees people and characters journey long and far within their minds and yet only ever really cover a physical distance of a few dozen feet ? let's say half a mile when they're outside on the Moon's surface.Moon sees a certain American astronaut by the name of Sam (Rockwell) suffer, struggle and eventually come to limp his way through what can only really be described as some sort of tour of duty, on the Moon, working for a large company called Lunar Industries - the word 'luna', of which, is Spanish for 'Moon'. His role sees him wake up; do whatever he needs to initially do; talk to the base's on board computer, named GERTY (Spacey), about this and that before spending not-all-that-much-time extracting 'Helium-3' from the Moon's soil so that it may be used back on Earth for certain purposes. For all the technology; for all the awe of supposedly travelling to the Moon and being situated on the Moon for 'x' number of months, the job boils down to that of a farmer, or that of a bean counter trained to push a few buttons and shift incoming 'goods'. This changes, however, a while into the film when a crash in a vehicle outside on the surface kicks off some rather strange events.It is again to Jones' great credit that he keeps the momentum and the intensity going throughout the build up to a rather dramatic unveiling later on. I think it's fair to say at this point that a second Sam turns up for whatever reason, but the film draws us into the first Sam's mindset so much that interpretation and guess-work will still play a part on the viewer's behalf when sitting down to watch it. Sam comes across as weak, soft-bodied even, in his mannerisms and general behaviour when hallucinations of women sitting in chairs and eerie images of himself decked out in full astronaut gear reaching up from the bottom of a bed become apparent. He watches video messages from back home; they glitch and skip a beat - is something up? Is he going mad? Is the machinery wearing out, or is HE beginning to wear out to some degree. Moon draws on inspiration from some pretty far reaching and understandably heavy weight science fiction films from decades gone by; drawing on inspiration from and paying homage to, but never feeling like trying to go higher than. Jones knows the level he's at here, and with this as his rather accomplished debut, anticipating his next venture will be a joy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One small step for Sam; one giant leap for Science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I want to make clear that I personally felt that this was one of the most thought provoking sci-fi movie's I had seen in quite a while.As many have said, sadly the bulk of sci-fi movies these days are mainly concerned with action and or entertainment. Although there is most certainly a place for movies where such themes are an integral part of the movie, few if any are being produced which focus on stimulating deeper thinking on the rather less superficial level and at the same time have any significant long term value. For me Moon was a real breath of fresh air and to its credit, although it didn't absolutely blow me away, I think it achieved that level of stimulation many sci-fi fans like myself (and also non sci-fi fans alike) have been craving for.I know many were disappointed with the seemingly identical overlap of the themes/concepts from sci-fi greats such as Kubrick's: A Space Odessey 2001 and Scott's: Blade Runner, as well as a more recent but certainly less notable, Soderbergh's Solaris.However, although I was hardly unaware of these parallels whilst watching Moon, I still felt it stood on its own two feet and that the obvious links were certainly more of a homage than a rip-off. Afterall if you were to truly attempt to copy the greats surely you'd invest a significantly higher budget and dress it up much more.Either way such comparisons produce at best academics distinctions and such citations are mostly to defend a perceived threat to the intellectual property of the greats such as Kubrik, which of course is perfectly intact. The over focus in this area I feel, misses or worse ignores the real strength and the bleak beauty Moon has to offer.Far from having a lack of emotion (as some have perceived), there is an all pervasive and tangible sense of intense isolation and disconnectedness throughout Moon. This feeling, despite the obvious, relatively close proximity of the Earth and especially during a more technologically advanced, if fictional future period, made it all the more potent.At many points I found myself empathising hugely with the situation Sam Bell (the main character) found himself and was heartened by the relationship between Gerty and Sam. Gerty, was a great example of how possibly machines can and could in the future go beyond their pre-installed limitations.Ultimately there was one area where I did feel a little disappointed in Moon. That was the lack of a more significant discussion or drawing in of the average viewer into the deeper issues of what it means to be human or the dangers of the gross unethical misuse of Science by future corporations. I really wanted it to take such themes to another level. However, perhaps this was a wise decision and a risk best avoided, as had it been done it could've ended up been too overstated and too spelt out for someone like myself. Always a fine line to tread. Anyway, this did not however, I feel detract from its main source of pleasure.Overall, after watching Moon, I really felt that I had been taken on quite a personal journey. Sam Rockwell I think carried and performed really well in this movie and Duncan Jones' distinct direction and personal touch shows he is one to keep an eye out for the future!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK at the outset let me tell you that i'm not a great fan of Sci fi movies. I'm the kind of guy who finds series like Star Wars and Harry Potter utterly boring. Having said that i must say this movie impressed me all the more.Although the movie was made on a shoe-string budget, it's technically perfect. The special effects are convincing and the acting though underplayed, is superb.The cast of characters though not many is brilliantly chosen. Sam Rockwell(Sam Bell) has acted the part of the miner, whose very existence is questionable, to perfection. So does Robin Chalk, the guy who smells a rat. The unemotional voice of Kevin Spacey fits GERTY the robot like a glove. The use of smileys on its screen is exceptional, if not mildly depressing. It offers us a kind of window into into how our lives will be when robots are introduced en masse into our lives. Imagine a robot with a smiley on the screen in place of an actual smiling human, depressing, isn't it? But the movie is significant as it deals with two technologies that have tremendous potential for use as well as misuse. More so because these two are on the verge of becoming science fact in the near future. One is human cloning and the other is fusion reactors running on Helium 3, an element that is very rare in the Earth's soil but is abundant on the moon. In fact there is currently a project called ITER that is building a fusion reactor. While human cloning faces ethical and moral hurdles and the very real prospect of being misused by corporations, Helium mines on the moon faces ones of the technical nature.This movie is not for those who expect edge of the seat thrilling stuff or the muscular hero beating and blasting the bejesus out of aliens sort of stuff. It's the type of movie that provides you things to cogitate about. Ergo, it demands an intent an patient viewing.Nevertheless, I rate it 7 as the first half an hour was kind of dull. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Made Science Fiction Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Duncan Jones has created a science-fiction movie that doesn't bask in visual effects and that puts action aside to meditate on human nature. Like Stanley Kubrick, of whom he's an aesthetic heir, the centre of his story is Mankind. I applaud the realism of the settings and costumes, the way he captured the isolation and tedium of the astronaut life. And I watched in awe the way he captured the craters of the moon, the star-filled skies and the distant Earth. From a technical and visual perspective, this is one of the most gorgeous explorations of life in space since 2001: A Space Odyssey.Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, an astronaut living on a Moon mining base. His three-year contract is about to end and he longs to return to his wife Tess and daughter Eve. His only company has been the patient and benign computer GERTY (a friendly version of HAL). But it's when he's about to leave that he starts seeing things and his existence on the base comes into questioning.Without wishing to give much away, I can only saw the movie starts addressing questions of memory, reality and individuality. Although I expected a more metaphysical story, Moon's story is actually very mundane, I'd even say crude. The story itself ended being my least favourite aspect of the movie. At times I found myself guessing whole scenes minutes before they happened, which does not bode well for a movie built on mystery.What I loved was Rockwell's performance, Kevin Spacey's voice as GERTY, the sets and costumes, the cinematography, and especially Clint Mansell's beautiful score. Duncan Jones has shown a lot of potential in Moon and I don't doubt in a few years he'll grow to become a great filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, Gepetto, Wake Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Extremely interesting first feature from writer/director Duncan Jones (son of David Bowie). The issue I often have with sci-fi is its lack of humanity. Funny to me that this one is loaded with humanity and emotions and psyche, yet it is centered around human cloning! Sam Rockwell is outstanding as the poor guy "sentenced" to 3 years of isolation on the other side of the moon in order to deliver energy back to earth. Of course, we (and he) find out that Sam is actually programmed to last 3 years before being disposed of and replaced by a new Sam.Prefer not to discuss any more about the film than that, but will say it does a very good job of examining isolation and a full spectrum of other human emotions ... not to mention the scientific possibilities that may be on the horizon. Lastly, the voice of GERTY is provided by Kevin Spacey. There aren't too many other voices that would give me LESS confidence that things are going to be alright!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't agree that this one was like Alien or even 2001, although 2001 is the closest. The danger/suspense comes from within, even though it is precipitated by dastardly Big Company men on earth.So here it is. You have done your job for a mining company on the moon for three long years - alone - and you are feeling a little nuts. You see things that aren't there. Then one day, 14 days before your scheduled return to earth, you see yourself, only a few years younger and fitter. What is going on? That's the mystery. It's not Hal - that is, Gertie - the computer. It's not an alien waiting to rip open your chest. It's everything you thought was real - but now can't be real. Because there are two of you.What's fun about this movie is it's fast, confusing pace, allowing viewers to dissect it almost endlessly during a pizza dinner following the show. No fancy visuals or fake monsters. Just reality peeling back more and more unsavory layers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of "Moon"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>UK Director Duncan Jones makes his debut with "Moon", the story of a man who experiences a personal crisis as he nears the end of a three-year solitary stint mining helium-3 on the far side of the Earth's moon. That's about all I can say about the plot without spoiling anything, other than the fact that it is very interesting, original, and, even at times, emotional. Sam Rockwell gives a very affecting performance as Sam Bell, the troubled astronaut minor, and Kevin Spacey gives a very memorable performance as the voice of Bell's robot companion GERTY. In terms of the script, I felt that it was fairly well written - The dialogue was engaging and realistic. The special effects are very impressive, considering that this movie only had a 5 million dollar budget. Another aspect that I found to be fairly unique was the soundtrack. At the climax of this film I found myself whistling the movie's main theme song - something that is hard to get me to do. In the end, I feel that "Moon" is a worthy addition into the "Hard Sci-Fi" genre. It kept me interested throughout the film and even forced me ponder it's many convoluted ideas after it was over. Pretty cool stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingenious science fiction offering, packed with thought-provoking ideas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a movie genre, science fiction seems over the past ten years to have returned to the standard B-movie approach which involves good guys and aliens blasting the hell out of each other with lasers. More philosophical and thought-provoking science fiction has been harder to come by. "Moon" - Duncan Jones's debut feature which premiered to considerable acclaim at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival - is a wonderfully clever sci-fi story, featuring a remarkable performance by Sam Rockwell. It takes elements of "2001: A Space Odyssey", "Solyaris" and "Silent Running", and weaves them into its own uniquely fascinating story of isolation, madness and human exploitation.Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is the lone worker at a moon base called Sarang, where he monitors and occasionally repairs giant harvesting machines. The machines are gathering helium-3, which provides Earth with energy. Sam is in the final fortnight of a three year contract, and is desperate to get back to his wife and child on Earth. Hardly surprising, since his only companion during three years at the base has been a robot named GERTY (voice of Kevin Spacey). Worse still, a communications malfunction means that Sam has only been able to send and receive pre-recorded messages to his family ? live chats have not been possible. Whilst out on the moon's surface driving a rover to one of the giant harvesters, Sam accidentally crashes the vehicle. He comes round back at the base and is told by GERTY that he's had an accident? but when he goes out to the crash site to investigate further, he finds a body still in the wreckage. His own body! Now there are two Sam Bells on the moon and neither is sure which of them is real. Gradually the two Sams piece together the answers and learn that they are victims of a shameful conspiracy which will drive them to the edge of sanity?Jones not only directed but conceived the original story, with the final script being penned by Nathan Parker. They deserve credit for creating such an engrossing, thought-provoking story and filming it so inventively. Rockwell's performance as the multiple "Sam Bells" is absolutely superb. It's no exaggeration to say the film relies on him immensely ? it wouldn't work were it not for his believability in the role. Kevin Spacey's vocal work as GERTY is also noteworthy, evoking memories of Douglas Rains' chilling voice-only performance as HAL in "2001: A Space Odyssey". Clint Mansell's score has a haunting, deliberately repetitive rhythm which suits the story perfectly. There are, perhaps inevitably, moments where the film has a slow-moving quietness about it (how else could Sam's loneliness and tedium be conveyed?) but on the whole this is an impressive movie and one which I think will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moon is a recent, comparatively low budget, independent science fiction film set in the not too distant future about a man whose job it is to mine the fuel helium 3 on the moon. His only companion is the intelligent robot GERTY (who bares a striking resemblance to HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey). However it soon transpires that even on the moon not all is as it seems. I don't want to spoil it too much for you, but suffice it to say he is definitely not alone.The writing in Moon is good, the character(s) have depth and the dialogue is spot on. There are many twists and turns along the way and it raises quite a few moral issues.The acting is also superb. Sam Rockwell plays the protagonist and he is very believable, especially as he (Spoilers) spends most of the film acting against himself which is very hard to pull off convincingly. Kevin Spacey is also good as the voice of GERTY.Moon was the directorial debut for Duncan Jones and he did a fantastic job. The film has a tense atmosphere throughout. The cinematography is amazing, especially the space shots. The editing is a bit bitty at times, but the film remains easy to follow.This is a brilliant film, it is nice to see the science fiction genre can still deliver something original. The fact that it had a low budget and it is the director's first feature film only make it more impressive. I can definitely recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to write a review without giving away too much as to not spoil your surprise or enjoyment, but just watch the trailer and you will get the basic premise of the film but luckily it doesn't show you everything that will ruin the overall pleasure.The film starts us off with stock footage telling us that the Earths natural resources are pretty much used up and more environmentally friendly sources of energy can be found on the moon. This is where majority of the film takes place.Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), is nearing his 3 year stint on the moon with only Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) as his reliable and only companion, he is most certainly looking forward to going home, but not everything goes according to plan. After 3 years of isolation and no contact with the outside world (he only receives delayed video transmission from Earth via satellite link) he begins to see things (an unknown woman on the base) and notices minor glitches in video playback and archive footage of himself he doesn't remember recording. When one of the mining vehicles stalls, Sam goes out to investigate only to find his hallucination reappearing on the surface of the moon which causes him to crash.When he wakes up in the infirmary, he has no recollection of the crash. This is when the real mystery and marvel of the film begins The recovered Sam notices that the mining vehicle is still not in proper working order but Gerty denies him access to go outside. When Sam manages to convince Gerty to let him check it out, he comes across an abandoned lunar vehicle next to one of the mining vehicle and finds an unconscious body. "His" unconscious body....This film is outstanding and the performance by Sam Rockwell is superb (he was criminally denied a nod for best actor). The main driving force in the film, is that Sam is able to portray himself as two different characters and the amount of sadness and loneliness he displays when he is alone is a complete contrast to the anger, frustration and confusion that he shows as the 2nd Sam Bell. The supporting vocals from Kevin Spacey also provides the film more of the feeling of isolation and alienation. Its all done very monotonous way but he does convey human emotions via emoticon.Little touches within the film are marvellous and subtle. The use of Chesney Hawkes "The One and Only" is so ironic and apt used that it is the probably only time I would ever tolerate his music. The score as well is very haunting and very effective. Clint Mansell (Requiem For a Dream) once again creates the perfect ambient and mood.We see the influences worn clearly on its sleeve. The sets and designs are very in keeping with other sci-fi classic. White minimalistic interiors (2001, Alien) and a computer called Gerty who is very HAL-like (also 2001) and vast emptiness of space. It's very much a throwback to old 70s and early 80s sci-fi films. Scenes are reminiscent of films like Silent Running and Outlands. Films like these are not always about alien invasions and this is one that questions, why are we here and who are we really....The general themes on what makes us humans and what is humanity are very apparent and asks you questions on what really makes us who we are. Is it our ability to dream, think, desire and to feel... The portrayal of these human qualities by Sam Rockwell gives the film its heart and soul. We are all rooting for him to make it home because of the suffering and desire to see "his" loved ones is so overwhelming. We start off with a man waiting to go home only for it to turn out to be a film about identity.It is an intelligent and very thoughtful piece of science fiction with a deeply affecting performance from Sam Rockwell. With no other major actor (bar Kevin Spaceys voice and video footage via satellite) it is a wonderful and mesmerising display of skill and nuances from Sam Rockwell that even if you don't enjoy sci-fi movies you have to tip your hat in acknowledgement of his "one" man show.if you like my review please visit my blog http://fsfilm.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sci-fi ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to popular belief that it's impossible to make a good sci-fi movie without good cash aid, Duncan Jones creates his extraordinary story having only 5 million in his pocket. While Hollywood tries to show something technically advanced to surprise people, Duncan Jones just made a true masterpiece, without any reinvent the wheel, by using tricks that peculiar to the real masters of movie creating. Tactically omitted attempts to impress spectator by dint of bright and expensive special effects, creators switched on the viewer on the other significant aspects of that film, such as an atmosphere and the script.First and foremost I'd like to take a glance at the script. The plot has been madden looking over Stanislav Lem's (famouse Polish sci-fi writer) shoulder. If you ever red The Star Diaries and Memoirs of a Space Traveller, you'll certainly like the script in the ''Moon''. The story is about lonely miner Sam who has got a three year business contract on Moon. Towards the end of the contract, strange things start to occur on the station, and only elaborate Sam's investigation may shed the light on the truth. After figuring out of the situating Sam faced a conspiracy. What kind of conspiracy he deals with I won't tell just to not ruin your impressions about the plot.Now let's talk about atmosphere. A lot of small diversions showing Sam's way of life, greatly detailed and neat mining station, beautifully illustrated Moon landscapes and competently chosen music in the post-rock genre, creates an accurate picture which is ideally fits to the spectator's stare. Absence of other people except Sam makes to feel lonely too, and plot tensions in the second half permanently sustain deep empathy feeling for the main character. Though in the middle of the film I already had couple of assumptions about the plot clue, I didn't know exactly what the punch line till the end is. That's what I just call amazing.In additional I should notice eccentric acting of Sam Rockwell, he's one of my favorite actor cos of his person's variety. He's capable to play almost everyone, remember ''The Choke'', ''The Green Mile'', ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' and dozens more works! Every role he had is completely opposite to each other. Pity that this actor and his potential seriously underestimated by Hollywood. And he quite rarely gets the main roles in outstanding movies.The result obtained here was great, I have no doubt that director reached desirable goal. And the only one reason I'm claiming that because of perfect combination of every element in the film. I just don't know what could be added here more. I hope further Duncan Jones's works will have the same charm. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought provoking and engrossing, but lacks emotional punch and tension.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something subtly wrong with "Moon" that stops it from being a great film (though it's still a really good one). In many ways it's a beautiful piece of movie making - thought provoking, finely shot and engrossing. Sam Rockwell is puts in a tour-de-force performance and the interactions between him and his mirror self are flawlessly executed. As the credits rolled I was left thinking "I should have really LOVED that, but instead I just kinda enjoyed it instead." What went wrong? I think somehow the film lacks an emotional punch and a sense of building tension. The events that take place call for a multitude of deep and powerful emotions - isolation, terror, confusion, sadness, excitement and finally joy - yet it fails to really take you to these places. It borrows (in a good way) from other movies that unfortunately *did* get those target emotions right (eg. 2001, Silent Running, Solaris, Gattaca, and Blade Runner) so you always have this comparison field in your head as you are watching it. It's not as lonely as 2001, not as touching as Blade Runner, not as haunting as Solaris, not as joyous as Gattaca, for example. The problem lies in part with the screenplay, which is a little too placid for its own good, and in part with the directing - which reaches for Kubrick but never quite gets there.But enough focusing on the negative because I don't want to give a skewed opinion of the movie. All told, Moon was an exceptionally well done sci-fi movie that should be seen by all lovers of the genre. It may not excite or punch you in the gut like you'll wish it had, but it gets REAL close. And it's still a refreshingly intelligent and peaceful movie in a field awash with lesser quality work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie in itself is very well done, especially considering the budget for the film. Moreover I applaud Duncan Jones for making such a well thought through movie, as his debut. The spoiler is only in the last paragraph of this review.The actors have played their roles very convincingly, and have managed to convene the emotions and atmosphere very well to the viewer. Overall the performance is great. Kevin Spacey has a great voice as Gerty, however it might be a minor problem for those for who his voice is way too familiar.The special effects and music were also very well done, thanks to Duncan Jone's background in low budget special effects from the advertising industry. This created a very good feel for the film.The story is well developed and is very intriguing, thought provoking and generally interesting with a few good twists. One is challenged to question technological development, global warming, the progress of the human race, moral issue and so on.But, and its not a small but, its more like a HUGE BUT! (*** HERE COMES THE SPOILER, PLEASE DO NOT CONTINUE IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO SPOILERS ***) If the human race has gone so far as to be able to make very good clones, artificial intelligence, harvest on the moon etc. Then why on earth do they need clones/humans on the moon in the first place? The only thing they would be good for is for making mistakes (As the movie shows so very well), wouldn't it be easier to just have the whole process automated? Humans are generally very prone to make mistakes, unreliable, need a lot of resources, sleep 6 hours a day, don't do their work effectively, etc. So why would they have them there? This was a major problem in my perspective and forced me to give this movie a 7 instead of the 8.5 that it deserves on many other aspects. Great movie overall though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great sci-fi movie. Immersive and moving.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a sci-fi fun, as i am, this was, behind Avatar, the best sci-fi of the 2009 (i should say one of the best the latest years or also i could say one between the best of all time).There are not great effects or cgi in here, it didn't need any. But the ones used match perfectly the place and the needs. I liked everything of this movie, the plot, the direction, the superb acting of Sam Rockwell, the atmosphere, also the music was so great (i grabbed the Clint Mansell main theme immediately). It was exceptional as a single actor entertained the whole movie, and let me felt in his same shoes.Not less i was deeply moved about the story. This can be called sci-fi but it's also almost a far future possible situation. From this movie on I wrote down the name of the emerging director Duncan Jones and waited his next movie. He did "Source Code" then, that was not good as this one but another very well made sci-fi movie anyway. So I'm looking ahead for his next opera.This is a moving, mystery drama overall. A mature one. Perfectly done in every aspect. A masterpiece, and not just in its own genre, to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was really good to say the least.I couldn't decide what was real at times which I love in movies. Another thing that I thought about a movie that earn a 10 in my book is that it had a really good soundtrack that seemed to know what to play at the right moment, rather if it be something funny or sad, it was on time the whole entire movie which was a plus. This would be an excellent movie to add to your science fiction collection. I would recommended this movie to my friends (and I usually do) and I know they will enjoy as did I. Best supporting robotic actor I'd say too, at times you can't tell about him, which kept me on edge. It's hard to say any more about this without leaving a spoiler so I'll just say that you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moon is a fascinating, ingenious, and original sci-fi/fantasy film by first-time (full-length) director, Duncan Jones.It is another small, sly, well-made sci-fi flick like Primer; but it is more stylish and polished like the equally-brainy Gattaca.Sam Rockwell (Charlie's Angels, Matchstick Men, Iron Man 2) delivers a commanding performance as the lone astronaut-miner on the moon -- he is excellent here and was easily one of the better of 2009 (ahem, way to look the other way Academy!!). Kevin Spacey (American Beauty, Se7en, The Usual Suspects) is soothing as the voice of GERTY (Moon's HAL 9000).Moon is nearly perfect with what it sets out to achieve. Just like it's titular celestial object, Moon may be small but it isn't slight -- it is a cerebrally beguiling lunar confection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Questions to ponder.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Science fiction is invariably a fairy tale nowadays. You can probably connect with a handful of movies showing a fictional future. Most just serve to entertain with cheap visual thrills. Moon is an exception to this degradation of scientific imagination in our modern day script writing. Instead of pondering over the power levels of imaginary "cores" and flashy laser weaponry, this movie strives to ask difficult questions from the audience. Questions that will leave you with no clear answers long after you have seen, dissected and digested the movie. Script is remarkably simple and there are no "big" secrets except one, which is revealed around the middle. The rest of the story is what gets the gray cells all juiced up. Instead of delivering a complicated plot, the movie delivers a complicated premise.Soundtrack is excellently suited to the pace and texture of the story telling. Visuals are clean and precise, and most importantly believable - without being boring. The dialogs are also well - real ! No flamboyance or theater grade facial mannerisms here. Just plane and simple acting, done in a most convincing manner. Rockwell is a gem.A well laid out story which tries to tickle our moral brain maps, this movie is a must watch for hard science fiction fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Bell has a three year contract to work for Lunar Industries. For the contract's entire duration, he is the sole employee based at their lunar station. His primary job responsibility is to harvest and periodically rocket back to Earth supplies of helium-3, the current clean and abundant fuel used on Earth. There is no direct communication link available between the lunar station and Earth, so his only direct real-time interaction is with GERTY, the intelligent computer whose function is to attend to his day to day needs. With such little human contact and all of it indirect, he feels that three years is far too long to be so isolated; he knows he is beginning to hallucinate as the end of his three years approaches. All he wants is to return to Earth to be with his wife Tess and their infant daughter Eve, who was born just prior to his leaving for this job. With two weeks to go, he gets into an accident at one of the mechanical harvesters and is rendered unconscious. Injured, he awakens back at the station in the infirmary, he assumes assisted by GERTY. GERTY tells him that a rescue team named Eliza will come to the station to clean up the aftermath of the accident. After his recuperation, he takes an unauthorized trip back to the broken harvester, where he makes an unexpected discovery. Because of his find, he begins to doubt his sanity, then his true identity, then the company and GERTY's willingness to do what is best for him. Because of his resulting beliefs, his sole mission becomes how to get back to Earth on his own. I Never Took Sam Rockwell Seriously(Prior To Galaxy Quest &amp; Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy) Until I Saw This. A True Moving Sci-Fi &amp; It Gives A Sort Of Message: "You Can't Take Advantage Of Anyone To Be Slaves They Are Human &amp; Have Feelings"(Even Though They Are Not Human They're Clones But You Get What I'm Trying To Say).

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is that rare breed of film that seamlessly weaves existential introspection with thrilling story-telling resulting in the most satisfying and touching of film going experiences. It is a tour de force of technical achievement from the set design to the acting to the score to the directing.The film tells the fascinating story of Sam Bell (Rockwell) who when coming to the end of a three year stint as the sole crew member on a moon base encounters a duplicate of himself. This encounter sets the scene for some mind-bending self-reflection and a heartfelt bonding between the two men as they not only discover who they are but that their lives are in danger. In telling this story, Jones constantly plays with the audience's expectations exploiting their knowledge of film convention in general and science fiction convention in particular so that the narrative is kept fresh and unpredictable and the audience kept on their toes.Like all great science fiction films Moon looks great. The production design is truly excellent with more than a few nods to 2001: A Space Odyssey, while the visual effects are simple but immaculate. The magnificent Moonscapes against which the exterior action takes place are nothing short of sumptuous. Moon is a testament to the idea that the clever and restrained use of visual effects that is necessitated by an independent budget can produce a quality far beyond that of even the most expensive blockbusters. Like 2001 and Blade Runner before it Moon uses its look and visual effects not to impress the audience in a vacuous attempt to show off but as a subtext for the story. This only heightens the visual experience and gives the film's look a life of its own.The script is tight and economical with not a word of dialogue out of place or wasted. Given that the film only stars one actor and that loneliness is an important theme there are extended periods where no words are spoken. In such circumstances score can become critical and the audience will not be disappointed as Clint Mansell's unforgettable music carries you throughout the film colouring every scene with a pervading sense of mystery. Indeed, his score is so subtly haunting that you continue to 'hear' it even when it's not there.At the centre of this film is Sam Rockwell's powerhouse performance which is possibly the most impressive piece of acting since Pachino's portrayal of Michael Corleone. As with that latter performance, Rockwell takes on the mammoth task of portraying two different versions of the same character and he succeeds so wonderfully that at times you feel you could be looking at two different actors. Of course the real trick was in playing the character differently enough to account for the personality changing over time but similarly enough to reinforce the point that they're the same person. And it is in pulling off this trick that Rockwell lays the groundwork for some of the most unique and profoundly touching acting in modern film history as the two Sam Bell's grow past their initial suspicion and resentment of each other to the point where they become bound by genuine compassion and concern for each other. For me, this is the punctuating performance in this maverick actor's career and one that confirms him as the standout actor of his generation.Sam Bell's AI companion Gerty is superbly brought to life through a combination of Kevin Spacey's perfectly measured vocal performance and an incredibly innovative conception of robot-human interface where Spacey's monotone voice becomes emotionally embellished through the use of emoticons. Though the existential relationship between the two Sams is the heart and soul of this film, the three-way interaction between Rockwell, Spacey's voice, and the physical robot is at times equally touching and this is never better realised than in the moment when Gerty breaks protocol to tell Sam the truth.Ultimately it is the poignancy of Moon that makes it so deeply brilliant and that poignancy is drawn from the story through the intuitive combination of Rockwell's searing performance and Jones' profound and visionary direction. In one standout scene this perfect harmony between the two and their respective crafts is realised as Bell sits in his rover talking to his daughter who is back on Earth. As Bell begins to emotionally crumble before our eyes Jones cuts to an exterior shot, which slowly pans behind the rover and the more distant blue sphere of the earth. This is perhaps one of the most beautiful and haunting scenes in the history of cinema.Duncan Jones' Moon is the best debut since Scorsese maybe even since Welles. It is the best science fiction film since Bladerunner maybe even since 2001: A Space Odyssey. The more often I see this film the higher it rises in my estimation. In fact, Moon might just be one of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

Sam Rockwell isn't sure whether to play it for laughs or not, leaving us with a performance that Simon Pegg would have been annoyed to not to have been considered for.I was left confused over why most of the events and actions occurred due to the complete illogicality of Rockwells' behaviour and ridiculous premise. Although not as perplexing as the high rating this film has garnered.Despite all the misguided and gushing raves this film has received, it seems to have achieved the box office returns it deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't understand all the positive reviews here. I came here at about 2/3 of the way through to see if anyone else thought it was a major stinker, but was surprised to see almost nothing under 8 stars. I didn't get anything even remotely philosophical about it, it's just some lonely guy slowly rotting (from...radiation? never mentioned), with a couple of hallucinations that crop up at the beginning but are never heard from again. He and the buddy hardly talk at all, no deep discussions, just some general snottiness, some collaboration, and then the end. Big wow.So many inconsistencies: if he was still alive in the vehicle, wouldn't medical monitoring have picked that up? All that massive infrastructure, and no auto-tow-truck bot to go pull the vehicle out of the dust? And why an Indiana Jones warehouse hallway of cells? Why did the vehicle have brake lights? How would a vehicle headed for earth, designed to hold solid objects possibly not kill a man? Why would its temperature be expected to remain below lethal, why would it be expected to not hit so hard as to kill anyone inside? And when he climbed in, you could see the walls wobble like they were cardboard. And on and on. Sorry, I'm not being picky, but these things just jump right out at me. And only in one shot near the end did we see anything like the reduced gravity on the moon; when the vehicle moved, the object on the back swung along merrily.And hey, let's just make all the inside door corners 45 degrees, that way we'll all know it's the future. So lazy.Usually any movie reviewed on here, no matter how awful, will have a bunch of people going OMG best thing ever, but there are always at least a few people who can smell a stinker. For some reason everyone seems to think it's all that, and I really really disagree. I rarely want to check out of a movie before the end; wish I had never watched this at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull and implausible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The screenplay for "Moon" plays out like a college student's first draft of a film script - where they make the mistake of thinking that they're writing a deep psychological piece by pitting a man's clone against himself. (Episodes of the old Star Trek handled this concept with far more aplomb, and in only one hour.) College student screenwriters also often make the classic error of believing that it's easier to write a script with only a few characters (in this case, just one), when in fact it is much harder. The truth is, two identical personalities stuck in a room is just as boring as it sounds, Sam Rockwell's game try aside. What this movie desperately needed was a lead character who was actually interesting, and interesting dialogue for him to say.Then there's the general implausibility of having a large army of clones developed and waiting to service a single space mining operation... wouldn't it just be easier and cheaper to AUTOMATE the whole base and not force a human (or clone) to run the place? (If Gertie was competent enough to take care of the dozens of sleeping clones in the basement, wouldn't he, or some other machines like him, be competent enough to manage the mining operation?) That's just a basic failure of Science Fiction Screen writing 101.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark side of Moon left me cold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't really a Sci Fi film. More of a psychological thriller with an absence of thrill. Not exactly the film I eagerly anticipated. Great set up, great cast, so much unfulfilled potential. From the word go I felt uneasy about this flick. The set up lacked any credibility. A multi billion dollar Helium 3 mining operation on the moon manned by just one person. Come on! Hadn't the filmmakers heard of the Apollo Missions? NASA sent three astronauts on short trips there. You seriously telling me that investors who have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into this long term operation wouldn't have provisioned for at least half a dozen employees. Just doesn't make logical sense. I also found it jarring that Sam Bell wasn't in constant contact with his bosses back home. Realistically he would be checking in with them like clockwork. And if there was a communication problem it would be a top priority to fix it, wouldn't it? I also had other problems with this film. When our protagonist first came in contract with himself I assumed he was suffering a mental breakdown. Then the filmmakers persisted with the plot line that he was indeed cohabitating the base with his clone. Why send other employees there when you can manufacture a new human from scratch? Yeah right. Makes sense to me. Or then again maybe he was indeed delusional? At that point I couldn't give a rats. I didn't care about our lead character. I was more concerned with the time I'd wasted watching this pretentious drivel. I'm a big fan of both Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey. Got to say that I thought Spacey was totally wasted playing the voice of GERTY, a poor man's HAL if ever there was one. Could have had Spacey's next door neighbour play the role and it wouldn't have made any difference. And those cheesy smiley faces on GERTY. Were they trying to make the computer prop look as cheap as possible? This film was about as gripping as one of those bulky space suit gloves. I'm a big Sci Fi fan. This film could just as easily been set in the South Pole. The Sci Fi element is peripheral to the story. I felt Silent Running was a much better exploration of the dilemmas faced by man stuck in the void of space. I can not work out why this film has attracted so much kudos. By all means judge it for yourselves but a word of advice, keep the fast forward button handy. This film's a sleeper, in the ZZZZZZ sense.</fullReview>

It's very rare that such a magnificent space film will hit the box office, unless it has large transforming robots or ridiculous huge budget special effects or visual effects or terrible casting. This film hits everything dead on, and then goes above and beyond. They clearly shot for the stars here, and made a pit stop at the moon, only to soar further and further. I really love how drab and dry Kevin Spacey's voice comes off. It really personifies a modern version of HAL, minus all the odd weird 'emotion' that HAL 9000 had.

		<shortDescription>Moon - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sci-fi movies usually consists of lots of CGI and special effects, big scenery with explosions and lasers. In Duncan Jonse's low-budget 'Moon' the focus is more on the story rather than the visual aspect, even though the cinematography captures and delivers the director's intention with glorious fashion. Jonse has succeeded to touch on multiple subjects and emotions that will leave you wondering with moral conflicts. Jones has manage to deliver a thought-provocative film that plays a homage to old sci-fi movies such as Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and Riddly Scott's 'Alien'. 'Moon' tells the story of Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), the only astronaut who works in a lunar mining base extracting Helium-3 from the moon's surface to be sent back to Earth to fuel the planet, a new cleaner solution to Earth's power problems.Sam's isolated three-year mission is about to come to an end and he can't wait to return to Earth to see his wife Tess and daughter Eve. His only company throughout this time period has been GERTY, the base's AI robot (voice by Kevin Spacey) and kind of Sam's personal assistant and best friend. Sadly, the last days are proving to be the worst, and after experiencing a bizarre encounter (which I wont get into details) both Sam and the audience are left questioning whether it is all really happening or is it inside Sam's mind. Sam Rockwell delivers an outstanding performance in this one-man-show and proves he is capable of playing such role. the constant flashbacks Sam has had to his life on earth and his whole approach to the situation were, in my opinion, very human-like. This film stretches the boundary between sci-fi and art and redefines the words 'isolation' and 'lonely',I would strongly recommend every sci-fi lover, every drama-lover and even every Charlie Kaufman-lover to see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating and thrilling, if occasionally slow-moving...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can only think of two movies which feature one main character for the majority of the film ? "Moon" and "Gravity". The surface parallels between them are surprisingly numerous. Both place their solitary character in space, with only the voice of a computer/mission control helping them for the most part, and both are ultimately trying to get back to Earth. From here on, however, the two films are very different. Rather than continue to compare them, I will merely focus on what "Moon", the directorial debut for Duncan Jones, does well.It would be impossible to talk about the film without spending a large amount of time on Sam Rockwell. Rockwell shows a great amount of depth in his portrayal of Sam Bell, the only man working on a moon base, and it is this performance which keeps the movie interesting throughout its relatively short running time. It's a film with endless twists and turns, constantly keeping you guessing what's going to happen next, and often, what's happening now. This strength is also occasionally the movie's greatest flaw, as there are many moments where confusion rather than interest are produced in the audience.The film successfully continues and builds on many classic sci-fi tropes, especially with some of the space-ship visuals and the voice of Kevin Spacey as GERTY harking back to 2001 and HAL. Spacey's voice has the perfect quality for a menacing computer, and by using more than just computerised monotone, he constantly has you guessing whether he is friend or foe to Bell. The minimalistic space ship design makes for a great backdrop, as does the exterior lunar landscape, which looks surprisingly good despite the film's low budget. Clint Mansell's score for the film is another great strength, using a combination of minimalism and electronic sounds to echo the film's mystery and its setting.Ultimately, the film is fascinating and thrilling, if occasionally slow-moving, and a welcome addition to the low-budget sci-fi canon. It shows great talent from Duncan Jones and, having seen the superior "Source Code", it suggests that even better things are yet to come from him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The alien within</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Moon" is an intense little movie that will probably knock around inside your brain for a while. Sam Rockwell, in the performance(s) of his career, plays a technician who has spent three years working in isolation on a moon base. As his time at the base nears its end, he begins to discover some inconsistencies in what he's been led to believe by the energy company that employs him, and he begins to doubt his very existence, along with his memories of life on Earth. Kevin Spacey supplies the voice of Gerty, an ambiguously helpful computer (and a direct descendant of HAL, from "2001: A Space Odyssey"). Produced by Trudie Styler (Sting's wife) and directed by Duncan Jones (David Bowie's son), "Moon" is a sharp, smart, and understated film that delivers a scathing message about our willingness to sacrifice humanity in the name of efficiency.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sci-fi triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is on a 3 year contract on a moon base overseeing the extraction of Hel3, a primary energy source on Earth. Accompanied only by GERTY (voice of Kevin Spacey), a robot-assistant, he has just two weeks to the end of the contract. Missing his wife and 3-year old child Eve he is counting the days. The stay has taken its toll on Sam - he has hallucinations and he physical form has deteriorated. And thats as far as I'll go with the plot - it is best to experience the rest yourself.This classical in feel sci-fi movie is a pure gem amongst the overflow of trash like Star Trek: The Beginning, Terminator 4 or Transformers. Going back to the roots it focuses on the human condition without unnecessary action, chases and ridiculous plot twists. It may not be very cerebral, but it is definitely thoughtful and intelligent. It may not be breakthrough in any sense, but this movie will be remembered in years to come. An instant classic.Sam Rockwell has the opportunity to play the defining role of his career. If he never manages to get a second such good role this movie will always be evidence of just how great an actor he actually is. He caught me be surprise, but his screen presence was one of the prime moments of cinema this year.Kudos to the director. I had small issues with the ending and some minor plot solutions, but otherwise a deserved standing ovation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A budget film trip to the moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Duncan Jones has delivered a real little sci-fi gem here. With a tiny budget he manages to get us to the moon, where a solitary Sam Rockwell is almost at the end of a three-year contract supervising an automated Helium mining operation. Sam has a HAL-like computer looking after him, but after an accident outside in a moon rover, HAL starts acting ? well ? protective. Sam is then confronted with - well ? himself. Sam 2 is not a vision, unlike the apparitions in "Solaris" which are the product of an alien intelligence, and the two Sams have to come to an accommodation before a "rescue" mission arrives. The lunar mining base is hi-tech but shabby, in the way than mining camps tend to be. Gerty the computer which is attached but movable is particularly battered. Voiced in sepulchral tones by Kevin Spacey, Gerty has some of the menace of HAL from "2001", but in the end follows Asimov's first law of Robotics ? a robot shall not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Without giving the plot away, it is evident early on that Sam 2 is a clone. He is also undoubtedly human ? a clone is after all an identical twin born at a different time. Sam 2, though, is obviously programmed to replace Sam 1. How then should Sam 1 act? This situation makes for an interesting resolution. In a beautifully judged performance Sam Rockwell does a great job of his everyman in space role. We feel his loneliness and his longings. We also feel his fear, when it becomes clear that something is wrong, without any aliens or other monsters being present (the villains turn out to be home-grown). Duncan Jones makes good use of references to other great sci-fi movies but has added his own take on the "man alone in the universe" situation. It's possible to pick holes in the story (would a mining operation crucial to the Earth's energy needs have only one human supervisor?) but the movie is so well executed you hardly notice. Maybe it's all moondust, but it's a clever piece of work.The science behind the story is sound; Helium-3 the rare helium isotope is both useful in nuclear fusion and more common on the surface of the moon than on Earth - we may well find ourselves using it as a source of energy one day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ooh... here is the new century's equivalent and homage to 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY but only 90minutes in length. Clearly inspired from the 1968 Kubrick film, MOON allows Gen X and Y to have their own look alike complete with ambiguous themes, clunky white/grey sets, and calls to home. I was actually really pleased to see MOON especially with the completely magnetic Sam Rockwell and the overall effect of the film which is to challenge and entertain with some space paradox ideas and melancholy. Kevin Spacey as Gertie - or PAL or even KPAX the talking robot - was a good touch and the eerie and tense atmosphere, especially once the 3 year life of the job is revealed was both compelling and effective. However you must see MOON on a huge screen... to see this Cinerama sized drama in cinema 10 in some shoebox-plex is not doing yourself, your cash or the film any favors. Seek the biggest screen, sit alone, and go on a journey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Moon" (2009) is a brilliantly made movie that manifests on our fears of loneliness and the unknown. This is the best sci-fi movie I have seen in a long time and is one of the best ever made.This movie is about an astronaut, Sam Bell, who is the single human crew member of a Lunar Industries facility on the moon. There is also a computer there to assist him, GERTY. The facility harvests Helium-3 (a very clean energy source and commonly used on Earth in this movie) and sends it back to Earth. Though, near the end of his time on the Moon, Sam is involved in an accident at the harvester and he becomes unconscious. Once is recovers he goes back out to the harvester and makes a shocking discovery which makes him begin to doubt a lot of things.This movie may only have a few characters with only one appearing regularly, but this movie still manages to be very exciting and interesting. "Moon" has a very eerie and creepy feel to it that I haven't seen in many other movies. The music, the computer, the infirmary and the landscape of the moon all contribute to this. The movie is also quite dark and explores themes of loneliness, fear and helplessness.This is a stunning movie and I recommend everyone to go and see it, sci-fi fan or not. This movie may have seen a very quiet and small release in numerous countries but I wouldn't let that fool you - this is a brilliant movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hero Too Annoying To Care About</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After attempting to watch this movie twice, there was a lack of momentum that allowed me to invest myself into it. There certainly is no disrespect for Sam Rockwell, and Kevin Spacey playing the voice of HAL (or equivalent thereof). One thing that is hard to ignore is the low production values, giving this feature length film the feel of an episode of a Sci-Fi TV show. The premise doesn't seem entirely strong for a feature length story. Worst, is that Sam Rockwell playing a clone of himself does not come off as believable. With many films successfully wowing the audience depicting one person as twins (Dead Ringers is just one that comes to mind), it is odd how almost obviously disjointed the two characters are in scenes together. There is no eye contact between the clones, the conversations don't feel natural, even the physical interaction doesn't connect the way it should.I blame the under-ambitious script for lack of gripping drama. I also had a very very hard time buying into a premise that Earth-saving materials were being mined on the moon by just a single guy???? Worse, they hire someone that is unstable (even if he is a clone, why not clone the best and brightest?). The pacing is slow. Both versions of Sam Rockwell's character are just annoying. Neither gain my sympathy as they both bicker and fight. Revelations in the plot that are meant to be showstoppers seem pretty predictable.The mystery I am supposed to care about was too shallow and uninteresting for me to finish watching. I certainly don't think Sam Rockwell is part of the problem, and maybe a better budget would have made this more multi-dimensional. But for what it is, I can't recommend it.</fullReview>

Kevin Spaceys role as Gerty was very well executed as well. Even though it was a robot, you could really feel the emotions it conveyed.As I said in the beginning, the music was superb.

		<shortDescription>Well-crafted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For its first feature, the English Duncan Jones delivers a solid, almost completely behind closed doors movie that puts the emphasis on Sam Rockwell, very well directed and whose excellent performance truly illuminates the film by its accuracy. The plot is relatively simple but executed to perfection and not too long ? it only lasts an 1h30 which becomes increasingly rare these days. The script suggests interesting questions about ethics, and a well thought-out critic of capitalism and what it could bring in a more or less near future.An interesting point regarding Moon is its budget: 5 million dollars. It is very low for a sci-fi movie like that, therefore Jones logically opted for old school FX for most of the illusions. The end result is good, even though one has to admit some shots look really fake. The cinematography on the whole is good but some editing choices are a bit questionable with some bizarrely unnecessary shots or abrupt linking between scenes.Nevertheless, Moon remains a well-crafted movie even though it misses a little something extra, maybe a bit more tension and suspense, which certainly would have made the experience even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping, Extraordinary And Evocative Sci-Fi Film Of Solitary Lunar Worker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Bell is the only technician on lunar base Sarang, nearing the end of a three-year contract. After an accident whilst on patrol in a moon buggy, he wakes up in the base infirmary, unsure of how he got there and suspicious that things are not what they seem ...This is a wonderful one-man science-fiction drama, which is beautifully written, directed and acted, subtly reminiscent of some classic genre films from forty years prior, but more importantly is a unique, extremely original and constantly surprising little story in its own right. It's one of those delicious movies which plants a troubling notion in the mind of the protagonist (and viewer), and when that fear is realised the effect is heartbreaking. It's a fantastical premise which never seems anything less than plausible, thanks to the bravura performance from Rockwell, who is simply astounding. The hardest thing for any actor is the absence of others to play against and he handles this with consummate skill. Like the best movies, on one level it's a gripping story where we wonder what will happen next, but underneath this it is so much more as Sam confronts fundamental truths about what it means to be alive. Jones is something of a revelation for me; in my opinion his direction is near flawless. The film is exquisite to look at, gripping in its suspense, profound in its scope, smooth and unhurried, atmospheric and stylish, layered with metaphors, serious in its themes but also wryly amusing by turns. He clearly has a love of the genre, as the picture reminds us of 2001: A Space Odyssey visually, Silent Running plot wise, and THX 1138 thematically, but his classic objective visual style is superb and his movie is all his own. Despite being made on a minuscule budget every scene looks sensationally authentic in beautiful outer-space Panavision, and the editing is modest and careful, never falling into the trap of cutting too much but simply letting the sets and the shots speak for themselves. Equally terrific is Spacey as the voice of Gerty, the computer, whose tones blend mellifluous, bland and disquieting together, developing a charming and surprising character from literally nothing. The visual effects are superb and Clint Mansell's music is a fabulously evocative series of deep piano chords, percussion and industrial sound which fits the visuals like a glove. I'm a die hard sci-fi fan and in my view this is the best such movie for ten years, both in terms of its look and its scope. It may only be a slight story, but I really can't think of any faults with it and that's pretty magical. Trivia - Jones is the son of rock legend David Bowie and producer Trudie Styler is the wife of rock legend Sting, neither of whom had any connection with the movie. A great modern-day science-fiction classic and, like John Carpenter's Dark Star, one of the most impressive directorial debuts I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film won the BAFTA for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer for debuting filmmaker Duncan Jones, son of David Bowie (he was formerly named Zowie), as far as I know this was one of those surprise hit movies, and I wanted to see it. Basically Sam Bell (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind's Sam Rockwell) is the astronaut working for Lunar Industries working a three year long contract as the lone employee on the lunar station whose job it is to harvest and rocket supplies of Helium-3, the current clean and abundant fuel, back to Earth. There is no live communication available between him and Earth, so he relies on recorded message from his Lunar Industries colleagues and family, and the only company he has is interactions with the intelligent functioning computer GERTY (Kevin Spacey) attending his day to day needs. Three years has been extremely slowly, but Sam is relieved it will all end in two weeks, but as this time approaches he find himself hallucinating, all he wants is to return to Earth and be back with his wife Tess (Dominique McElligott) and little daughter Eve (Rosie Shaw). One day he does his usual routine work in the space truck on the surface on the moon, but something distracts him as he has an accident, and the next thing he knows he awakens from unconsciousness in the infirmary, and GERTY tells him he needs much rest. Sam decides to go against the wishes of his faithful computer and investigate something outside, and what he comes across is a crashed harvester vehicle, and he carries the body out and inside the station, he is shocked to see it is himself. This second Sam is insisting he is the real one as he remembers the crash happening, they are both confirmed by GERTY as being the same person, but they realise they are both clones, and that they are part of a standard routine of cloning where every three years a new one takes over operations. The Sam recovered from the crash site is slowly coughing blood, this is the effects of the three year existence, so he is dying, and the new Sam is the one who has to decide what to do him soon. Hacking the camera system the dying version of Sam manages to call home, and he is shocked to see an older Eve (Kaya Scodelario), hearing that her mother is dead, and that she appears to already have a father there. The new Sam clone places the dying version in a supposed hibernation capsule sent for rescuing, but it in fact an incinerator, and the pod is shot into space like it is meant to. The new Sam is told by GERTY that memory needs to be wiped in order for things to go back to the way they were, with another new clone on the space station, so he does do this, and the end before leaving to return to Earth, Sam has a space truck crash into the antenna blocking communication to Earth so that it can be freely accessed. Also starring Benedict Wong as Thompson, The IT Crowd's Matt Berry as Overmeyers and Malcolm Stewart as Technician. Rockwell gives a fantastic performance as the astronaut, and his identical clone(s) who discover the Lunar Industries plots to keep things running smoothly, and Spacey as the much nicer version of HAL 9000 is good, the story is marvellous with some good twists and delicately investigated themes of loneliness and humanity, and of course the visuals of the space station and lunar surface are wonderful, a terrific science-fiction drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Outstanding British Film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Astronaut Sam Bell, who has spent the last few years on a solitary assignment on the moon, watch-dogging a mining conglomeration of machines, is nearing the end of his shift. He's fallen into a decent, if claustrophobic routine, sculpting a small village, checking the machines, chatting with his computerized nanny, GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). But he starts to have some problems. Spiraling deeper into what may be insanity, Sam starts to question almost everything, including his very existence.This movie was fantastic. Jones directs this with a calm hand, swooping through the abandoned base smoothly, giving the entire movie a bit of an alien feel. It's a small film telling a small story where psychological science fiction meets character study. A very welcome addition to the science fiction genre. Sometimes you really can do so much more with less. Duncan Jones does a beyond promising feature film debut for this film. The plot has many twist and turns but nothing too confusing. The Screenplay is great somehow doing a nearly impossible task of freshening up the film with only one actor for the whole film. But that is where the film really shines, the acting. Sam Rockwell is fantastic. His ranges of emotion from both of his characters is very complex. He seems to somehow make the characters the same yet very different, personality wise. He is amazing and funny and tragic, sometimes all in the same scene and GERTY, with it's animated emoticon screen and deadpan voice is pitch-perfect. Science fiction is invariably a fairy tale nowadays. You can probably connect with a handful of movies showing a fictional future. Most just serve to entertain with cheap visual thrills. Moon is an exception to this degradation of scientific imagination in our modern day script writing. Instead of pondering over the power levels of imaginary "cores" and flashy laser weaponry, this movie strives to ask difficult questions from the audience. Questions that will leave you with no clear answers long after you have seen, dissected and digested the movie.Script is remarkably simple and there are no "big" secrets except one, which is revealed around the middle. The rest of the story is what gets the gray cells all juiced up. Instead of delivering a complicated plot, the movie delivers a complicated premise. Soundtrack is excellently suited to the pace and texture of the story telling. Visuals are clean and precise, and most importantly believable ? without being boring. The dialogs are also well ? real ! No flamboyance or theater grade facial mannerisms here. Just plane and simple acting, done in a most convincing manner.I rate it 8 out of 10 for its brilliance.</fullReview>

The atmosphere surrounding the Moon and the inside of the bay's was dark and disturbing, but I have to say the story goes out to a point of a uniqueness I couldn't find in any recent movie.I like the Camera, the location, the music, Sam and the Spacey robot. Nothing was forced to be too far from reality,and the special effect were content enough.I like the choice of a sick Sam and a brand new Sam, the choice to make the "controllers" looking like bad guys just out of jail and the "emotional" side of the robot which gives to the relationship a tender quietude which I liked.I have to say there's something missing beside the everlasting loneliness sensation, but this lack of "action" makes this movie unique in his style and an unforgettable one for me.Good Job guys!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an interesting character study between Gertie the Robot &amp; Sam the Human(s).The premise is an Lunar Corporation is mining the far side of the moon for Gas which is now being used to supply 70 percent of the Earth's power. At first you believe Sam has only been on the moon for 3 years as part of his assignment. Then something does not ring quite right.While you could compare this with Hal in another Sci-Fi film, the difference here is that in this one, Gertie has cut off communications with Earth directly and has the power to regenerate Sam in clones wherever they need one.Sam wrecks some equipment &amp; dies in the crash prompting Gertie's replacement. Then the new Sam violates Gertie's orders and goes out and saves the old Sam. While the Sams do not get along, they eventually find a way to organize an end run around Gertie so a rescue party is sent for.The symbolism here which viewers might over look is how a large organization with too much power can change reality and with it do things that never should have been done. Once the 2 Sams get into this, they find out that has happened here.In the end, Gertie becomes an ally to help Sam. The film is just over 90 minutes but this is the right length for this film.</fullReview>

Although we're never quite sure what his mission is, he becomes increasingly less certain about what he's doing there, how long he's been there, and how long he's going to be there. Internal conflicts abound, and "Moon" does an outstanding job of portraying those internal and personal struggles that Sam is experiencing.It's a small film telling a small story where psychological science fiction meets character study. Rockwell, as always, is larger than life. His progressive disorientation and confusion about time, himself and his mission allow for so much thought and introspection for the viewer.

		<shortDescription>Better than A Space Odyssey. Yeah, I said it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot on every cent of a five million dollar budget and the directorial debut of Duncan Jones (the son of David Bowie, no less), Moon was without doubt the most underrated and underviewed film of 2009. With an underrated film comes an underrated actor in Sam Rockwell (Frost/Nixon, Iron Man 2) who pairs up with one of my favourites in Kevin Spacey to deliver a sci-fi film hell bent on breaking all the rules of genre-specific filmmaking.Rockwell plays namesake Sam Bell, an astronaut stationed on the moon carrying out operations as part of a three-year contract, at the conclusion of which he is to return to Earth. He lives in isolation with only supercomputer GERTY (voiced by Spacey) for company. Working peacefully, his problem-free situation begins inherently more complicated when he finds unexpected company aboard his station, leading to the unravelling of a giant conspiracy that challenges his very existence as a human being.For a genre obsessed with alien invasions and intergalactic wars, Moon embarks on something of a path less travelled. However, the heart and raw emotion of the plot more than makes up for the film's lack of gunfights and high-tech action. Director Duncan Jones came up with the original story and must be commended on what can be best described as a magnetic series of events. Indeed, after Sam makes the discovery that sets the movie into motion after an admittedly sluggish start, don't be surprised to find yourself moving closer and closer to the edge of your seat as you wait for the next 'big' moment. Had I been secretly videotaped while watching Moon (hey, it happens) you'd notice my facial expressions range from empathy to intrigue to anticipation to?utterly confused during the climax, but it all ends up making perfect sense before the end credits. And for any film to create such an interest in its characters and what happens around them is an undeniable positive.This couldn't be done without a strong showing in the acting department. Spacey has 'friendly robot voice' down to an absolute tee (a pleasure to listen to) but it is Rockwell who carries this film. In the midst of the Writer's Strike in the US, Jones and Parker still deliver an impressive screenplay, and Rockwell compliments its emotion-driven direction to put in a quality performance cementing his credentials as a leading man. His temporary nervous breakdown, where it all gets too much for him and he wants to 'just go home' is the standout scene, and a perfect example of what I'm trying to explain.Jones has great fun spoofing all sorts of genre-defining sci-fi films. Some references are obvious (pretty sure GERTY and HAL are cousins) while others are subtler, and offer satisfying intertextual depth to fans of the genre. Let me conclude in saying this film is not for everyone. For those expecting a more action- oriented film, the synopsis offered by the Showtime channel ('?things take a turn for the worse when Sam discovers he's not alone') may ultimately prove misleading, but that is to take nothing away from this absorbing mind-bender. And for anyone who felt the ending was somewhat abrupt and could have been expanded upon, word round the campfire is that Moon was just the first of a planned trilogy. Watch this 'space'?awful pun definitely intended.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is right up my alley. I like these type of movies. The science-fiction type of movies that lean more toward the science rather than the fiction. The kind of science-fiction movie that takes a more realistic approach to things and don't feature any aliens, lasers, far off places, or anything of that sort. Movies that make you think, like for instance similar sort of movies like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Solyaris" also do.No, I not saying this movie is being like a modern day "2001: A Space Odyssey" or "Solyaris" but its being a movie that more or less picks a same sort of approach, with as a big difference though that "Moon" is also being a very entertaining and even somewhat lighthearted movie to watch, despite of its story and its settings.The entire movie is being set on a base on the moon. As a matter of fact, the movie only features really one character. It has Sam Rockwell and than it has a robot as well in it, who is being voiced by Kevin Spacey. Doesn't sounds like the most exciting thing to most perhaps but let me tell you that the movie also really didn't needed more characters (there are still more in it though). I have always liked Sam Rockwell in basically everything that he has ever done and he also carries this movie, basically entirely by his own, without any problem.The movie has a nice story, that is never being made too complicated. You constantly question what is real and what is being imagined in this movie, when the main character is seemingly slowly starting to loose it more and more due to the loneliness and isolation, till you figure out what is going on but the movie does this in a mostly lighthearted way. I still don't really know how they managed all this, since its not really a movie with any comedy in it and like I said, is a movie with for most part just two characters in it. You have to give lots of credit to Sam Rockwell but also really to the writers and the director Duncan Jones.This really is a movie that deserves to be seen by more!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

I even found myself wondering just if I would be able to cope with such a life. Probably not! My reference to this film saying a lot about humanity...you will have to watch and go through the experience, to understand my comment there.It's hard to comment on much of the film without giving anything away so I'll just say that the acting was really good, superb.

		<shortDescription>A Return to Pure Sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is a welcome return to pure science fiction. Most science fiction films nowadays are what I call "sci-fi lite-" that is, they contain science fiction elements within the framework of another genre. But Moon is the best real science fiction film that I've seen in ages. Coincidentally it came out in the same year as District 9, another great science fiction film, but Moon edges it out slightly in my opinion. This is a mind-bending film that gives the audience a lot to think about. This is a spoilerific review, so do not read this unless you have seen the movie.Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, an astronaut who harvests an energy source called helium-3 for the Lunar Corporation. Bell is all alone on his employer's moon base with only his computer, Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey), for a companion. Three years of isolation have put a heavy toll on his mental and physical health. He starts seeing things and gets easily distracted. His poor health causes him to get into an accident while driving a vehicle that's sort of like a monster truck for moon travel.Bell awakens in the infirmary on the base, but something seems fishy. Gerty does not want him to go outside and the computer lies to him about taking a conference call with his corporate overlords. So he concocts a scheme to trick Gerty into letting him outside the moon base where he makes a shocking discovery- there is a body in the wrecked space vehicle that looks just like him! It turns out there is another Sam Bell, and they are both just clones of the original Sam Bell who is safely back on Earth. The two clones have to learn to live with each other and it doesn't prove to be easy.From here, the film explores an interesting question: what would it be like to meet yourself? Could you learn anything from yourself? The two Sam Bells in fact do have a lot to learn from each other. Sam Rockwell really makes the film's insane scenario seem perfectly plausible and he is able to carry the entire film on his shoulders since he's practically the entire cast! Rockwell is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood in my opinion.Moon is an impressive directorial debut for Duncan Jones, David Bowie's son. Aside from creating a fascinating premise, Jones employs old school special effects that stand up to the best computer animation in Hollywood. You would never guess that the moon base and the vehicles are miniatures- and all of it was done on a shoe- string budget. It just goes to show you that creativity and intelligence can always outdo a large budget.Moon is one of those rare intelligent science fiction films that will be loved by fans for a long time. I look forward to more of Duncan Jones's projects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small, serious and mostly satisfying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many reviews talk about how Duncan Jones' succinctly titled "Moon" represents a return to "hard" science fiction in the same line as the classic "2001: A Space Odyssey" which both true and not exactly correct. The film actually is more in keeping with the existentialist spirit of "The Truman Show" or Tom Cruise's "Vanilla Sky" and to a lesser degree "The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind." Sam Rockwell's Sam Bell learns to doubt even the most fundamental concepts as his memories, identity and humanity as it unfolds that he and the sentient mining operation robot which shares the moon with him, GERTY, have far more in common than he initially imagines. To describe why would get into spoiler territory but Rockwell and Duncan do a very convincing job of selling the central conceit and creating an entertaining science fiction story with $5mil, basically 1 actor, and the voice of Kevin Spacey. The story lingers with as much as the plot of the spectacle "Avatar" which was 55 times the cost. My biggest objection with the film is an incongruous happy ending which suggests the company's moon-based personnel practices would be viewed with scandal -- maybe by this point in humanity's technological evolution, such procedures would be public?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Sci-Fi Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To find a sci-fi movie about ideas is a damned novelty these days. A piece of cinema that is willing to forgo car chases and gun fights for philosophical questioning and human struggles. Moon, directed by Duncan Jones (son of David Bowie) attempted to do this during its limited release in 2011. It is a tour de force that follows the solitary life of a "man on the moon" played by Samuel Rockwell. Because most of the film occurs on an isolated lunar mining base, the pacing and plot is carried entirely on the shoulders of Sam Rockwell's role as the main character. Sam Rockwell's character is Sam Bell, a contractor who is operating the space station for a 3 year stint, along with his HAL9000 inspired robot named GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). We are allowed to indulge in Sam's longing for the family he left on earth and observe his decent into insanity; delusion, paranoia, and Sam's loss of his sense of self after the story's big reveal. As his situation becomes increasingly more miserable and his mental stability wanes Sam suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations. The viewer is forced to question his judgment for the rest of the movie and his eternally cynical attitude contributes all the more to this effect. Sam Rockwell may not have been the most obvious person to take on the role, but he rises to the difficulty of the situation and blends his personality to fit it. Rockwell seems to have a chameleon-like ability to fully embrace a character, and this is his best performance so far. Although he is no Daniel Day Lewis or Christian Bale, Sam Rockwell's brilliant acting is by far the best part of the film. The hidden gem of Moon is Kevin Spacey's portrayal of GERTY, Sam's companion on the base. GERTY is the only other character to get significant time on-screen and although its full range of emotion is linked to a smiley face on an LCD display, it offers important comic relief during the tensest parts of the movie. Luckily Duncan Jones avoids the "evil robot" plot trap and allows Kevin Spacey's charm to shine through the character. Moon is a brilliant first attempt by Mr. Jones and received many accolades reflecting this. It offers a fresh combination of "soft" science fiction and a unique directorial vision but the solid acting is the glue that really brings the film together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely unexpected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Bell is a contract worker who, for three years, has been mining the moon for helium-3, the solution to Earth's energy crisis. He is nearing the end of his contracted time, and excited about getting home; for so long his only company has been that of video messages from his family, his photographs, and the on-board computer. Upon visiting one of the mining stations, Sam has an accident and finds himself waking at base, under the care of said computer, named Gerty. What then unfolds is something not very easily described without spoiling what makes the film so good, but it is fair to say that on more than one occasion, due to a lot of seemingly familiar tropes, you may believe you know where the film is going. You almost definitely don't. It is refreshing to see this sort of film take more than one turn along the way and become something you really are not expecting.Sam Rockwell has become one of many people's favourite actors now, a man who seems able to manifest physical transformation from one role to the next without the aid of effects. Put Rockwell from 'Frost/Nixon', 'Iron Man 2', and this film alongside each other, and you could almost believe they are different men! In 'Moon' he really does, perhaps more so than anywhere else, illustrate just how complex a performance he can give, and despite the other things about the film that I love, it is ultimately Rockwell on whom the film's success hinges. This is the performance at which, in time to come, people will likely look and wonder how it was that he didn't receive an Oscar nomination. Even Gerty was only voiced by Kevin Spacey after the man himself saw a rough cut, and was so impressed by the actor that he wanted to be part of the project. The great reception 'Moon' received was not only testament to the quality of Rockwell, of course, but also to that of first time film maker Duncan Jones (yes, "Zowie Bowie"), who would go on to make 'Source Code', and is now pretty much finished with the daring project 'Warcraft'. 'Moon' is a fascinating, independently produced sci-fi which, unlike most entries in the genre, features no hi-tech, big-budget effects, monsters, or fancy trickery; it is just a good idea, great film making, one of Clint Mansell's most impressive scores, and a superb performance as its beating heart. Catch 'Moon' and it may well become one of your favourite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Golden Age of Science Fiction reborn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most enjoyable classes I took in college was a summer course on sci-fi literature. The assigned reading included superb novels (along with a few that were a little stodgy) but what I liked best were those great short stories from the Golden Age of Science Fiction; All You Zombies and The Cold Equations and just about anything by Asimov. Moon reminds me of those classic short stories in the best possible way. It's true hard science fiction ? lean, brainy, and creative ? and I recommend to any and all genre fans who enjoyed the space opera of Star Trek but found it a little intellectually lightweight. Moon's got ya covered.The story involves an astronaut played by Sam Rockwell on a three-year solo mining operation on the moon, with only an omnipresent A.I. named GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) to keep him company. Everything's going swimmingly until Sam gets into an accident on a standard surface mission and the plot plunges into a dark and fascinating direction, examining humanity, corporations, technology, and ethics through a very, very small cast, a tiny handful of sets, and only the subtlest bit of special effects work.I dare not reveal anything beyond the movie's fifteen-minute mark for fear of undermining the power of the story, but I will say that I really admire the way Moon handles plot twists. There are several, yes, but in rejection of the popular M. Night Shyamalan method of shoving them at film's end as giant expository wham moments they're worked subtly and organically into the narrative framework. Early on I thought I had guessed the "ending twist," only to have said twist be revealed with little fanfare in the first act, with the protagonist who was actually smart like a real person figuring it out as quickly as the audience and the plot moving on from there. Right then I knew I was watching something kinda special.Along with the clever screenplay it deserves mention that this, stunningly enough, is the first feature by director Duncan Jones. He's helped along by Clint Mansell's haunting, piano-heavy score and of course Sam Rockwell's one-man-show performance full of high-strung energy that contrasts perfectly with his sterile lunar surroundings, but the eerie tension Jones creates feels less like that of a nervous filmmaking virgin and a lot more like Alien-era Ridley Scott. It's a confident and memorable vision that deserves to go down as a minor classic of hard sci-fi and I look forward to whatever Jones cooks up next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing and thoughtful sci fi film for a niche audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is slow and brooding, so therefore not exciting for all viewers. Any full-length feature film with only one actor is bound to have limited appeal. However, sci fi fans will tend to love it because it has some solid ideas in it, though they are slow to develop. But sci fi fans have patience, they will wait for something that is really good. And as this film moves along, deeply intriguing things do emerge, like butterflies struggling to emerge from their chrysalises, and taking their time about it. An unknown English director named Duncan Jones has made this German production in the English language. The only other live actor on screen apart from Sam Rockwell, who plays two identical men, is the computer, whose silky voice is recorded by Kevin Spacey, and it is very much a 'son of HAL'. The story concerns a mining station on the moon, which is manned by a single person, Sam Bell, who is played by Rockwell. He has an accident when driving in a heavy vehicle outside his base, but is rescued by another man. That man, however, turns out to be his identical twin. It is highly sophisticated the way Jones handles this situation. The two men, instead of confronting one another, try to ignore one another, which is not normal. But then they themselves are not normal, as we soon discover. It becomes obvious that one of them is a clone, and one is real. But which is which? Later we are shocked to realize that they are both clones, and that the real Sam Bell left the base many years earlier. Both men become sullen and introverted upon realizing that they are clones of Sam Bell rather than the real Sam Bell. A clone has a lifetime of three years, and then another is taken out of storage and brought to life. The two clones become desperate to search for the 'hidden room' which they feel certain must exist inside their base. This stirs psychological responses in viewers, because as Carl Jung and others have so often pointed out, unknown or concealed rooms in houses and buildings as experienced in dreams, or even in reality for that matter, psychologically represent untapped portions of our consciousness, and symbolize our unexploited potentials and abilities. Eventually, the 'hidden room' is indeed found, but it is much more than a room, it is an entire subterranean level of the main base structure. And it contains row upon row of clones. The two clones then decide to vivify a third clone. Meanwhile, a 'rescue mission' from Earth is about to arrive, and the two clones think it is coming to kill them because they have learned too much. Obviously, the commercial company owning the mining station had decided long ago to save money by not having real people running the mining stations, but to economize by using clones instead. The pathos of the film is intense when the clones, who have had the memories of the original Sam Bell implanted in their brains, realize that the beautiful young wife whom they both 'remember' died long ago, and the charming little daughter whom they 'remember' as a toddler is now a teenager, and that her dad, the real Sam Bell is living happily at home with her on earth. They discover all this by TV link and then take steps regarding their situation. The drama of this film builds slowly but surely. It is paced languidly, however, and is thus the antithesis of a Hollywood sci fi film. There are no explosions, no wham bang, nobody gets shot. Isn't it amazing how a film can be made these days without non-stop violence? You might be tempted to think that humans had finally become civilized and could stop killing each other for long enough at least to watch a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly excellent film, the producers displayed how cinema should not necessarily be degraded to CGI showcasing and big money. The star of the show is undoubtedly Clint Mansell's haunting soundtrack, as well as Kevin Spacey's excellent voice acting for the robot GERTY, who is the most endearing and convincing non-sentient character I have ever seen in cinema, including HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Go and rent this film. The movie addresses thorny issues, including the potential of corporations to lie and abuse humanity for their own profitable ends and exactly what makes us 'human'. The creators of this film used CGI to the minimum, relying on old-school 'hard' set creation to make the film 'feel' authentic as possible, and this really shows. Positively. My only real criticism of this film is that it has little 'staying power', in that I wouldn't watch it again. However, this is arguably a plus. A simple film with a powerfully delivered message, I do not feel I need to see it again. It was close to perfection. Go and rent this film. NOW.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest films of the sci fi genre I've ever seen. Sam Rockwell deserves an Oscar nomination for his subtle beautiful and extremely challenging performance. Apparently the film had a budget of only about 5 million which is nothing for a sci fi, but when you see it, it is as good as any 50 million dollar picture. They used real models combined with digital effects which gave it a wonderful feel and it was so refreshing to see that. The script is fantastic and presents us with a film that stays with us long after it is over. Duncan Jones put his heart in the right place with this film and I'm sure we'll be seeing much more from him in the future. The problem is, he set the bar so high with this film I don't know how he will ever top it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"For me, the Moon has this weird mythic nature to it... There is still a mystery to it..." Duncan Jones,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon (2009) -is the film debut of Duncan Jones, aka Zoui Bowie, the eldest son of David Bowie. This is a very good independent film in the genre of space science fiction/drama with the well crafted elements of mystery and thriller. Of course, the film immediately brings to mind such classics as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solaris (1972) as well as Silent Running (1972), Alien (1979) and Outland (1981), all of which Jones names as the memorable films from his youth. I say this not to criticize Moon. On the contrary, I believe it is an achievement of the young director/ writer that he made a film on the themes and subjects that have been explored many times by famous and prominent directors, and as result, he made a clever, exciting, touching, and original film. Moon does not fascinate with the spectacular and flashy special computer generated effects, masterfully set fights or breathtaking chases. With 97 minutes of running time, Moon is basically one man show which belongs to charismatic and talented Sam Rockwell. Rockwell plays Sam Bell, an astronaut, working under the contract with the International Lunar Corporation, the company that found the way to efficient production of helium-3 on the Moon. The resulting helium is then shipped to Earth to be used as a source of cheap and much needed energy. Sam's contract lasts 3 years, and when we meet him on the space station he has only two weeks left until his returning home to his wife he desperately longs for and the little daughter, whom he had never seen because she was born after he left for Moon. The only creature he communicates with all this time, is highly organized AI - computer Gertie, for whom Kevin Spacey lends his voice. Like the best films in the genre of sci-fi, the Moon is about a human in extreme conditions, physical, mental and moral. It is about the indifferent silence of space, the nostalgia for home, for love, for Earth. It is also a thriller that makes an interesting twist in the plot. Most importantly, Sam is such an interesting and compelling character that we truly experience everything that he goes through and the choices he makes. To say more would be to spoil the movie. I only add that IMO, Kevin Spacey played one of his best and most human roles for long time.Jones is planning a follow-up film, titled Mute, which will serve as an epilogue to Moon and I would like to watch it because the ending of Moon was a little rushed, and I have few questions that were not answered in the first film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a return of the smart sci fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon's style seems to have borrowed somewhat heavily from the early 70's film Silent Running and to a lesser extent other classics such as 2001 and Alien, however its strong subject matter and a smart story pull this low budget sci-fi up to the level of those it pays homage to and presents a contemporary and viable story of its own. Without revealing too much plot, there is one actor, the underrated Sam Rockwell (think Gary oldman without the ticks) and an ambiguous genre-defying computer voiced by Kevin Spacey named Gerty. They spend their days lolling around a moon station mining the films Mc guffin "Helium -3". After the initial set up things get a little difficult for our protagonist as he struggles to comprehend the events that are evolving around him. The film keeps you engaged for the entire running time and ends with a few head scratches that will keep you awake for that "penny dropping" moment when the whole film makes perfect sense. Its main themes are as interesting as the story itself and it explores quite a few, mainly human isolation and compassion, consumerism and corporatization mixed with strong overtones of environmental deprecation at the expense of industry and commerce.Duncan Jones who has obviously inherited his dad's interest in all things space proves in control of his subject matter and willing to let us think for ourselves, which is rare in this day and age. Some tasteful modern cues adorn the film; a few orchestral winks to scores past keep us entertained whilst not detracting from the films overall tone. The sound design keeps the artificial environment alive and humming and adds to the claustrophobia and distance one would feel in that environment. You'll believe there is a real moon space mining operation out there. All in all this movie gives low budget films a boost and possibly signals the beginning of studios funding the "smart" sci-fi film rather than some of the bloated messes we see in the cinema these days. Hint : Watch this movie twice to see the clues</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never make the actor(s) talk over a swinging punching bag. It's irritating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Rockwell had annoyed the hell out of me in "Confessions of a Confused Mind" or "The Confusions of a Confessed Killer" or "The Serial Minds of a Confessed Confuser" (or whatever Clooney's first turkey was called), playing his character as if he had graduated from John Travolta's School of Shameless Overacting &amp; Clowning Around, so I was a little wary of watching "Moon". However, this being one of few potentially promising sci-fi flicks, I had to give it a try.Fortunately, Rockwell annoys only in a handful of places, as in the scene in which the two clones are having a communication problem due to the fact that the new clone can't keep his hands off a punching bag. It was the punching bag making too much noise - hence not allowing the poor viewer to hear the conversation - that really annoyed me, but that was the director's fault, naturally, not Sam's (for once). Needless to say, Sam was in much safer hands this time around: Clooney seems to have the uncanny "ability" to bring out the worst in any thespian. Any director is an improvement after George. Any.Actually, can we even consider Clooney a director? "Moon" is an enjoyable sci-fi drama, a refreshing change from the chop-sokey, space-cadets/marines-going-yo-yeah, monsters-going-ghhrrgaw sci-fi action garbage of recent years. Not all the story elements would survive a closer scrutiny, logic-wise, though. Kevin Spacey, doing the voice of the slightly gay computer, had been programmed to help the clones no matter what. It even allows Sam to re-boot it. Orders coming directly from the company's bosses generally seem to have lower priority: this makes little sense. Also confusing is how the older Sam clone could possibly have had visions of his teenage "daughter", when he only had memory implants of the time when she was a baby. That would include the supernatural into the equation, but I didn't get the feeling that the writer of "Moon" was going for that. Still, this one could be explained away...There should have been more shock and disorientation in the way the clones react to each others existence. But even that can be rationalized away through some more-or-less cockamamie genetic-manipulation argument, so I'm fine with that too.Harder to explain would be why the company would go through such lengths - and such risk of having their image ruined/damaged - to create a mini-army of Sam clones instead of hiring normal personnel. The argument that "clones take away the need to train new employees" seems rather thin, certainly insufficient. The fact that clones don't get paid is also a flimsy reason, considering how little one man would cost as compared to the great deal of profit that must be coming out of this energy-related venture.This begs the question: if this future Earth is so advanced - to the extent that they can make near-perfect clones - then why didn't they just hire robots? That would certainly avoid the additional cost and trouble of sending a repair mission after an aging, dying, very ill clone starts making errors, such as crashing vehicles into expensive machinery. Sam's 3-year expiration date (and I assume it's not controllable) creates hazards every 3 years, right?... So why not replace him every 24 months...Why would they even give the clones memory implants? Why not just make them behave like robots: do your job and shut up.I am also struggling with the fact that a Sam clone could so easily leave the base and fly off to Earth. Wouldn't the company make it impossible for anyone to leave the base without their permission, especially considering the secret they hide on the Moon?Then again, being a mindless sci-fi fan, I am willing to overlook all these Swiss-cheese holes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MOON (Duncan Jones, 2009) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that needs to be said (and which might not be readily apparent to the uninformed) is that director Duncan Jones is David Bowie's son i.e. he who was formerly known as Zowie Bowie. MOON is a quietly impressive directorial debut that was deservedly much acclaimed and most of its success hinges on a tour-de-force central performance from Sam Rockwell ? playing triple roles in what is virtually a one-man-show. The plot-line would initially seem to be reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968) ? the interaction between astronaut and the human-voiced computer (dispassionately provided here by Kevin Spacey) ? and Douglas Trumbull's SILENT RUNNING (1972) ? the isolation of the astronaut on an ecological mission; however, the twist revelation in the middle swerves it admirably into the realm of Andrei Tarkovsky's SOLARIS (1972)...not to mention any number of clones/replicants/surrogates scenarios we have seen in the last 30 years! This is certainly not to say that MOON is simply a rehash of past sci-fi fare but merely to highlight the fact that the film-makers know their stuff and, consequently, have managed to make something equally worthwhile despite the thematic echoes. Two further assets to the production that bear mentioning are Clint Mansell's evocative score (with, I might add, no use of Bowie Snr.'s epochal "Space Oddity" anywhere) and the predominant whites in the production design.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With only three weeks left in his three year contract, Sam Bell is getting anxious to finally return to Earth. He is the only occupant of a Moon-based manufacturing facility along with his computer and assistant, GERTY. The long period of time alone however has resulted in him talking to himself for the most part, or to his plants. Direct communication with Earth is not possible due to a long-standing communication malfunction but he does get an occasional message from his wife Tess. When he has an accident however, he wakens to find that he is not alone. He also comes to realize that his world is not what he thought it was...Moon is a very interesting and promising debut from director Duncan Jones.This independent film has been extremely talked about and acclaimed by most critics and everyone in general.Many comparisons have been made and obviously,Sam's companion, Gerty, the computer voiced by Kevin Spacey, is a clear reminder of Hal from "2001,A Space Odyssey" but the comparisons should end there.They are completely different films and Moon,although being a very refreshing piece of work that stands on his own doesn't have what it takes to become such an all-time classic as 2001.Moon raises some very interesting questions when it comes to existentialism, and the circle of life and it is thought-provoking but Kubrik's film is a surreal journey that goes from the very beginning of the human kind to the space age,it's a roller coaster of emotions and the film was way before its time therefor it can't be compared to Moon.And don't get me wrong, Moon is a very good film with a great screenplay and feels like a breath of fresh air,however, it's not the "next big thing" as it has been dubbed by some. I have to say that Sam Rockwell's performance is amazing,after all this is basically a one man show and he nailed it, he carries the film on his back and at the same time the film relies on him immensely which makes his performance the central piece of Moon.In conclusion,Moon is great watch and a must see for Sci Fi fans.7.5/10</fullReview>

Take this job and shove it!" After a while, the confusion becomes overwhelming as the plot gets more complicated, with new elements being introduced.You like sci-fi? Try "Gravity," "2001," "Star Wars" or "The Day The Earth Stood Still."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cerebral exercise with a twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stylistically, MOON owes a great debt to the likes of SOLARIS, SILENT RUNNING and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, all films exploring astronauts trapped in a self-made prison in space and suffering the extremes of loneliness. The difference is, while those films were new and thought-provoking at the time, MOON fails to offer much in the way of originality for the modern age.Critics lauded it, praising a film which eschews action and incident in favour of deep-rooted themes and an exploration of the human condition. However, I just found it boring. The storyline is unengaging and the material is spread way too thinly over the running time. There just isn't enough substance, enough to make me care about the central character's plight or the twists that are gradually unveiled.I've never been a fan of Sam Rockwell, and his performance here hasn't changed that. MOON deserves to be good for its different-to-the-norm premise, but for a film so singularly lacking in thrills, incident, suspense or, indeed, drama, I wondered at the end why I'd bothered watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Compelling Work Of Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is a British science fiction drama film directed by Duncan Jones. It is about a man who experiences a personal crisis as he nears the end of a three-year solitary stint mining helium-3 on the far side of the Earth's moon. Sam Rockwell stars as the employee Sam Bell, and Kevin Spacey voices his robot companion,GERTY.Robin Chalk,Dominique McElligott,Kaya Scodelario,Benedict Wong and Matt Berry play key supporting roles.It was the feature debut of director Duncan Jones.An astronaut miner extracting the precious moon gas that promises to reverse the Earth's energy crisis nears the end of his three-year contract, and makes an ominous discovery in this psychological sci-fi film. For three long years, Sam Bell has dutifully harvested Helium 3 for Lunar, a company that claims it holds the key to solving humankind's energy crisis. As Sam's contract comes to an end, the lonely astronaut looks forward to returning to his wife and daughter down on Earth, where he will retire early and attempt to make up for lost time. His work on the Selene moon base has been enlightening wherein the solitude helping him to reflect on the past and overcome some serious anger issues but the isolation is starting to make Sam uneasy. With only two weeks to go before he begins his journey back to Earth, Sam starts feeling strange: he's having inexplicable visions, and hearing impossible sounds. Then, when a routine extraction goes horribly awry, it becomes apparent that Lunar hasn't been entirely straightforward with Sam about their plans for replacing him. The new recruit seems strangely familiar, and before Sam returns to Earth, he will grapple with the realization that the life he has created may not be entirely his own. Up there, hundreds of thousands of miles from home,it appears that Sam's contract isn't the only thing about to expire.Science fiction can encompass many genres such as suspense, horror, action-adventure, romance, even comedy but this movie doesn't fit neatly into any of them. This smart, provocative film has no aliens or cool spaceships, and the effects aren't all that special instead, the material is character- and story-driven, centering on an excellent, multi-layered performance by Sam Rockwell.But overall,it is a compelling work of science-fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Rockwell's acting is one of the best in film history....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a quick summary of the film: Astronaut Sam Bell is at the end of his three-year mission on the Moon, where he, working alongside his computer, GERTY, sends back to Earth parcels of a resource that has helped diminish our planet's power problems. He has no direct contact with people on earth so his only conversations he has is with his computer companion GERTY. Towards the end of his three-year mission, he notices things aren't as they seem.This is one of the best sci-fi films ever made. A low budget film with a huge twist and an excellent story. This is the debut film by Duncan Jones who shows promise and talent in this extraordinary film. Sam Rockwell plays astronaut Sam Bell and wow what a performance. Sam Rockwell was at the top of his game and gave an Oscar friendly performance. I am surprised he did not get any recognition for his tremendous acting performance. The script was genius same with the directing as well.Just a brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moon - So simple yet so stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film to impress, it needs to be different, clever and most importantly captivating. Moon succeeds on all these levels, sophisticatedly unravelling a deep and meaningful plot. The stunning futuristic scenes from the moon's surface separate the film from life as we know it, whilst the aptness of the script pokes and prods 'very- human' and powerful emotions throughout.Based strongly upon a debatable concept, Duncan Jones balances the reality and imaginative nature of the film perfectly through a believable script. Enhanced by Sam Rockwell and Sam Rockwell alone, the limited cast emphasises the loneliness felt by Sam Bell as a character. Whilst later in the film this lonely undertone is merged so subtlety through the development of the plot and the careful styles in acting by Rockwell. Kevin Spacey's role too, must be addressed with applaud. Although merely voicing over the unnerving thriller-robot, known as GERTY, Spacey somehow develops personal attributes through robotic tones, again adding to the emotion of the constant unraveling film.However, the setting tops the film for me. Trying hard to astonish, it also mirrors the lonely atmosphere through not overcompensating with special effects. Just stars, the Earth and a grey, wilderness of rock.But why is it different, clever and captivating? Simple - because it is so simple (at least on the face of things). This is then emphasised by the superb acting, script and scenes that give the film the emotional edge over many, or dare I say any other films. Truly unmissable!Rating - &#x263a; &#x263a; &#x263a; &#x263a; &#x263a; &#x263a; &#x263a; &#x263a; &#x263a; &#x263a; (10/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TOugh movie to review here.'Moon' is an atmospheric, moody piece about isolation.SOme here will certainly poke and prod at the plausibility of this film, and the lack of action, but 'Moon' is much more than that.One of the great things about this film is the music. This film has style. This film has tension. It also has one of the most under-rated actors in the biz, Sam Rockwell. From his role in 'Confessions of a Dangerous MInd', I've been following Sam like lost puppy, and he never seems to disappoint. He single handedly made Iron Man 2 a pretty good sequel, somehow made 'Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy' watchable, and stamps approval on just about everything he touches. Conviction, his latest, is very good.His performance here is nearing Oscar material.'Moon' defies the detractors with it's subtle but powerful storyline, and uses some fantastic editing, music, and acting to weave one of the better films of the year. Worth owning. Undoubtedly, some will call this boring, but many film masters will take notice of the care and effort that it took to piece together this fine work of art - because that's what it is.Other recommendations along similar lines(or you'll like it if you liked) : Solaris(orig/about even &amp; remake/not as good), Outland, The Quiet Earth, Silent Running</fullReview>

When we "get" the rather obvious story line....we need to have a sharp script to push it along. Alas the script is ordinary----so we wait patiently to see how this is going to end. I think the end was rushed (this---remember is a low budget flick). Sam Rockwell was not an inspired choice to have the lead role here. He is in 98% of scenes, and he fails to have the magic quality that great actors have. Call it the..X..factor...call it anything. Jude Law may have been the best choice. It is a highly regarded movie...But as a science fiction film...it is a million light years behind Kubriks 2001..A Space Odyssey. Made in 1968.</fullReview>

Everything in this movie has been done before and has been done better. In an other movie an other computer behaves outside of it's program. But in the other movie (2001 of course) there is a reason. In Moon there is not, it just does. In Moon the lead character does not wear a spacesuit in his buggy. That is of course unless the script has the buggy break down later on, then he wears his suit. Oh, and the main character is very vulnerable, unless he has to stow away as cargo that is shot at 25 G's into space then he becomes superman. No more about this movie; it's a extreme stinker.

		<fullReview>Moon is one of the most atmospheric movies ever witnessed. Astronaut Sam Bell is near the end of his 3 year contract on the Lunar moon mining base. Strange events start to suddenly occur. Sam Bell comes across a crashed mining vehicle with another astronaut injured inside. The oddity is that Sam Bell is meant to be the only astronaut on the base. The injured astronaut is also Sam Bell.The movie's subtle eeriness creeps upon you like a spider slowly crawling up your leg. The level of raw emotion that is displayed by Sam Rockwell (who stars as Sam Bell) is so deeply moving it is difficult not to overwhelmed even if you have a heart of stone. Kevin Spacey's voice performance of the robot, GERTY, is magnificent.The only drawback with Moon is the ending. For a movie that is so artistically beautiful, the ending leaves little to the imagination with a closed ending scenario. The movie itself would have been better left as an open ending interpretation.Overall, Moon is an incredibly well crafted film and will be thoroughly enjoyed by every moviegoer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A semi-dark side of the Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Duncan Jones's directorial debut "Moon" is a science fiction film set on, you guessed it, the Moon. Sam Rockwell plays a Moon-based employee of a mining operation. To try to explain (spoiler-free) what happens to him is difficult so let's just say that he faces challenges as a result of his long isolation from other human beings.The film is practically a one man show for Sam Rockwell. I've liked him since "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" and here he gives another solid performance. Kevin Spacey as the voice of GERTY (the lunar station's robotic assistant) is about the only other actor worth mentioning.The story may not appeal to everyone, though. Personally, I liked the direction that the film was going in early on but then it turned into a different beast altogether. There's not really anything wrong with the story; it just utilizes a theme that I don't particularly care for.Jones's capable direction keeps things under control while the film's look harks back to the likes of "2001: A Space Odyssey". I found the score a bit overwhelming at times but maybe that's just me.I'm surprised to see the film rated so highly but apparently I've just underestimated the appeal of science fiction to the general movie-going public. That being said, I don't think that you'd necessarily need to be a science fiction fan in order to appreciate the story. Ultimately, critical consensus seems to be pretty positive for this one so perhaps I'm in the minority here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Moon' is built around a stunning solitary performance by Sam Rockwell as 'Sam Bell', a lone astronaut overseeing a mining operation on the moon. With thoughts of his three year tenure coming to an end, Bell prepares himself to hand over the reins of responsibility and for the journey home, but when he begins to experience visions that put him in harm's way, the film takes us into some seriously cerebral science fiction.Duncan Jones has crafted a melancholic yet powerful exploration of identity and isolation which manages to remain original whilst strongly evoking the feeling of films such as 'Silent Running', '2001: A Space Odyssey', and 'Solaris', to name but a few. It is to the films credit though, that such comparisons can be made, as Moon stands beside them as a sombre and philosophical foray into the eeriness and stillness that the realities of Space Travel may one day bring. Like all really good sci-fi, 'Moon' poses difficult moral questions with regard to the development of technology and the dangers that such progress will invoke. That it does it within the confines of a creepy, atmospheric puzzle box of a movie is a bonus that will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd heard very good things about Moon from friends and critics alike and had been markedly disappointed by its limited cinema release. Thus I was very excited when I finally got round to watching it.To think this film was made on a relatively puny budget of ?5m is staggering. The story is excellent told by the clearly very talented director, Duncan Jones; beautifully shot and styled through the cinematography, set design, modelling and effects; and brilliantly acted by Sam Rockwell, the most underrated actor in Hollywood. I've been a fan of Rockwell since Lawn Dogs but his performance here really is masterful. Kevin Spacey's vocal performance as Gerty is also delivered perfectly.A funny, dramatic, upsetting, thought-provoking, beautiful film that deserves vastly more recognition than it's had. I've given it nine stars because it doesn't quite do enough to knock my all time favourites of their pedestal but it's definitely the best I've seen in a long while. A natural, more understated cousin of Sunshine and Solaris (done on a sliver of their budgets) this is a must for everyone, not just sci-fi fans. Put it on your list now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The lonely man on the moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Bell works on the far side of the moon. He is near the end of a three-year stint manning a mining outpost from which helium-3, a source of clean energy, is sent down to Earth. Sam is all alone. His only companion of sorts is his robot assistant GERTY. Communications problems make live contact with Earth impossible, meaning he and his wife can only send recorded messages back and forth to each other. This is a man who can't wait to get home. It's been three long, lonely years. But just when the finish line is in sight there's an accident. And here things take a very strange turn. Sam is going to have to ask himself some very serious questions as he tries to come to grips with the shocking truth with which he is confronted. What exactly is going on here on the far side of the moon?This is a movie which requires you to tiptoe around the plot as you attempt to review it. Best to let viewers discover the movie's secrets themselves. What can be said is that Sam Rockwell turns in a rather astounding performance in the role of Sam Bell. It's somewhat clichéd to say an actor has to carry a movie himself but in this case it's absolutely true. When we meet him Sam Bell is all alone, giving Rockwell nobody to play off of other than the computerized voice of Kevin Spacey as GERTY. It's a great challenge for Rockwell. And then comes the movie's big twist and all of a sudden Rockwell's challenge grows much, much greater. It's a performance which you probably can't fully appreciate until you've seen the whole film. Only then can you stop, look back, and understand how difficult this must have been for Rockwell. You'll also have an appreciation for director Duncan Jones who, with a rather meager budget, produced some rather astounding visuals. The effects in this film are very subtle, you don't even really think about or notice them when the movie is playing itself out. Then afterwards you think about it and realize that in this movie filming something as simple as a game of ping-pong is a masterful technical achievement.If there can be any complaint at all it would be that the story of the lonely man does make for somewhat of a lonely movie. It's a one-man show and as that one man Rockwell is terrific. But with nobody else around there are times where there is really nothing for Sam Bell to do. The film struggles for momentum at times, especially in the beginning. But the story is compelling and very well thought-out. Once it really gets going it will definitely hold your attention. It's not a big, flashy sci-fi movie. It's a personal story, Sam Bell's story. And that's a story you'll find yourself emotionally invested in. This story definitely has a lot of heart to it. It's compelling and more than a little surprising. The direction this movie goes in is certainly not what anyone would have been expecting when we first meet Sam Bell. It's a very unique tale, one performed wonderfully by Rockwell. Give director Jones credit for the very interesting story. And for the impressive visuals. The effects, the moon base set, everything in the movie looks wonderful. Jones created a great little world for Sam Bell but it was going to take a great actor to pull off what the movie required of him. And Sam Rockwell was up to the task. It's Rockwell's movie all the way through and it his brilliance which makes the movie work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original enough to stand on its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets get one thing straight right from the start, Moon is a great film, a majestic piece of sci-fi, directed with an assured confidence and a leading man who has never been better. But what it is not is a classic. The reason behind this is that has been made in the wrong time. Let me explain.Moon echoes many sci-fi movies of the past, 2001, Silent Running, Saturn 3 and to an extent Alien. If Moon had been made and sandwiched snugly between these films made in this era it would have no doubt have been dubbed a classic and be sat in many 'Top 10 ever made' lists. The problem is we've seen this before and although Moon is a work of unbridled brilliance you still can't help but compare to those other movies. This for me takes the edge off 'classic'.The story of Moon is that of Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) who while working on the Moon harvesting resources to help with Earth's power problem has a accident while out attending one of the harvesters. When he awakens he finds himself back in the base being nursed back to health by his computer colleague Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey). Once back to a relatively healthy state of mind he goes back to the scene of the accident only to discover himself still there. Strange.The movie then enters its surrealism phase where Sam and his doppelgänger try to comprehend exactly what is going on and why they are both there. The great thing about the film is that it never tries too hard to explain things, everything flows smoothly and the story progresses evenly to keep you hooked. The reason behind this however is the performance of Sam Rockwell.Rockwell is really the only actor present on screen in this movie and its on his shoulders whether the film succeeds or fails, and succeed it does. Rockwell is majestic, portraying the alienation and loneliness with a realism that defies belief. Kevin Spacey lends his monotone vocals to the bases computer, Gerty, who is clearly a nod to HAL from 2001 with added smiley face.Its also hard to believe that this is Duncan Jones directorial debut. The way he has shot the film is undeniably a throw back to the movies I mentioned earlier, but brings to it an updated swagger which portrays the confidence of a film maker who's been doing this successfully for years. The visuals and tone of the film are quite astounding, with the score being a particular haunting highlight. Its a credit to Jones that he is being bounded around as being 'the new Kubrick' but as with most of these tags its best to ignore and continue doing his own thing. Its interesting to see what he comes up with next as he's set the bar very high.Moon is a solid entry into the massive catalogue of sci-fi and although its a homage to past films it can still sit proudly on its own as an original piece of work.mark - http://kaihorotimes.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Cast Away" in space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is one of those rare films that has the ability to captivate you all the way to the end if you let it. The movie is a touching story and a journey through the loneliness of Sam Bell. I don't want to leave any spoilers here so I'll continue on with what I think.Sam Rockwell puts on the performance of a lifetime as Sam Bell and showcases why he may be one of the better actors of our time. The film draws comparisons to 2001: A Space Odyssey but I think Moon can be compared to a more modern list of films such as: Sunshine, The Fountain, and Cast Away.Not a lot of actors can carry a film by themselves and it takes a gifted one to do that. When you watch the movie, you can really understand just how alone Sam Bell really is. We've all been lonely at one point in our lives but it's very rare to see that emotion from a third-person view like you can with a movie like Moon. There's a familiar voice in a supporting role throughout the film and that is Kevin Spacey voicing the robot known as GERTY. GERTY remains loyal to Sam Bell during the entire film's running time and mid-way through, you nearly forget it's Spacey's voice and for me, there was an eerie feeling each time I heard him speak. It is familiar, pleasant, comforting, yet sad.For a low budget film, the special effects are kept at a minimum but, when you see them in it's entirety, they are exceptional. There is a specific scene in Moon that most refer to as the "long distance phone call" and this is arguably the most powerful scene of the film. Without giving up too many details, there is however a single shot of Sam on the moon while you get a glance of the sun and then planet Earth from a distance. It is beautiful shots like these that truly define a movie.Hollywood is currently missing films with stellar acting and story telling and Moon is a very unique film in that department with the potential to stick with viewers for some time afterward. For those who crave action and/or loads of CGI, check out something else. This is good old-fashioned Science-Fiction at it's best. Your loyalty as a movie watcher may be challenged but by the film's end, it's safe to assume that Moon is an experience -- a visual journey of pure loneliness that begs the final question, "Is there anything more lonely than handling a specific duty while being an outcast 238,855 miles from your home planet on a rock known as the 'Moon'?" I can honestly tell you that I felt all the loneliness the film tried to show me. And that's the whole purpose behind it. I really felt that that was the plot, the milieu if you will -- the mission as a whole and for me, it succeeded at that.Overall, I give "Moon" a 9 out of 10 because nothing is perfect in my book. I highly recommend this movie to classic Science-Fiction fans and those who enjoy Drama. For those who appreciate story telling along with the superb acting of an underrated actor such as Sam Rockwell, I urge you to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent piece of contemporary Sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good science-fiction is hard to come by these days, but 2009 blessed us with what I view as two contemporary classics in "Moon" and "District 9." Science-fiction, much like the Western, is past its heyday and usually struggles to find connection in a society with an ever-growing dependence on technology for survival. "Moon" succeeds by being a modest, almost chamber-drama about the isolating and alienating effect technology can have on our lives. It conjures up a wonderful vision of loneliness and the longing for human contact. Sam Rockwell gives the performance of a lifetime, conjuring up anger, confusion, sadness, and humor in this multifaceted role.I appreciate that the director, Duncan Jones, didn't try to make too big of a movie. He treats this small and delicate picture with the care and nuance necessary to leave an impression, at least on me.Highlights from this film include excellent set design and application of miniatures with CGI being avoided almost entirely. I can't say that I miss it. The craftsmanship and attention to detail remind me of "2001" and "2010" in their dedication to quality. The soundtrack is superb as well with sad piano pieces and more modern industrial-sounding melodies.This movie is not for the science-fiction fan who wants explosions, gunfire, space battles, or any sort of action. It's a slow-burn of a drama, with questions about what the difference between a human and an individual is. Don't pass up a chance to spend a quiet evening with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recap: Sam Bell is an astronaut working for Lunar harvesting helium on the moon for Earth's fusion reactors. His three year contract is coming to an end, and he is looking forward to going home and reuniting with his wife and young kid. But he is having some peculiar visions, imagining people that isn't there. One of those lead to him having an accident getting trapped in a lunar rover. When he wakes up in the infirmary the station AI informs him he has been in an accident, but he can remember no details. When he goes outside the station he discovers the demolished rover, and to his surprise, a trapped astronaut inside it. Is he still imagining people, or, if the trapped astronaut is real, who is he? Comments: A very well written and inventive thriller using a possible aspect of a near future technology of cloning. It is an eerie suspense that slowly builds up with the uncertainties the characters feel, well acted and scripted so that I viewing also had my doubts of who was what or who.It is also interesting that a movie can be made so complex with only three characters, and two of them being the same person. The third is Gerty, the suspicious station AI, voiced by Kevin Spacey. The threat and suspense connected to it is not really external, not initially at least, but stems from Sam Bell's uncertainty of his own identity and sanity.One could extrapolate and have a serious discussion about cloning after having viewed this movie, but it also works well as pure entertainment. Duncan Jones is a new director that has also written the original story, having made a well made movie with good attention to detail. It will be interesting to see what Jones can make in the future.8/10</fullReview>

Moon is the story of an isolated man nearing the end of a 3 year gig at a mining operation on (you guessed it) the moon. And he is really looking like he's been there that long and can't wait to get back to Earth. Sam Rockwell plays astronaut Sam Bell who seems so bored he cannot wait to do menial tasks like jump into a surface rover and retrieve a cannister of mineral from one of the enormous terrestrial harvesters outside. Communications malfunctions are keeping him from any real time contact with his wife and daughter back home. At least that's one of the things he's meant to believe....Anyone isolated from regular human contact for that long is bound to start experiencing odd phenomena after a while. And Sam is no different. He begins to see brief visions of women where no woman should be. One of these visions leads to an accident with a surface rover. Sam wakes up from it on a slab in the infirmary, and that's where things start getting weird. (SPOILERS TO FOLLOW) The first odd thing we notice is that Sam Appears to have no visible injuries, even though we saw him take a pretty nasty shot to the head during the accident. Next, the helpful computer/robot voiced by Kevin Spacey instructs Sam he is not to go outside until help arrived from Earth to clean up the accident. Considering who/what Sam is, you'd think he would simply obey this directive. For Sam is just a clone. A clone of some long dead astronaut from years past. Every three years his physical form wears out, and a new one is created from a storage space below the facility. Sam makes it outside and finds the crash site. And soon, there is more than one Sam haunting the facility! Further plot details I urge you to experience for yourself.Director Duncan Jones and his crew create an aesthetically appealing moon surface and machines and equipment that look impressive. The acting, pretty much all by Sam Rockwell, is terrific. Rockwell has always been a valued performer not afraid of challenging roles in fringe projects. He clearly has the stuff to be a A-lister, but he sticks to more challenging roles. Kevin Spacey does a good enough HAL impression with a kind-sounding voice hiding all kinds of secrets and probably an agenda all his own. But this time, the computer seems to be helping the astronauts instead of hindering their plight. The film also gets props for not stringing us along with cryptic clues that will lead to a shocking revelation at the conclusion. We learn Sam's circumstances as he learns them, and that helps us identify with him. Even though he is clearly nothing like us, after all. The film loses points for falling back on that age-old cliché of having a huge and faceless corporation act as the bad guy. Just like in Alien and so many others. Also, the properties of gravity in this environment are not properly spelled out even though they must be somewhat different that those on Earth. Gravity seems to be just the same within this mining facility, and it doubtfully would be. Still, a wonderful effort and fine finished product. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trying my best not to spoil this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Give credit to Moon: instead of hoarding its dramatic twist for the final reel, as a more hackish filmmaker would do with this premise, it lets you know what's going on fairly early on and lets the implications of that percolate. If this makes the back half of the movie somewhat perfunctory, it does show its commitment to big, classical sci-fi ideas, which the 2001 nods are only a part of.Moon is based off of a series of fantastical conceits, but it's grounded in the world we live in more than many contemporary movies: it's a world of work, exploitation, and crises of identity. The drudgery of life may happen in space now, but it's drudgery nonetheless (here I'm reminded of Alien, another sci-fi classic). It also suggests that we need certain familiar fictions to keep that exploitation going: the loving family waiting at home, the supportive work environment, whatever drops of leisure we can get...Slickly produced, with a great claustrophobic aesthetic, Moon is a great think-piece film, especially for everyone who's been waiting years for a good science fiction movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe it was Rod Serling who often reminded audiences, the greatest terror we humans could ever face was isolation. Removed from our own kind, a man can easily succumb to it's terrifying power and in the end, go mad. In this 2009 film, writer/director, Duncan Jones, takes a page from Serling and relates the story of Sam Bell, (Sam Rockwell) an astronaut and mining engineer who has been contracted to live on the moon for three years. While there, working for Lunar Industries, he is to keep vigil on several moon excavators which automatically mine a substance call Helium 3 which is then 'harvested' and sent back to earth. Assisted by a robotic system named G.E.R.T.Y. (Kevin Spacy) Bell has done well to stay sane in this cold, dark, bleak lunar isolation. As time draws near for his contract to expire, he looks forward to returning to Earth and his wife and child. However, things which have gone well up till then, suddenly causes Bell to question his surroundings. Accidents, began to happen, dialog between himself and GERTY become confusing, he begins hallucinating and questioning himself and his CLONE. Although, the film itself is prone to some confusion, Rockwell does an exceptional job of keeping the audience focus towards a surprising ending. A memorable film and one which which sure to remind us of the Twilight Zone. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent thought-provoking sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The field of non-pulp science fiction film is sufficiently small that any new film will call to mind its predecessors. When, as in Moon, it presents elements of a puzzle, the mind is immediately set to mining those predecessors for clues and possible answers.So, when we meet Sam Bell near the end of his 3-year contract in isolation on the far side of the moon, and quite possibly going stir crazy with only computer/robot Gerty for company, our thoughts immediately suggest that Sam is going crackers/being influenced by his environment a la Solaris, and/or Gerty has gone mad and is playing tricks on him a la 2001. As it happens, there is another explanation, and one which is much more credible.This film is an engrossing conundrum with a standout performance, both technically and dramatically, from Sam Rockwell, and is well worth watching.I have only two reservations: one, the film works on the apparent assumption that clones are brought to full adulthood in a minimal timeframe and, two, there is a clear implication that the clones have a limited "shelf life", but this is never mentioned yet alone explored despite the fact that it looks as if it could usefully have been made into a major (and helpful) plot point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One small step for Bowie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You look like a radioactive tampon?like a banana with a yeast infection." Sam Rockwell's character, also named Sam, has some pretty nice one-liners in the movie Moon directed and written by Duncan Jones. Little know that Duncan Jones is also known as Zowie Bowie and that he is the son of musician David Bowie. I found this out after the movie and was glad to see that his family name wasn't used as a selling point. Not that the movie need any help. With a well- written story and screenplay it would be hard to mess a movie like this up.Sam Rockwell did a great job acting and keeping the viewer interested in the movie even though he is really the only live actor in it. Much like Tom Hanks in Castaway. Kevin Spacey was the perfect choice for the voice of GERTY the computer. GERTY could tell you that he was going to eat you alive and make it sound like a good thing. I don't see how Sam's character didn't go crazy sooner on his three-year mission with only GERTY to talk to.Read full review at FlicksWorthWatching.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has taken me a long time to get to see this movie and it was well worth the wait. Duncan Jones has crafted a great sci-fi film with a miniscule budget. Avatar schmavatar! DJ is every bit his creative father's son. I believe he can and will do great things within the movie business. A film like this, as good as this, could not have been made without a great lead and Sam Rockwell is terrific in this piece. He holds the whole thing together with a bravura turn. He is ably supported in this by the presence of Kevin Spacey (in voice only) as GERTY his computer assistant and protector. At first the premise is a little confusing but slowly everything drops into place and becomes clear. Jones directed his movie with assurance and no sign that he is a newcomer. I look forward to seeing further movies by an exciting new director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I highly recommend this compelling movie set on the Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set on the moon Sam Bell is coming to the end of a 3 year contract harvesting some kind of Helium compound from the moon which supplies most of the earths energy.He's only companion is the talking computer called Gerty and video messages sent from his wife from earth. That's right the corporation is too stingy to pay to fix it.Slightly slow to build up this story initially, Sam Bell is going a little mad having spent so much time on his own, when he goes out in one of the moon buggies to check up on one of the harvester machines. He's slight craziness hallucinates someone standing in the falling rocks ahead and he has a nasty accident, crashing into the harvester.When he wakes up, the film kicks into another gear - always leaving the viewer slightly guessing, working out what's going on in the moon station with Sam Bell is compelling stuff. This is such a good movie. The actor Sam Rockwell is essentially doing the whole thing on his own - like a Castaway set in space - with Kevin Spacey (Gerty) as a talking Wilson, which is very impressive as he carries the movie brilliantly.It's a very satisfying Movie as the questions it makes you ask about what is happening and what's going to happen are all answered by the end of the movie.I love the look of the movie - clean, futuristic, interesting - and the special effects are super and completely convincing.It's not perfect, I thought there were a couple of mess-ups with the plot regarding the accidents that had happened in the past - whether they had happened when Sam Bell arrived or whilst he has been working. I won't go into detail or it'll reveal to much of the plot.I thought the plot had some good emotional depth - helped by great acting, and a great plot; for example - moments of sadness and moments of self-sacrifice.I won't go into detail about what happens but it is fascinating and well worth watching. I highly recommend watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But I just wanted to add my voice in saying that this movie was great from beginning to end, from the time that it was shot in and the budget and during a writers strike all these things surprised me because this just felt top-notch from beginning to end. I do wish they got a tiny bit more into the hallucinations of the mysterious girl on the surface of the moon. I know it might have been of his wife or girlfriend or something I can't remember, but I do remember that it was too brief and unexplored. But I still wouldn't change anything about this movie. It was engaging and gripping the whole way through.There really aren't too many movies that I'd watch over and over again. But I would watch this again a few more times. It's just great. I love that robot and its awesome that Spacey's voice was used, it was perfect for the role. Even under very trying circumstances, a lot of the right things came together in the right order and time - plus of course the incredible effort of the cast and crew to make such an amazing experience of a movie. I gave it a 9/10, because this is good storytelling, and the effects were good and everything looked nice.Fantastic job everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Moon' is a sci-fi thriller that makes a very obvious acknowledgement of it debt to that definitive movie, '2001': it ponders (among other matters) the nature of artificial intelligence and the infinite loneliness and isolation of a life in space, while serving us with an aesthetic of sterile gleaming white, and digital communications devices that might have represented 1970's vision of the future but which already seem decades out of date. The film also addresses another sci-fi staple (though not one mentioned in Kubrick's work), namely the identity of clones, and actually does so with some skill, using its futuristic setting to explore questions of identity that have emotional impact in their own right, as well as thematic resonance in our own world. For sci-fi, this is a relatively low-budget movie: no explosions, an effective cast of one, and a set that at times looks as if it was made of Lego; yet it's sparse, haunting, and effective, and also less pretentious than its illustrious forebear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If sci-fi movies can invest less on too much action,meaningless effects and more on characters which we can connect with, I think they can come up with more movies like Moon.The movie Moon doesn't boast of a host of action heroes trying to save planets from alien invasions nor do we see anyone zoom through space in FTL drives.Too many characters don't clutter the canvas and allows a gradual building up of the story which is deeply contemplative and at the same time chillingly distant.The technology portrayed in the movie (moon landing has already happened, so is cloning though not of humans, colony on moon isn't too fantastic it might happen in few centuries compared to say FTL drives which are very far-fetched at present) isn't too futuristic which helps us connect with the story and at the same time it forces us to think about ethical/moral implications of such technologies.Though the story moves a bit lazily (only negative I can see and in-spite of it I give 10/10) it picks up pace towards the end and overall an excellent movie which is really worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Lunar Industries. Enjoy your stay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Science Fiction used to be just that: fictional storytelling that has an underlying, relatable theme set in a fantastic environment pseudo- grounded within the realities of science. Authors like Heinlein, Bradbury and Dick understood and thrived in this medium, setting the tempo for the imaginations of the next generation; their film adaptations, for the most part, were not as spectacular. That next generation, however, seemed to forget the thematic elements of such stories and focused instead on the spectacle of fiction. MOON has the pleasure of recapturing that feel and the message of those tales from a by-gone era.MOON is, essentially, a one-man play admirably performed by the Oscar- overlooked Sam Rockwell, playing Sam Bell, a miner overseeing a solo three-year operation on the moon. Bell spends his time focusing on his work, staving off boredom and interacting with the station's HAL-esque computer system, the Spielbergian-named GERTY, perfectly-voiced by a cold, or is that cool, Kevin Spacey. An accident out on the lunar surface gets Bell's attention that, surprise-surprise, things are not all well with Lunar Industries and that his indentured slavery to the corporation might be a greater price than imagined.Directed by Duncan Jones, whose father knows a thing or two about the oddities of space, MOON absorbs the viewer into Bell's tight living space. The film's lo-fi F/X work to its benefit amplifying that classic sf-movie feel giving proper attention to the story, not the visuals. But as such, the look is starting real as is the permeable paranoia that also exists on the station, a paranoia that is enhanced by Clint Mansell's simple yet haunting orchestration, a paranoia that leads to a quest for escape. But who can escape the reaches of a corporation? With MOON, Jones crafts a mystery around Bell's service, his life, and his destiny. He also brings into question how much of our souls are willingly sold to corporations and the almighty, intergalactic dollar as well as if we have what it would take to escape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique, thought provoking story. Superb acting. Some tedium.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fresh, unique storyline for a change. A thought provoking plot which doesn't fully reveal itself until the end. It will keep you guessing. Then watch the movie again with your new knowledge of the ending to fit the pieces into place. It will take 2 or 3 viewings to grasp all of the details and the implications of each.This is NOT an action movie so don't expect any. Frankly, I get quite tired of the mind-numbing shoot-em-up sci-fi's. I usually fast forward through those types of scenes to get to the meat of those types of movies. There is no shooting or violence or cowboy action in this movie.The story is intended to play with your mind similar to the style of Rod Serling. The actor, Sam Rockwell, does an outstanding performance acting against himself. He makes it quite believable and deserved more recognition for his performance.However, this movie is very slow paced and not for any A-type, impatient or short attention span personalities on a power trip. It is a very deep movie and requires above average IQ to appreciate the concept. It was a real treat to finally see a fresh SCI-FI storyline. I have seen just about every Sci-fi movie and series ever made and have more than 1000 in my personal video library, so when I say this is a fresh storyline, I mean it quite literally.It is not the issue of clones which is unique, it is rather the issue of who's who; when's when; how the pieces fit; and is it reality or madness which is quite unique in this movie. You will most definitely need to see it more than once to catch all the nuances you missed the first time.The only negatives I would note were the gruesome scenes where the one character is literally falling apart. It reminded me of the remake of "The Fly" when he was losing his teeth &amp; hair, etc. I could do without graphic scenes like that. I would have also added more healthy greenery &amp; colorful photos throughout the facility.The pace could be improved a bit by inserting more covert issues and scenes for the characters to pursue. Having the characters uncovering more secrets and better video exchanges from earth would improve the dry scenes where they are just glaring at the other. They should also be more interested in combining their efforts to uncover the intrigue. The scenes as they currently appear, would be better fitted to a 3 day timeline than 14 hours. It would be impossible for the characters to have done all of those things in that timeline. 3 days would be more realistic for the pace of the characters shown. Otherwise, the acting would need to show a more urgent sense of haste during this compressed timeline. At times, they showed an odd disinterest in events despite having just learned some shocking details. The personality of the robot was excellent as was the dialogue. Reminded me a bit of HAL 9000. I did like the fact that it was helping the characters beyond the limits of its programming. The only negative on the robot was the 70's design with the smiley faces. Giving it expressions was a good idea... but I would find a different method a bit more advanced.This movie was a rare pleasure to watch. It was well written, acted &amp; directed with quality authenticity and believability. Great attention to details was endeavored to make this movie seem real to the audience. I found it to be quite authentic. There were a few other slow paced space movies which similarly endeavored to be authentic: Marooned, Stranded, Apollo 13, Robinson Crusoe on Mars, Silent Running... were all slow paced in an effort to reflect authenticity, yet each had a unique story to tell. Space is cold, sterile and lonely, so to show it otherwise would not be representative of reality.The lowbrow complainers expect violence and computer generated effects, alien battles; bizarre costumes and sets and convulsive camera shots to substitute for their lack of plot comprehension. Just consider the source of these types of comments. The storyline is quite unique despite what these xgens may say (so just ignore the dullards, high-school dropouts &amp; anarchists who don't like anything that requires deep thinking). Some might even be from competitive studios using blogs or reviews as a weapon against the independents to keep them from gaining footing; a lot like political parties trying to maintain power and control.If you have an open imaginative mind which has the patience to enjoy reading books without requiring violence and space battles, you should not have any problem understanding and appreciating the concept of this script.I would have liked to have seen more of the rebound issues at the end of the movie. We only caught a brief moment of those events, but I understand they are making a sequel to be named, Mute which is supposed to be about those very issues. I think they should pick a better name, but, I look forward to seeing more of the spillover ramifications of the events brought to light in this.Definitely worth watching more than once.</fullReview>

It has special effects where it is needed and it doesn't look like a computer game (like Star Wars and so on) The special effects were perfect, the scenery was very stylish. The humor was top (The tabletop tennis game !) I also saw "Source code" of the same director. That was very well made too, but it lacked the cleverness of "Moon", that story was totally unbelievable. I think that for this director a big budget is not a guarantee for a good movie. So I hope Duncan gets a decent script (like Moon) for the next one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good indie old-style sci-fic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great British indie retro-sci-fic film that tells the story of a solar station on the moon and of San Bell, one of the caretakers, at the end of his 3-year contract.The aesthetics of the movie are very much the same you could find in classic sci-fi of the 1970s, with miniature lunar sets, clean white interiors and furniture. Even the robot is chunky and heavy, more emotional than functional, nothing to do with modern robotics. The lunarscapes are also very retro, with the use of miniature vehicles that do look real. It is a well-known setting by sci-fi lovers and very enjoyable to see reproduced. Even the atmosphere is classic, with that unsettling feeling of old sci-fi movies.Sam Rockwell really shines in his double performance, especially in the skin of the first character, showing what a great actor he is. The changes of clothing are minimal, but his performance really gives life to two different people. Really, this is a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. In fact, Rockwell makes the movie, as it is him who carries the weight of the story and makes it believable.Keven Spacey, the voice of robot Girty, is not especially inspired, though, as his voice is dull and plain and improper of a robot like the one in the movie, which is very chunky, heavy and not that developed. One would expect 1/ a more mechanical voice, if the robot is as it looks 2/ a more human voice, with more human inflexions and tone, in case the chunkiness is just apparent.The storyline is excellent, but the script and the mood of the movie get deflated mid way, as the movie does not have a marked tempo and the in crescendo necessary for the viewer to get excited and anxious towards the end. Although the story carries on very well, there is not enough tension and mystery to give the movie the little push up it need it to get a more rounder film.I hated the voice in off at the end, summarizing what happens at the arrival to earth... which I found a little bit cheesy and unnecessary, unless you want to shoot another movie departing from that.The DVD contained a short film "The Whistle", which I found quite interesting, with good ideas and characters, but dull and with not enough dramatic and mystery tension.</fullReview>

One does not notice at first, but then realizes that this is a film supported by a single actor: Sam Rockwell. Few films have been sustained by a single actor. It has the intimate warmth of Ray Bradbury's stories and the environment " 2001: A Space Odyssey " 1968.It is an intimate, existential and transcendental film that tells the weaknesses of human beings in the vastness of the cosmos and as a metaphor for daily life. You realize how small it is. This void in the family and personal environment brings out the protagonist his paranoia and insecurities, adding that economic interests at any cost is shipped the despotic company, right behind the astronaut. As a good "Guinea pig", Sam Rockwell discovers a secret network of the company was to plan b, if something went wrong. And also, in that plot twist, is where the film gains more strength."Moon" is a science fiction film moving, leaving the footprint and induces a pleasant reflection and melancholy. It is a story of loneliness and survival, of friendship, profound ode to freedom and life. The interpretation of Sam Rockwell is exceptional, fascinating perspectives addressing. His adventures in space are fresh, vital, amazing. His irreverent and aggressive point sweetens the excessive rigidity of the environment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of those movies that I kept thinking about for days after watching it.Where moon succeeds so spectacularly is in creating an understated but very believable environment which the story grows out of. Its a little slow starting off but in some ways this actually adds to the realism as you can appreciate just how bored this guy must be being up on the moon all by himself.The cinematography is a real highlight. The filmmakers manage to capture something of the sheer grandeur and awe that being on the final frontier must feel like. There are lots of shots pulled far away and above the action that give the viewer a real sense of wide open space and context. What a treat this movie would be to see at the IMAX and if it had been in 3D.Sam Rockwell delivers an undeniably excellent performance. He really caries the film. From watching the making of documentary it was his performance that sold Kevin Spacey to get involved in the project and become the voice of Gurty. Kevin Spacey as Gurty is also perfectly cast because Kevin has that always even keeled detached quality to his voice that is perfect for representing an Artificial Intelligence.Nothing in this movie is in your face. Even the plot twists aren't designed to shock you so much as make you think. Its more of a slow burner that is best watched when you aren't looking for some cheap entertainment and have the time and patience to discover this guys world. Obviously since I gave it 10 stars I think its worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I try not to give anything away, so no real spoilers here.Remember the great genre classics "2001: A Space Odyssey", "Alien" and "Blade Runner"? Sure you do, as do I, so I was right at home with this film. This is not a straight rip-off by any means of any of those films, but there are certain borrowed elements which you will recognize right away. I like to think that the makers of this movie wanted to tell a story, and at the same time pay their respects for the great classics, and it worked. Duncan Jones has created/directed/co-written a very good story, and I am hoping to see more of his work in the future. The story is simple and engaging. There are a couple of twists, but only to add to the story, not to destroy the last 120 minutes you've seen. "Moon" is a character-driven movie with a great, simple and nice atmosphere and it's just as much a drama as it is a sci-fi movie. This isn't an action movie, but I believe even people with short attention spans can enjoy "Moon". I didn't experience even one boring second, I couldn't even pause the movie and go for a smoke which is a thing I often do. Those looking for hard sci-fi may be disappointed though, because this is a rather simple movie at its heart.Visually "Moon" does just fine, and there is not a lot of CGI here but more like believable sets, miniature models and the good old stuff. "Moon" does not look cheap or bad, and everything feels "right". You can feel the moon base is the main character's home and you feel the isolation that comes with it. That's something you don't get with money, but with talent and passion. Also, music is very, very good. The themes have a nice feeling to them and the timing is always right. Clint Mansell became one of my favorite composers because of this film - although he's done some really nice work before and after this too.But enough about that, let's get on to what's the movie about. Meet Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), who has been on the moon for almost three years, monitoring the mining of Helium-3 - which has basically solved most of the energy problems back on earth. He has been alone for the entire time, except for GERTY, his loyal robot assistant. Sometimes he would get a video message from the company he works for or from his wife on earth, but that's it. He can't have live conversations with anyone on earth, since a satellite has broken. The guy is alone, and it's starting to show in him. He's counting the days of the last remaining two weeks on the job. At this point I will stop so I don't spoil anything. This is just the setting for this film.Since the movie is pretty much about a guy who is alone in the moon, the main actor would have to really deliver. And I knew it - Sam Rockwell not only delivered, but delivered in style. It would be easy to overact in such a demanding role as this one, but Rockwell handles it like the pro he is. I have been impressed with him a couple of times before, but with "Moon" he made it to my A-list of actors whose movies I will surely see in the future. Let's not forget about GERTY the robot/AI here. He is a character as well. His calm voice (Kevin Spacey, I didn't even realize it was him before I saw the credits) will definitely make you feel something, and the character is well handled - he seems just enough human to provoke feelings but at the same time enough of a machine to make him...well, just a machine. I absolutely loved GERTY in this film. This film is paced wonderfully. Cinematography is great to watch, props look good, sound department deserves a pat on the back, the script is solid. It's all quality. I really felt 100% satisfied after seeing "Moon". This might be remembered as a cult classic later. It's not wholly revolutionary in the sense that it isn't too intellectual or challenging, and it does borrow some elements from other classics, but when you do it like this, I'm all in. "Moon" is one of my all-time sci-fi favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a great Twilight Zone or Outer Limits extra-long episode</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is a contemplative psychological mystery sci-fi movie like we rarely see anymore. An astronaut lives at a base on the far side of the moon at a mining base, collecting and sending canisters of a precious isotope back to Earth. He has a 3 year-contract and in that time he lives totally isolated except for a robot companion and recorded messages from his wife. You see his life has become pretty much routine, until a certain accident... where he will meet someone looking very much like him... (not a spoiler : seen in the trailer).What would you do if you met someone like yourself when you thought you were unique ? That's not only food for thought but also a disturbing mystery. "Moon" is slow to start but soon turns more and more intriguing. The strength here is in the storyline more than in the somewhat eighties-looking special effects. The effects are quite acceptable by the way and seamless when 2 particular characters are together. The night skies seemed a bit fake though. The biggest flaw I noticed was the reaction, or lack thereof, of the 2 main characters when they meet. That didn't seem real to me. Interrogations regarding their respective nature do occur but a tad too late.Other than that, Sam Rockwell did an amazing acting job and he keeps our interest high even when not much is happening. He also manages to convey the few dramatic moments quite well. Beyond the acting, it's the mysteries that keeps us watching, not only the big obvious one but also the mysteries of the human (and non-human) reactions to such unexpected circumstances. The robot companion is rather low-tech with his static smiley faces but with the soothing voice of Kevin Spacey and some surprising actions becomes quite a memorable character. The minimal soundtrack comprised mostly of simple piano is very good. Despite being outwardly sci-fi and seemingly cold like its namesake, Moon is a very intimate and human experience that deserves to be watched except for those who absolutely need lots of action. Rating : 7.5 out of 10 (very good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern sci-fi masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few interesting or original science fiction films made anymore, usually they production places all of its emphasis on special effects and space invaders. I had heard great reviews about this film before I originally saw it and I was not disappointed. I won't spoil the plot but the themes are interesting and emotive. There is a depressing almost hopeless theme throughout about loss, Insignificance and identity and that is conveyed by Sam Rockwell's stunning performance. Spacey who voices the initially sinister seeming AI character is adds to the unsettling and claustrophobic atmosphere in a similar way to HAL in 2001 where you can't help draw comparisons. Clint Mansell's soundtrack is beautiful and fits perfectly. It's a more accessible film to 2001 and Solaris but equally powerful. You won't need to be a sci-fi fan to appreciate this, one of the best films of recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hugely impressive first feature from Duncan Jones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy sci-fi movies just as much as the next person, and heard so many great things about Moon. To me, it was every bit as good as I had heard, and notable for two things especially.One is Duncan Jones' direction. For a first feature, I was hugely impressed by the assurance and consistency of the direction here. The other is Sam Rockwell, I have always liked him, and in Moon he is simply amazing in perhaps his best performance.But these two elements are not the only outstanding elements. The production values may be low-budget, but looking at the film you wouldn't guess that, it does look very polished. The story is explored in a delicate and intriguing fashion with themes of loneliness and humanity, and the script is intelligent and poignant.The rest of the cast are fine, in particular Kevin Spacey as the voice of Gerty, and the characters are interesting. Though at the end of the day it is Rockwell's film.All in all, hugely impressive and one of my favourites of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very well made and acted... but I do not get it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give only 6, because for all its strengths (excellent acting, very good music, directing, special effects etc) I just do not see the point of this movie. Oh loneliness sucks? Hmm, I did not know that. A person alone for 3 years starts to talk to himself?? Wow. A father and a husband misses his family?? Revelation. The entire premise of the implanted memories of his (their) wife and child makes no sense, because they are... CLONES!!! Why would the sinister company behind, that sent Sam into space, even consider implanting memories about a fake family? I do not know, other than to give the film more emotional and psychological depth. But it is stupid nonetheless, because... they are CLONES!!!! The company could have made and programmed the clones not to talk to each other, for example, and to have NO memories whatsoever, other than the need and desire to work. If they can implant any memories, why not that of a cult of efficiency and necessity to do as much work as possible while asking as few questions as possible. But then there would be no film, u see. In addition, the new Sam's "victory" at the end is very short-lived, as every clone is clearly designed to live exactly 3 years only. So for me the film is very well crafted, but pointless. Unless its point was to support the idea of human cloning. In this case it is very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the pace and mood of this, but the plot was unsatisfying.It's a good set up, but you wonder why the base isn't fully automated, why replacing the caretaker every three years is more expensive than supplying hundreds of clones, and how the hero is expected to survive in the escape pod.Also there was a suggestion of menace from the robot early on, but later it became so helpful you'd think it was there for exposition: "Yes, you are a clone. And yes, I won't tell my masters you have figured out their game".And finally - what was with the hallucination of the girl in the armchair in the first few minutes? It gave the impression of the supernatural, but the story was about skinflint corporate deception.The lead does a great job playing a double hand, and the moonscapes were cool.Plus there's a nice alarm clock gag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lunar Labour Pool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Moon", a nifty little science-fiction movie, Sam is the only human inhabitant of a lunar mining facility where all the work is done by machines. The facility is run by a computer named Gerty. Sam is there to perform work that Gerty, due to its physical limitations, cannot manage. In a very real sense, Gerty's the boss. Gerty even has real-time meetings with its superiors on Earth, which Sam doesn't know about. Sam is not in the loop. Gerty is more than just boss. He's the resident cook, doctor, psychiatrist, and...priest? I don't want to give any of the story away, but certain other duties fall within Gerty's purview.Sam is on the facility for a three-year tour of duty, after which he will head home to his beautiful wife and little girl - and that is in a matter of weeks. But the solitude has taken its toll on him. He seems to be cracking up, and he's become somewhat derelict. He just waits and dreams the same dreams that we all do. And then, that wonderful inevitability that happens in movies. Something occurs that's not supposed to, and things get really interesting. Director Duncan Jones has, in a sense, let the story tell itself. The pace is leisurely by today's standards, and he has not succumbed to any temptation he might have had to jack up the thriller elements or sci-fi voodoo. Best of all, Actor Sam Rockwell has been given all the room he needs to do his thing and he delivers a compelling performance. Rockwell's Everyman not only has something for each of us, individually, to latch onto, but also provides fodder for the discussion of this film as a whole. Sam (the character) is pushed to question nothing less than his entire existence.It appears that very little CGI was used in the making of this film and that the moon's surface was a model set. It's obvious that a lot of love and care went into the making of "Moon". It's a quiet, engaging little surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An astronaut miner extracting the precious moon gas that promises to reverse the Earth's energy crisis nears the end of his three-year contract, and makes an ominous discovery in this psychological sci-fi film starring Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey. For three long years, Sam Bell has dutifully harvested Helium 3 for Lunar, a company that claims it holds the key to solving humankind's energy crisis. As Sam's contract comes to an end, the lonely astronaut looks forward to returning to his wife and daughter down on Earth, where he will retire early and attempt to make up for lost time. His work on the Selene moon base has been enlightening -- the solitude helping him to reflect on the past and overcome some serious anger issues -- but the isolation is starting to make Sam uneasy. With only two weeks to go before he begins his journey back to Earth, Sam starts feeling strange: he's having inexplicable visions, and hearing impossible sounds. Then, when a routine extraction goes horribly awry, it becomes apparent that Lunar hasn't been entirely straightforward with Sam about their plans for replacing him. The new recruit seems strangely familiar, and before Sam returns to Earth, he will grapple with the realization that the life he has created may not be entirely his own. Up there, hundreds of thousands of miles from home, it appears that Sam's contract isn't the only thing about to expire. Starring Sam Rockwell, Kaya Scodelario, Benedict Wong, Matt Berry, Malcolm Stewart , Dominique McElligott , Kevin Spacey.a great hit at BAFTA and British Indie Awards but wasn't an Oscar Nominee.OK so this is one of the most discussed movies of the past years. i would say it is a good entry in Sc Fi genre. for such a small movie to be this much good is a nice thing. i would say that this is slightly overrated movie. i had a good time, i liked the movie but it could have been so much better. Sam Rockwell's performance, background score and the whole set up of this movie are the only good things. i do however appreciate Duncan Jones' effort for trying this, a good step for which he got deserved appreciation. i still however prefer his latest effort Source Code over this.this is a small budget Indie Sci Fi movie set in space, over Mon obviously. it is however more of a mystery drama than a thriller, or was the thrill part not good. a man called Sam Bell experiences some personal crisis as he nears the end of a 3 year solitary stint mining helium-3 on the far side of the moon. he works there but he experiences some unusual situation and after an accident as he wakes up to find that there is another him, a clone. the whole set up is a lie, the are just used for work there ad after 3 years contract they have to change to give another colne a try. the whole lie process repeat all over. while what happens that yo have to see for yourself. he is accompanied by a smart artificial intelligence named GERTY voiced by Kevin Spacey.as i said earlier, Sam Rockwell gave the best performance of his career, he deserved more praise than what he got. he is a good actor, i think like that now for him after this movie. i don't however remember his best performance yet that some negative supporting roles here and there. but he gave a believable and quite well done performance. Kevin Spacey's voice was well used.Duncan Jones has a great crave for Sci Fi and i would really appreciate if he does some good for this genre right now because i see a good vision in him for this genre which however been ruined by many movies, obviously some exception. he is a good director however i don't think this was his best work. Screenplay had some problem towards the end, it looses the momentum after that one twist. plot again is not thin or very thick. i wish it was written more well. excellent score by Clint Mansell, right from the start his score makes the atmosphere isolated, lonely and haunting. Editing was good enough and effects were quite simple and so good for a movie like this, not over done. it proved that a sci fi movie doesn't always need a Trillion dollar budget to prove its good.some viewers suggested it is very complicated, i thought it lacked that. i mean to call it as confusing as Inception is an insult to Nolan, this was a plane simple movie. without knowing anything about this movie i guessed what was going to happen, twists weren't surprising for me nor was shocking. predictable movie. but i really appreciated the effort. a good movie for a one time watch. Critics and Viewers however overrated it a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They do make movies like this anymore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The science fiction Genre is so broad that there really should be sub-genres within it.On the one end you would have Science Action 'Star Wars', 'Independence Day' and 'Avatar' type movies, where there are definitive heroes and villains, space battles, lasers and a general sound and vision extravaganza.On the other end you would have Science Drama movies like '2001', 'Blade Runner', 'The Thirteenth Floor' where the place is slow, the viewer is required to figure the plot out for himself, the action is minimal and heroes and villains are either non existent or interchangeable.'Moon' definitely fits within the latter category. 'Moon' is dark, broody and atmospheric, there is only one main character throughout the entire length of the movie and pace of the movie is extremely slow.Sam Rockwell plays the part of Sam superbly. The effects convey the disconnection and isolation extremely well and the music is minimal and spot-on. The voice of Kevin Spacey for GERTY was rather distracting and I would have preferred a voice that I didn't actually recognise. The plot is reasonably solid and keeps you thinking. To be honest as with most movies nowadays nearly everyone will figure out where the story is going well before the punchline. I think that movie goers have pretty much seen it all.***major spoiler Alert*** Many of those who have pointed out plot holes have not really thought their holes through. The most expensive factor in maintaining a staff presence on the moon is the actual cost of the trip from Earth safely to the Moon. It is THE main reason why we've never been back there since 1972. It is cheaper to send an unmanned probe to Mars than it is sending a manned mission to the Moon. The last mission, Apollo 12 cost $1.5bn. In todays costs you're probably talking $50-100bn per single trip.By comparison, once you've perfected the biological duplication aspects of cloning, the cost of production is negligible. Dolly the sheep didn't cost billions. I'd safely assume that the cost of sending up a module that maintained clones in suspended animation and released them as needed would be negligible by comparison especially being based where there exists a readily available source of electricity.The level of technology shown in the movie would indicate that despite the advanced level of robotics, a human is required on the base to trouble shoot and manage the operations.Another plot hole that keeps coming up on IMDb is why if it is possible to program a memory, is it not possible to program a clone to simply perform its duties without question. Again this plot hole coming from so-called sci-fi buffs defies logic. A clone is still an intelligent human being and you cannot program a human being without that human being then questioning their programming. It is far easier to give a human being a purpose and a reason for doing something than to command it to do something as with NLP, hypnosis and brainwashing.My guess is that the original Sam was sent to the lunar base for the first time with his memories being copied before his duties commenced. The corporation then decided to see how long Sam could stay there before cracking up and discovered that 3 years was his limit. They then gave the clones a limit of 3 years and used the recorded messages from Sams wife to simulate the environment for the cloned Sams. Whereas the original Sam was sent back home, the cloned ones were not.As with pretty much all science fiction, you still require a certain suspension of belief. You of course have to accept that it is possible to artificially insert memories. If you really put yourself into the mindset of Sam, the most haunting aspect of the movie really hits home. And that is the realisation that countless Sams will have lived out their 3 year lives in yearning anticipation of going home to their family. To see them climb into the pods expecting to be jettisoned back to earth to then be incinerated was deeply saddening. Not only is Sams life meaningless, he is no more than a product in a line of disposable products.The only real plot hole for me is Gerty. A corporation with so much invested in the project would not allow its programming to be able to sabotage the operation by helping Sam to learn the truth. This is one of the reasons why I'm not giving this movie a 10. The other reason being the bog standard typical Hollywood fairytale ending. The perfect ending for me would have been for the two earlier Sams to die having learned that those on planet earth are well aware and accepting of the disposable status of clones and the situation on the Moon, and for the new Sam to wake up oblivious to what has happened.Sometime hopelessness and the insignificance of our existence in the greater scheme of things is a fact of life that we conveniently forget.The movie itself raises real questions that will need to be answered soon. Technically we are already capable of cloning a human and it is only a matter of time before we do so, if we have not done so already. If a corporation was responsible for bringing a cloned human into existence would it be justified to view that clone as an 'investment' and therefore the property of that corporation? Would the rest of humanity feel threatened by clones and consider them to be sub-human and therefore undeserving of the rights that the rest of us enjoy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Moon"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Helium-3 provides something like seventy percent of the Earth's energy, and Lunar Industries has a corner on the market. Their profit margins must be huge too, since overseeing the mining operation on the moon's surface is apparently a one man job. That man is Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), who's coming into the home stretch of a three-year haul when he starts to feel physically and mentally unwell. His condition is only compounded when he discovers the body of a man bearing him more than considerable resemblance outside the station."Moon" is an earnest, almost postmodern science fiction film with good intentions and some great ideas. Director Duncan Jones' story is thoughtful but not dense, and though he occasionally stumbles in translating his ideas to the screen, he's crafted a compelling anti- blockbuster worth the price of admission.The world of "Moon" is largely homage, lovingly cobbled together from shards of sci-fi greats. GERTY, Bell's robot assistant (voiced by Kevin Spacey in an uncommonly quiet performance), is HAL 9000 by way of emoticons. Bell's hallucinations recall Tarkovsky's "Solaris," and the sets fall somewhere between "Star Wars" and Ridley Scott's "Alien." Everything has an appropriate matte sheen to it that pleasingly disregards the recent SFX trend to over-shine. Though there are a few effects shots in the film, including one that almost perfectly recreates Dave's psychedelic voyage at the end of Kubrick's "Space Odyssey," the exterior moon sequences were shot using models, and the film's aesthetic feels all the more consistent for it.The greatest flaw of "Moon" is not necessarily its early plot twist, but rather the way it knowingly strings the audience along in another direction beforehand. The film travels the comfortable path cut by so many established science fiction films that when it swerves off- road, the viewer is uncomfortably jarred. Jones is a little dishonest in depicting Sam's plight, and so the moment of revelation is met with distrust instead of the desired, "Ah ha!" It's only a brief detour, however, and once the cards are on the table and the plot continues to unfold, all is more or less forgiven.That's really the worst of it, suffice it to say "Moon" is never particularly challenging. It might be because the film deals in so many degrees of familiarity, or because the Bells' scenario, when revealed, plays out relatively without incident. It's a subtle shade of good, though doesn't take us where truly great science fiction does: where no man has gone before. Jones has a lot going for him, and Rockwell easily carries the film, playing his part(s?) expertly. The cinematography is fluid and unobtrusive, and yet "Moon" is somehow less than excellent."Moon" sounds incredible on the page, and occasionally is on screen, but mostly settles for offbeat and interesting, which is still a welcome alternative to pseudo sci-fi garbage like "Terminator: Salvation" or "Transformers 2." It's an interesting companion piece to "Star Trek," which was equally successful on the other end of the action spectrum, if a bit riskier in concept for a mainstream popcorn movie. Jones' film is an enjoyable but ultimately safe take on the genre that pays off to an extent, but will leave those hoping for mind-expanding science fiction revelry wanting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Sides of the Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Mild Spoilers) Not that I had anything particularly bad to say about 'Moon' when I give it a straight-average rating, but it wasn't something that jumped out at me as wonderful or incredibly bad. I liked the sets, the lunar shots and I always love Kevin Spacey, even just for his voice. But on the dark side of this 'Moon,' it was rather slow at times, it had the same ole corporate story (Ripley didn't just battle aliens in her outer space films) and Rockwell ? act as he might, he never really does anything for me. 'Moon' is set on a moon base, a few weeks shy of the end of the three year contract for Sam. We're told up to this point that he's heard voices, seen images of people not there ? side effects of long-term space jobs. What could possibly go wrong with only mere weeks left? Enter another Sam, or is it an image, or is it a clone? I liked how the movie turned from somewhat boring scenes of working out and connecting with his wife/daughter on Earth to the mystery of Sam 2.0. I think it was a noble effort and on the same track of another low-budget space movie 'Sunshine.' Both were based on very old ideas, both with twists and both without the budget to be a huge box-office hit. I can recommend it for those interested in sci-fi and are extremely tired of the alien/dark corners genre that's overcome a lot of sci-fi movies of the past decades. Also for Sam Rockwell fans (again, I'm not one of them) due to this being basically a one-man Rockwell-fest. I, on the other hand, wish just once big-bad corporate doesn't play the bad guy. Yeah, I know in reality, they're rarely perfect, but still.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an odd coincidence that Bowie pere et fils both broke through commercial,y with space-themed works, father David Bowie with his classic single "Space Oddity" and son Duncan Jones with this offbeat science fiction movie. Both touch on themes of loneliness and remoteness too.Watching "Moon" one is reminded of space-ship/station bound features of yesteryear, "Silent Running" and of course "2001", but director Jones boldly limits us to almost a lone actor for the duration, albeit duplicated, if not triplicated and Sam Rockwell does a good job playing essentially two sides of his own persona. The plot takes a little figuring out, but centres on prolonging the working life of employees in dangerous environments and as such has some relevance to today's technology of using robots and nano-bots to do things we humans can't. It is though a bit of a po-faced watch, although I got the joke about Rockwell's alarm clock awakening him each day to the dulcet tunes of one-hit-wonder Chesney Hawkes "The One And Only", which he patently isn't. The special effects are actually anything but, very Gerry Anderson circa 1965 model-sets but the story's not about SFX in any case.Maybe I just prefer my space-outpost dramas to have some rampaging evil monster on hand to up the body count, which is perhaps it didn't completely grab my attention, but it's a quirky story, with a decent twist, well told, even if it never quite took off for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the low budget, this DOES make you think. It has aspects of 2001, Blade Runner, Saturn 3, and Outland ( and maybe others ), but in a very unique way.Spoiler 1: Sam is a clone ( ala Blade Runner ). We find out that the clones just last 3 years, and then the clone is destroyed, and a new clone awoken. Why they stocked up on decades of clones isn't really answered.Spoiler 2: The evil corporation ( ala Outland ) sends killers to eliminate the old clone ( rescued by the new clone after he awakens ). The countdown is right out of Outland.Spoiler 3: While the moon is not a moving space ship ( ala 2001 ), the similarity is there, and Gerty is less deranged than Hal.Spoiler 4: Sam is there to ship harvested Helium and maintain the harvesting equipment ( as opposed to the hydroponics of Saturn 3 ).Spoiler 5: The plot is usually predictable after the second clone is activated, but takes some interesting plot twists after the third one wakes up.This is worth the time to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Its Progenitor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever bought the store or generic version of a name brand product? Usually this process ends with you telling yourself, "Oh, that's why I buy the name brand. The knock-off sucks!" However, sometimes you stumble upon a generic version that's as good as or even better than the more-accepted brand. Good news! This picture is better!!At first, this movie seems strikingly analogous to the Sci-Fi Classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Both pictures share a lunar connection, although this one (Moon) takes place entirely on...well...the moon. The eerie, melancholic voice of an AI (Artificial Intelligence) seems to be the only break in what can almost be described as a maddening tranquility. Yet, GERTY is very different from HAL 9000; the sine qua non lies in its programming, and in its unique relationship(s) to Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell). Aside from lunar scenery and computer sentience, this cinematic wonder offers up some unique perspectives on death and dying, friendships and family, Jungian Archetypes (with the grand conclusion of the Individuation process - e.g., the making of the model town), and even Dissociative Identity Disorder (multiple personality disorder). And, all of that fits comfortably within the realm of cloning and psychosomatic auditory and visual hallucinations.I guess what I'm saying is that this movie rocks. It might be a bit too slow for the average moviegoer, but the serious watcher will surely enjoy it. And, yes, I'm serious... and don't call me Shirley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dark side of the moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is a movie that rides that fine line between sci-fi cliché and pure originality. It is by no means a game changer in the sci-fi genre but it accomplishes everything it intends to commendably.Sam Rockwell gives out an excellent performance as the lead Sam Bell, a lunar astronaut stationed on the far side of the moon to mine Helium. He is accompanied by an AI named GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) who reminds the viewer of HAL in Space Odyssey. The story revolves around the emotions of a man yearning to return home after years of service and the crushing feeling that he just might not.The cinematography is excellent and the director manages to hide its low budget brilliantly. Moon is an enjoyable sci-fi experience that does not overwhelm the viewer with needless amount of CGI but relies more on the script and the acting prowess of Sam Rockwell, and leaves the viewer to discern their own ending with the voice-cuts at the end</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow burning but excellent psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Moon" isn't really a sci-fi movie at all. It's more a study of humanity that happens to take place in space. At the start of the movie we see Sam (Sam Rockwell) working alone on the dark side of the moon. He is the sole human present, in charge of a mining operation. He is helped by Gerty, a computer voiced by Kevin Spacey.He is coming towards the end of his three-year contract and can't wait to get home to see his wife and child. His loneliness has been worsened due to a problem with communications from Earth to the base, meaning that he can only receive and send recorded video messages. Then he starts seeing mysterious figures inside and outside of the base. It's obvious that all is not as it seems.Revealing any more would give away the plot. Suffice it to say "Moon" is an excellent slow-burn psychological thriller that has plenty of twists and turns in its ninety minutes. Rockwell is very good as the bewildered worker.Definitely worth a viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So very difficult to fault</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then a film comes along where everything that it does, it does superbly and Moon is one of those films. The story is interesting and never loses its footing. The acting/ actor is brilliant, Sam Rockwell continues to amaze and the direction is spot-on. While I do not give the film a 10, anyone should check this out sometime, it is not essential but it is worth watching.The story is difficult to describe without spoiling anything but if you have seen the trailer, then you will know what the film is about. Yet despite a simple premise, the film feels very emotional; you think about how you would cope under the conditions that the character is in and therefore you sympathise with him. Assisting in making this a fantastic film is the soundtrack. Composed by Clint Mansell who quickly becoming 'that guy who makes epic music' does a great job in making a peaceful soundtrack that reflects the films story. Other impressive features include the cinematography and the special effects. All scenes that take place outside on the surface of the moon have a unique style that while it does not look photo-realistic, is impressive and the crew should be recognised in being able to make a sci-fi film on a limited budget. Duncan Jones rightfully won his BAFTA but it is still a shame that the film did not receive more recognition. While the film could have been longer, what it has is more than enough in order to make this a film well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something to Think About for a Change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes it is derivative, but there is no secret about that. It's as if 2001 was moved into the future and now the exploiters of both resources and humanity have found a way to ply their trade. It took some time to get involved in this and, of course, when dual identities begin to happen, we need to regroup. The acting is fantastic. Having just the voice of Kevin Spacey is quite novel. In 2001, HAL showed some compassion, but had a heart of stone. His programming was limited. Here, the computer has involved a compassionate side. I don't know if this is truly explained other than it begins to analyze the needs of those he protects. When the newer Outer Limits series appeared on HBO, there was an episode where the memories of the central figure were implanted. This had some similarities. It also deals with the morality of using clones and sentient creatures as slaves. This is an incredibly thoughtful film. I had not heard about it when it first appeared. I'm glad I took a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of those special films that comes out very rarely, you might only get one a year (if you're lucky). Low key, subtle, not at all over the top in effects, action, dialogue, romance, anything. Just a damn good watch and a movie that tells an interesting, multifaceted story. Certainly not a blockbuster that keeps you on the edge of your seat, nor would it claim to be that type of film, but nonetheless one of the most riveting films I've seen in a while.I've always liked Sam Rockwell in everything he's been in, he's got a certain intangible quality that I find accessible in an actor, even as the truly evil William Wharton in The Green Mile. He's the main reason I was so interested in seeing this, and here, in his biggest role yet, he's definitely at his best. For this film to work, the person who played the main character was the most important decision to make, and they couldn't have picked anyone better. Sam Rockwell's just so believable.A fantastic directorial debut, and considering who the director's dad is, boy is there some talent in that family.Highly enjoyable, even more highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthwhile Ethical Dilemma That Needed To Be More Front And Centre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a worthwhile ethical dilemma at the heart of this film. Set in the future (although it isn't entirely clear how far in the future) a company called Lunar Industries has developed a way of essentially mining energy from the dark side of the moon and returning it to earth as a clean source of energy here. To keep the mining base operating an astronaut is sent up on a three year contract, where he's completely alone except for a computer/robot named Gerty (a little bit reminiscent of Hal from "2001.") The astronaut is Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell.) Three years is a long time to be totally alone and as the movie opens, Sam is approaching the end of his contract and is looking forward to returning to earth, his wife and his daughter. But in those last couple of weeks, unusual things begin to happen, and it seems as if Sam is having strange hallucinations - perhaps not surprisingly since he's been alone for all that time. Without giving too much away, eventually this becomes a dilemma about taking a strictly utilitarian view of human life. Is human life only useful as long as it's - well - useful? The question is worthwhile. Even in our own time, there's the danger of human life being reduced to the role we play or the job we have, rather than being honoured for who we are. Mind you, that question really only gets raised once the mystery of what's happening to Sam is revealed, which is the basic problem. It takes quite a while (at least in the context of a movie that lasts only a bit longer than an hour and a half) for the mystery that surrounds Sam to be revealed, and without that answer, the movie is confusing rather than thought-provoking, and you do wonder just where it is that the movie wants to take you.I guess in the end that was the biggest problem I had with the movie. Aside from the potentially worthwhile ethical question (which I thought should have been a little more front and centre and which should have been raised a lot earlier) this really isn't an especially interesting movie. Sam Rockwell's performance was good. It's basically a one man movie, and he pulls it off. It isn't the most powerful one-man performance I've ever seen. For a truly superb and recent virtually one- man performance think James Franco in "127 Hours." Rockwell's performance doesn't have the power of Franco's, but he's good in the role. The setting is appropriately stark, given that this is set in a space station on the dark side of the moon. Gerty turns out to be a likable enough computer/robot (although I was unconvinced about the need to use Kevin Spacey as Gerty's voice. Who cares? That seemed to be to be little more than an excuse to put a big name in the credits.)The basic problem I found with this is that it just wasn't that interesting. It wasn't especially energetic and until the ethical dilemma was finally revealed, it seemed to have very little purpose or direction - which is fine to an extent (I understand the need to set up the mystery) but we needed to get to the dilemma a lot sooner than we did. Overall, while there were certainly some redeeming qualities to this, I was disappointed. (3/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had way more potential then it lived up to but it was still entertaining to watch. The biggest problem i had with movie is that you figure out the whole scheme less then halfway through it. This kind of made watching the rest of the movie pointless because you already knew everything that was going on. If they would have made the whole plot/story line a little more mysterious and thrilling, it would have got a better rating from me. i don't have much else to say but there is a ten line minimum for posting reviews so i am going to continually type about this until i hit the ten line mark but i cant think of how else to run on this sentence, oh wait, just hit 10 lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many nods to great sci-fi movies here, that I understand if some might feel cheated. But I hope that you don't feel this way about this movie. It has a great (weird) little story at it's basis, that will keep you guessing, where it is heading next (especially if you haven't read anything about the plot before you go ahead and watch it). Which is a really rewarding experience! When I first heard about the director trying to push his lead actor into the Oscar run, saying his performance got overlooked, I was surprised at how persistent he was. Now that I have watched it, I have to admit, that he is right and that he did deserve to get a nod (at least). He had to work quite a few things out, while he was making the movies. Like the frame of mind and other stuff.It really is funny, dramatic and suspenseful and pulls it off, without any big problems. Kudos to the script, the director and our main actor. If you like Sci-Fi, you have to watch this!</fullReview>

For something like this to work in our wonderful new millennium, you really need to instill the basic story arc with an interesting subplot and then some; i.e. some conflict extending beyond the basic premise which is exactly what this brain sore is so painfully lacking. The film scores well here and on other movie related websites, which is probably because anyone who has ever seen an episode of Star Trek or dared to read an actual SF book, turned the movie off after 30 minutes and couldn't be bothered to leave a vote.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It baffles me that so many people find this movie to be an enjoyable watch. The movie moves at a snails pace, is extremely predictable and steals in a too obvious manor from far superior predecessors. Rockwell turns in an uneven performance but it's always nice to catch the highly talented Kevin Spacey, even if he literally phoned it in this time. The story could have worked had it been told in a shorter amount of time, had it skipped the many absurd lapses in logic it needlessly featured and had it dared to sire some original thought. As it stands, the story has been told many times before and in Moon just lacks the zest, intelligence and imagination to pull it of. With a script too repetitive and a lazy score (sounding exactly like the crap I made in the 80's with my first sequencer, perhaps I should sue for plagiary) very poorly timed in places, the movie became sort of annoying especially considering the potential it had. Whatever was left to enjoy was surely ruined by the incredibly dumb and completely nonsensical ending where a man survives a trip through space being exposed to G- forces which in reality would result in a spacesuit filled with a gory mash of meat and bones.With a reasonable production value nonetheless, Moon remains a simplified 2001 and Solaris redux for the MTV generation with apparently on par appreciation. I guess you know who you are.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful story and a masterful performance combine in a sci-fi classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is not just a smart movie. It's a movie that asks you to be smarter. Science fiction is one of the more bastardized genres in cinema, with about a jillion action movies with ray guns and monsters passing themselves off as sci fi. The essence of science fiction, though, is right there in the name. It's fiction that uses science and technology to illuminate human thought, deed and morality. Moon is as true to that ideal as any work of Bradbury, Asimov or Heinlein.Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is an astronaut. Well, he's not so much an astronaut as he is the caretaker of an automated mining camp on the far side of the moon. As machines that look like lunar combines harvest moon rock as a source of energy, Sam ventures out on his moon buggy to collect the full canisters of Helium 3 to ship back to Earth. As the story opens, Sam is finishing up his 3 year contract at the mining camp. He's the only human on the moon and, due to satellite trouble, he can't even have direct communication with anyone else. His only companion is GERTY (Kevin Spacey), sort of a tripartite version of HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey, one that comes with changeable emoticons.One day, as Sam is heading out to collect the Helium 3 from a harvester, he thinks he sees someone out on the surface of the moon. Distracted, Sam crashes his buggy into the much larger harvester and passes out. He awakes in the infirmary, GERTY watching over him, with no memory of how he got there. When he finds out and how he finds out will change Sam's lives forever. And no, that's not a typo. I mean "lives".This is an exquisite and challenging production, highlighted by a masterful and yet understated performance by Sam Rockwell. It looks great and never feels contrived. When it begins, you're not sure what kind of tale is going to be told and when Moon introduces its mystery, the film willfully refuses to answer the immediate questions that spring to mind. Not because those questions aren't anticipated and eventually answered, but because this movie wants you to think beyond technical details and focus on more profound thoughts. This is a story about human identity and human decency and whether changing the meaning of human alters either identity or decency. Moon makes no judgments itself. It demands viewers make judgments for themselves.Like most smart films, Moon allows the audience to figure stuff out. In fact, a couple of the most touching and wrenching aspects of this story are things of which Sam Bell seems oblivious. It's poignant to understand something about a person which they don't understand about themselves, and Sam Bell manages to be a person and not a character. This is a physically and mentally demanding role that Rockwell makes completely his own.In addition to being excellently made and both intellectually and emotionally engaging, Moon is also a subtle and chilling indictment of the capitalist drive for exploitation and the unconsidered consequences of enriching oneself at the expense of another.Moon is a great film. You should go out of your way to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Rockwell Shines in the Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be. ¨ Moon is a very good sci-fi film, which is even more impressive considering it is Duncan Jones's directorial debut (and he actually won a BAFTA award for this picture). Jones, who was known up to this moment primarily for being David Bowie's son, does a great job at creating such an artistic movie with such a low budget. He came up with the story and Nathan Parker wrote the screenplay for it. Moon is probably among the best films of 2009 and my favorite sci-fi movie of that year along with District 9. The film works because it has an interesting premise, it's a well thought out movie, and it has a very good performance from Sam Rockwell. It also is impossible not to compare it with Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, since Moon seems to pay homage to that film and I think that it does the movie justice. It is very hard to come across smart movies like this one, especially in the sci-fi genre, and it really felt very nice to not know what was going to happen nor being able to predict the film. In a period of time where so many remakes are being made and ideas are constantly being recycled it was good to come across a fresh movie like this one. Even though the budget to make this film was pretty low, the visual effects are great and that is a must for a sci-fi picture.Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) works for Lunar Industries and he has a 3 year contract to work solo at the station in the moon. The new energy source in Earth is Helium 3 which is harvested in the moon and Sam is in charge of sending it back to earth. The only company he has at the station is a robot called GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey), who is designed to fulfill his every day needs and since direct communication with Earth has been interrupted he has to communicate with his wife through video recordings. Sam also has a young daughter who was born shortly before he went to the moon and he can't wait to go back to meet her since he only has a couple of weeks left in his three year contract. The problem is that the three years of isolation have begun to leave its mark on him and he begins to suffer from hallucinations and finds himself often talking to himself and his plants. One day Sam encounters some problems outside of the station as he was trying to fix a mechanical harvester and suffers a head injury and is left unconscious. He awakes inside the station with GERTY attending him but has no recollection of how he got back to the base. After Sam recovers from the injury he decides to visit the site of the accident and makes an astonishing discovery that makes him doubt about his sanity. He sees himself in the same place where he suffered the injury and decides to bring him back to the base. He begins to question his mind and his true identity and whether or not he has been cloned.The movie really takes some interesting twists and turns making it very hard to predict. This is what makes Moon such a good sci-fi film, but it wouldn't have worked if Sam Rockwell didn't give such a great performance as he put on a one man show. He had to play two different kind of characters and it was very entertaining to see him deliver such a great performance. Kevin Spacey also was great as the voice of GERTY and it was impossible not to think about HAL from 2001 Space Odyssey. I really enjoyed this movie which raises a lot of questions towards the advances of science and will leave you thinking about some important issues which I don't want to give away. It also focuses on the importance humans have of communicating with each other and having intimacy with other people in a similar way that Tom Hank's Castaway did. This is a highly recommendable film which you should see if you're not easily put off by the slow pacing of the film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't Seem To Decide What It Is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strange movie that doesn't really seem to be able to decide what it is, in general, the acting and pacing of the story are all over the place. We are introduced to 'Sam' on his moon-mine of some type, the environment is well done, the base interiors look used and the moon vehicles are rendered with models, which for me at least, is more satisfying than a stale CGI rendering. Rockwell is pretty much overacting off the bat, the whole 'astronaut as truck driver' cliché is beaten to death for the first five minutes. From then on, stuff happens, without giving anything away, Rockwell is required to play two characters, which he does with no subtlety, one being the eyebrow arching serious type, the other being an irritating doufus. Anyway the plot unfolds as some kind of 2001/Slient Running/Alien pastiche which can't decide if it's being played for laughs or drama (one can't help but snigger at Kevin Spacey doing HAL), we lurch between casual revelations and grinding cliché. After all this I found myself actually caring about what happened to the main character, which was a surprise. So overall, a mixed bag, it can't seem to decide if it's a lighthearted ScFi tribute or a serious drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moon Review: There are many sides to the Moon, which side are you on?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love actors, no really I do. They have this quality about them that I like. Some might call it an intangible quality, but it's very easily explainable. As a writer, it's my job to create a character's motivations. To know them inside and out so that I know how they would react in just about every possible situation imaginable. An actor has to find a way to understand those motivations and bring out the emotions they cause. The way I see it, writers and actors go hand in hand. When I see an actor take on a difficult role, it gets very exciting.This was the case with Ryan Gosling in Lars and the Real Girl, Ryan Reynolds in Buried, and most recently Sam Rockwell in Moon. Another film in my long list of movies that I always meant to see but never got around to until now and again things are interesting. Where Moon is different from the previously mentioned films is that it used a visual effect to tell a major part of the story. Mainly that Sam Rockwell played several (two specifically) distinct versions of his character to play off of. This technique is one that is used often these days when dealing with characters who are twins or multiple characters.The first time I remember this occurring is in The Nutty Professor with Eddie Murphy playing his character's entire family with various prosthetic, but since then it has been used in movies like The Matrix, The Social Network, as well as TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Smallville and the recently cancelled Ringer. This can be a really effective technique if used in the right way. It can also go horribly wrong if not done properly. Unfortunately I have seen both in the multitude of films and television that I watch. When it comes to Moon, I think that it is used properly. Through most of the film I had my concerns, but as things progressed I was able to understand why they did it.And that's true of things not limited to the use of the doubling visual effect when it comes to this movie. The story centres around the character of Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell), a man on a three year contract to harvest the moon's resources for clean energy that can be used on Earth. One of the main things that bugged me about the film is the idea of a single person on a moon base. If you're going to put a mining camp on the moon why have only one person running it? This, along with most of my questions about the film, gets answered by the end and I am left generally satisfied with the story as a whole.What really hits home for me more than anything though is the performance of Rockwell. He manages to make two versions of himself very much distinct in their mannerisms and approaches to the situations they face that you might almost believe they were entirely different people despite their obvious similarities. The only other character to play off is the full on robotic helper droid GERTY, played through voice work by the great Kevin Spacey. And even there Mr. Spacey is able to bring a certain amount of nuance to an inanimate object that has you questioning the robot's motives much in the way that you did in 2001: A Space Odyssey.This movie is a perfect example of how acting can make or break a film. And in the case of Moon, I definitely think it makes the film.There are many sides to the Moon, which side are you on? I honestly could tell you because they all make such a great case.To check out more of my movie reviews, go here:http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard good things about this film before I sat down to watch it but thankfully I hadn't heard about the ending so was constantly wondering what was happening. Set in a mining base on the far side of the Moon Sam is the sole operative and he is coming to the end of his three-year contract; unfortunately for him he is involved in an accident while outside the base. He then wakes up back in the infirmary and is told by Gerty; the base robot, that he was injured and mustn't venture outside until he has fully recovered; he disobeys this order and goes out and finds his crashed vehicle? with himself still in side! Something strange is clearly happening although it takes some time to establish just what that something is. The two Sams now have a limited time to discover just what is happening before the 'rescue' team arrive.Duncan Jones has made an excellent debut film with a fine performance from Sam Worthington as the two Sams; apart from him the only other major role was Kevin Spacey who provided the voice of Gerty. As the film progressed I was reminded of '2001: A Space Odyssey' due to the potentially sinister computer, 'Solaris' as there was a possibility that things weren't quite real and even of 'Outland' as the clock ominously counted down to the arrival of the so called 'rescue team'. While I was strongly reminded of these films I didn't feel like this was in any way a rip off as the story here differed in significant ways which I won't mention as that could spoil a first time viewer's enjoyment. If you are a fan of serious science fiction without needing space battles, laser blasters and giant robots then I'm sure you will love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings back memories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhat reminiscent of the old science fictions from 30-40 years ago, Moon will bring back memories of such movies as 2001 or Outland. And although special effects are a big part for movies like these, they rely far more on the story and performances of the actors than a lot of other films from this genre. Sam Rockwell adequately pulls off his role despite the closet thing he had to co-stars was himself and Kevin Spacey in a box. While the plot kind of peaks towards the middle, it still holds interest beyond that point and is something you'll want to watch till the end.There is one unfortunate downfall however. For some reason the makers seemed to intentionally shoot for an R rating when writing the script, as F-bombs are delivered in sorties of three or more every five minutes, likely making it the most common word in the entire film. Why they found this necessary is beyond me, since it adds nothing to the overall movie and could have easily been done differently without losing anything. So what could have been something that I might watch with my kids or even my folks, gets relegated to late night viewing when no one else is around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Outstanding Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is an outstanding achievement. Coming from an unknown director and an actor that isn't known for starring roles, I never imagined I would be totally mesmerized and amazed by Moon. It's difficult to explain this confusing story without being spoiled, so I won't try. Talk about being lazy, huh? The first forty minutes of Moon, which is about half-way through the movie, is confusing. Not confusing like 'The Usual Suspects', but more along the confusion of 'Donnie Darko'. It makes you think hard until you feel silly for thinking it was confusing, because it truly is a simple plot. There are two main actors, Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey. Kevin gives a fun voice-over and Sam is simply outstanding. You will forget that Sam is acting for two characters in the movie, meaning he gives one helluva performance. He should receive an Oscar-nomination. The director is promising as he shows the Moon in a cinematic -but simple- way throughout and uses great camera-work to make the movie, well, work. Moon is simply an amazing sci-fi like no other and is one of the best movies to come out in 2009. Sometimes simplicity is a great thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the story of a man stuck on the Moon, all by himself, except for a handy A.I. robot that helps him in all his everyday life. His mission is to collect some sort of energy, and to send it back to Earth, he's supposed to stay three years before leaving his place to somebody else.The movie starts off near the very end of his cycle, and something unexpected happens, thus changing a lots of things.Though it is a movie in which you can predict everything one minute before it happens, I really can't say much more or it will spoil everything.Overall, the plot is great. But what steals the show is the acting, Sam Rockwell delivers an excellent performance. Would his acting had been bad, the movie would have lost all it's credibility, but here, what we have is 1h30min of magnificence.The sets are also very good, even more considering it's not a big production, and the audio ambiance is all well done.So, in conclusion, pretty much everything in this movie is great, making it one of my best movie set in space.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic 90 minute Twilight Zone episode ! ( Minor SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thrilled when I saw this film on my satellite TV on demand list. I immediately toggled down the movie list with anticipation knowing how good the reviews were and I wasn't let down despite the high expectations.Science fiction fans will love this film. It has overtones of 2001, and Solaris. Basically, GERTY, the computer that controls the space station will remind you of HAL 9000 from 2001. The movie shares some plot driven elements from the movies Solaris as well. But other than that, the story is entirely original and what a great one it is.The movie starts slow, but then picks up a bit, and grabs a hold of you. Each scene makes the next one better, and the mystery never ends until that final scene. Sam Rockwell is always great, he's an A-list guy for sure. At least he should be, he's very good in this film although a bit comical in some scenes that felt out of place even though you knew he was going out of his mind.GERTY is voiced over by the great Kevin Spacey, and wasn't as spooky sounding as HAL 9000 but he has the perfect voice for a computer. GERTY was a character in this film, and it was intriguing to see some hints of humanity coming from GERTY, it was touching in fact! Unlike HAL 9000, GERTY was a sympathetic computer in this film and in this film you will feel very bad for the protagonist for sure.The CGI was great when seen, but there was not too much CGI in this film. I'd compare the overall production to Pandorum since it feels more epic than it is. It's a B-movie, but doesn't feel like it. The soundtrack was excellent too. I would rate it higher than an 8 but I feel the story wasn't entirely original because of the influences from the films I mentioned above. It felt like a long Twilight Zone episode, and had Hitchcock flavor as well!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I watched this film with our 25-year-old son, who thought it was amazing. It just confirmed why I generally do not like sci-fi. It was ponderous, obtuse, illogical, took itself way too seriously, and was filled with too many plot holes. Besides that, the actor mumbled many of his lines and we had to turn the subtitles on in order to understand the dialogue. I wouldn't call it worthless crap as some writers did, but I certainly wouldn't watch it again, nor would I care to see anything else like it. The moonscapes were atmospheric and the film was interesting on some levels. Overall, it was pretty much a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Very well shot with an eerie atmosphere assisted by one of Clint Mansell's more simple, yet effective soundtracks that brings this unique film to life. The acting started off a bit rough, but greatly improved along the way. Kevin Spacey's voice is a perfect homage to the classic HAL of 2001: A Space Odyssey fame. The movie is relatively low budget for a sci-fi flick, but it certainly doesn't show. The effects and sets are believable (for the most part), and, for once, not really important.What really is important is the human story told here, one that is never predictable or flat. There are countless "twists" that keep the momentum moving without seeming forced or artificial like a cheap thriller. The moral dilemmas brought up by this film are interesting, but surprisingly not dwelled upon very much. I feel like these could be addressed a little bit more as opposed to just being given in passing, but it's not much of a detractor.I highly recommend this to sci-fi fans who don't just want explosions and lasers. If you like Blade Runner, chances are you'll like this one too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Science Fiction Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's great when a filmmaker comes along that realizes science fiction doesn't necessarily need to revolve around alien invasions, giant CG spectacles, or flashy lightsaber battles (sorry). The best science fiction poses questions about the future of mankind and the decisions we as a species may be confronted with. It gives us cause to examine our path and where it might lead us. First-time feature director Duncan Jones (son of the legendary David Bowie) has done just that with MOON. The story begins in a not-too-distant future where mankind has begun harvesting helium-3 from the surface of the moon as a potent, clean energy source. Seeing as how most of the operation is automated, the lunar base has a single man on staff: Sam Bell. With the satellite uplink to Earth non-operational, Sam's only form of personal contact is with the station A.I., GERTY. As Sam is approaching the end of his three-year contract and his chance to return home, there is an accident and Sam is injured when colliding with a harvester. He awakens in the midst of some strange goings-on that I'm going to do my best not to spoil here.I really love this movie. It's so rare that a film can inspire as much thought as MOON anymore. The film presents questions of individuality and human rights in regards to how they apply to cloning. It's an intriguing topic that can make for some excellent post-movie discussion. Duncan Jones has brought us an excellent science fiction film in rare form. The trailers for this film might mislead some who go into this movie expecting a thriller. The ads for the film give it a SIXTH SENSE feel with hints of the supernatural, but there is nothing of the sort. The big reveal comes less than halfway through the movie, so it doesn't keep you guessing throughout to find some big answer. It presents you with the situation early on so that the audience is given ample time to understand what exactly it is Sam Bell is going through. I admit GERTY gives off a bit of a HAL-9000 vibe, but this is not just another in a long line of films about technology gone wrong. It's an insightful glimpse into a future where humans will need to carefully consider their options in biogenetics. In other words, this movie is not going to be for everyone.After finally talking some of my friends in watching the movie, one of the biggest complaints I got throughout was how incredibly slow the movie moved. I can't argue with that. This is a very slow, deliberately paced movie. At only an hour and a half, it feels much longer. That's fine. I can deal with that. It's a great story so I don't mind if it takes it's time establishing itself. I'm sure the movie never would've worked as well if they hadn't casted it so well. MOON is the film that officially established Sam Rockwell as one of my favorite modern actors. Keep in mind, Rockwell is the only actor on screen throughout the course of the movie. He has no one to play off except himself and GERTY (voiced in a haunting monotone by Kevin Spacey). I love these sorts of films and I think it says a lot about an actor when they are the sole character for a feature length film and pull it off. Sam Rockwell's fantastic performance, slick production design, and an engaging, thought-provoking story: MOON is an excellent piece of independent work and it has established Duncan Jones as a director to watch.</fullReview>

If all you want is CGI and all those movie affects to keep u interested then do not watch this movie. It starts out very slow with the star of the movie already on the moon for about 3 years or someshit on his moon duties with about two weeks left before he returns home. Oh yeah and in the beginning they have a shower scene that shows this dudes ass, which should not have been shown, so fair warning. But if you get past that and are able to get through the slow beginning and still be paying attention to get to the halfway point, this movie will no doubt get interesting and will keep u watching.

		<shortDescription>Hey, oldschool scifi fans... CHECK IT OUT.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm just going to rattle off some titles, and if you like most of them, chances are you'll really enjoy "Moon". If, on the other hand, you think these movies are boring, then there's no need for you to read further; skip this movie.OutlandBlade RunnerStar Trek the Motion PictureTHX-1138Soylent Green20012010Space: 1999Kin-Dza-Dza (an obscure Russian flick, but I'll throw it in there anyway)All of these productions share something in common: the attitude that mood &amp; theme are more important than special effects or even plot. These are all films that make you think on a level much deeper than the action on screen. Special effects are (in most cases) minimalistic and pacing is slow and heavy. No, this definitely ain't Star Wars.More than a scifi flick, "Moon" is a psychological thriller that unfolds slowly and cryptically, with many surprises thrown at you. When I say 'surprises' I don't mean monsters jumping out of the dark, but rather surprises in the way characters behave and resolve matters.Adding more twists to the joyride, director uses familiar elements from older scifi to make us think certain things, but this is a clever way of fooling the audience. So don't be put off by the fact that certain elements may seem like they're stolen from other films. In the DVD commentary, the director tells us that these elements are intended as both an homage and a storytelling device. And that's precisely what makes it interesting to old school scifi fans. The same way Steve Martin's "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid" is a pastiche of 40s film noir with a new spin, "Moon" does a similar thing with 70s scifi.I won't say a thing about the plot since it's best that you experience it yourself. I'll just say that it touches on psychology, sociology, genetics, ethics, industrialism, stem cell research and a whole host of topics that are relevant today, let alone for future generations. This is very much a thinker's flick, so if you're the kind of person who bores easily, I'd say stay away.I'll mention one other thing that you should keep in mind when watching this movie. It had an overall budget of a measly $5 million, but it looks every bit as believable, if not more, than today's movies that cost 25x as much (Star Wars III had a budget of $120 million). The director accomplished this feat by going back to the old ways of doing special effects in the 70s: models &amp; miniatures, not computer generated cartoons. A full set was built for the moon base, and everything was filmed within those rooms, no cheating. This gives the film a degree of authenticity that you can't get any other way. Yes, there was some cgi added in post-production, but with very few exceptions I couldn't spot it.I highly recommend you watch this movie and also watch the extras on the DVD which will give you a greater appreciation for how this production came together, not to mention how much work &amp; discipline went into the performance by Sam Rockwell.If nothing else, this film is a breath of fresh air in space. It's a return to days of 70s science fiction where the emphasis is on 'science' and the abstract themes that arise from it. I rate it 8 out of 10. I only took off points because I would've liked it to be twice as long so it could've explored some of the compelling themes even deeper. But as the director says on the DVD, they kept it mainstream enough that everyone can enjoy it.</fullReview>

With the unsettling, subtle suspense of a Hitchcock flick, Moon opens as effortlessly as Alien: an every-day guy in space doing his job. Rockwell has an amazing talent to visually communicate his emotional isolation, boredom and deprivation of human contact while also conveying a full-fledged, completely fleshed out, easy-going character that any of us would be happy to know. What comes next is as bizarre as it is believable. The dialog, pacing, premise and acting are all top notch. Don't miss this gem. Moon is destined to be a true sci-fi classic.</fullReview>

Sam Rockwell holds the film on his shoulders and he is incomparable? in fact all the Sam Rockwell's are excellent and as the plot unravels one is truly taken by surprise as things are most unexpected? The concept is unique ? Sam Bell is an astronaut and the sole employee working on Moon for Lunar Industries. His shift is for three years and he is readying to go back to earth to his wife. But the last few days are getting too tough on him as he starts to hallucinate? his only interaction here in the past three years is with Gerty his computer-cum- assistant. But even Gerty is unable to tell him what is happening to him? and things go haywire when he has an accident on the surface of the moon and later wakes up back in the space station in suspicious circumstances? looking for answers about himself he finds the vehicle in which he had the accident earlier and is stunned to find a body there? And thus begins a series of discoveries that makes Sam suspect everything ? the company, his job, his wife, himself, his reality and his sanity? his only objective henceforth is to return to earth in any way he can?This is truly an awesome and unforgettable movie? not many movies like this out there? with no villains, no mutants, no zombies, no aliens, no animals? no big budget special effects? just one man and his battle with his realization? it truly is an experience like no other? not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very unique science fiction movie for a long time.Total isolation in the moon, getting weirder all along the movie, really felt isolated while watching this in the evening.I felt like Space Odyssey 2001 and HAL most of the time, also Alien3 came to mind, it was fascinating. Great performance from actors, mostly Sam Rockwell who made this actually believable.For a low budget movie I'd say this was brilliant, script and all. Directing was also very good and made me wonder what would they have done with bigger budget.Best sci-fi movie for a long time, really. If you enjoy sci-fi and very confusing plot I recommend this, it makes your brain tickle. This wasn't even too long or anything, just long enough to make it whole. Also the philosophical side was truly amazing like every ground breaking sci-fi movie should do.Huge thanks to creators of this movie.

		<fullReview>Of all the movie reviews I've had the pleasure of reading to-date, i must say that the reviews for this one leave me confused... As for the movie, i loved it. I was blown away. Saw it right at release and wasn't expecting much so maybe thats why i was so taken aback with the quality (in a good way). I am a huge sci-fi fan. I've literally seen it all whether its movies or TV, right from the first star trek ever made to all good and bad spin-offs. Stargate, same thing. Battlestar galactica etc... All the classic movies and all the new gems (and steamy piles of crap sometimes)in this genre have been viewed by me. I literally made a point of this 5 years ago. Now that you know I'm not a sci-fi noob i must say that it doesn't make any sense to me that so many reviewers have said that "those who like this aren't sci-fi fans" or, "those who like this haven't seen a single episode of trek/stargate". This is original (despite its references to so many movies and shows), moving, exciting, and most of all believable! Ya i said it... believable! EVERY SCI-FI MOVIE/SHOW EVER MADE OR DREAMPT UP HAS "HOLES" Such is the genre of science fiction...FICTION Things like "How can Gerty communicate with earth if its the tower thats blocking the signal", if they had taken the time to explain this it would have been some easily creatable sci-fi typical explanation "uhhh... the tower has a .... Gerty detecting algorithm", its complicated and poorly explained in sci fi, always is, thats why its almost better that they leave it open, some dumb sci fi explanation for these "holes" would have taken away from the writing and point of the movie. Sure, you'd need some sort of a centrifuge to create gravity where there should be none (the moon-base interior), and we've no mention of this... would that have helped the people who didn't like the "holes"? Maybe they live in a future where technology exists that allows gravity to happen in the moon-base.... point is WHO CARES? thats for the writer to decide because (drum roll....) ITS A WORK OF FICTION! Watch this movie for what it is, a good, original, and sly flick with great acting, great premise and good set/effects. Think for two seconds how hard it would be to make a sci-fi movie without giving any referable aspects of other sci fi in it. The movie isn't perfect, i agree that more probably could have been done with the plot/excitement after starting with such a great premise, but i don't feel it takes much away from it.Most of all, to all of you who consider yourself sci-fi fans: don't be deterred by bad reviews. This is a perfect example of the genre and delivers everything a true fan of sci-fi loves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Space Oddity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1969, two years before director Duncan Jones was born, David Bowie released the single, "Space Oddity." 40 years later, Bowie's son, Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones releases his own space oddity - the brilliant MOON, an intelligent, thoughtful, unsettling, dialog-driven drama and the first true science fiction movie in a light year."Commencing countdown, engines on..." This isn't your Armageddon or MISSION TO MARS, or even STAR WARS; MOON embraces the iconography of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, SPACE:1999 and SILENT RUNNING.Sam Rockwell is astronaut Sam Bell, a lunar miner nearing the end of a three-year contract maintaining harvesters on the far side of the Moon, harvesting helium-3, a new energy source which has overjoyed Earth corporations. Sam has two weeks to go. And he is definitely losing his mind."Want an axe to break the ice. Wanna come down right now..." The Moon is only a couple seconds transmission time from Earth, yet Sam has no direct communication because his transmitter is faulty and the Earthbound corp has not bothered to send someone out to fix it..."Ground Control to Major Tom: your circuit's dead, there's something wrong..." ... so he must contend with delayed messages from his beautiful wife and baby daughter whom he has never met."Tell my wife I love her very much. She knows..." And he is seeing visions of a girl in a yellow dress sitting at his console...Sam's only companion is GERTY, a HAL-like computer voiced by Kevin Spacey (who has a foreboding voice at the best of times - in a supercomputer that has control over your living conditions, it is downright jumpsuit-browning scary).One day, Sam goes out to check on a harvester and crashes his rover. He wakes in the infirmary, staggers out half-conscious and walks in on GERTY having a real-time conversation with his corporate bosses on Earth. Did he just see what he thought he saw - direct communication with Earth?! GERTY assures him he didn't..."Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare..." Something is bugging Sam. He drives out to check on that harvester again - and finds the crashed rover. Inside - he finds himself. Literally.MOON is Duncan Jones's debut feature, already winning acclaim and awards. It is pure old school, with no lasers or aliens or bombast, yet tension as palpable as piano wire tightening around your chest; a controlled mystery drama with one large moon base set, one man, one computer, one mission; exteriors are cute little model buildings on authentic-looking Moonscapes and tiny six-wheeled rovers rolling along in slomo to simulate one-sixth gravity. All underscored by the eerie music of Clint Mansell (REQUIEM FOR A DREAM)."Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do..." One Sam is fit, healthy, while Sam from the crashed rover is falling apart physically. Both realize that cloning has been done without their consent or knowledge - yet neither knows which is the clone...Without doubt, this is Sam Rockwell's most inspired acting performance of his career. Like Michael Keaton in MULTIPLICITY or, to a lesser extent, Kevin Kline in DAVE, we lose cognizance of the constant camera trickery going on. Actively and passively, our eyes are being fooled by a combination of special effects, creative editing and sensational dual acting."And the stars look very different today..." But MOON's underlying disturbing message is not the fact that clones exist - it is the fact that corporations will use this device to once again line their pockets and screw people over; how the bottom line overrides any kind of human element or ethics. That makes MOON a biting potent indictment of modern day corporate misconduct and dysfunction."I heard a rumor from Ground Control - oh no, don't say it's true..."And hidden deep within all Bowie's Scary Monsters, Super Creeps, Thin White Dukes, Aladdin Sanes, Ziggys, Lodgers and Heroes, is the same far out biting social commentary...The Space Oddity doesn't fall far from the Starman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully suspenseful film throughout.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: This film, being the directorial debut for Duncan Jones, is pretty solid. The film explores the theme of solitude, as well as life. What kind of life is important? Are clones considered human beings? Or are they considered property? Experiments? Are their lives important? Sam Rockwell does a great job at making his character interesting and at making us care about his character and the situation/dilemma he's in. The film also makes a great job at being suspenseful; the film's suspenseful throughout its entirety. Sam's smiley-faced robot companion, and only companion on the Moon, GERTY (the acronym isn't explained in the film), voiced by the amazing Kevin Spacey, is very suspicious. However, what robot isn't suspicious in any science-fiction film? I'm glad Duncan Jones didn't make GERTY into a cliché robot persona.Cons: Some may find the movie completely boring and stupid. It all depends on how you view the film. I like the suspense, and one-man-show, and the eerie setting. The film is long for having just one actor on screen the entire time, but the suspense made the length of the film not a problem to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I've ever given a 10 rating to ANY movie on IMDb, and I'm a zero or 10 rating kinda guy. I've watched Moon about 3-5 times now, and I'm still blown away by Sam Rockwell's performance. I am still not convinced that this is a sci-fi movie, and more-so I'm convinced it's someone's statement as to a drama on what it would be like to deal with the worst existential crisis imaginable. As I watch this movie, I've often moved back to several points in the time line to observe what's happening and reanalyze what is happening. I do not remember this occurring with any movie I've seen in the last 5 or more years.What happens in this movie is not so much sci-fi as much as it is self-analytical and worthy of comparison to the psychological comparison to the first version of Solaris by the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky. Where sci-fi leaves off, the mind picks up and I'm sure that this movie provides a much more complete picture of the unimaginable of the depths and heights of humanity than this movie has previously presented. I'm not saying this movie is perfect, but I'm saying it's very, very, very near perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it's good Sci-Fi. Just don't fall asleep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some interesting concepts in here - I especially liked the way the characters care about each other. The movie will definitely provide something to think about even after it ends.Well, there were times when I wanted it to end prematurely. Yes, the silence and stillness contributes to the atmosphere a lot, but can very quickly get boring. Yes, the sterile setting helps you immerse, but also raises a lot of questions. Some questions don't need answers, but some do and there were times when I wondered just what is going on. Maybe I wasn't supposed to know the things I wanted?I loved a few scenes with heart-touching moments. That's when you see the real beauty of it and start thinking about the cruel reality.The movie won't disappoint, provided you are prepared to do some thinking - otherwise you'll be bored of the lack of action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent if Uneven Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A qualified success for the Directorial Debut of Duncan Jones, aka David Bowie Junior, aka Zowie Bowie. Science Fiction films are a niche, and neglected market.When you strip out those born of TV series, there is precious little left. Jones, who wrote the story but not the Screenplay, delivers bona fide science fiction, sans gratuitous CGI, but with a strong, resonant plot and some convincing acting.The premise of proceedings is that of a sole engineer on a lunar mining station just a few weeks from coming home. Actor Sam Rockwell, as that engineer Sam Bell, then has to confront a turn of events which leads him, and the audience, to question his sanity,identity and pretty much everything around him.With only the intelligent robotic voice of Gerty, the on board computerised robot, amusingly delivered by Kevin Spacey, the 97 minute running time gives ample time for reflection.This is not perfect by some way.The sets and effects are basic and crude, rather than spartan and austere, and the piano theme often grates rather than haunts.The editing also tries unnecessarily to confuse for effect what is a good story anyway.Trudie Styler has a Producer credit. As wife of Sting, a decent actress in her own right, and God mother to Guy Ritchie's Rocco she clearly has some strong connections in the film making world.It is to her credit that this is manifested in a well made, credible work rather than pompous self indulgent vanity project amongst the rich and famous.At times the isolation becomes almost too claustrophobic, and Jones does not have the confidence to go for the broad themes as genre Masterpieces Bladerunner and 2001 a Space Odyssey do. Yet this is the first "proper" sci fi film of the 21st Century. As such Jones lays down a solid marker for his peers, and offers much promise for his future development.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen - a classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now let me first just say that even though I've seen my fair share of sci-fi movies I'm certainly not a sci-fi boff. With that said sci-fi films are not my favourite so I didn't have high hopes for this movie and MAN was I pleasantly surprised.This film with it's great performance by sam rockwell, creepy music and artistic style draws you in from start to finish with a great story told in a non linear but understandable fashion, kevin spacey as a VO was a good choice too.The only things about this film which I disliked was the fact it seemed a little short, and also the fact that it could and probably should have gone into more detail about the story but ultimately I highly recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had hoped to finally find a good SF , but it was a bit disappointing (bit much actually) .The similarities with 2001 Soljaris and Blade Runner are clearly present, but the film lacks the length and the rest to create the same atmosphere. / Voltage Some themes ( paranoia , loneliness , man vs chilly technology etc ) demand a certain length / inertia in the movie to be able to feel the Developing charactersThe shots of moon -earth universe are clearly intended á la 2001 , but absolutely incomparable, ditto on the use of classical music . The contrast classical music/ high-tech in 2001 was and effective , in Moon is simply dragged in . Soljaris eventually had only his planet's surface , but all the above still gave this a specific atmosphere. Moon remains visually very flat.The whole was somewhat " overacted " and sometimes nonsensical. I suddenly had the impression watching the two guys in " Midnight Cowboy" (a very good movie btw).With these actors ( and this budget? ) You can probably not create a masterpiece like the three above-mentioned ,well, then do not try .Why on the moon? a kind of Gattaca - like setting would be enough ( or anywhere on earth) .Maybe a nice Star Trek or Twilight Zone or something like that but nothing more , unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst 8.0 IMDb rating movie I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally you can go by the IMDb ratings to give you a good feel of how good or bad a movie is,but that is not the case with "Moon". This movie makes little to no sense throughout the entire film. You spend the entire film waiting for it to end so it can make some sort of sense,then it reaches the end,and guess what still nothing.But don't worry about the bad ending, the movie never really gets your hopes that high so that the bad ending is that much of a disappointment,it is more of a relief that it is over."Moon" is just a terrible terrible movie in my opinion, I have no idea how this movie received an 8.0 on the IMDb rating scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good, yeah, they just need to improve their marketing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moon is a one of a kind. A film cunningly disguised as a sci-fi film whilst trying to come across as a seemingly flawless character piece ... and it sort of works. From the premise, the title and even the tagline I became convinced this was film about a lonely man hallucinating (and with slogans like "the last person you expect to find is yourself" you would be wise to think so) but oh no, no it isn't - the slogan is not metaphorical or deep ... it means it literally. Sam Rockwell literally meets Sam Rockwell. This for me was a very clever twist ... almost. Okay, so I watch this film for a psychological one man thriller and get a story about other things instead. This is where I get a mixed reaction - yes, it was great that it was unexpected and very original but where it fails is that this left me nagging for the next hour "so wait, this is only his imagination, right?". And it never gives way so right up to the 85th minute of the 90 minute run time I'm expecting "it was all a dream" to jump out of nowhere then the film ends ... literally ends. Da-dahh - nothing really happened. I admire the film but feel that despite its entire story told at such minute detail it ended with little or no ending in the sense what it needs to round it off. The problem was that it tells you what it intends to deliver then goes along a different route before ending which is not a problem, it's 100% perfect as a story and as a plot but its the false premise of the first 20 minutes that kind of spoils it so do I argue the first 20 minutes are bad or the last 70 minutes. Neither are, in fact, just seemingly badly handled so was this a mistake on the part of the marketing or the part of the people who wrote what the films premise was on IMDb (which is why I watched the film). Trust me, one hallucination does not account for how this films premise is laid out. However as I thoroughly enjoyed the film it may just be that I'm one of those people that accepts the premise and assumes the ending is what I thought it would be - it wasn't and that is why its amazing. It's unexpected and very well thought out (and marketed as something else ... just to get people in). After this, we have the rest of the movie to discuss. The acting is alright on Sam Rockwell's part. His presence and acting are heavily praised but I don't see his acting as high a class as people claim. He's convincing and mostly handles the playing multiple selves easily but hardly dominates the screen and sometimes seems to be a small presence in the shots (which is probably due to the complicated editing of making about 3 of him appear on screen at some points). Kevin Spacey does a convincing job but his voice acting doesn't sound any different to what any actor would do with the voice of a monotamus computer. The character motivation is however somehow bizarre, the main character and his clones are mostly fairly simplistic but why did he start fighting with himself - it was actually a fairly pointless scene in the long run - and why did GERTY do all that stuff? He allows one clone to see another - wait, isn't GERTY supposed to be in on the whole conspiracy? Why did he explain it all to the characters - it's a computer = NO emotional attachment. The effects are pretty rubbishy - I know, it's a cheap budget but the effects remain obviously fake throughout and is it CGI? Well, it doesn't look real at all - the scenes with the Truck are lame and apart from the opening sequence no sequence on the moon has special effects worthy of blockbuster Hollywood, which this film decidedly isn't. The GERTY prop is a genius piece of equipment which looks like an actual slightly futuristic computer. The moral dilemmas involving commercialism is very well handled except to the last minute. Not only is it made unclear what the effects actually were but it seems hard to read between the lines on something that is already hard to read already. There's things like Orwell's 1984 which are full of messages which anyone with an average IQ can figure out but this has smaller messages but somehow has more trouble explaining it - it's briefly mentioned, hardly reflected on and not concluded as the ending is essentially a cliffhanger that we know will never be answered. This is a problem considering the pacing of the movie. The pacing is bad all round (hence the 7 rating) - it's slow, very slow. It may have been a good idea but during the middle section of the money, events not only repeat themselves but nothing at all happens. The occasional incident will occur but they are infrequently exciting and serve often no purpose. Taking these detours effectively ruin this movie and bores us to death. I like it being interesting and slow paced, I don't mind that but effectively shots of someone walking down a corridor for 5 seconds and repeated every other minute don't paint a great standard of pacing. It becomes nothing but a slow mess and essentially kills off my last remaining my brain cells that are concentrating. However I was totally engaged - I was bored but engaged and understanding every piece of dialogue so for a film, a story, a message and a new director it's pretty entertaining but as a whole, it's just uneven - oh, and why was there that amount of language, lesser language could convey the same emotion and not put off the character so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moon is the extremely rare kind science fiction picture that comes along every once in a while and reminds us that the impact of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is not dead. The hard reality of intelligent science fiction has been replaced by spectacular comic book non-sense pried more from the special effects department then from the gray matter. Here is a movie that, for 99% of its running time, is occupied by one astronaut trying to wrap his head around the most unbelievable circumstance. It is a brainy thriller for that tiny audience still interested in such things.The movie stars Sam Rockwell in a very good performance as Sam Bell, a contracted worker for Lunar Industries who has spent the last three years working on the Sarang lunar base where he is in charge of harvesters that send minerals back to earth to be used as cold fusion energy. As we might expect, Sam's three-year hitch is about to come to an end and he is excited about returning to his wife Tess and their now three year-old daughter.Sam spends all of his time alone. His only means of human contact come from transmitted communications from back home, from Tess and occasionally from the execs at Lunar Industries. His onboard helper is an odd machine named GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey), a bulky machine that follows him around, talks to him in a flat monotone and has facial expressions that appear as emoticons on a tiny screen.The description might make Moon sound like just a carbon copy of 2001, but something else is afoot. After Sam crashes his lunar rover into the harvester, he begins seeing things. Things are out of place, not quite right and for reasons we don't quite expect. We might expect that they all have to do with GERTY, that this creepy machine is just HAL with a smiley face, but this movie is anything but predictable as the screenplay offers a cleverly-paced building mystery.The trouble with reviewing this film is the danger of revealing too much. To spoil what happens after Sam crashes into that harvester would be an act of cruelty simply because, from the point, the movie never goes where we expect it to go. What is most tantalizing about Moon is the way is builds Sam's predicament, a piece at a time, like a card trick that is only slowly revealed. There are no laser guns here, no lightsabers. no aliens, there aren't even any actions scenes (except a fist-fight that has to be seen to be believed), just a guy in an extremely bizarre circumstance trying to get a handle on the moment.This is the first feature from writer-director Duncan Jones who I hope doesn't lose his edge as a screenwriter. His screenplay has the patience and the intelligence to tell the story as it unfolds rather than make everything clear at the beginning. We learn Sam's plight as he does, and it is just as surprising to us as it is to him. Credit should go to the film's production designer who creates the interiors of that space station with its tight corridors and its surgical white walls. We feel as confined as Sam, sharing his claustrophobia and his paranoia.Moon is one of those little films that you discover and want to tell everyone about. The problem is that, in order to avoid spoiling the surprises, you can't really tell them why. This is one of those movies that incites long conversations afterward about life and death, about the meaning of humanity and what constitutes the qualifications to be a human being.***1/2 (of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different kind of sci-fi story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen a new, cerebral sci-fi movie in a while, but Moon scratches that itch quit well. It's somber, engrossing, and almost heartbreaking at times.&nbsp;The plot is fairly simple. There's a clean energy source on the moon, and a company has built a permanent base there, to harvest it. The base is occupied only by a man (who stays there for three years at a time, before going back to earth and being replaced) and a robot that serves as a universal helper to the human. From there, a story of loneliness, love, and the very essence of humanity, unwinds.I really dug the direction the story took. It never felt limited by the small number of characters, and the plot developments succeed in keeping the movie interesting, without becoming disorienting or boring. I recommend Moon to anyone who likes a good, personal drama, regardless of whether or not they are a general fan of science fiction. &nbsp;&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moon Clones go "Luny"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film had difficulty making its mind up what it wanted to be: Sci-fi, clone story, or "evil corporation" movie, or maybe an unintentional mixture of the two. Could have been improved easily: Court room drama, with flashbacks to operations on the moon. The makers obviously tried to tie up loose-ends at the very ending. As our clone re-enters earth's atmosphere, a brief voice-over indicating a supposed, courtroom battle is suggested. Would have been wise to leave that off. Otherwise, the film implied the immorality of cloning. Only trouble with this is the lunar backdrop. We are more interested in the futuristic aspect than with moral questionings. "Outland", a more entertaining sci-fi film, was also more effective at using moral injustice as an antagonistic platform.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean wow, reading all these positive reviews, one would watch this movie thinking that they're about to experience a new sci-fi concept that's astoundingly original, but this film is far from original or even in the slightest bit interesting. The lead character, and only character, develops sporadically in the eyes of the viewer. You never really get a sense of who this person is, hence you never really relate to him.I'm going to spoil it all below because honestly I think it's better you read a 2 minute summary, rather than a bunch of reviews, which could potentially save you another 90.The movie begins with an introduction to this Sam Bell character, along with poor CGI animation of rovers on the moon harvesting some scientifically unsound energy. He's gone nuts from 3 years of isolation, goes out in a rover to fix a problem with a machine, starts hallucinating, and ends up crashing. In the meantime, the base produces a new Sam from a chamber of clones it has in its basement. Apparently the clones only live 3 years, so by the end of them, the first Sam we met was already slowly dying and losing his mind. The new Sam finds his new surroundings suspicious upon waking and goes off to find out what happened at the crash site, only to find a clone of himself in the wreckage.Clones. He has been being cloned for 15 years in 3 year intervals, go figure. It turns out he wasn't imagining a counterpart, which is what the director was trying to portray (so poorly it wasn't at all a surprise that he wasn't imagining him). All the while, a robot, and not just any robot, but a robot programmed to run an entire moon base, allows its human captive clone to do whatever he pleases, without at all getting in the way, and even later facilitating his cover-up and eventual escape to Earth, which would be illogical since whatever device projected out of the base would reach the company that cloned him back on Earth...So the people who put the guy on the moon base didn't think of programming the robot to do what the company would want in all circumstances. The whole story is just absurdly constructed with several loopholes and questions left looming around. Many scenes either linger too long, or are cut short by a strange fade out. The soundtrack is just plain cheesy rubbish. It's movie ratings on IMDb that are this high for bad movies that have made me trust public opinion less and less...In short, don't waste your time, watch Interstellar instead, at least it had CGI budget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Single Greatest Film in the History of Horror Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Duncan Jones perfects the concept of hypnotic villainy in this film, which features a battle of wills between a spaceman and a genius robot who uses the power of suggestion to set in motion a series of killings throughout a moon. Showcasing innovative suspense sequences, plot twists, and rich psychological/philosophical concepts, this film will have viewers pondering well after it ends. Duncan Jones again manages to elude the pitfalls of popular cinema to contribute not only a chilling masterpiece, but arguably one of the most awesome villains to ever grace the big screen.Of the thousands of films I've seen, few have floored me to the point where I've wanted to grant them the honor of being the "Best Movie Ever." The only other film that comes to mind is "Silent Running" (1973), which is easily the most impressive motion picture of all time. Since that distinction is taken, that leaves "Moon" (1997) with the runner-up spot in terms of world cinema, but the medal for "Best Horror Movie Ever" is still for the taking. This film takes it. As of this writing I've seen 374 films from that genre, and I can tell you that even M. Night Shylamayan, Craven, Kubrick and Hitchcock have failed to match the brilliance of "Moon." This is quite possibly the most engaging slow-paced film in existence. The tempo moves slower than molasses in January, but the introduction of the lead antagonist a mere 8 minutes into the film sets the seemingly endless array of intriguing moments into motion from the get go. Kevin Spacey's character of GERTY is spellbinding with his hypnotic technique that starts off with seemingly trivial dialogue but slowly progresses into an ingenious psychological trap. This provides for a number of memorable moments, my favorite of which is the mesmerizing personal hygene sequence. In addition, the identity of this character is expertly crafted as a sort of ambiguous soul/personality whose essence is only truly revealed during the very last frame. No other film has created an antagonist so uniformly dangerous, sublime, and interesting as GERTY.Duncan "Zowie" Jones is easily one of the top five directors of all time. This guy made a perfect film that no one talks about ? "Moon". What's really interesting is that he follows a rather unique art-house style that's almost never applied to the horror/body horror genres. Jones uses long shots, deliberate pacing, and ambiguity in moderation, which is unlike most art-house directors who have no sense of discretion. Despite the mindless ramblings of mainstream cinemaphiles, Jones rarely (if ever) indulges in pompous, self-congratulatory filming techniques because his choice of lean running times (under two hours in almost every instance) helps him to avoid the bloated, masturbatory pretentiousness that rears its ugly head in films like "2001: A Space Oddity" (1972) and "All The Right Stuff" (1984). Think Andrei Tarkovsky with more interesting and refined philosophical content and you'll have an idea of just how special Jones is as a director.Whenever possible, I like to point out the high content levels of Jones's films in an attempt to counter the nonsensical claims of some who feel that he practices a form of style over substance. Take the seemingly trivial dialogue that the GERTY character engages in during his hypnotic acts of terrorism. The exchanges are an odd mix on a superficial level, but one comes to realize their importance when the victims are subjected to strict interrogation. Only then does the viewer understand why Sam Bell fakes his amnesia (an attempt to elude his victims memories) and engages in circular question-begging. Also note the attention to details in other situations. Within the final 20 minutes we see Sam Bell in a quaint diner, but only upon further inspection do we realize that in one case his plate is filled with leftover food while in the other case it's licked clean, an important revelation of his essential change in character for the finale. And how about that final shot? This is just awesome cinema people. Magnificent.In retrospect, "Moon" was the true beginning of the Space Horror phenomenon that has followed it's release. While lacking in industry influence that has helped to establish Space Horror in general (that nod goes to Honda's "Latitude Zero" of 1978), it provides a ground zero date for the turning of the tide so to speak. For all intents and purposes, Space Horror has kicked everyone else's backside from 1997 onward. That said, I am truly unhappy that Jones chose to leave the genre for more dramatic fare because we're already inundated with enough art-house dramas to keep us busy. How many expertly crafted art-house horror films are there floating around today? Whatever the number, it's not nearly enough.It's really too bad that good taste in film is practically extinct, because "Moon" should be one of those movies that everyone under the sun raves about until they're blue in the face. Duncan Jones isn't blessed with the lunatic fan base that follows guys like Akira Kurosawa or David Bowie. (Maybe I count as the first big fan of Ziggy Stardust.) It's a shame that he has established himself as an upper echelon filmmaker but somehow hasn't won over the majority of paid critics and film snobs who so easily drive the "emperor with no clothes" tide to coerce and guilt people into riding the bandwagons of lesser filmmakers.In any case, "Moon" is the pinnacle of exceptional film-making. It's also Kevin Spacey's best film, and that's saying something.</fullReview>

But I can understand why people didn't, it is a thinkers film, played out at quite a slow pace and not everything that happens in the movie is actually explained so the more simple movie goers amongst us will struggle with it. But for everyone else, it is worth a watch, but not for a movie night with friends round. It is much better watched alone in a dark room. I give it 7 out of 10. I can't really pick out many flaws and especially not without including spoilers so I will just leave it to the viewer to make his or her own mind up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"How can it not know what it is?" ? Deckard (Blade Runner) "Moon" stars Sam Rockwell as Sam Bell, an astronaut manning a Helium-3 mining facility on the dark side of the moon. As the film progresses, Sam realises that he is not a "unique" and "special" human being, but one of many mass produced clones who has had his memories, thoughts and desires programmed into him by a shadowy corporation. As Sam's body disintegrates (like "Blade Runner", "Moon's" androids are programmed with a kind of "planned obsolescence"), one of his copies hitches a ride back to earth, where it reveals the corporation's evil practises to a shocked global audience.The film recalls a now classic scene in "Blade Runner", in which an android called Deckard - who doesn't know he's a replicant - reveals to another android that her memories are not her own, but belong to the niece of Tyrell, the head of the corporation that built and programmed her. "Those aren't your memories," Deckard says mournfully. "They're somebody else's." Contemporary materialists echo these sentiments, applying Deckard's cyborg speech to all of humanity. According to the theory of materialism there are now no subjects, there is only subject-matter. Selves are nothing but electronic packets, while private persons are simulacra, Rationalism rejecting the notion that there is some ineffable "thing" over the genetic, neurological and social coding that makes us "us", maintaining instead that the personal and the biographical are only explicable in machinic and impersonal terms.The question raised by people ? "Is Deckard a replicant?" ? therefore misses the point of the "Blade Runner" completely. The criteria for rating the human above the cyborg (a fusion of humans and technology) have long been evaporated. Deckard, like man, is a machine that thinks it is what it is not and is certain that it is not what it is. As all identity is construction, everything has been produced and nothing is given (which is why Cronenberg now thinks of his films, from "Crash" onwards, as being filled with cyborgs).As man is defended by his own narcissism, Sam, like Deckard, struggles to come to terms with this. Like most subjects faced with this trauma, he oscillates between retreating to either the Symbolic Order (The social world of linguistic communication...of The Law) or The Imaginary Order (the fundamental narcissism by which the human subject creates fantasy images of both himself and his ideal object of desire), both of which are tragic flights.But, as film Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek says (see "A Pervert's Guide To Cinema"), the lesson of "Blade Runner" (or rather Philip K Dick's lesson...Scott is clueless) is not only that everything in the personal is in fact the product of impersonal processes of cause and effect, but that it is the very act of delineating the underlying nexus that regulates our lives, that marks our freedom. For this reason, "Blade Runner" and "Moon's" android's are actually the film's only pure subjects precisely because they testify that their "content", including their most intimate fantasies, is not their own, but already implanted. i.e, it is only when I acknowledge my replicant status, that I become a truly human subject. Kazimierz Dabrowski called this "positive disintegration".What both films fail to do, however, is recognise that the "android as pure subject" is itself not an identity, but the product of a machinic process which mis-recognises itself as the process's final cause. So rather than a subject, we have the continuous production of subjectivity (in which the personal is always the "sim-personal"; the simulation of the personal by the impersonal). Self-consciousness as pure introspection simultaneous with what it is introspecting, is therefore impossible, as subjective reflection must always exists "two steps removed" or "behind" the process, consciousness, like memory and habit, always an "after the fact" reflection on the unconscious processes which produce it. In this sense, the subject is by definition always nostalgic, a subject of loss.For this reason, for the pure subject to have reflection is for it to realise, nihilistically, that consciousness is itself nothing. Unless this happens, the android remains a "simpersonator", able to simulate personalities, but always confusing personality-function with consciousness-as-essence. In other words, unlike Deckard and Sam, the pure subject would not go from "it does not know what it is" to "it now knows what it is", but from "it does not know what it is" to "it knows it cannot know what it is becoming".7.9/10 ? An excellent sci-fi tale with a very silly ending, our cyborg hero returning to earth where he, in the film's only uplifting moment, fights for cyborg rights and personal freedoms. This brief but triumphant scene undermines the entire picture, turning it into a story of corporate ethics and painting Sam, not as us, but a mistreated machine.</fullReview>

Forget Riddick, Pandorum etc. Seriously, this is the best thing that happenes to sci-fi genre since alien, 2001... and first Star Wars. Watch this cause next 2 movies by Douglas Jones (one of the best directorial debuts ever) gonna be set in the same "Moon" universe (with cameos by Sam Rockwell playing either Sam Bell or...... well I'm not gonna say that so I wont spil it to anyone who hasn't seen this - really i wonder why there are some people who haven't seen this)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish this movie got more recognition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming into the movie, I had no idea exactly what is going on if they do not pay close attention to the small details. The way the movie was put together was simply amazing, it gives the viewer a calm and normal sensation for a situation of a lonely person on the moon who is cut off from the rest of the world from being on the dark side of the moon. When in reality the viewer is being placed in the middle of a dark and secret situation that is more to the viewing eye. Sam Rockwell has always been a top favorite actor of mine, but after watching Moon, my respect for him is at a high. Sam Rockwell gives us a variety of emotions as well as personalities in this unique story, since he is literally talking to himself throughout the movie when each personality is an absolute different point of view and approach to the storyline. Overall, this movie is a great film to watch if you are ready to sit down and watch something that will keep you glued to the screen. My only wishes was that Moon could have been given more recognition than it was truly given.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tense and disturbing thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thrillers work best when they are allowed to slowly go from a simmer to a boil. It's a pity that Hollywood doesn't realize this, and panders to the ADD-afflicted masses, which is why we get a ton of garbage like "Transformers" and less movies like "Moon." Duncan Jones' debut film is no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. But it does generate a good amount of tension and a pervasive sense of unease.In the near future, most of the world's power is being harvested from rock on the moon. The base is occupied by one person at a time for a three year contract. This time around, it's by Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), and he's only got three weeks left. But the isolation is really beginning to take its toll on him, and he senses that his mental state is quickly beginning to unravel.I don't want to give anything away, but the film can be confusing. "Moon" is a sci-fi/mystery, so naturally the tension revolves around the answers to unknown questions. But good thrillers of this ilk leave viewers hungry for answers. I was left confused and somewhat irritated by the film for much of the running time. Much of that has to do with Jones' handling of the material.However, the film looks great. For a film with a mere 5 million dollar budget, "Moon" looks like it was made with a budget 50 times that. I felt like I had been on the moon for three years, and that kind of claustrophobic tension is the film's greatest success.This is a one-character show (well, two, if you count GERTY, a robot who is voiced by Kevin Spacey). A bad performance could tank the project, but fortunately the film's central character is being played by up-and-coming character actor Sam Rockwell, who continues to impress with one terrific performance after another. Rockwell is terrific as a man on the edge, and his desperation is actually rather heartbreaking. Kevin Spacey is brilliant as the helpful GERTY. I haven't heard a voice this soothing since Goran Visnjic in "Close Your Eyes." There are many laudable qualities to this film, but the amount of time I spent confused was too much for me to give more than a weak recommendation. Still, this is a film where the trailer gives almost nothing about the plot (for once). Not that that has anything to do with the quality of the film...My rating: PG-13 for language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie just as empty as the space itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some good things about "Moon". Sam Rockwell ("The Matchstick men") deserves some praise for his performance. I would even say it's an Oscar worthy performance. He captures many different emotions of his hero (loneliness , boredom , depression , anger , psychosis) and gives a true one man show through all movie. I also liked Kevin Spacey ("American beauty") as the voice of robot.Clint Mansell delivers a gentle music that has something magical in it , something which screams "SPACE". His music is one of the strongest points of the movie. "Moon" is also visually good looking . The special effects are few and well used. The art-direction reminds me of "2001 : Space odyssey" and that's a good thing.All of these doesn't change the fact that "Moon" is dull , shallow , boring and pretentious movie. Some people were fouled by the fact that there are no explosions or too much action here and that the movie is relatively low budget. For some people that already means that a movie is ART. That this is a philosophical science fiction movie worthy of Stanley Kubrick. That's completely not true. I have seen few philosophical sci-fi movies in my life ? "2001 : Space odyssey" , "A Clockwork orange" , "Solaris" , "Stalker" . You could also add to them "The Matrix" and "Inception". All of them ask philosophical questions , while the last two are also very entertaining. "Moon" is definitely not an entertaining movie . It's also not a deep movie , even if it pretends to be meaningful.It's not about the fact that the story here is almost completely predictable and I have guessed the whole mystery after twenty minutes . It's also not about the fact that "Moon" left me emotionally cold.It's about the fact that the whole movie PRETENDS to ask important questions , but it never really asks them . It's a movie where the viewer see what he wants to see. Some people will say it's a movie that asks what it means to be human , some will say that it asks about the morality of scientific experiment , some will say that it is about computer/robot becoming human , some will say that it's a heartbreaking story about loneliness and a deep allegory for whole humanity and so on and on? "Moon" is a movie about nothing. Get over it. There is no deep message or any substance here. It's just a quite well made trick to make you believe that there is some deeper meaning here while there isn't. Don't waste your time and better watch one of the sci-fi classics of Kubrick or Tarkovsky . They are deep and definitely hard to watch , but not boring movies. Why ? Because there is subtle message hidden underneath them. You could also watch "Inception" or "Matrix" ? entertaining , high budget , commercial yes , but also deep movies.Don't let anybody full you that this pseudo-art is a deep movie. I give it 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just have zero understanding for the praise you lunatics are lavishing on this film. I caught a festival showing many moons ago, and was quite disappointed. So he's a clone. That supposed to be a big deal? What about the ridiculous premise: Earth government says, "Hey, yeah, how about having a manned moon base, but manned by just one guy, and oh, let's make him a clone who thinks he's a natural person!!" Uhhh... That's ludicrous. There's no way anyone would do that. And as the premise goes, so goes the rest of the movie.It's a nice production, but ultimately far too silly to be in any way believable. 5 out of 10. A disappointment. A big one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over rated nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying, I am baffled that this movie is receiving such high reviews or that the fanboys of this film are going completely out of their way to defend it.So, I recently heard people talking about some indie film called "Moon" that everyone kept comparing to Oblivion. So I went out and bought the Blu-ray and thought, I'll give it a try.For me this film started out interesting and wham, just like that, fell completely flat on its face once Sam's clone was revealed. I will give the director effort on the story concept (which is still over used imo) however as much as people seem to enjoy Sam Rockwell, his performance was dull and I just couldn't for the life of me relate to his character or even find compassion for his character. Some of the acting was so over the top, it came off as very cheesy. Not to mention the cheap looking space suit that had me cracking up.Look, I don't care if it was David Bowie's son who directed it or if Kevin Spacey was the voice of GERTY (which sounds like a female's name btw). This film seemed to have a ton of potential until the second act came along. I honestly wanted to turn it off at that point but I had to hold out hope, which to say never happened. I did drag myself to watch it through the end but was sorely disappointed. My wife who was in the room with me looked over and saw my disappointment and said, I'm sorry you wasted $10 on the Blu-ray for this.Enough said.If you want a decent sci-fi movie that actually has a story and better concept, well this is why Oblivion is what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting to really like Moon, an indie movie with a sci-fi setting and a reputation as a return to the meditative hard sci-fi classics of the 1970's. Even half an hour in I was still holding out hopes that it would prove to be le gem that it looked it could be. Eventually, as the unconvincing and tedious psychological posturing dragged on, without any depth or emotional effect I became resigned to the reality that this one was a stinker. It is a stinker. The denouement was both predictable and implausible. There's absolutely no good reason to construct a vast conspiracy involving clones for a mining operation on the moon. The whole basis of the plot seems utterly pointless and silly. A terrible movie, not good scifi at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a lunar mining employee's last weeks on the moon, when he encounters many unexpected twists.Reading the plot synopsis of "Moon" is enjoyable, as the story is filled with unexpected surprises. The minimalistic and futuristic sets look real, but plain and dull at the same time. Things happen slowly, and you can really feel the desolate solitude that Sam is in.However, the story is delivered slowly and is confusing. Most of the time it is a dull soliloquy, with occasional monotonous computer voices thrown in for a conversation. This means that the film is slow, dull and plain. There is not much to keep me interested at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie based on the IMDb rating of 8. Wow! I'm in disbelief. I'd give it a rating of 0.05 if I could.Any comparison between this film and the seminal masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey" is as absurd as comparing a high school football game to the Super Bowl.This is one of the absolutely worst films I have ever seen. The plot is so haphazard, dull and convoluted I still don't understand the story line.What I was able to piece together is a pretty implausible scenario for conducting mining operations on the Moon. The dialog ? what there is of it -- is unbelievable and ridiculous. The story drags and drags and drags because Sam Rockwell only has one other character to play against ? a clone of himself. His character is hapless, clueless, and idiosyncratic. He reminds me a little of the neurotic isolated astronaut Bruce Dern played in the 1972 "Silent Running." Oh, there's also his computer sidekick that's yet another clunky imitation of "2001's" legendary HAL 9000 computer. But this computer is a crying bore too. Kevin Spacey tries to sound like a flat unemotional computer, and his voice is so over-equalized that he sounds like he's talking from inside a toilet stall.Unlike the devilish scheming HAL, this is a nauseatingly altruistic computer that displays ? believe it or not ? sappy emotioncons. It's so submissive it offers to have its memory wiped. You half-expect it to ask you out for a beer at the bar, or to give you a back rub.By the time the film ends you are lost is space, or at least went through a space warp where 97 minutes stretched to what seems like three hours of tedium.I hope this film is not a DVD on NASA's International Space Station. The astronaut crew would be driven to go outside into the vacuum of space without their helmets on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our Culture is Erasing Itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you want to make a science fiction film, and you are obviously aware from the moment you start that you have watched Solaris and 2001 fifty times, you would think one would contemplate that out of respect you should stop there.I'm not a purist. I don't mind a revisit to a genre. However, those two films hit the things we needed, and it takes much more than the little ideas in moon to make for a movie even half-worth an homage.Our current generation of 20 year olds did not grow up watching 2001 or Solaris, so there is no frame of reference to catch this film and throw it directly onto a late night broadcast on the sci-fi channel -which is where it belonged back in 1985 when we weren't watching MTV.It's a damned shame film. Shame on these "filmmakers". Good grief. And, shame of some of the best reviewers, not excluding Roger Ebert himself, for not taking a blazing torch out and screaming for the negative of that film to be strung out for all to see.Neither Kubrick nor Tarkovsky would be stirring in their graves. They would in fact rise from the dead, take the director out for a night of heavy drinking, and then swat his bottom before putting him to bed and handing him a mini dv camera, telling him to spend the rest of his life video taping traffic.It's okay to make a movie that takes place in space. It really is. But, if you're going to do it, start from scratch, not from theft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film, good build-up and feel, some little set-backs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to add any more praise to this film, since that has been done often enough. I especially liked the build-up and the atmosphere. Definitely recommendable for people who generally enjoy sci-fi movies.xx SPOILERS xx Why don't I rate this film a perfect 10 - like so many others? 1. Some bits of the story leave you questioning the whole logic of the setting. Like the actual need for humans to be on the station, when they have to go through all that trouble to keep him "in his state". And wouldn't a one-year-contract be psychologically easier to bear? Would a nasty corporation programme a friendly A.I.? Etc. Okay, I will acknowledge that sci-fi always builds on sometimes far-fetched assumptions. Still, I don't like having too many simple questions unanswered.2. There were a lot of quotes and references that you can't really understand, unless you know the history of sci-fi movies. I went with my girl-friend and she asked me why GERTY was being so helpful. Well, since she hadn't seen 2001 or Alien, she didn't see GERTY's behaviour in contrast to other (rather negative) examples of human interaction with A.I. As someone who's seen most of the classics, I was always thinking: "reminds me of Solaris", "he's behaving like HAL", or "a corporate rescue mission? Like in Alien3?".I thought, sometimes the film-makers were too focused on playing with references than laying out their own plot.3. The ending was a bit too blunt. Suddenly we hear news headlines about shares dropping and accusations of him being an illegal alien. Why? My last thoughts were: "Oh, so this movie is actually about finances and politics?" That angle was completely unnecessary. The psychology behind being an expendable clone was mind-boggling enough. The rest can easily be left up to the minds of the audiences.Still, a good movie. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moon (2009) - Sam Rockwell is on the Moon! Duh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by newcomer Duncan Jones, son of worldwide singer David Bowie, "Moon" stars Sam Rockwell as a man named Sam Bell, at the end of a three-year solitary on the far side of the Moon. He tries to get back home to his family, but then something happens on the ship. He then finds out that...well, watch the movie and find out, because this is one of those movies that are better to be left unspoiled. Sam Rockwell delivers the best performance of his career, and he delivers such a sense of drama and heart into his performance. He blew me away in this movie. Besides Rockwell, Kevin Spacey brings the voice of GERTY, Sam's robot companion for three years. Director Duncan Jones has created such a unique and different motion picture that may not be for everyone. Although "Moon" is advertised as science-fiction, this is more of a sci-fi drama, that focuses more on characters, and not on the sci-fi elements. "Moon" premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, and it was given high critical acclaim. It's all for one good reason. "Moon" is a interesting, and enjoyable motion picture that will provoke your thoughts and test your patience. Sure, you might not understand a single detail that happens in this movie, but "Moon" is still one hell of a ride. "Moon", in my review, "beautifully executed, and thought-provoking".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly encapsulating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who haven't seen Moon, I would heavily advise watching it without any distractions to really get the most out of it. In my opinion, the film's two strongest qualities are its beauty and its thought provoking nature - two elements of a film that tend to require full attention to appreciate. The film is very minimalistic in both setting and characters, with Sam Rockwell providing a fantastic turn as Sam Bell, but the ideas it deals with can be placed in no such category. Identity and what it is to be human are both issues dealt with, as well as isolation, loss and sacrifice. Yet any who have seen this film would almost certainly argue that it is in no way convoluted or overcrowded, crediting the skill of Duncan Jones' directing and Nathan Parker's writing.The visuals of this film are stunning. Whether in the base itself, the appearance of GERTY (beautifully characterised by Kevin Spacey, who personifies the robot to the point of making us sympathise with it), or the moon itself, the shots were hugely effective. Some of the moon shots especially are incredibly beautiful and quite awe inspiring. The score compliments the cinematography beautifully, with Clint Mansell's work being reminiscent of his earlier score for Requiem for a Dream, one of the most famous modern pieces of film music.If you're primarily into Transformers and Need for Speed, this is probably one to miss (not meant derogatorily, but it is not an action junkie's film.) Otherwise, I highly, highly recommend this.</fullReview>

Its small budget, has few characters, has plenty of Sam Rockwell, and to top it all is a very thought provoking debut from a director who happens to be David Bowie's son: Duncan. Pretty different right? But it's the foremost point where Moon is almost entirely contrary that makes it a fundamental but essential independent movie.Sam (played by Sam) is just finishing his three contract of supplying energy from the moon to earth, to be reunited with his wife and child. He gets some nasty Shutter Island form of hallucinations before he severely crashes his moon truck-thingy and soon after, quiet literally meets his match. I won't give away anything more than the trailer because well no-one likes a spoil sport and for such a rare heart wrenching solely driven performance by Sam, I find it hard not to justify credit even if you have or haven't seen it with your own eyes.Kevin Spacey also stars, however he will be in a box shape form with a yellow face. Shouldn't be hard to spot; especially if you have seen a certain Stanley Kubrick film recently. But as previously mentioned a great story, unreliant on its look that has given Rockwell the chance to prosper with a lead role, easily puts the likes of Hollywood's multi-million extravaganza's to shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Rockwell is fantastic in an otherwise extremely boring movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always respected Sam Rockwell as an actor. This is why I went to see Moon, a drama/thriller set in space. I've got to admit, Sam Rockwell is fantastic in this, but I was thoroughly bored throughout this whole movie. It was like a really, really boring movie. It kept doing the same thing. We get it already- Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) finds a clone of himself, and immediately freaks out. It also hurts that someone as big as Kevin Spacey voices the robot, Gerty. They could of used anyone's voice for that, and to use someone as famous as Spacey makes it feel like the people making this film tried to hard to create a movie with an all-star cast. It's a one-man show from Rockwell, who delivers a great performance, but there is too much repetition and it is too boring. I was expecting to love it. I personally think Sam Rockwell is a great actor. When you look at other films like Choke, Joshua, and Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind, he is great in all off them, and he makes them great movies. I, now, am very sad to inform Moon doesn't live up to its premise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Bell (Rockwell) is the man on the moon in the last 2-weeks of a 3-yr contract, monitoring mining operations for a mineral that earth needs to solve its energy problems. He is alone except for Gerty (voice of Spacey) a computer that monitors Sam's health, the mining operation and the base station. Suddenly he gets sick and this almost causes a fatal accident outside the station. Then he realizes he is no longer alone. At first I thought, "well, here we go again with imaginary friends" and "let the ripoff continue."But, it's not that. The other person is a spitting image of himself and Sam doesn't know what to make of this. And, he gets no help from Gerty who will not answer his questions. But, since the other Sam doesn't seem to be a threat, Original Sam goes about his business and eventually confronts the "other Sam."This is good Sci-Fi, but there are some holes. Why would the company that Sam works for only allow one man to monitor the mining operation? Maybe the thinking is that Gerty would be enough. Hmmm??. Big clue concerns Sam's sickness, and a 3-yr contract. Can you figure it out?Original Sam does have some hallucinations: he sees a woman, not his wife, sitting in a chair. The woman hallucination is never explained. And, the accident is caused by his having another hallucination of the same woman outside the station. Again, never explained. Maybe hallucinations don't need to be explained and they are what they are. And, one more thing. A computer is not supposed to show emotion, but there are a few instances whereby Spacey got too involved and we hear some emotion in his voice. Not really a hole, but the computer's name of Gerty is never explained. Well, the name of HAL in 2001 was never explained until later on. The closest I can come is that Gerty is based upon a Jewish mother's name: Gertrude Goldberg (from the Goldbergs TV show back in the day) or was that Molly and not Gertrude? I give up, but it's the closest I can come. The Jewish mother reference is about someone who takes care of everything, like Gerty does. Get it? Tough room. All in all a very good Sci Fi movie and I would have nominated Sam Rockwell for an Oscar (yes, I'm still handing them out).Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, a lot in the early part of the movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And The Cow Jumped Over The Moon (!?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My guess? - One reason why some people are afraid to slam this piece of Sci-Fi junk is 'cause it was directed by David Bowie's son, the obviously no-talent, Duncan Jones.Am I wrong? Well, if I am in serious err here - You can be sure of one thing, it was certainly Daddy David's influence and, most likely, his financial backing of Moon that undoubtedly launched this ill-conceived klunker off the ground and paid into the cost of its expensive sets and impressive moonscape visuals.Well, am I wrong? For me Moon's "clone-ified" novelty of a literal one-man show lasted for about the first 15 fidgety minutes. And, then, at that point, once I realized what a total lunar toilet that this film's constipated story was heading down, it took all of the god-damn patience that I could possibly muster to see it through to its unbelievably disappointing and truly unconvincing ending.Believe me, Moon was the sort of sickening Sci-Fi slop that intergalactic yawns and celestial farts are made of.Perhaps, if a more competent and more likable and more dynamic actor (other than Sam Rockwell) had been chosen for the all-important role of Sam Bell and if the dead-end dialogue had been a helluva lot more snappy (instead of being exceedingly crappy), then, yes, Moon actually might have risen out from the moon-muck of an astral graveyard.But, let me tell ya - It was certainly bad enough having to endure the likes of 3 (?) Sam Rockwells here in Moon - But, on top of that, this poor victimized viewer was also forced to have to look at this twit's ugly, flabby ass cheeks, as well, during the senseless shower scene.(Like, was the sight of Rockwell's dimply, pimply moon supposed to be regarded as some sort of an added bonus here, or something?) Besides Rockwell's frickin' fat fanny freakshow, I absolutely hated Spacey's "Gerty" to infinity and beyond.Not only did Gerty's cheap, over-used, little "Happy Faces" grate on my nerves like you wouldn't believe - But, Spacey truly sucked as the choice to voice this dreary robot who clearly had some serious issues when it came to the ethics of artificial intelligence.No matter how hard little Kevin tried to imitate the voice of HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey, he just couldn't convincingly pull it off. All that he sounded like to me was just some completely forgettable nobody who was talking from inside a toilet stall in a public washroom (which was probably where Spacey was when he phoned in his uninspiring performance).All-in-all - Moon was utterly atrocious film-making. Yep. It sure was. Give me Plan 9 From Outer Space over this heap of mortified moon-dust any old day of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Moon" has a lot of things going for itself: Duncan Jones' direction is unagitated and focused, Clint Mansell wrote an atmospheric score (once again) and Sam Rockwell finally delivers that one performance that absolutely puts him on the map as the great actor he apparently is. Still, I found myself looking at the watch a couple of times during the movie.While "Moon" has an intriguing premise, the mystery is not really in the center of the story. In fact, this mystery is solved pretty quickly. Problem is that a pretty existentialist thought arises from the fact that the main character has to deal with meeting someone who looks just like him, but that this thought is never really elaborated on. What could have been a highly philosophical movie that takes a stance on human nature, ended up as more of a science- fiction-drama.Make no mistake, "Moon" is well worth seeing, but it's not in the same league as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Solaris" as it strives to be. It is, however, a promising start for Jones' career, so all eyes on this new talent and his upcoming projects!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Science fiction as a genre has pretty much been dead for the past eight years. Duncan Jones has attempted to revive the genre with his directorial debut, Moon. Unfortunately, this attempted reinvigoration quickly devolves into nothing more than a regurgitation of nearly every sci-fi movie since 1968.I can only assume Duncan Jones' original outline to his producer read something like: "Start with 2001, add a half cup Silent Running, a pint Wall?E, and a pinch of Alien. Whisk until The Sixth Day starts to take form then just keep pouring in Solaris until you hit the 90 minute mark. (And if you're feeling particularly festive, you can even garnish it with a single leaf of Midnight Cowboy.)"Read the full review at: http://cfilmc.wordpress.com/2009/07/11/moon/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't serious sci-fi and it's not a shoot-up either. So it's rather hard to rate. The plot holes are so obvious that it sometimes distracts attention from the main plot and this contains spoilers otherwise what's the fun of picking them apart? At first, I thought this was on a Jupiter moon, because there were problems with "live communication." But it turns out to be our own moon where a decent dish antenna can pick up strong signals. In addition, the whole automated cloning scheme doesn't make sense when "rescue ships" can be sent in a matter of hours to clean the politically incorrect mess. Finally, and this is the most annoying plot gap of all: How was the Bell character to be considered an "illegal alien?" Like from Mars or Pluto or something? This was obviously a jab at USA immigration policy and talk radio but fell flat and nonsensical.Apart from those shortcomings, it was neat how the viewer is surprised to learn that rather than the protagonist being recovered from the accident we thought, it turns out that it was a fresh clone. Then we get to see how they figure out the ethics of killing their own clone or sacrificing one of themselves to pull off the scam at the end.Considering the cheap leftist political ploy mentioned above and the plot holes, it's not surprising that I missed this film first time out. I accidentally hit it when it was on cableTV.I liked certain elements of the film. How the main computer had a smiley face emoticon similar to facebook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere out there in the future, astronaut Sam Bell(Sam Rockwell)is nearing the end of his three-year contract mining Helium-3 on the moon. It has become Earth's primary source of energy. Things become a bit rough as Sam is counting the days till his return home. A broken satellite makes communication impossible; except for conversations with "Gerty"(Kevin Spacey), the well-intentioned computer on moon-base "Sarang". Sam's health appears to be falling apart the closer he gets to leave the moon. On a routine lunar rover drive, Sam has a serious accident. While recovering he finds that he has very little memory; and he is certain he has met a younger, but angrier version of...himself. Has he completely lost his mind or is this lonely astronaut a victim of a dastardly plan that "Gerty" has not shared with him? The company has an agenda that evolves with Sam. Not just a Sci-Fi fantasy flick...MOON actually gives you a chance to exercise your gray matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished with this at the EIFF. Sadly the story was a bit too obvious. If you've seen any form of Sci-Fi before, then 30 minutes in to this film you'll have most of this story worked out, and 45 minutes you'll have it all worked out. In fact, there is nothing in this story (or the imagery for that matter) that hasn't been done in the TV Comedy series Red Dwarf. It ends up feeling like a straight version of "the best of Red Dwarf".Sam Rockwell does put in a very good performance but that is the only high point. The directing is straight-forward and the dialogue is nothing-special. This is not to say that it's a bad film, it just that the main focus in this film, the plot, is unlikely to keep anyone enthralled. By the end you just want to know if you've guessed the specific number correct (I'll leave that comment vague!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious "Moon" lands short of exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter the premise, a film puts itself at a disadvantage when it calls for a one man show. Sam Rockwell, as talented as he is, cannot generate enough interesting conflict with nothing at his disposal but the skin-tingling monotone voice of Kevin Spacey. In other words, films like "Moon" have to work twice as hard to keep our attention and more importantly, capture our imagination. Creator Duncan Jones' first feature-length film makes an ambitious attempt to pull off this challenge, but it doesn't fully get there.The echoing theme in outer space movies is the silence, loneliness and its consequent madness. With only Sam Rockwell as astronaut Sam Bell, the expectation is "Moon" will repeat those themes and the hope is it will shed new light on them. There are a few snippets where it does get us to begin contemplating existence in a new way, but it doesn't meditate on these ideas enough, doesn't let them cook.Sam Bell is a space worker on the dark side of the moon in the near future when Earth is harvesting moon rocks for Helium 3, a new fuel/energy alternative. Bell is contracted for three years to oversee four rock-harvesting machines. At the time of the story, he's nearly completed his three years and eagerly awaits going home to his wife and daughter when an accident happens leading to a startling discovery.I've always been a fan of Sam Rockwell. He's done a great job balancing comedy and drama in numerous films such as "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" and most recently "Frost/Nixon." He brings the same talents to a quiet "Moon." However, "Moon" doesn't give him a lot of opportunity to stretch his dramatic talents despite being the only role in the film; his character is thinly developed, his motivations never clearly spelled out."Moon" has an opportunity to paint a beautiful but tortured picture of life in outer space, but little of Jones' visual imagery really sticks in our minds. A film with so few roles should really be advanced in the way of visual storytelling, should pry deep into the soul of its main character through image, but that's a lot to ask from a novice filmmaker. Instead, he's busy fighting the audience's assumption that the Spacey-voiced computer assistant, GERTY, will inevitably turn evil. You can't spend all your efforts trying not to be too much like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and not identify another force of antagonism. Jones also struggles a lot in the beginning editing scenes together, trying to keep the film's pace up until the discovery.There is quite an inspiring idea behind "Moon," once the true nature of Bell's situation is revealed, but it never hits us the way Jones wants it to. There's simply not enough conflict despite Rockwell's best efforts to keep our attention and the space visuals are not as awe- striking as they need to be to counter that disadvantage as well. "Moon" is a unique movie, but it's a very long and lonely hour and a half.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not My Flavor of Sci Fi but Decent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just found out about Moon recently and decided to rent it and check it out. I am a big sci fi fan. I love Star Trek, Star Wars, and pretty much anything fact or fiction that has to do with outer space. Moon definitely looked like a great movie. Sadly I was somewhat disappointed by this movie. First off, the pluses. The acting is great. Sam Rockwell puts on a convincing, solid performance, and I know of him from Galaxy Quest. Kevin Spacey's voice is creepy and spooky for the robot and it fits the movie well. Although some set designs were overused, the set was very nice. Cool space station looking rooms with nice space fonts, computer screens, and slick space uniforms. Lastly, the sound mix for this movie is pretty good, nice deep bass sound effects, Moon is a great home theater movie.Now to the downsides. The CGI. The CGI is budget. Some scenes look great with the moon, space, and the planets, but then other scenes, the giant rovers look like toy plastic cars with too much lighting in some scenes and not enough in others. The storyline and movie in general are very boring at times. Parts of the movie I felt like I wanted to quit watching because they were boring (and some scenes showing blood being vomited were disgusting as well). Other parts of the story don't make sense or are completely uninteresting. The whole movie revolves around similar rooms and sets which gets boring with one actor throughout the whole movie. Also, GERTY was really corny. A futuristic A.I. robot with a smiley face screen? I thought that was really stupid and killed the movie. If GERTY was more serious in design, or even had legs and eyes, maybe I would find him more interesting. Lastly, the piano style music theme in the movie was really overused. There was hardly ever a change in pace or music throughout this movie.Moon is a teeter totter movie. Some parts are very well executed and catchy and then the next scene of the movie will either be boring, silly, or downright confusing. Either way, I think it's worth a watch from any sci fi fans. Many people here found this to be a 10/10 movie, I kind of disagree. I think regular movie goers should pass. Personally, I think the best sci fi movie made in the past few years is the 2008 flick "Sunshine", about a ship with multiple astronauts trying to save the Sun from burning out. Much better thriller and sci fi movie for me. If anyone needs a good sci fi film, I recommend Sunshine over Moon, but if you think this movie is your style of movie, then check it out!</fullReview>

This film starts out comparing itself with odyssey (greatest film period) and solaris (very odyssey inspired), then calling it "one of those rare space gems". They've made a great soundtrack, spend millions on props and actors. And then....nothing...No, seriously, absolutely nothing. One actor (except when there's two or three of him), the weakest story and plot ever (a five-year-old could think of this). NOT in any way clever or inventive, just tedious and dumb.I suppose some people think "aah.. a sophisticated scifi experience, maybe even space-opera like, we can discuss seriously, while smoking cigars and sipping whine" - I can only say: AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH you've been had!Sorry Hollywood, you can't just steal all the props and ideas from other movies, without adding something yourselves.

		<fullReview>Are you dying to see a movie that looks like it could have been done in your garage? Well, you have struck gold with Moon - or better yet, moon dust.With Kevin Spacey sounding like Lex Luthor doing HAL 9000 and Sam Rockwell sounding like Sam Rockwell, who could ask for more? Welllll, if you're stuck on the moon, you may be satisfied. I was not on the moon and so I stayed because it was my choice. It ended up being one of the worst decisions I ever made.I was asking more questions about the sensibility of this story than I was asking about the characters and their purposes. The movie is advertised as Mystery, Sci-Fi and Thriller. IMO, there was never any thriller; the mystery died quickly when Rockwell's presence on the moon became nonsensical; Sci-Fi was not so Sci-Fi after all, but more of a delivery of Sociological Fiction. The scenery was one dimensional which, with a better story, may have been OK as a Twilight Zone episode. And, actually, it came across as a bad Twilight Zone rip-off.Spacey and Rockwell performed fine but I found it hard to appreciate their performances because the story was so bland. The intermittent jabs at humor were lost in the Moon's atmosphere.I went because I thought it was going to involve a good science fiction story. This is not good sci-fi. This is not good entertainment 2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow!I have never written a review or even made a comment on a film before but I felt the need to after viewing this TERRIBLE FILM! 1st. If your going to make a film about space or the moon how about doing some research on the subject before hand.One of the many amazing things about space is " the lack of gravity as we know it on earth ". Something that totally failed in this film.Trying to walk slowly just doesn't sell walking on the moon.I've seen drunk mimes sell walking in space better than this film. Sure the Exterior shots were somewhat compelling but really, we can all watchlive space footage on www.nasa.TV so why couldn't this film put at least some sliver of reality into the film,what a pathetic effort!Thankfully it looks as though minatures were used for the exterior sets which slightly saved me from barfing in my own mouth.That was short lived as the Interior design was just awful.Poorly designed with enough " Mind your Step " and cheap generic numbered vinyl graphics to throw a stick at. It appeared as though the station was aged down by a bunch of 4 year olds with black paint brushes.As you can tell I was not a fan of this film. Sure there were moments that made me think ' Hey maybe this will get better ' but those were shortly followed by Kevin Spacey's voice trying to lull me to sleep. I know there are many references to " Hal and 2001 " but what was up with the stupid happy/sad face ?I have better emotion icons on my phone!This film stunk from the very start, crappy opening text credits , poor production value and design , a very weak effort to sell me that this base was on the moon where things weigh under 17% of their weight on earth. If your going to make a sci-fi film about living on the moon then please....at least make it believable that the story takes place there!The only saving molecule of goodness in this film was Sam Rockwell and well maybe the treatment for this script.Sam's performance was solid and honest. The script in theory had an interesting side but was buried deep inside an asteroid of crap." Moon " just more space trash.</fullReview>

I missed it in the local cinema but bought the DVD - which turned out to be a disappointment quite apart from the film itself. (It first of all just played "snow" and the special features refuse to run. Shame that - they might have thrown some light on the plot....) Obviously a low budget movie, the constant jump cuts, shonky outfits and wobbly computers could be forgiven if the story warranted it. I don't think I am particularly thick, but the long, drawn out sequences of a moon rover approaching various stations, the haphazard editing and the way the scenes are manipulated so as to get the same actor in the one shot made it a real effort to keep watching.The final straw for me is the really terrible diction of the various Sams - the mumbling delivery meant I could not follow much of the dialogue. That certainly didn't help understanding what the hell was going on - not that it mattered, since I lost interest halfway through.Oscars? Please don't go on - I'll split my sides!</fullReview>

Many practical problems with the script might have been solved had the setting been moved to an isolated asteroid at the outermost fringe of the Asteroid Belt. This would relocate the action far from Earth and make Rockwell's predicament seem more lonely and precarious. As it is, with the Earth looming large in the sky, just two days away, and with Sam possessing a lunar vehicle which enables him to drive around the moon -- perhaps to the next mining station? -- he just didn't seem especially cut off from the rest of civilization.
