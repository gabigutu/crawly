		<shortDescription>Allen's Dreams are Magical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something about the midnight hour, something special, mystical, and magical. In the case of this marvelous movie, its impact is fully realized, as we see our protagonist suddenly realize that he has the opportunity to face that which he truly admires, treasures, and dreams about. In the opening scenes, he expresses his desire to settle in the city of lights, and we know it's not going to be an easy thing to do. His girlfriend and he are quite different in their appreciation of what being in Paris means. She understands it's special, maybe from an aristocrat's point of view. He might be looking at it, as the dream place for an artist to find aspiration to fulfill his artistic goals.One night, he wanders into the streets of Paris and finds himself lost, only to find himself rescue by a party of night socialites who turn out to be quite famous in some literary circles. Soon, the screenwriter/aspiring writer has an opportunity to see himself living one of his dreams as well as slowly come to some surprising epiphanies as he discovers more and more who his new acquaintances might truly be, and most important what their dreams really are.The film is set in several time periods, and Paris glows intensely and seductively in everyone of those. From its overcast skies and reflective streets, showing lovely architectural details and its magnificent landmarks to the superb and lovely recreations of older time periods, one can't help being seduced, charmed, and inspired to find a way to show what a special place, and consequently what a truly magical film this might be.Performances are outstanding all around, with Cotillard once again stealing every second she is on the screen. Through her eyes and carefully delivered lines, we understand what attracts us to this special time and place. She is a gorgeous and very talented performer, one who might be truly aware of her standing, yet she doesn't dwell on it. She attracts many types, but her philosophy is unique, move on, enjoy, live the moment. In a way, she is like the city that has inspired Allen, and many others before him. Paris as a place might not be aware of its magnetism, its beauty, and its power. Cotillard's muse is the perfect human equivalent, a dazzling and potent woman, who moves from man to man, place to place, time to time, and who surprises us with her own wishes near the end of the story.Wilson inhabits the Allen persona, and he does a very good job, not creating a tired imitation, an annoying cliché that could have ruined the perfect balance of sight, sounds, and insightful dialog, keeping this masterpiece way ahead of the best Allen has offered before. For those of us who gasped during the fantasy sequences of "The Purple Rose of Cairo", the marvelous recreations of the stage in "Bullets Over Broadway", the dissection of relationships in many of his best films, get ready to see it all finally come together, as he picks from the best, and adds his personal touch, with many a funny and clever observation, uttered by Wilson with a honest and complete sense of wonder. Unlike many of his leading men, Wilson displays an innocence which allows him and us to see his adventures in a fresh light."Midnight in Paris" is a beautiful display of what movie magic can truly create, a sense of wonder long gone from contemporary cinema; This is a movie that entertains, teaches, and wears each one of its elements, like Paris bewitches us with every light, every facade, and every heartbeat of its music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's love affair with France, which goes back decades, finds its finality with "Midnight in Paris," the latest of Allen's Parisian brochures, which recently opened at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday. The good news is that Allen seems to be paying attention in a way he hasn't always done in recent films, and has found a way to channel his often-caustic misanthropy, half-comic fear of death and anti-American bitterness into agreeable comic whimsy. The nominal point of "Midnight in Paris" is that we've all got to make the best of life in our own time while longing for a past that probably never existed. If anything, Allen seems to be rebuking himself, ever so mildly, for his compulsive romanticism, his obsession with the past and his disconnection from contemporary American life. Allen has baked us a sweet, airy Parisian dessert with just a sense of sentimental substance in the finish. One of his better films in his latter years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magical Mystery Tour De Force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's latest is beautifully written and a charming story that belongs in the top ten of his all-time greats. From the opening montage of lush, picturesque Parisian scenes the film is a love letter to the city of lights. Owen Wilson is perfectly cast as Gil Pender a Hollywood writer who has penned his first novel about a man who owns a nostalgia shop. Throughout his stay in Paris he hearkens back to the iconic characters who once roamed its winding cobblestone streets.For everyone who sometimes ponders how life would be in another time, this film through whimsical storytelling and pure fantasy transports us. Perhaps that elusive world does not really exist or we are never truly content in whatever station we reside. Gil is enraptured with discovering the bistros where Ernest Hemmingway once wrote or the idea of living in garret with a sky light.His fiancé played by Rachel McAdams who adroitly depicts a character both shallow and blasé and content to listen to the pseudo-intellectual musings of her onetime flame. To discuss the plot much further and divulge the magic twist would be a shame.Midnight in Paris is a gourmet meal of delectably charming and playful scenes. Adrian Brody is riotous as a surreal artist and Kathy Bates deftly evokes a wise and famous writer. A character in the film remarks of seeing a movie but, she cannot recall what it was about or who was in it, not so with Midnight in Paris. It is a sweet, endearing and thought provoking film that will whisk you away into a sublime magical world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Do you think it's possible to love two women at the same time?," asks our protagonist Gil Prender to a tour guide discussed Auguste Rodin's love for his mistress and his wife. Like that's the first time we've heard that question in a Woody Allen movie. Infidelity, gorgeous women, and neuroticism are some of Allen's favorite motifs, so it's really not too much of a surprise that they all appear in Midnight in Paris.That said, Allen's rendition of those ideas feels fresh this time. Midnight in Paris is a sweet, fun romp through the art world of France. This light comedy may not have some of the heavier messages about adultery and art that previous Allen films have had, but Midnight in Paris is, nonetheless, an enjoyable exercise in allusion to the Lost Generation and artists of the 1920s.Midnight in Paris begins with the same idea of a man, in this case a screenwriter named Gil played by Owen Wilson, searching for connection with the real world. The protagonist is clearly a projection of Allen's self, but no matter. Gil is engaged to the Inez, played by a blond Rachel McAdams who coincidentally (or is it?) looks like Scarlet Johansson from Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Inez bores Gil with her pretentious friends and spiteful parents, which ultimately causes Gil to seek inspiration on his own time by drunkenly wandering that streets of Paris. One night, he is invited into a car that takes him back to the 1920s where he meets his favorite writers and artists, something that eventually leads to a breakthrough in his work. A large supporting cast includes Kathy Bates, Allison Pill, Adrien Brody, Michael Sheen, and Marion Cotillard.Allen's conception of Paris is just as romantic as the story itself. The film's physical look matches some of the complexities of the women in that it appears to be almost splashed in gold. It is, after all, the City of Lights. It's a beautiful movie that matches the pretty faces of its starring women.Allen's screenplay leaps right off the page thanks to his cast, but this too is something that isn't unusual for a Woody Allen film. At his best, Allen picks actors that play their parts with a sense of realism that, when combined with some elements of the fantastic, charm the audience. Just about everyone here manages to do just this, with the exception of Rachel McAdams, who tries her hardest with an underdeveloped character. Marion Cotillard is the best of the cast (as per usual) in her role as Picasso's mistress. She's bursting with sexuality yet she's grounded in her ability to deliver her dialogue with her natural French accent.Midnight in Paris is fantastique. In comparison to Woody Allen's previous tales of lust and spite, his newest film feels like a dessert rather than a filling entree, yet this is exactly how a good, highbrow summer movie should be. The cast shines just as bright as the lights at the top of the Eiffel Tower and Allen proves himself worthy of his place in society as a master director once again. By no means a classic, Midnight in Paris is a pretty little diversion, one that is grounded in a theatrical gimmick that totally works every time. This, along with The Tree of Life, will be one of a few summer movies that will dazzle visually (without explosions) and somehow manage not to insult the viewer's intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie! It blends film noir with Stardust Memories, The Purple Rose of Cairo, and a bit of Annie Hall. The scenes of Paris were enough to make one fall in love. The music was superb! Having all the artists and writers show up was the ultimate name dropping contest! Their caricatures were hysterical! Casting Adrien Brody as Salvatore Dali was mind blowing, along with the surreal discussion about a rhino. I think Owen Wilson is the best Woody Allen by far. He has a kind of naivete that seems to fit perfectly with who Woody seems to be and the combination of Owen's good looks with Woody's humor is riveting! Of course the "nostalgia" theme and the -I really want to be somewhere else because it's too boring here- give the story a whole other layer of meaning. For we artists and writers it's one of the things that sparks our creativity, so I loved this discussion and the never ending unraveling the story provokes. While he's entertaining you, getting you to laugh hysterically about it all, you're actually getting the point he's trying to make! There is no one who is so brilliant! Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French Woody, at last!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The love between the French and the Americans has always been mixed with an element of dismissal even contempt but the love is real. Woody Allen walks that fine line in truly inspired fashion. "Midnight in Paris" is a delight. This is he first time I actually loved Owen Wilson. He is terrific as Woody's alter ego. Rachel McAdams superb. Her mean American girl is hilarious and frighteningly recognizably, so are Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy as her parents. What a chillingly awful, normal pair. I loved the moment in which Owen Wilson, in a great close up, comes to accept what's happening around him. I accepted it too. Happily. Another stand out moment: the meeting with Salvador Dali, played brilliantly over the top by Adrien Brody. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite a lot of great lines carrying life's wisdom; Profound reflection and insight of living the precious present expressed in a light-hearted touch! If you have your own 'Golden Age' fantasy, you will likely enjoy it. This movie seems to be relatively more straightforward in communicating its message than some of Allen's other works, such as "You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger." As a plus, lovely cinematography of the city of Paris - Mr. Allen has apparently fallen in love with the 'good old (and charming)' European major cities; e.g., London, Paris, Barcelona and etc. Very likely, you will leave the movie theater with a big and warm smile on your face...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insufferably shallow characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an interview with L.A. Weekly, Woody Allen said, "The human predicament is so tragic and so awful that, short of an act of magic, we're doomed." Given his questionable view of the human condition, one wonders what the word "magic" means to him. There is little indication of it in his latest film, Midnight in Paris, a love letter to an imagined Paris in the 1920s. Set to the music of Sidney Bechet, the film opens with a 3 1/2 minute montage of Paris by cinematographer Darius Khondji's that is little more than a travelogue showing the usual tourist sights rather than the true Paris beyond the Eiffel Tower and the five-star hotels that Mr. Allen seems so enamored with - street vendors, bookshops, cheese, bread, wine, and pastry shops, outdoor cafés on the Left Bank, and quaint streets loaded with charm - the Paris of the Parisians.As the film begins, we hear disembodied voices chattering away over the credits. It takes a few minutes to find out that we are listening to an engaged couple, Gil (Owen Wilson), a hack screen writer turned novelist and his shrill fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) talking about plans for their wedding. They are visiting Paris at the behest of their wealthy parents, businessman John (Kurt Fuller), who Allen lets us know right away is a right-wing Tea Partier, and his charmless wife, Helen (Mimi Kennedy), whose interests seem to lie in spending thousands of dollars for antique furniture. Almost immediately we can sense that the engaged couple may not be right for each other.Inez is always on schedule, making plans and demanding that Gil go along with her every whim. Gil, on the other hand, (at first anyway) is adjustable, willing to go along to get along, not a good beginning for a marriage. As if we did not have enough of insufferably shallow characters, however, (Allen's desultory persona is there in spirit), the director throws in old friends of Inez, Carol (Nina Arianda) and Paul (Michael Sheen), her pedant of a husband, who Inez used to have a relationship with. It is not a mystery why, after a few failed attempts at socialization and sightseeing, Gil insists on being alone to take walks at night to get his so-called creative juices flowing.The conceit of the film is that Gil, while out walking at midnight, is picked up by an antique cab and enters a time warp, traveling back to Paris as it was in the Twenties, presumably an invigorating and exciting time to be alive when ex-patriot Americans and Europeans interacted with innovative artists, writers, and musicians in a Bohemian atmosphere. With an "Oh gee, Oh gosh, Oh golly" expression on his face, Gil meets and hangs out with F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Pablo Picasso (Marial Di Fonzo Bo), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody) Luis Bunuel (Adrien de Van), all shown together like the director was testing the audience to "Name that Tune". Naturally, they are all so fascinated with the exotic Gil.What could have been a wondrous and entrancing experience becomes a stupefying cliché in Allen's hands. The 1920 artists are mostly one-dimensional caricatures delivering "clever" dialogue without spontaneity or wit, except for Stoll's lively discussion with Gil, a scene that begins to show promise for the film's direction but is soon dropped. With some exception, most of the characters resemble the cardboard cutouts from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Hemingway, the macho man, talks about his war exploits and challenges Gil to a boxing match, Dali pounds his chest shouting "I am Dali! Dali!, Picasso feuds with his lovers and so forth on into the night. Meanwhile, Gil becomes smitten with Picasso's lover, the entrancing Adrianna (Marian Cotillard) and makes his return every night at midnight in the same vintage car.Gertrude Stein agrees to read and comment on Gil's novel about a nostalgia shop. What else would she do with her time? The film gives the impression that life in that era was one big party with important artists never doing any work, never feeling lonely and depressed, and never seeking the quiet places, suitable for reflection and serious thinking. Of course, Adrianna isn't satisfied with the glorious Twenties and travels with Gil further back in time to the "Belle Époque" of the 90s. If all of this sounds superficial and dull rather than full of mystery and fun, it's because it is. Allen has nothing meaningful to say about the human condition, witness his philosophy from Match Point that posits that life is all about luck and little else.His facile message here is that we should appreciate our present circumstances rather than long for something unattainable, (especially if we live in the lap of luxury as do most of Allen's characters). This is a worthy if banal message but it is lost on Gil whose actions on returning to present time negate whatever value the message might have offered. Traveling to a distant time should have a calming effect such as in Rod Serling's Twilight Zone episode from Season 1 called "A Stop at Willoughby" where a train stops in 1888, allowing a harried businessman to experience an illuminated world filled with simplicity and serenity, qualities nowhere to be found in Midnight in Paris, a film about as magical as shopping at Walmart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Woody Allen, so already I'm biased. But even I will admit that he's been spotty for the last...my God!...twenty years or so. "Curse Of The Jade Scorpion" will forever be his lowest moment, and in his later phase "Match Point" and "Vickie Christina Barcelona" remain the highlights. Well, we can add another to that list. By no means is this movie an "Annie Hall" or a "Manhattan", let alone a "Husbands and Wives". But if you've been bored by what you've been seeing at the Multiplexes lately, if you think "The Hang-Over 2" sucked and you've despaired that the romantic comedy is dead...than I'm delighted to tell you to go see this movie right now. See it on a big screen! It's gorgeous to look at, fun to watch, romantic, sweet, smart, and pleasantly old-fashioned. This movie is not a masterpiece, and yet I'm giving it 10/10 because it was perfect for what it was -- a modest pleasure that left me in a great mood, and even a little inspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen Is Back In Fine Form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen takes Paris and bathes it within its own glory all the while making one of his most entertaining films in decades. Great cinematography, classic music, french food, french culture and Allen's trademark humor are pure magic. You may see some of the familiar character types from other films, but they only add to the mixture. Odd man out is Owen Wilson, but somehow he sheds his B-movie past and encompasses the Woody Allen humor without mimicking Allen. The ever-evolving plot twists will have you laughing as well as entranced. This is the first Allen film (in a long time) where he doesn't pontificate about life and death, but only celebrates the present while ironically, living in two eras. This is beyond Oscar material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We'll always have Paris."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Paris, France is exciting and peaceful." Gertrude SteinWelcome to the world of Woody Allen as he has always loved it: nostalgic, romantic, imperfect, and full of hope. Midnight in Paris is one of his finest treatises on the lure and delusions of the past: Like Zelig it depicts other times, like Purple Rose of Cairo it uses magic realism to deal squarely with the present. Allen has another of his surrogates, this time Gil (Owen Wilson),who virtually experiences the past (the twenties) while dealing with the troublesome present.Gil, engaged to marry Inez (Rachel McAdams), is with her and her parents on business in Paris where he hopes to work on his novel while he is still a successful Hollywood writer. Although she is a materialist who would like him to become wealthy to enjoy the life his parents are used to, he dreams of escaping the hack work of LA and living in the City of Lights for inspiration, just as his idols Fitzgerald and Hemingway did in the roaring twenties.Well, the twenties roar back to him as he experiences their friendship and the mentoring of Gertrude Stein, among just a few of the many expatriate luminaries he meets through the magic of nostalgia. Just one of the Allen signature touches that make him the equal of great European directors such as Rohmer and Godard is opening the film with music that reflects the allure of the twenties, the romance of Paris, and his abiding love for this city: "Si Tu Vois Ma Mere" by Sidney Bechet combines jazz, the clarinet, the twenties, and Allen with a romantic nostalgia.Owen Wilson catches the halting diffidence of the typical Allen persona without slavishly imitating him. Yet whatever little duplication Wilson employs endears as he sweetly visits his heroes, falls in love, and comes to terms with his writer's voice and his mismatched engagement. But that engagement is the troublesome present; the past offers the chance to experience history on a human level that only someone who writes for now and reveres the past can do. The magic and the realism, both requiring hard work from the protagonist, lead to surprising understanding of human nature, the delusion of nostalgia and Paris, and hope for a present that brings love and inspiration."For all we know, Paris might be the hottest place in the universe." (Gil)It's been at least a decade since I have enjoyed an Allen movie this much.</fullReview>

Meanwhile, take it from this disappointed moviegoer that one simple idea is not enough to fill 90 minutes even if repeated three times.Contrary to the movie's claim, there was a better epoch where your films did have depth, humor, and acting. "Midnight", with all the recognition it received, sets the bar so low that aspiring directors feel like nouveau Bu?uels with their 'Hangover 2'.As Ernest Hemingway said (although not in this movie): "The most essential gift for a good writer is a built-in shock-proof $#%*-detector."Please get one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie includes Gertrude Stein; therefore, it MUST be good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm sure some moviegoers did find this film enchanting, I think the greater majority of critics and viewers who claim it's a masterpiece are just afraid to admit that a film that name-drops so many intellectuals is just not very good. For a film whose list of characters includes some of the greatest minds of the early twentieth century, "Midnight in Paris" has little to say about the creative process or inspiration.Maybe I've just gotten sick of Woody Allen's gimmick. Every film he makes includes the same list of players: the shrill wife / girlfriend, the overbearing other man / father, the nebbishy Allen stand-in (played this time by Owen Wilson, who makes a valiant, stuttering effort but is far too likable and easygoing a screen presence to really come off as neurotic and quirky), the ravishing young girl who finds the nebbish irresistible. And every film he makes includes terrific actors reciting their lines as if they're at the script's first table read.Possible spoiler territory: Allen starts the film with a five-minute travelogue of nice places to visit in Paris, then introduces us to characters we'd never be able to stomach in real life. They have affairs and spend $18,000 on chairs and attend wine-drinking parties. We meet Gil and his fiancée, whose engagement is a complete mystery, and the fiancée's father, who must be evil because he's Republican. After watching these people amble around Paris for a while, we join Gil as he journeys back in time somehow to meet the artists he claims as personal heroes.Many episodes of "Doctor Who" deal with time travel better than this film does. I'm not saying this to score a cheap point: The Vincent van Gogh episode from season 5, for example, introduces us to a world-famous artist as a brilliant but troubled thinker who has passion and ideas he struggles to express, and whose work in turn is shown inspiring those in the future.Not so here. Gil seems to take no inspiration whatsoever from this amazing blessing, responding to his ability to travel through time with what can only be described as nonchalance. He encounters Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Stein, and other writers we all read in college. Here's where I began to find the name-dropping irritating. These are CliffNotes versions of these great thinkers. Hemingway is brash. Zelda Fitzgerald is loony. Gertrude Stein is heavyset. We get it. What does this movie have to say about their work, their influence, their passion? What draws them together and makes their work vital? Certainly we don't find out by watching Gil. At first, he's kinda happy to show Stein his novel, but then once he meets Marion Cotillard as a Lost Generation groupie, he shifts his ambition to sleeping with Marion Cotillard. I can't blame him, but I have no idea what the movie's statement becomes at this point. Something involving nostalgia, but even Gil admits that it's not a very compelling epiphany. Big spoiler: This amazing time-traveling adventure of self-discovery ends up not with Gil reinvigorated and pursuing his dream, but deciding to hang around in Paris because it's pretty in the rain, and meeting a nice hot young girl who likes Paris because it's pretty in the rain. What I'm trying to say is: Shallow movie.To its credit, this movie did make me question, at about the 75th verse of "Let's Fall in Love," why Hemingway didn't punch Cole Porter in the jaw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak for Woody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually Woody Allen movies maintain certain artistic level: acting, humor, avoiding cliché, music, etc. Usually Woody Allen movies are made for intelligent viewers, with intelligent viewer in mind. Unfortunately Midnight in Paris is not one of such films.Instead of a light, dynamic, full of irony and natural acting "smart" comedy, we get a cheesy, predictable, and oversimplified "Hollywood" style flick. All the characters are so primitive, and overemphasized, that it's boring like hell. Snobism of one of the characters, lack of understanding between a main character and his bride , eccentricity of "great artists", naive character of a main character, etc, etc, etc - all of it - is so exaggerated and so dull, that I could not believe, that it's for real. I thought that maybe in the end there will be some twist, or some justification of such bad acting and such terrible script. But no, everything was for real, and a movie ended with the most predictable and boring end.I would never believe, it's a Woody Allen movie. The only good thing about the film is music, but that's definitely not enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>over-rated fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to "Midnight in Paris" full of warnings that I'd like the scenes of Paris but the film wasn't much. The warnings were basically correct. Although inoffensive and even occasionally humorous (e.g., the Hemingway parody), the film was just too silly and unbelievable to be a paean to a great city. The moral of the story is hardly original or profound: don't live in the past, and the time-travel gimmick was cute but more cleverly done in Back to the Future. Worst of all, Allen confuses characterization with caricature, from the protagonist's uncaring fiancée and her right-wing father and money-consumed mother to the comic-book pseudo-intellectual ex-boyfriend. As to the Woody Allen main character: he was so na?ve that no one could possibly believe he was an experienced and successful Hollywood writer?he seemed more like the editor of his high school newspaper. Why any women (let alone two perfectly normal Parisian women?the only appealing characters in the whole film) were attracted to him was a mystery, as was why he and his fiancée ever got beyond a first date, having so little in common. As I was walking home from the theater, I was trying to figure out why even the many scenes of Paris didn't particularly affect me emotionally. After all, it's a city I love, my favorite in the world and one I've visited many times. Then it dawned on me that the Paris I love could not be the same Paris loved by that doofus of a main character. The only remaining mystery is why the critics have lavished praise on this very mediocre film, one that they'd probably trash were it not a Woody Allen film. My only answer is that they are somehow relieved that the Woody Allen who has produced so many pretentiously "intellectual" films is reduced to turning out routine Hollywood fluff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight Magical Movable Feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It had to happen sooner or later, and finally it did. Woody Allen and Paris "fell" in love with each other, and, as the result, we, the viewers, received a precious gift from the master of subtle, intelligent and charming dra-medies, gentle and charming "movable feast," the new movie "Midnight in Paris ".I have been a fan of Woody Allen for long time and seen all his movies, those that he made, and those in which he starred or only wrote the screenplay for. I look forward to each of his films and I am ready to love them before I even see them. I knew I would like Midnight in Paris, but I had no idea how good it was. From the first frame, following the Darius Khondji's camera on such familiar but uniquely beautiful streets, alleys, boulevards and quays of the City of Light, it was hard not to fall in love with Paris and with the film of Allen, his love letter to the most famous city in the world, capital of love and Mecca for writers, artists, musicians and artists to whom Paris gave inspiration during all times and epochs - Belle Époque 1890s, the Golden days of the 1920s, and today, right now...Midnight in Paris is a delightful, kind (yes, this is Woody Allen), light, and charming film, which can be described as A Paris Midnight Magical Movable Feast. Paris in the film is beautiful during day light, night time, bright sun, and rainy hours. Oscar nominee, the master cinematographer of many remarkable films, including Panic Room, Se7en and Evita, Darius Khondji worked with Allen on three films: Anything Else (2003), Midnight in Paris (2011), and the next film, the Roman project Bop Decameron (2012).Soundtrack consists of Allen's favorite songs from the 1920s-30s by such songwriters as Cole Porter, Glen Miller, and Enoch Light, and from the repertoire of Josephine Baker and Juliet Greco. For the original film theme, Allen picked the guitar composition of the French jazz guitarist Stephane Wrembel "Bistro Fada". Wrembel's influence and source of inspiration has been the music of the famous French Gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt, whose longtime fan and admirer is Woody Allen himself. According Wrembel, Allen was searching for a typical French-Parisian melody, reflecting the spirit and atmosphere of Paris. I can confirm that the film theme and the songs that Allen picked up for Midnight in Paris are important, integral component of the film's charm and add to the romantic and joyous feeling that the film brings to the viewers.As always, in Woody Allen's movies, the actors give uniformly good performances. Owen Wilson is very convincing and likable as Gil, Hollywood's successful screenplay writer who works on a first novel, a protagonist, a much younger, attractive, and funny Woody Allen stand-in. Adrien Brody played the best role since The Pianist (very small cameo, but memorable and hilarious). Kathy Bates was very believable as a famous literary critic and friend to the struggling talented writers and artists. Alison Pill was impressive as the bright, outgoing but showing the signs of instability wife of the celebrated American writer. I hardly recognized Corey Stoll but liked him a lot as another famous American writer. Watching Marion Cotillard, I had no problems believing that the character she played, Adriana, could have been the muse and the girlfriend of not just one but three amazingly and uniquely talented world renowned painters. Rachel McAdams (Inez, Gil's not so romantic fiancée), Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy (Inez's parents on the business trip in Paris who don't seem to approve their daughter's choice), and Michael Sheen (Paul, Inez's pedantic and arrogant former boyfriend from college) were quite good as not very likable Americans. The First Lady of France, Carla Bruni appeared in a small role of a museum guide.The story itself was so lovely in using the time travel as the plot device and brought so many funny and sharp one-liners, dialogs and scenes as well as the plenty moments of recognizing the beloved literature and art figures of the past, that I sat and smiled happily during the whole film. Like I mentioned in the beginning, I expected to love the film even before I saw it and knew from the very first scene that I was in for something very special but my husband, who is much more reserved in his ratings and not often calls a film a masterpiece, used the word for Midnight in Paris and asked whether the film has won some prestigious prizes. Well, the awards season is several months away, but for me, and I am sure for all Woody Allen's fans, Midnight in Paris is a great prize from the writer/director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After an interminable opening montage of establishing tourist shots of Paris (if it had been London there would have been red phone boxes and double decker buses; not a North African mugger or traffic gridlock in sight), all to the accompaniment of Woody Allen's horn-blowing, we have Woody Allen directing a Woody Allen script in which Owen Wilson plays a writer of scripts who talks, acts and dresses like Woody Allen; after half an hour or so of by-the-numbers comic clichés about culturally insensitive Americans and pompous pseudo-intellectuals (oh the irony!) the plot stumbles into Goodnight Sweetheart territory as Woody, sorry Owen, stumbles through a time porthole into a 1920s Paris where you cannot order a coffee without Salvador Dali asking "Have you met my friends Luis Bunuel and Man Ray?"

		<fullReview>I really fail to see how this film can attract so many decent reviews. I'm no film buff but I've seen a fair few in my time and this is probably one of the worst. The scenes of Paris are more like a 1980s ministry of tourism project - if you want to see sumptuous Paris then look no further than Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amelie. The plot is absurd - it's like a school film project - hey why don't we cram in as many famous people from the past as we can and then have the main character miraculously be able to go back in time whenever he wants! Even this could be tolerated if it weren't for all the cringeworthy lines such as when the main character walks into a room to meet Gertrude Stein and she leans over and says "hey Pablo what yer paintin" or something equally painful in order to shoehorn in another famous character. Wooden acting, appalling script, truly terrible stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pablum for Narcissists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Woody Allen at his most shallow and pretentious. As in all his movies, the central character is Woody Allen himself, his anxieties, his narcissism and his affectations. Whether he plays the main character himself or, as in this case, it is played by someone else, it's still the whiny, insecure, pathetic little pseudo-intellectual that by all indications is who he really is. All other characters in his movies are either clones of the Woody character or projections of his neuroses. What's most evident here is Woody's tin ear for comedy. Jokes fall flat, and worse, ruin any semblance of a mood or serious emotion among the characters. Woody is, and probably will always be, a frightened, insecure twelve year old boy with average intelligence who is desperate to appear smarter than he is. For some people that's funny; for me, it's just embarrassing.Here we have Gil, (Owen Wilson) another Woody clone visiting Paris with his dumb-blond wife, her parents, plus a pedantic professor and his equally pretentious and absurd wife. They are the epitome of East Coast liberals: insufferably arrogant and intellectually competitive. Gil has an added affliction besides his annoying nervous tics: he's obsessed by the Paris literary/art scene of the 1920s. In fact, he worships the celebrities of that era the same way the the clueless slobs in "The King of Comedy" worship their TV idols. Gil is a groupie. He has little feeling for art or writing but needs to somehow bask in the reflected glory that knowing their names will add to his resume. Raymond Chandler once wrote in reference to the people who go to Hollywood parties in hopes of rubbing elbows with celebrities: "They are fearful of becoming the nobodies they never ceased to be." That is Gil. One night (who knows how?) he is transported back to the 1920s where he is able to actually meet some of his heroes and heroines. This could be a sort of magical moment, a romantic fantasy realized on the screen. But in order for such a thing to work the audience must be convinced of the reality of the transformation from one time to another. Unfortunately Allen wrecks the suspension of disbelief at every opportunity with the intervention of the nervous and supercilious Gil who can't seem to keep his mouth shut. The artists too, such as Ernest Hemingway, Salvador Dali, Pablo PIcasso and Man Ray are merely cartoon stereotypes, often spouting quotes from their own work, or commenting on art in that phony-baloney way people in Woody Allen movies are wont to do. These artistic celebs welcome Gil into their midst, but you know right away the real artists these stereotypes are based on wouldn't have had anything to do with such an obvious loser. I could say more. Did I mention that there seems to be some kind of weird colorization in some of the Parisian cityscapes? What's that all about? But I hope I've said enough to warn you off this pile of sentimentality and drivel. Did I mention it's not funny?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am astounded that this film is amongst the Oscar nominees for 2012. If there was a category for Best Travel Film it would win hands down as the cinematography is first class in its depiction of Paris. But the plot is so shallow as to be transparent. The characters are likewise and define the term cliché. Owen Wilsons whiney portrayal of what is clearly supposed to be Woody Allen himself is irritating in the extreme, except when he puts Michael Sheens character in his place with a critique of a Picasso painting, which I admit was the highlight of the film. I am aware of Allens politics but surely he is more intelligent than hitting us over the head with his obscenely wealthy American 'sledgehammer' of a Republican family. The film is worth the nomination for Art Direction but the other three nominations are undeserved and to think that this sorry apology of a film has been nominated for best film when Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy has been overlooked is nothing short of scandalous. If you want some good shots of Paris see the film otherwise pass it by.</fullReview>

It's obvious they're having a good laugh at the audience as they rake in the money for what is clearly a thin movie. Woody Allen has clearly exhausted his creativity and snap. A sad moment to witness for what was a great creative genius. The photography is indeed beautiful with various Paris scenes but the story plot is weak not only unbelievable but absurd. The primary actors are miscast and overplay their roles. The cameos are well done but can't save the drowning pool of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in the Garden of "Manhattan" (1979) ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It begins as a low-end travel agency commercial, with irritating jazzy music (that's out of place, in my experience). Then we see Owen Wilson as the latest Woody "stand in." And then we are exposed to the usual self-absorbed individuals (in Allen films) who think they are special. Aren't these the kinds of people you don't want to spend any time with if you can avoid doing so? If not, perhaps this movie is for you! It's almost like Woody doesn't understand that society is not exactly the same as it was (for him if nobody else) in the 60s or 70s. In the age of the mortgage crisis and the destruction of the American middle class, this movie is a proverbial rubbing of salt in the wounds of the injured ! We soon learn that a screenwriter wants to give up his career because he has visions of being a "starving artist" in Paris. Why? If you are going to present this idea at a time like now, you need to supply some back story. I'm wondering what's going on in Woody's mind. Does he enjoy spending his time with such obnoxious individuals (that is, just about everyone in this film), or is he trying to torture those who still go to see his films? A major problem is the sympathy factor, which is that if you present us with a bunch of obnoxious people, why should we care what happens to them? And why should we continue to watch the film? After the first fifteen minutes, it became like bad background music to me.But then we are transported back to the "roaring twenties." So now we have a "time machine" thing going on, somewhat reminiscent of "The Purple Rose of Cairo." What's interesting is how this undermines the film entirely, because it points to how bound to a particular cultural milieu most of us are (perhaps all of us are but not all of us can admit it). For example, how many of you can imagine Allen at an Occupy Wall Street protest (just one!), or even a Tea Party one? He's still living with childhood notions he was exposed to in the 40s and 50s, and his young adult musings and disappointments of the 60s and 70s, apparently. Overall, this movie reminded me most of the Carousel of Progress attraction at Disney World (last time I was there was in the early 1980s), and not a serious film.If you can't bring yourself to say it, I will say it for you; I am done with Allen. And I am willing to admit that when I was younger I looked down upon friends who weren't interested in his movies. The neurotic "every man" (who also doesn't seem to exist in my experience) is of no interest, other than psychologically. To some degree, I found this film depressing, like going to a gallery opening and realizing that the work of the artist being displayed demonstrates that he is clearly past his prime, and that he is searching, unsuccessfully, to try to be "new" and "fresh." Allen seems to lack cinematic empathy; everyone is seen through the eyes of the main character, who may deserve the "problems" he faces, for all we know. Ask yourself, what if Woody had lost all his money in a Madoff-like Ponzi scheme in 2008? Would he have made this film (assuming he could get funding) a year or two later? I really wonder if he can't address socio-economic issues (beyond having one of his obnoxious characters make an obnoxious remark about them) because he thinks he is far superior to the "little people" of the world.And what is the "underlying message" here? That one should live in one's own time? Does one have a choice? If you are a multi-millionaire like Allen perhaps you do! The rest of us have plenty of "reality" to deal with that is of this time. But putting that aside, Allen seems to have been trying to be "cute," allowing a person of today who is captivated by a Parisian "golden age" to meet the famous people of that age in person via a time travel conceit. This might have worked, at least to some degree, if the Wilson character had some of his illusions shattered by meeting these "greats" in person. Instead, the interactions are very soft and uninteresting. This film has the appearance of being made by someone who was able to do whatever he wanted, and was not willing to accept any criticism (and certainly had no interest in seeking any). Nice "work" if you can get it !But let me end this with a critique that is "universal." As I mentioned above, I want to know the main characters' back story when I see a film. Otherwise, for all we know, the Wilson character is basically immature and not ready for a relationship. Allen doesn't seem to know how to do back story, from what I've seen, but he certainly must understand the concept. If you want people to think of you as a "professional," if not a "great," then you should work on your weaknesses, but he has not, despite the huge number of films he has made. Because of this, he basically creates films that are variations on a theme, and all with the same glaring flaws. I wonder if he thinks he is doing "something important" or if he is "just going through the motions" to make money. The flaws are not an issue in a fast-paced, silly/absurd comedy like "Love and Death," nor in "Annie Hall," which contained plenty of good comedy (of different kinds), and had a compelling main character who was rather simple, though genuine, namely Annie (whose family we got to see), and therefore requires less of a back story. She was the best "every man" in any Allen film, though he keeps wanting his audiences to view him that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Midnight in Paris" was a massive disappointment.The film is full of beautiful shots of Paris and perhaps this may distract viewers from the fact that this movie is void of any real meaning whatsoever.The 'story' is about a writer Gil (Owen Wilson) who wants to stay in Paris and write. His fiancé (Rachel McAdams) and her family are wealthy superficial socialites. Every night, Gil 'time travels' back to Paris 1920s where he meets all his artistic and literary idols. This is little more than an exercising in name-dropping and talent-wasting. He meets a non-superficial woman (Marion Cotillard).I can't spoil the storyline because nothing happens. In what I suppose could be called the 'climax', the character Gil himself experiences what he describes as a "minor epiphany". It barely even qualifies minor. It's meaningless.The 'characters' are woefully under-developed, completely two-dimensional.Woody himself as described his film-making style as "lazy" and I have to say this is Woody at his laziest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film so mixed it requires a detailed review to "summarise"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen has done an excellent job in Midnight in Paris (MIP).There are a lot of special features about this movie. The dialogue (script), the acting, the score, the cinematography.Midnight in Paris provides a lot entertainment without essentially "going anywhere." It isn't an extraordinary story. It doesn't provide some deep meaningful message. It's merely a bunch of interesting dialogue mixed with outstanding acting put together to provide good entertainment.The kind of entertainment I speak of in MIP isn't the ordinary type of "entertainment." It's a rare kind of entertainment and can only be found in certain movies. Pulp Fiction is the other prime example that springs to mind. Although very different in genre and script, there was one broad striking similarity I noticed between the two movies. They both have no purpose, no story (or at least, the "story" is used as a scapegoat to present the desired script in the movie), there basically isn't any real "reason" to see the movie. It's just about nothing. But what both movies succeed to do is just make you watch the movie, immerse yourself in it, provide you with a different kind of "comedy." It isn't comedy that makes you laugh out loud (for the most part) and it isn't failed comedy. It's the kind of comedy where you simply get subtle enjoyment from, you let out an occasional smirk or smile, but the smirk isn't necessarily in relation to the a specific comment in the movie, rather it's a smirk signifying your quiet enjoyment towards the film generally. You can sit there continuously for hours and days following repeated viewings of the film and not get bored simply because its so enjoying to watch. That's the kind of entrainment MIP offers and for the very same reason, it will attract negative attention from certain viewers, but not from me.Next, the cinematography. Oh my gosh! I could have given this movie a 10 without the rest of the movie being so good. I, having visited Paris, for unfortunately not too long a period, fell in love with the city. It is the most romantic and beautiful city I have ever seen. It really is the city of love and all expectations were not only as good, but better. I hold this thought even though some friends I know of have had, well, not as great an experience as myself.Woody manages to capture the beautiful presence of Paris like no other director. I felt like I was back in Paris and it sometimes managed to put a chill down my spine because of the amount of beauty I was both witnessing and remembering. I really can't say anymore about the cinematography except that it is the best, it is flawless, it is exceptional and if you have ever been to Paris and loved it, you'll definitely love this movie.Moving onto the acting, I'll settle this briefly. Although MIP has a lot of very solid small roles (Rachel McAdams was very average, but I think that's how her character was intended to be), Owen Wilson is the complete stand out. Although I can't quote statistics, I think this may be the first movie Owen Wilson has been in which has scored and 8+ on IMDb. To put this bluntly, I'm not an Owen Wilson fan. I generally don't like his comedy. But in MIP I have never met any other actor who fits the lead role so perfectly. To put it metaphorically, Owen fits into MIP like a glove. I have never seen such an flawless representation of Woody Allen himself. Owen is Woody. And therein lies the perfection of his acting. He barely needs to act, because I know all he's doing is being himself and dishing out lines given to him, but it fits so perfect with a Woody image. All in all, MIP is Woody Allen movie, with a Woody Allen touch, a Woody Allen script, a Woody Allen cinematography and a Woody Allen leading actor.Unfortunately, I can't express a very specific audience to which I would recommend this movie to. If you have been to Paris and loved it, chances are you will love it. It captures the beauty, the fashion, the culture and personality of Paris like it really is Paris. However, like I stated before, the dialogue in this movie and the "story" and "purpose" is something which will attract mixed feelings. I, for one, absolutely loved it. All I can say is that, if you agree with my comments above or if they touch an emotional nerve, then the chances of this movie doing the same to you is very high.It is nothing too special. It doesn't provide a great message. It doesn't have a extraordinary story. But it provides for a rare kind of entertainment, coupled with exceptional cinematography and for these reasons, I cannot give any less than a 10.</fullReview>

Obviously a problem for Owen as he in turn tries very hard to be the 21st Century's answer to Jimmy Stewart. The movie as a whole was very predictable with lots of silliness including time traveling back to the 20s and late 1800s and being able to pay for dinner/drinks, I would love to see the face of a 1920s waiter when you offered to pay him in Euros! The saving grace was the shots of Paris and Versailles which I enjoyed. However I think time for Woody to hang up his directing boots</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallow, one-dimensional and superficial...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this movie I had not seen its trailer nor had any idea about plot, actors or anything else. The only thing I knew was that this was a Woody Allen movie and everybody liked it. I do like some of the Allen's so I let my wife drag me into the movie theater (in defiance of my general observation that what everyone likes is usually not good). The movie starts with a montage of views of Paris under a nice music. All is nice and shiny. However Allen does not forget to make some money from slipping several brands into our subconscious. This trick was repeated while showing us "Chopard" (if I remember correctly) as a brand preferred by bride-to-be for her engagement ring in an out-of-context and inconsequential scene. I feel cheated when I pay for a movie and have to watch commercials instead. Sinicism of this is aggravated when you consider how left-wing a director of this movie purports himself to be. But you can soothe yourself with the fact that everybody needs to make money, and so does old Uncle Woody, and wait for the movie to really start, at least that's what I did. But first introduction to characters was terrible. All of them so one dimensional, so plain, so caricature, so shallow! Later in the movie Hemingway says that a book cannot be bad if it is about a real story, but somehow Allen missed this point. (Alongside the movie he makes a lot of points which his movie fails to take into consideration). There are no such one-dimensional people in the real world! The living would be very easy, and there would be no need to psychology at all. All characters are instantaneously divided into good and bad. I only kept wondering how Gil and Inez could ever get together, let alone be ready to get married? When talking about his fiancé Gil could only remember that their common thing is that they both like Indian puri. How unrealistic is this situation? So, bored with his current affairs, Gil starts wondering in midnight Paris. At this point I was praying for Woody Allen to show some creativity and not turn this into a standard plot of a couple traveling to a new location where one of them meets a new love of his life and understands how wrong he was. There are at least million of movies shot with that plot. May be Allen could have done this movie without a second girl? I would appreciate such a twist. But I was not surprised, everything was as trivial as it can get. Gil travels to the past to meet caricatures of great people. A total mockery of these great men, and without evident reason. I will not stop on how superficial these characters are, I think shallowness is a theme of this movie. The only bright side is Marian Cotillard, Gil's new love. She is very pretty and her acting is very good. Eventually, after his time travels Gil understands that it is better to live in the present reality, firmly standing on the ground, rather than to fly in the clouds longing for "good old times". So he returns to present time, and guess what he does? ? He stays in Paris. Like if Paris being a magical city, somewhat different than others is not a same type of myth, as 1920's being better than 2000's?</fullReview>

Inception confused me, it wasn't a very good movie, but it got a very good rating. But oh well. This on the other hand...I do not understand how a movie so devoid of any subtlety can be rated so highly. Each plot point was drawn out so crassly, so boringly, so artificially it was unbearable. No character was likable, as no character had even a semblance of depth. It was a parody of a parody, and not a good one at that. There was but one tiny laugh in the entire film.This movie was equivalent to a school project. To give it 7.8 out of 10 is to deceive the public of what is on offer. If you want a mindless rom com, then there are 101 other movies you can choose where the characters actually are human.This is the death knoll of the IMDb. To deceive such as this is beyond the pale. I will never trust these ratings again.So long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris (2011)Total wish fulfillment. Who wouldn't want to drift back now and then and visit some cultural heroes in their own time--you know, Ernest Hemingway, Cole Porter, Picasso? Well, that's all this movie does. It does it brilliantly, and in the "flashbacks" which are really more like time travel scenes, the set design, music, and invented dialog of these icons is terrific. Like many people, I think Paris in the 1920s was the greatest cultural hot spot since Florence in the Renaissance. But that's all this movie really does, and if it's enough, you're going to love it. The plot laid over this, including a strained and irritating cast of early 21st Century ungrateful Ugly Americans, is painful. Not only does it seem false (like these are just "types" without real depth), but it's crudely filmed (lighting and camera-work) and actually badly acted, overall. You might think this was all on purpose, to contrast in every way then and now. Certainly it's the same crew, same writer (Woody Allen), and same director (Woody Allen) in both parts of the movie.And same lead actor, Owen Wilson, who is perfect in both roles (he is the one consistent presence). He's a dreamy writer who likes Paris in the rain. And he wishes he could just go back to those glory days when the arts were spilling out of the cafes at night on the Left Bank. So, by magic, he does, and so do we. If everything is a cliché, it almost has to be--Gertrude Stein played wonderfully by Kathy Bates, Zelda Fitzgerald by Alison Pill. There are some twenty famous people who show up (some briefly, like Man Ray, who is badly portrayed, and Josephine Baker, who doesn't get a speaking part, naturally). But they are all backdrop, in a way, to the idea, the time travel foremost but also the bigger idea that we sometimes think we'd be happier in another time.And the movie ends on the sweet note that in fact we just need to look around at what we have in our time and appreciate it.As a movie beyond just entertainment, it's easy to get frustrated. One good friend of mine, a true movie buff and not a Woody Allen fan, loved it. But he's a nostalgia freak. In the theater, two young women got up and left after half an hour, even while it was getting interesting. In my friend's case, he was taken in (as I was) by all the famous figures and what they might have been like (and what they might say). The two young women, I'm guessing, didn't know the references. They didn't know who Scott and Zelda, Cole, and maybe even Ernest were. Or didn't care. Which is an important truth in this kind of movie filled with references. Like a lot of post-modern art, it's only good for insiders. Unlike Allen's "Zelig" (a far more inventive and zany and complicated film, if imperfect, too), the references here are mostly for an older cultured crowd. There are hints of his "The Purple Rose in Cairo" as well, a fantasy to another world, a seemingly (or actually) better one, but that's a brilliant movie filled with pathos. "Midnight in Paris" is an extended trick, a one-liner, and as fun as it is, keep at least some of your expectations slim.</fullReview>

Actors and critics alike fall over backwards to praise his work yet i find it all very bland.Midnight in Paris is an odd film about a writer who , while on vacation in Paris with his wife to be, finds a way to go back in time to meet famous artists , writers and musicians and he soon realises that this world is far better than the one he currently lives in.As is any Woody Allen movie , Midnight in Paris is very dialogue orientated , and i have no problem with that but what i don't like is the pretentiousness of it. Allen presumes the audience is aware of the characters on show and their history and that everyone is in love with their work. It's not the case with me. Owen Wilson is irritating ( as usual) as is the totally unbelievable Rachel McAdams. You never get the feeling that these are a real couple.

The gorgeous opening cinematic montage of Parisian scenes, accompanied by what I have to believe is Woody himself on clarinet in the musical accompaniment, leads us to believe we are in for a Gallic "Manhattan." But this movie is several steps down from Woody's brilliant love letter to New York. That movie had a credible and engaging - if morally questionable - plot, about a middle age man dating a high school girl (little did we know at the time?). But the story here, aside from its fantastic elements, is thin and without dramatic direction. Once the initial time travel back to the Paris of the 20's happens, there is very little else of consequence. And the film has to be completely meaningless to anyone without a solid historical knowledge of the intellectual scene in Paris in the Roaring 20's. As a matter of fact it doesn't take long before the film becomes a pretentious exercise in name-dropping that actually becomes annoying. Gee let's see if we can name the next writer/artist/playwright/musician that's going to walk in the door. And Allen's political beliefs, which, if they were touched on at all in previous movies, were treated with subtle whimsy, are here wielded like a two-by-four. And I find Owen Wilson completely unsuited for the role of Allen's alter ego. He just doesn't have the feel for the Allen persona, and I'm sorry, but he should get that broken nose fixed as all it does is distract. I was vastly disappointed, and am at a loss to explain the rave reviews this movie has received.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Woody Allen's ode to the City of Love, and its most celebrated denizens of the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris is a subtle romantic drama with a comical touch that has a little bit of almost everything: be it magic-realism, romance, phantasm, voyeur, surrealism or even noir. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to proclaim that everything that Woody Allen learned and gained during his long stint in cinema culminated in form of Midnight in Paris ? An ode to the City of Love, and its most celebrated denizens of the past. Driven by the very impetus that gives cinema its resonant charm, Woody Allen the auteur has seen his art go from strength to strength, taking new shapes and forms, being completely oblivious of the existence of his larger than life alter ego, Woody Allen the showman, whose stimulating works have been a treat for us all for last so many decades, and who himself has been a force to reckon with, right throughout his long and illustrious career that still seems to be in its prime.I have grown up watching works of legendary Dev Anand, whose iconic movie career spanned well over six decades. Being an Indian, I guess it comes naturally to one! The first that I heard of Woody Allen was when someone eloquently referred to Dev Sahab as the Indian Woody Allen. It indeed seemed revolting! A showman, whom not only you but also your grandparents have grown up watching being compared to some run-of-the- mill movie maker form the Occident. But, it did succeed in getting me hooked. Today, I find the comparison to be much more apt. Dev Sahab was oblivious to the changing trends in the India Cinema, and remained royal to his idiosyncratic style. The same can be said about Mr. Allen, who became the champion of a resurgent parallel stream in American Cinema? inspired by the avant garde works of European auteurs like Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman?while others kept busy figuring out their new roles in rapidly changing American movie circles. Marion Cotillard and Owen Wilson in Midnight in Paris Vintage Woody Allen, watching Midnight in Paris is like savoring the great city of Paris from the eyes of Mr. Allen himself. Midnight in Paris made an emphatic debut at the 2011 Cannes Festival, and succeeded in leaving a lasting impact on most of those present at the screening. During a press conference at Cannes, Woody Allen had said that he wanted to show the city of Paris emotionally, and wanted it to be the way he himself sees it, and he indeed succeeds in fulfilling his dream by bringing the city to life, thanks to his perspicacious eye.Midnight in Paris presents a chapter in the life of a successful but disillusioned Hollywood screenwriter, Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), who yearns to break the shackles of monotony by writing a fiction novel, but is perplexed by his slender prospects as a writer beyond the glamour and razzmatazz of the sequestered world of Hollywood, while he is out on a vacation to the breeding ground of creativity and talent, Paris, and accompanying him are his ravishing fiancée, Inez (Rachel McAdams), and his affluent future in-laws. The perfunctory relationship that Gil shares with his fiancée seems to be a result of Inez' perpetually disinterested outlook towards Gil's ambition of graduating into a full- fledged writer by making a foray into fiction writing. The beauty of Midnight in Paris is that it poses several questions, and while many of them may be answered in the due course of the movie, the true onus truly lies with the viewer to fathom the reality based on his own understanding. One major question that would continuously perplex the viewer is whether it is the yearning for creativity or the want for true love or the search for something even more profound that's haunting Gil? Midnight in Paris has loads to offer even to the average viewer, especially to ones who are willing to delve deep into realm of the unknown to savor the real delight that awaits them. The dreamlike sequences that depict Gil interacting with the likes of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, and Pablo Picasso are an absolute treat to watch. While I greatly admire Hemingway and Fitzgerald for their indelible contribution to English Literature, I just absolutely idolize Luis Bunuel not only as a Surrealist, but also as a movie maker par excellence. Who can dare to overlook Bunuel's decorated oeuvre right from his maiden venture, An Andalusian Dog (1929), which he collaborated with another pioneer Surrealist, Salvador Dali to his surrealistic magnum opuses, The Exterminating Angel (1962), to which Mr. Allen pays a tribute in the movie, and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), which won the Best Foreign Picture Oscar for the year?Woody Allen's inspired direction and inciteful screenplay are well complemented by a very fine ensemble of support cast that includes the likes of Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody. The music and cinematography are awe-inspiring to say the least. Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams perfectly fit in their respective caricatures, and the charming presence of Marion Cotillard adds a whole new spark to the movie. Midnight in Paris has already managed to bag a handful of accolades, and the Oscar nomination is indeed an icing on the cake. Midnight in Paris crosses genres, and presents cinema at its most colorful, while also serving to be a delightful cinematic experience that has something for almost everyone. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Original &amp; Visionary Screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen seems to be in his element after a long long while...a well deserved pause and I must say what an intellectual pause eh! A fabulous screenplay,the most original I have encountered till to date. Shooting Paris la' Manhattan was anticipated but execution is unpretentious...a difficult task in this age of high end computer graphics tantalizingly at your beck and call. Casting of '1920s Greats' was to the "T". 'Rhinoceros' Dali is the manifestation of wicked wicked Allen and you can imagine the understated 'throat clearing' pause from Woody whilst writing and filming 'Rhinoceros' scenes..Am a great fan of Woody and my bias may be glaring but I am proud of it. More power to him and his ilk. Am in nervous anticipation as to when he writes a script based on Indian sensibilities?!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Return to form for Woody? I enjoyed it anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the reviews of "Midnight in Paris" describe it as return to form for Woody Allen. We've all heard that many times before but I was still persuaded to see it as I hadn't seen one of his movies in years.I did enjoy the movie though it hardly a classic. It begins with a title sequence featuring views of Paris, often in the rain, that reminded me of the beginning of "Manhattan".The movie is about an American screenwriter, played by Owen Wilson, who is in Paris with his fiancée, played by Rachel McAdams. He is trying to write a novel, feeling he is wasting his time making easy money from writing movie scripts. He is a sentimental soul. He loves Paris but imagines it would have been ideal to live there in the 1920's with the likes of Picasso and Hemingway. His fiancée is only there for the pre-wedding shopping with her mother and thinks he should be delighted to have such a lucrative career.His wish comes true when, as he walks back to the hotel alone one night, he is magically transported back to 1920's Paris and finds himself socialising with his artistic heroes. He meets and falls for a French model played by Marion Cotillard and starts to return every night to see her and get advice on his novel from the likes of Gertrude Stein. Allen populates the movie with as many famous artists of the period as possible ? Dali, Bunuel, Man Ray.He is convinced that he doesn't want to return to his old life, only to find that his new love hates the 1920's and imagines that life must have been so much better in Paris during "La Belle Epoque" when Gaugin and Lautrec were around.This leads to a conclusion where the moral is pretty clear ? Even if times were better in times past (and maybe they weren't) you still have to make the most of the times you are living in.Owen Wilson is well cast as the confused writer. The beatnik persona he has in most of movies his perfect here. McAdams is wasted a bit in the one-dimensional character of his rather unpleasant fiancée. Cotillard is lovely and superb as the world-weary model. As usual with Allen's movies there are plenty of cameos. Adrien Brody's over the top Dali is especially memorable.I'm sure I missed most of the literary and artistic references in the movie but this didn't stop me from enjoying this well written and beautifully filmed movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Woody Allen is the greatest American screenwriter and director of this age - That if you can call him a director? he admittedly does nothing but let the actors free to do their work, which is probably his greatest quality.He's been honing his skills for a long time now and at this point in his life has made countless works of art. He was close to perfection with Vicky Christina Barcelona, but perhaps that movie was way too passionate. The Purple Rose of Cairo was a great fantasy, but maybe too sugar coated. I think this time he got the recipe right. The movie is simple, but perfect.From the opening images you get the feeling he is up to some greatness. Mr. Allen presents us with a very unique and intimate portrait of Paris? he shows us the roofs, the cafés, the people walking on the rain. All from very singular perspectives. A Paris I never seen on the postcards? Images of the City of Lights that makes you feel you are there.The movie goes on unpretentious as Owen Wilson's character and adorable as Marion Cotillard's Adriana. A delicate masterpiece that I enjoyed for every second and as some great actors played some of my favorite artists in history, I slowly tasted every single little piece of it like a delicacy, hoping it would never end. This one deserves 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magic of Midnight in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's 'Midnight in Paris' Kay Webb Woody Allen has created a sense of romance and magic through the simple act of strolling along the softly lit streets of Paris at midnight. Owen Wilson's voice sounds over the opening credits and jazz music, reflecting on the idea of living in Paris in the 1920's. His character Gil believes that there would be nothing better to do than to walk in the rain, absorbing in the vibrant culture of the time period. His fiancée Inez has other ideas; most of them have to do with staying in the states.The two begin their stay in the city of lights captives in the presence of the fiancée's old college professor who is an expert on everything he sees. Gil decides to split from the group after an evening of wine tasting to walk the streets at night. He quickly gets lost and can't find his way back when an antique car pulls up to him full of partiers, drinking and reveling in the night. They invite him to join their party which he readily accepts but comes to realize, to his amazement, that they aren't from this time period. In his company are F. Scott Fitzgerald, his wife Zelda, Cole Porter, and Earnest Hemingway. He can hardly believe his luck. He takes a chance and asks Hemingway if he would proof-read his novel. The man prattles on about truth and courage, and then suggests that he should have Gertrude Stein take a look at it. Gil leaves excited at this unreal experience and the chance for someone to read his book. After few steps however, he realized that he never confirmed where to meet Mr. Hemingway and turns on his heels to go back to the bar. When he returns, it is now a laundry mat. Excited but confused he returns to his hotel room and his girlfriend who is becoming quite annoyed at him. Gil spends his days with her and her cynical mother, searching for Cole Potter records among the antique shops in Paris. He returns every night at the same time to continue his adventure and his renewed interest in his novel, welcoming the chance to experience the people and the artistic energy in this exciting time in history. One of the more colorful characters he meets is Salvador Dali, who insists on painting him with a rhinoceros. Unknown to him though, the more time he spends with his book and his midnight escapades the more his fiancé spends with her old college professor. It is during this time in the past that he meets and falls in love with a beautiful French woman named Adriana who is currently dating Picasso. The two walk the streets talking about art and literature when she mentions that she would love to go back in time to the 1890's, the time of can-can dancers and Toulouse Lautrec. Instantly, a horse drawn carriage appears and two well dressed people in top hats and formal dress urge them to join them. The two travel back in time again and arrive at Montmartre in its hey-day. The girl meets a few of her heroes from the past, like Gauguin and Degas. Enraptured with the time period she decides to stay. Knowing that his real time is in the future, Gil reluctantly leaves her there. He arrives back in his time period to discover that his fiancé has indeed been cheating on him. When confronted though she merely throws her hands up, unconcerned with her discretion. The message is clear to him now and he decides it is time for him to leave. His experience in the past has taught him to appreciate the now. This is his golden age and he needs to seize it. He walks out of the hotel and onto the darkened streets of Paris. He crossed a bridge and meets a nice Parisian girl that sold him the Cole Potter record. The two connect and they walk off as it starts to rain</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight In Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight In Paris follows a young writer in a visit to Paris with his fiancée where he travels all nights ninety years back in time to get advise and friendship from the literary geniuses of the time. Yes, it's another film from Woody Allen, but this time is not as routinary as You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger or as cheeky as Vicky Cristina Barcelona. This shows Woody Allen at the standard he should be at every year. Original, funny, engaging and with some light meaningful message that we all relate to; what else can you ask from a film?The colors and cinematography of the film are more of the same of the post-Barcelona Allen, all beige and brownish, but he achieves a beauty in his portrayal of Paris that has not come from him since he first visited London with Match Point in 2005. It's also the most original screenplay he has written since, and the plot works and looks like one of his short stories, as a crazy, illogic and absurd showcase of gags and jokes.The performances are all fine, nothing stellar though, except for Adrien Brody's magnificent role as Salvador Dalí. Owen Wilson does a very good job but he tries too much to be and act like Woody Allen. The impersonations are all great -Hemingway,Picasso, Bu?uel, Fitzgerald- they all look exactly the same than in real life.This is a film that will surely not disappoint any moviegoer or Allen fan. It's true that it doesn't come close to other of his better films, but it is a step forward from Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Cassandra's Dream, You Will Meet... and even Scoop and Whatever Works. Still, if you want to enjoy some true Woody Allen, go and see Annie Hall, Hannah And Her Sisters, Crimes And Misdemeanors, etc. This is not anything brilliant, but it is very entertaining, amusing and original; and it its a great time spent at the movies.Midnight In Paris is a surreal and touristic romantic comedy with clever comical gags, a creative story and a beautiful portrayal of the City of Lights.Rating: 3.5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Woody Allen masterpiece! A refreshing and endearing story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As embarrassed as I am to say this, this is the first Woody Allen movie I have ever viewed. I have heard numerous amounts of good things about his work and his directing, and his originality. I never really had an interest in seeing this movie when it came to theaters, despite all of the positive comments about the movie, but when it was nominated for Best Picture I immediately added it to my Netflix list. I wasn't sure what to expect, but, I knew it was Woody Allen so I was pretty excited to view this movie, even though I had no idea what the movie was about. Boy, I was pleasantly surprised.First of all, the movie is about Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) on a trip to Paris before their wedding. Despite Inez's rude comments that made me just wanna scream at her, Gil tries to be the best he can be to her, and that's frustrating. So one night, he goes wandering through the streets of Paris, and ends up getting lost. He's sitting on a flight of stairs, in the middle of nowhere, and when the clock strikes midnight, a car comes and takes him on a little adventure that sparks the plot of the whole movie. Along with Wilson and McAdams, there are some special appearances from Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, etc. etc. This makes the movie even more enjoyable.The big reason why I love this movie is the originality to it. That's always a huge bonus to me when I watch a movie, is it original? I don't want some love story that's been done twenty times to a point that it's just a cliché in Hollywood. This movie is definitely original, and right from the get-go I was very satisfied in the movie before I was even thirty minutes in. A lot of the movies nowadays, and I'm sure you've heard people say this over and over, lack originality. There are a lot of retreads, sequels, and remakes. This movie, in no way, shape, or form, represents another movie of any kind. And I loved that fact, it just made me enjoy this film ten times more. All in all, I think this movie well-deserves the Best Original Screenplay Oscar.Woody Allen has crafted a beautiful movie packed with amazing scenes played off very well by the actors. The writing and directing is just completely amazing. The whole movie is amazing, right from the beginning, with the montage of Paris, to the very surprising, but not unsatisfying, ending. I highly recommend this movie to anybody he enjoys a good time in front of your TV, and who appreciates a good movie when they see one.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm having an insight now... it's a minor one, but..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight In Paris can be accused of being slightly pretentious, lazy and indulgent, but then even Woody Allen's best films are slightly pretentious, lazy and indulgent. There's no real knock out factor in this one, it's just a pretty good Allen film from his modern period. However, what really holds the whole thing together is Owen Wilson playing Woody Allen (here called "Gil Pender") whose considerable charm propels what is quite a sluggish film on occasion. Sure, the entire point of this movie is not to be about pace or dynamism, but there's points where Allen's overearnest love affair with Paris becomes traveloguesque. Added to this is the perpetual self-flagellation over American identity, something else Wilson is able to achieve well.Yet Allen seems, if not at his peak, then somewhat reinvigorated for the new decade. You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger (6), while effectively the "same old, same old", was watchable, and Midnight In Paris sees him take back up his recent predilection for filming outside New York. Incidentally, an interesting note on Allen's working methods was revealed when Michael Sheen, playing Paul, was interviewed on a UK chat show: Allen likes to pass actors only the parts of the script that relate to their characters, so Sheen had no idea his character was having an affair with that of Rachel McAdams until he saw the finished picture.Midnight In Paris, is, without adjusting for inflation, the biggest box office success of Woody Allen's career. It's a nice movie, a fine movie, but I doubt many would put it anywhere near his ten or twelve greatest works. It just goes to show that tastes, star names, marketing and even just pure luck can factor in to what makes a "hit". After all, even adjusted to modern figures, Husbands and Wives still didn't make as much as Small Time Crooks...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris is about an engaged couple named Gil and Inez who go to Paris, France because her father is setting up a business deal there. Gil and Inez, we soon learn are very different people. He is a struggling author who loves the sights and sounds of Paris and finds it all very romantic and beautiful. His idea of a great time there would be to walk down the streets in the rain and capture the romance and beauty of the moment. Inez is more of a materialistic person who would much rather get a ride than walk in the rain and doesn't much care for Gil's opinions about art, or the different surroundings in Paris. One night while walking alone in the city, Gil is invited into an old vehicle and because he is drunk he accepts, and is then taken back to Paris in the 1920's where he gets to meet some of his favourite authors, artists and other very influential people in the field of art in the 1920's. He gets to be friends with them and for the evening gets to be with them in the 20's, but when he wakes up, he is back in 2010 with Inez. Gil goes back to the same spot every night and is taken back to his artist friends and soon meets a French woman who he starts to fall in love with, but how will he be able to stay in the 1920's permanently and what will he do about Inez? I absolutely loved Midnight in Paris. I have never actually been to Paris, or any parts in France, but have seen a lot of French films and pieces of art to know that it is a classy and beautiful city and this film captures that beauty and magic. It is a gorgeous looking film with it's cinematography as well as the sets and costumes. The film has tons of great one liners and made me smile frequently throughout the film. The whole cast is great and all do an excellent job here. The idea behind the movie is really intriguing and it makes for some very entertaining viewing and it sure made me feel good after I saw it. This is a film that is so light and funny and absolutely charming that I found it hard not to love every minute about it. The dialogue is great, the story is funny, romantic, fascinating and entertaining and it is definitely beautiful to look at as well. This film captures a lot of what is classic and sentimental from classic films by giving us a very original idea and humour and giving it class, innocence and beauty. I think fans of classic films will love this movie as well as anyone who enjoys good movies and comedies that are smart and do not rely on raunch, or bad language. Midnight in Paris really brightened up my evening and a certain joy came out of watching this film. I highly recommend it and I hope it is a hit at next year's Oscars because I think it is one of this year's best films and a true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For any senior creative person trying to keep dry eyes during Midnight in Paris is almost an impossibility. It brings back faint memories and romantic desires wished for but often unfulfilled.Woody Allen takes the viewer on his own eye view of a city he long has loved more as a fantasy than a reality. He does this through atmospheric lighting and evocative music that creates tourists out of cinema goers.Owen Wilson, in the of his best performances, takes on Allen's role and he is given a gift of experiencing what he had missed by being a bit too young for the Lost Generation of the 1920s.When Wilson and Marion Cotillard stroll through a misty Parisian street to some richly romantic French music, it was like the joy of all man's desiring...a truly beautiful moment in cinema.</fullReview>

This namedropping of 'famous' writers (who i never knew until this movie) becomes really irritating after a while. Also the pseudo-intellectual conversations about art are painful to watch.The concept of the movie is not bad, the acting is also not bad.

		<shortDescription>The mentality of the city that never sleeps meets the beauty of city of lights.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's first screenplay What's New Pussycat was produced in 1965 and I'm happy to say after forty six years and forty something films later...he's still "gettin it done". Midnight in Paris is the most recent Allen opus and like previous works Match Point, Scoop and Vicky Cristina Barcelona he utilizes a European back drop with the same visual charm he used on Manhattan for the first three quarters of his career. Ironically, the city of lights seems a natural fit for Allen's love of the artistic side of any large metropolis.The film stars Owen Wilson in a role that Allen himself could have played thirty years ago (a trend in many of Allen's newest works). As a Hollywood screenwriter longing for the art and romance of a bygone time, Wilson surprisingly inhabits the nebbish qualities of a typical Allen leading man. Rachel McAdams is his frustrated fiancé' and Oscar winner Marion Cotillard plays his "muse" or as Allen aficionados may call it?his Parisian "Annie Hall".The premise and characters are obviously similar to many Allen films, which of course is not a bad thing (if it's not broke, Woody doesn't fix it). However where it excels is its combination of a classic Allen theme with an exquisite period piece. In addition to the beautiful costumes, sets and production value the really fun aspect of the film is guessing just who may show up in 1920's Paris. Whether it's Kathy Bates' Gertrude Stein, Adrian Brody's Salvador Dali (and if you're keeping count that's two more Oscar winners) or Corey Stoll's Ernest Hemingway, the parade of colorful and historic people inhabiting the social scene of France is a literal who's who of artists, writers and dancers. Needless to say there is also a fair amount of verbal dry wit and humorous dialogue to balance out the beautiful setting and story.What this film demonstrates more than anything is Allen's durability in still putting out good films after over four decades as a filmmaker?a feat not easily accomplished, especially for comedies. He averages a film a year and even his contemporaries Mel Brooks and Mike Nichols, comic geniuses in their own right, have not had as much consistent success. Keep them coming Woody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen's passion project for a golden city.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen crafts a delightful little love letter to Paris. The film certainly isn't without flaw, but for the most part it really is this nice piece of movie magic. It's a look back into a golden era combined with a nice message about being able to appreciate what you've got instead of constantly living in the past. Allen again puts together a wonderfully talented cast to delight his audience, although some of the characters here are written much better than others. It seemed like he put all of his attention into crafting the time that Gil (Owen Wilson as the Woody stand-in) travels back to at midnight, and just got sloppy when it came to writing the present day. The characters that Gil has surrounded himself with when we first meet him are just absurdly banal and shallow.Granted, I'm sure people like that do exist in real life, but there's just no way I could buy that someone as decent and good-hearted as Gil would put himself into a situation like that. Why on Earth would he be engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams in a thankless role), the most vain and bothersome bitch in the world? It started off as a minor complaint, but the further the film went on the more it started to creep into scenes where Inez wasn't even around and continue to bother me. It all works itself out in the end, but it was just frustrating how we were supposed to believe he'd put himself in that engagement in the first place. It was lazy writing on Allen's part; instead of creating human beings he just created these blank shells to influence the main character.Fortunately, this is where my complaints on the film pretty much end. The second Gil goes back to 1920s Paris at the stroke of midnight, things are taken to a world of pure Woody Allen magic. The concept for the film is incredibly unique, I'm surprised no one had thought of it before, and feels very Woody right from the start. You take this ride back into the past and it feels so genuine. A concept like this could have been executed so poorly (time travel often is) but Allen doesn't spend too much time on the more scientific side of things and instead has Gil almost immediately embrace this experience; and why wouldn't he, he's getting the chance to live his largest fantasy. These characters are so wonderfully brought to life by this supporting cast here in the past.Every single one of them feels like you always knew they would be. You don't doubt for a second that these are the real people because these actors bring them to life so naturally. Alison Pill is a scene-stealing revelation as Zelda Fitzgerald, wild and out of control with her emotions. Tom Hiddleston is delightfully understated as her troubled hubby, F. Scott. Corey Stoll knocks it out of the park as the wild and blood-thirsty Ernest Hemingway. Adrien Brody absolutely steals his brief scene as Salvador Dali by creating one of the most hilarious moments of the year.The real star though, and the star of the film, is Marion Cotillard as a character who moves her way through these famous men's lives. Her Adriana is Gil's soulmate seemingly, a gorgeous and intelligent muse who herself feels like she is living in the wrong time and longs for a golden age. Adriana is supposed to be this kind of woman who just casts her spell and draws men in at every turn, and Cotillard makes you buy it immediately. The second we meet her you fall into her spell, she is so enchanting and wonderful it's impossible to resist. Watching Cotillard here, I felt like people must have felt in the '50s when watching Audrey Hepburn really come onto the scene. She is just so beautiful and ethereal here, making you feel exactly how it feels to fall head over heels in love. I think this is one of her best performances so far in her career.Owen Wilson pretty much does his usual Owen Wilson thing, just with a far superior script than he usually has, but the real treat of the film is this supporting cast back in time. In these trips to a golden age, Allen creates so many moments of genuine movie magic. They just take your heart in it's hand and make you feel alive and you really appreciate that life you have. My complaints with the supporting characters in the modern day were a big deal to me when I was watching the film, but since it ended all I've thought about are these moments that swept my heart away. That complaint feels pretty minor when the final product just makes me feel so good. Ultimately, the message about not living in the past is poured on way too thick, but it's a message that definitely made me think about my life when I came out of it. And boy, that ending is guaranteed to be the most purely blissful of the year. Really leaves you with a huge smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Glows.... Literally</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All men fear death. It's a natural fear that consumes us all," says a character in "Midnight in Paris"? "However, when you make love with a truly great woman, one that deserves the utmost respect in this world and one that makes you feel truly powerful, that fear of death completely disappears." Paris is her name. She has seduced writers for centuries, and in "Midnight in Paris" writer/director Woody Allen makes love to her with his camera, in the most poetic of ways.&nbsp; Or perhaps he's referring to art, to achieving such intimacy with your craft and such artistic climax that you become immortal, like Hemingway, Matisse, Fitzgerald, Picasso, Dali, or Allen himself.Gil Pender, the protagonist in Allen's new film, has never experienced that kind of artistic height. Played quite convincingly by Owen Wilson (in a surprising and refreshing role that Allen had to re-write for him), Gil is an aspiring novelist who is visiting Paris with his girlfriend (Rachel McAdams) and her parents. But while they prefer to shop and visit museums, Gil chooses to wonder about. "No work of art can compare to a city," he says.Pender is actually mesmerized by the City of Lights and fantasizes about what he believes was Paris' Golden Age, the 1920s with the Lost Generation of American writers walking its streets, writing in sidewalk cafés, and frequenting smoky bars and flamboyant parties. One evening at midnight, trying to find his way back to the hotel, something magical happens to Gil. Really! But no reviewer should give that magic away.Getting lost in the city seems to be a symbol for how lost he really is, as a person and as a writer, and although he's somewhat insecure and anxious (he even carries a bottle of Valium with him), he's actually a likable guy and soon meets a few bohemian friends (played by Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, among others) who give him much-needed advice about life and the creative process. &nbsp; From the beginning, "Midnight in Paris" grabs you with its witty and sophisticated dialogue about art, culture and literature, and in the second half the dialogue gets even better. For instance, my favorite line comes from one of the bohemian characters, who believes that: "the job of the artist is not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence." Another piece of wisdom comes from one of the antagonists who criticizes Gil for being infatuated with the past: "Nostalgia is denial ? a flaw in the romantic imagination of people who find it difficult to cope with the present." Think about that one while watching the film, for I believe, there lies the moral of this fabulous fable about the past and the present.At age 75?with more than 40 films under his belt?Allen has created a film that literally glows. Its dazzling cinematography, inventive plot, and Parisian score, combined with the top-notch acting and set-design, makes for an almost-perfect film, one that's not only clever and thought-provoking, but also entertaining and accessible?even to mainstream audiences</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ode to Nostalgia and Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨That Paris exists and anyone could choose to live anywhere else in the world will always be a mystery to me.¨ Woody Allen has directed more than 40 films in over four decades and I can honestly say that his last film is one of my favorites. If you think otherwise then you are just probably living in nostalgia and trying to remember the past as being much better than the present. Like Micheal Sheen's character would say: ¨Nostalgia is denial - denial of the painful present?the name for this denial is Golden Age thinking ? the erroneous notion that a different time period is better than the one ones living in.¨ Woody Allen has directed numerous great films and this is one of them that will be remembered nostalgically in years to come. It is not a romantic film as we are used to seeing, it is more of a nostalgic film; the true romance isn't between Wilson and McAdams, but between Wilson and Paris, between Wilson and art. The romance is in the city, in the art, in the past. The central theme of this film is clear: nostalgia. Woody Allen manages to deal with these issues in a very comedic way and the dialogue and story is just great. Midnight in Paris is a very funny and nostalgic film. The city of Paris may have never looked as great as it does in this movie. The characters are memorable and it is interesting how Allen intertwines the present with the past and makes fun of some of the stereotypes these artists have. I had a great time with Midnight in Paris; Woody Allen has done it again! Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) are an American engaged couple who are visiting Paris with Inez's parents, John (Kurt Fuller) and Helen (Mimi Kennedy). Gil instantly falls in love with the city and the rich story it has to tell, while Inez on the other hand doesn't like Paris that much. Gil insists they should move to Paris once they get married, but Inez would rather stay in Beverly Hills where Gil has had success writing scripts for Hollywood films. Gil is unhappy with his Hollywood life and has decided to try his luck on writing a novel. Inez insists he should stick to what he does best. In Paris, Inez runs into some friends: Paul (Michael Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda). Paul is a very pedantic sort of guy who always has an opinion on everything and is showing off his great knowledge. Gil can't stand him, but Inez insists on hanging out with him and his wife Carol, and asks Paul to critique Gil's novel for him. One night the couples decide to go out and dance, but Gil says he's too tired and decides to head back to the hotel on his own. While wondering the streets of Paris the clock strikes midnight and a group of French partygoers invite Gil to a party. In this party, Gil runs into Zelda (Alison Pill) and Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston), and Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll). Gil realizes that somehow he has travelled to 1920 and is meeting all these artists who he's admired all his life; he's in the decade he considers as being the Golden Age. Ernest tells Gil that he can get Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) to proofread his novel for him; but when Gil goes to get his novel he is back in 2010. Gil realizes that he can only travel back in time when the clock strikes midnight, so the adventure begins every night where he meets interesting people like Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo) and his mistress Adriana (Marion Cotillard) who he falls for, and other great artists such as Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody) and Luis Bu?uel (Adrien de Van), among others.The true heart of the film relies on Owen Wilson's performance. He is great in this movie and reminded me a lot of the younger Woody Allen who used to star in his own movies. The funniest moments of the film have to do with these stereotypes that these great artists of the past have been given. Adrien Brody is great as Salvador Dali, and the rhinoceros scene is extremely funny; Corey Stoll is equally great playing the courageous Ernest Hemingway. His dialogue with Wilson's character about love and death is powerful and funny at the same time. Marion Cotillard and Owen Wilson also had great chemistry together and it was fun to watch them on screen. McAdams is one of my favorite actresses, and this time she plays sort of the villain, instead of the sweet role she is used to playing. This is a much different role from the one Wilson and McAdams played in Wedding Crashers. Midnight in Paris is just a terrific movie, with a lot of heart, and Woody Allen proves once again that he is a great director and writer. I absolutely recommend this movie as one of the best the year has had to offer.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable, but forgettable Woody Allen time travel fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's an old Twilight Zone episode, a fantasy-drama called 'The Trouble with Templeton' which came out during the iconic show's second season. It's a similar concept to 'Midnight in Paris'. Templeton is a fading stage director who believes that his glory days were back in the 20s and gets the opportunity go back there and learn an important lesson. Unlike the Twilight Zone episode, Woody Allen's story is more of a romantic comedy. It features Owen Wilson as a hack Hollywood screenwriter who aspires for more as a high brow novelist. Wilson is the protagonist, Gil, who's vacationing in Paris with his fiancée and her parents. Wilson delivers many of Woody Allen's expressions in the same way as 'The Master' and that's probably why Woody praises him vociferously during the news conference extra in the DVD bonus section.As in many other Woody Allen films, the protagonist is friendly with another couple, with the male partner depicted as a pretentious intellectual. Woody also gets his ubiquitous digs in at right wingers, making jokes at the Tea Party's expense, through the mouth of the father-in-law to be, a corporate executive who decidedly is in the Republican camp. As usual, Woody's protagonist must move on from a failed relationship with a woman at the end; in this case, it's the fiancé, Inez, perkily played by Rachel McAdams.The central conceit of 'Midnight in Paris' is Gil's time traveling back to the 1920s in Paris. Woody doesn't come up with a very clever mode of transport: a limousine from the 20s appears out of the blue at midnight on a Parisian street and whisks our protagonist back to those heady days where he runs into the likes of Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.During the news conference on the DVD, Woody makes it clear that his intent is to satirize the artistes who Gil runs into. At first, it's rather neat to watch a perennially intoxicated Zelda Fitzgerald do her thing as well as listen to Cole Porter at the piano, but soon we realize that Woody has little to say about these iconic figures. Hemingway isn't very amusing blathering about all his macho concerns and Picasso shows up merely as a buffoon, seducing one woman after another. Adrien Brody tries his best to suck out humor from a pretentious Salvador Dali but ultimately is unable to come up with anything funny. There's a brief, slightly humorous bit where Gil suggests to the surrealist film director, Bunuel, the concept for his classic picture, "The Exterminating Angel", with the exasperated director rejecting it since he tells Gil that it doesn't make any sense. Kathy Bates has little to do as Gertrude Stein, except offering her critique of Gil's new manuscript.A good part of 'Midnight' has to do with Gil's infatuation with Adriana, one of Picasso's cast-offs. When Gil finds Adriana's autobiography at a bookseller in the present, he learns that he gave her a pair of earrings back in the 20s. This leads to an awkward scene where he attempts to steal Inez's earrings in order to fulfill the prophetic passage in Adriana's book. Gil is interrupted by Inez and her parents, who have returned to the hotel room after the father has some kind of heart scare. Gil's machinations, attempting to prevent Inez from discovering that he stole the earrings, don't cut it since he could have avoided the whole predicament by buying earrings for Adriana at a store the next day (and that's what predictably transpires!).Gil finally learns an important life lesson that living in the past is useless when he joins Adriana in traveling back to her golden age of the 1890s. Back in the 20s, Hemingway speculates that Inez has been cheating on Gil, who confronts her when he returns to the present time.'Midnight in Paris' is watchable but I guarantee you'll forget about this film after a few days. Please note that Lea Seydoux is sensational as Gabrielle, the bookseller babe that Owen Wilson walks off into the sunset with at film's end!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got this DVD from my library and am so happy that I didn't pay to see the movie. I started getting angry as soon as I saw the toxic couple at the beginning of this movie, but, things devolve even more, if possible.Everyone in this abject failure is a caricature; Wilson, as the nebbish-on-steroid Allen persona, his fiancée as the screech-y,throughly unlikeable Material Girl; her parents, as the Mitt Romney-esque 1%'s; the other couple is straight out of the movie line from "Annie Hall," the one in which Marshall McLuhan steps out of a cardboard poster and tells them that "you know nothing of me and my work." And what's up with Wilson's ultimate soul mate... a Mia Farrow clone? Any Freudian meanings there? The good news is that I could fast-forward through a lot of the nonsense to what was the inevitable breakup of this thoroughly unsympathetic couple. Allen is capable of such good writing...he must have done this for the money and a paid trip to Paris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is easily one of my favorites! I love this movie to death, it's funny, insightful, passionate, meaningful, romantic. The directing is glorious, considering how flashy and dumb it could have been, Woody Allen makes this story seem so real and it comes so naturally. The cinematography is jaw dropping and the score is absolutely wonderful. You can just tell how much everyone working on this project was passionate about it and wanted to make it the best it could be. All the performances were astounding, and ensemble cast with not one standing out as an actor during the experience and easily Owen Wilson's best performance in my opinion. This film is so different and original and it plays it off so normal. There is a reason the film won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The dialogue was excellent, feeling very real and as if characters were actually just people talking. The film inspires me as an artist, it really tries to be art and about art. But more than that: it is about love, understanding, dreams, our past and so much more! This film is so quirky but so beautiful at the same time. It is something that I would suggest anyone watch because my god is this film amazing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen directs Owen Wilson, a typical example of a modern American actor, in a movie built on two elements : the magic of the City of Light and the unbelievable spiritual and artistic prosperity of the 20's. As the protagonist travels back in time, the viewers have the joy of watching parade in front of their eyes the creme de la creme of the artistic world of the time : the Fitzgeralds, Hemingway, Eliot, Picasso- just to name a few. Some may find it a bit slow for their taste, but it is, certainly, an interesting, positive and entertaining film. A movie that reminds you that there was a time when bars were filled with stimulating conversation, when everybody dreamed of becoming a poet, when great people lived and thrived !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd been meaning to watch Midnight in Paris for ages but, I have to confess, I was put off by the presence of Owen Wilson, who I could not really envisage as the lead in a Woody Allen film. He was actually surprisingly good though and did a decent job as the vessel from which Allen's brilliant dialogue could be heard. However, this is not an actor-driven film or even a story-driven film; its beauty lies in the simple but clever script and the easy-going laid-back style that you'd expect from a Woody Allen film all about nostalgia. To be fair, I can completely understand why there have been so many negative reviews of Midnight in Paris. There isn't a great deal going on superficially and the characters are all gloriously stereotypical. This doesn't matter though because, although the film is quite simple, it is at the same time wonderfully clever and thought-provoking. However, you do probably have to be in the right mood to watch it. I saw this film on a lazy Saturday afternoon and wasn't expecting too much, so when I was left both entertained and thinking about the past, the present and the future, it was a pleasant surprise. There are few films these days that still have you thinking about them several days later ? this is definitely one of them. What do you want from life, with whom do you want to experience it, and why are we always so dissatisfied with where we are and what we've got? Like I say, quite thought-provoking!It's incredibly ironic that some critics go on about how Woody Allen films aren't anywhere near as good as they were back in the seventies and that he's a has-been pseudo-intellectual, when here he is making a film about nostalgia and poking fun at pseudo-intellectuals in both an obvious and also a more subtle manner. Midnight in Paris is full of self-parody and interesting contradictions, but not everything is immediately apparent and I believe that some viewers of the film may have simply taken it at face value and consequently been left thinking "is that it then?". On a slightly more negative side, I am perplexed that some people have praised the cinematography and the wonderful images of Paris in the light, in the dark and in the rain. To me, the use of colour and imagery are not too impressive and I would argue that Paris has looked far better in plenty of other films. The music can be a little annoying too ? especially in the opening sequence, which seems to go on for ever! As I said before though, Midnight in Paris is primarily about the dialogue and the interesting ideas that it throws out to the audience. Catch them if you like, and run with them. It's a great easy-going relaxing film that'll hopefully leave you both entertained and thought- provoked. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cultural romantic reconciles his intense nostalgia for the 1920's modernist French scene through magical rendezvous with its key figures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film for a number of reasons, though it is certainly a "love it or hate it" story. Myself being quite interested in the modern era and all of the creativity that it inspired, I was immediately drawn to the interpretations of iconic figures like Gertrude Stein and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. Seeing these icons in a mystified version of their everyday escapades had a particularly interesting effect; of course the plot was carried along as Gil became more and more enthused with his surroundings and longing for a change (which he of course later renounces for a huge character arc) as well as provide literature dorks with a chance to see their heroes as actual people doing actual things. Hemmingway was hilarious; his dry humor, fighting spirit, and obstinate take on the nature of good prose (brave and true!) was done very well. Gil's journey is filled with humor and good mirth and his eventual realization that nostalgia is more of a flaw in logic than a life purpose is illuminating. All of us employ the "Golden Age" principal in our daily lives but its an actual challenge to move on and make our next days better than days past. He is a perfect representative of the proverbial "green grass" idea and Wilson wonderfully portrays a man who is passionately preoccupied with his own convictions who ultimately makes an extremely wise choice. Great performances, beautiful cinematography, and wonderful story. Thanks for giving me another classic Mr. Allen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't love Owen Wilson, but I think this role gets every good quality out of him possible, and his charm really drives the film forward. Midnight is the perfect Woody pic because it has lightness, comedy, human neurosis, philosophical drivel, and hatred for the same philosophical drivel, all wrapped up together. I love the more Apatow sort of comedies that dominate today, but this was a more classic and thought-provoking sort of film that I think raises the standard and refreshes the palette. I think it is great when a comedy can be nominated for best picture, and this one certainly deserves to be this year. Go see it for date night, and if you are with the right sort of woman when you do, you should marry her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Midnight in Paris" invites its viewers to saunter back into the past to go on an unforgettably enchanting promenade with a masterfully characterized motley crew of history's most influential minds, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Salvador Dali and several others. Woody Allen crafts a simple yet remarkable tale that succeeds in mesmerizing the audience with the wondrous verisimilitude that radiates from every word, movement and idiosyncrasy of all characters that portray a non-fictional individual. This charming meet and greet is ideally accompanied with its moments of comical banter. Observing Allen's limitless imagination resuscitate and power the actions of such personae is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. Furthermore, the well-chosen cast contribute positively overall- to emphasize are Adrien Brody's amusing interpretation of Salvador Dali and Owen Wilson's all-round compatible mood with the tranquil and romantic Parisian setting. In sum, "Midnight in Paris" is a cleverly organized rendezvous that grandiosely connects modern-day spectators to their brilliant predecessors.</fullReview>

The scenes in Paris are beautiful and magical, the music a tad monotonous but I got used to it and it soon added to the charm. This film was simply charming, clever, well acted and well directed.

		<fullReview>Laughed out loud 2 or 3 times so guess this is a comedy? Woody has not delivered on comedy in a while. His obsession with Scarlett's chest has morphed to Rachel McAdams rear end in tight jeans here. But I digress - beautifully shot in what we imagine are 1920's warm colours (Monet's Giverny watercolours?), Paris is lovely and Woody explores the city for a few scenes in the rain - warm rain. And Rachel brings her special sassiness full tilt, while Owen Wilson does another Woody Allen stand in (as Kenneth Branagh in 'Celebrity'; Penelope Cruz in 'Vicky Christina...'). Sarkozy's ex model wife, Carla Bruni puts in a couple of scenes as does Cathy Bates, and Marion Cotillard (A Good Year) luminous. Woody's usual Trad Jazz staple is presented in 'stereo,' (Woody is beginning to get the hang of stereo, who knows maybe surround will be next?). That said, whole sections are to a Django Reinhardt style number - won't spoil as to why? Juliet Taylor's casting is superb as usual on a Woody flic. Paris at its best and an excellent travelogue but hardly earned Oscar calibre. Was reminded of 'Picasso at the Lapin Agile' - Steve Martin's play, that I saw live one balmy Saturday evening at the Westwood Playhouse in LA. Steve could not get his play financed/produced for a movie - Woody did?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike Allen's many other films, 'Midnight in Paris' has a more surreal/dreamlike feel to it that couples well with the reality of it. The film opens with some postcard shots of Paris and the visuals continue to look stunning which adds to the dreamy feel (thanks to the special effects, cinematography and wonderful jazzy score). It has that same feeling of whimsy that most of Allen's other films have. The time-travelling theme has been marvelously explored in the story. This film is especially relevant to those who think that life in so-and-so year was easier, more exotic, more exciting more so and so than it is in present. For Allen analyzes this theme through his protagonist who is a writer dissatisfied with his novel and wishes he were living in the 20s.This time Allen's alterego is played by Owen Wilson who does a terrific job here (one of his best). He reunites with the lovely Rachel McAdams who is equally stupendous as the frivolous bitchy fiancée. Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy, Michael Sheen and Kathy Bates provide great support. And what would 'Midnight In Paris' be without the luminous Marion Cotillard who can best be described as spellbinding? 'Midnight in Paris' is colourful, elegant, surreal, funny and delightful. It ranks among Allen's best works. This is also his way of showing respect to the artists and writers he pays homage to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An homage to Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Allen had me at « Paris ». What a wonderful tour of this beautiful city, and the revived color of the Roaring Twenties and the Belle Epoque. The premise was great (for people like me, who are people like Gil in the movie). How many times have we dreamers envisioned ourselves living in a garret, lolling for hours in some little bistro while we sipped a glass of wine or a café allongé. Like Gil, every time I get to Paris, I wear myself out wandering little side streets and stopping at out-of-the way bistros and brasseries to rest while I sit and absorb atmosphere. Unfortunately, in my little randonnées I never managed to step through that magical curtain into the past. Much as I enjoyed the film, the story line and color, I do feel that the whole structure was somewhat contrived. Boy, this guy got a chance to visit with just about every artist, painter, writer, filmmaker available as well as their copines, throwing in a glimpse of Josephine Baker to boot. He even went farther into the past for a visit to the Moulin Rouge. Throwing aside any relationship to reality, this was an absorbing and fun movie to watch. The soprano (I think) sax was sublime.</fullReview>

I was completely caught by surprise at the romantic, clever, intriguing, funny, interesting and thoroughly well written script. I had no idea about the plot and was happily led by Wilson's character into the depths of Paris' magical midnight strike. Other actor's involved did a great job too. I was particularly impressed with McAdams as it just adds to her ability to play any role. I think overall I'm simply in awe at the film. It's a classic.

		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris, started out with as a funny title, and the story described in it ridiculous. I didn't even consider the Director, Woody Allen as encouraging, considering his latest films had appealed little to my palate. But then I had just left Paris and sitting on the Airfrance flight to USA, figured that it might just be a good idea to see this story about "Romance in Paris", and "dis" it as i watched it. It was my third choice on the flight after watching a few other flicks, called "Spies", and another one.So began the movie quite simply with a couple arguing about the merits of Paris, moving swiftly to show us that this couple was eminently unsuitable for each other. it shows us quite convincingly that the boy, Owen Wilson, needs to pursue his own desires. then very easily slips into the supernatural, as we see the ride into the twenties,, and the roaring fun that they would have over there. amazing delights very nicely detailed, yet so casual that you wouldn't know they had time traveled till later on. i love this concept of time travel, and having written the book, "Black Shark Valley", i was very surprised pleasantly to find Woody taking me down a similar path, very dear to my heart, Nostalgia.Loved this emphasis on nostalgia, and love of the artists of Paris and of course some very real lessons learned from this sort of dreaming. we have all unfortunately realized the futility of day dreaming but then we can make it productive by making it work through art. that includes writing, movies, and painting. amazing if we can truly capture it in the past, or even better if we capture it in the present. yes Woody then celebrates the glory of the Present, another theme that i strongly agree with, tying the past in our glorious Present. After much soul searching, i have realized that the Present is the most glorious of all and its best to make peace with it. Woody does so brilliantly, while rupturing the ill-fated engaged couple, and onto the new. Paris is indeed the place of Romance, and thats what you can find aplenty in Paris. Even to this day, Mr Pablo PIcasso, Ernst Hemingway, and Mr Salvadore Dali!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an "Annie Hall," but very much worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stopped going to Woody Allen movies several years ago, when they had started to become pedantic (and let's be honest here) pretentious and self-importantly "deep." Woody Allen is still a very funny man, and I especially like his humor pieces in "The New Yorker." A couple of months ago, for old time's sake, I watched "Sleeper," and found it still funny.The reviews of "Midnight in Paris," both from the media and personal friends, made me hope that it was as good as his early stuff. Maybe the years have colored my delightful memories of gasping for air as I watched those hilarious situations and dialog, but M.in P. isn't at the level of an "Annie Hall." Allen's early movies were daring and sometimes outrageous in a way that this one isn't.Nevertheless, "Midnight in Paris" is a charming movie, full of clever dialog and witty inside jokes ? Gil's suggestion to Luis Bunuel for a movie plot, and "recognizing" Hemingway's portentous dialog (it was spot-on Papa). Allen makes only a passing effort to cast actors who look like historical figures, which is fine, but Adrien Brody's riff on Salvador Dali, both the way he talks and the way he looks, is brilliant (I'm grinning as I write this).A quibble, both about Gil's reference to people seeing Paris from outer space, and also from the perception of other reviewers: Historically, Paris is not "The City of Lights," it is "The City of Light." The original reference was by painters, who were drawn to the beautiful changes of natural light in the city. Anyone who has visited Paris knows exactly what they meant, and to assume that the reference is to a man-made phenomenon misses one of the loveliest aspects of Paris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen is getting better and better. This is one of his best preferred it to Vicky Christina and some of the London based ones. All the historic encounters are so fascintaing it needs to be seen twice to appreciate all the detail. Makes you want to know more details about the different people he meets. It's one of those movies you wish could go on longer. Owen is typical Owen I think the role was made for his laid back charm. Rachel is pretty and hilarious. Such a versatile actress. The cameo actors are interesting to watch from Brody to a slightly inexpressive Bruni. It's not just about cultural differences, it's about the magical past of the city. My favorite Paris film since Le Divorce. Can't wait to see how Woody handles Rome in his next movie.</fullReview>

Why not just ask the Paris Tourist Bureau that he would do it for them at a discounted rate, so he can indulge into something he wanted to do in a proper context? I went to see this movie hoping that it would be as decent as Vicky Christina Barcelona, with Barcelona replaced by Paris and the rest of the charm intact. I was so wrong!

		<shortDescription>Whimsical Allen and his time-traveling taxi-cab...lovely moments abound, though it is without charming characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern-day Hollywood screenwriter and novelist, on vacation in France with his fiancée and her parents, travels back in time to Paris in the 1920s via a magical taxi-cab, meeting legendary literary and artistic figures who help the writer put his work and his love-life into focus. Writer-director Woody Allen, seemingly in love with Paris himself, appealingly uses fantasy to both confuse and clarify reality...but without interesting, disarming central characters, the confection seems to cool early on. Stepping in for Woody, lead Owen Wilson doesn't have a dynamic screen presence (he fades into the foreground), and even the comedic scenes that should work the smoothest--such as a bit involving Rachel McAdams' missing earrings--have a bland denouement. Allen's nostalgia for the past is fun for awhile, but he doesn't use it to build momentum; fairly soon, we're stuck in a revolving door of personalities and romantic couplings, sequences which have an attractive sheen but ultimately feel a little underwhelming. ** from ****</fullReview>

The script is trademark Woody Allen, full of musings about life and happiness, but it's more subtle and natural than his dialogue can often be. The cast is great (Corey Stoll as Earnest Hemingway and Adrien Brody as Salavador Dali being two of the most memorable examples), and Paris looks so beautiful that it often can distract from what's going on with the characters.&nbsp;Fully recommended for Woody fans, Wilson fans, romantics at heart, and those who love Paris (both past and present).&nbsp;</fullReview>

A witty and funny comedy is set in the most romantic city of the world, Paris.Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is a writer who is on a vacation with his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) when he gets absorbed in the magic of the Parisian midnight. Pender is stuck in the rut with his script because he's afraid to show it to anybody. Then he has a colorful blast from the past when he meets his idols, a group of various artists from the 20's. Naturally nobody seems to believe him. He finds himself wanting to spend more time with Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald than his girlfriend. He also meets a lovely lady Adriana (Marion Cotillard). Gil starts to question what's really important to him.Allen's story brings back the glamor of the 20's. The script's insightful and the maestro's vivid imagination and humor are flourishing once again. The cast is great, especially Wilson has a fantastic role for a change. Also Marion Cotillard and Adrien Brody as a surrealist Salvador Dali are brilliant."Midnight in Paris" is the best Allen since the great "Match Point" and lovely "Vicky Christina Barcelona".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MIDNIGHT IN Paris sounds good on paper and looks in ads. The film opens with a long sequence of views of the sights in Paris - no actors, no story, just the breathtaking magnificence of the City of Light. For this viewer that section i the most rewarding of the entire film. Once the film starts Woody Allen imposes an improbable story with stereotype characters and with a few notable exceptions, it gets stuck in its own cuteness.VERY briefly screenwriter wannabe novelist Gil (Owen Wilson playing Owen Wilson) and his bride to be Inez (Rachel McAdams) are in Paris with Inez' parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) who in turn are on a business trip. Inez is a bore: Gil wants adventure. As Inez sees the touristy places with her friends, the hideously boring pedantic Paul (Michael Sheen) and his flaky partner Carol (Nina Arianda), Gil escapes to walk the streets of Paris and fall in love with the history and the magic of the city. At the stoke of midnight he is picked up by an elegant car and is taken to the 1920s where he encounters Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), F Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and his Zelda (Allison Pill), Josephine Baker (Sonia Rolland), Alice B. Toklas (Thér?se Bourou-Rubinsztein) and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo) and his current flame Adriana (Marion Cotillard who seems to have phoned in her performance), Djuna Barnes (Emmanelle Uzan), Salvador Dalí (Adrien Brody - in probably the only convincing performance in the film), Man Ray (Tom Cordier), Luis Bu?uel (Adrien de Van), TS Eliot (David Lowe) - in other words all the famous artists of the 1920s. Gil is captivated by the opportunity to share his work with these greats, though he finds it difficult to understand time travel. He falls for Adriana who in turn wishes she could live in the time of Le Belle Epoque so of course Gil and Adriana time travel again meeting Henri Matisse (Yves-Antoine Spoto), Toulesse-Lautrec (Vincent Menjou Cortes), Paul Gauguin (Olivier Rabourdin), and Edgar Degas (François Rostain) at Maxim's. Gil by day grows less enamored with Inez and by night more infatuated by Adriana and in the end there is a permanent schism between Gil and Inez and we are left with the moral 'Don't wish to live in another time than your own.'Sounds like a run through of famous names? It is. Wilson is inept at romantic comedy, and Woody Allen's script is fairly boring for Allen's works. BUT Paris is Gorgeous - and that is enough! Grady Harp</fullReview>

As far as light- hearted comedies go, this is the vein of many of his other movies. I had the pleasure of watching this movie on an atypical gloomy, rainy afternoon and it was a really good experience. Everything from the wide- eyed, open-mouthed, kid-in-a-toy-store Owen Wilson, to the hardcore Hemmingway, to the beautiful and confused Marion Coutillard/Adrianna, to the petulant Picasso, to the "what-the-hell-is-he-smoking" Adrian Brody/Dali and the absolute timelessness of Paris at night, was an absolute treat to watch.This movie left me with a smile on my face and an intense desire to walk in the drizzle.

As expected, Woody Allen shows you Paris though the eyes of love, but mostly through they eyes of a nostalgic all time tourist, in Paris.The direction is wonderful, as is the general acting. In my point of view, Owen Wilson could have done a better work. He often seems more idiotic than lost, and he keeps delivering the lines as he would in any other movie he played.The plot if really entertaining. It creates the illusion it was intended for, and, although, the ending might seem predictable the conclusions and the message itself is not.Not one of the best movies, not even one of the best of Woody Allen, but it is what it promises to be, time and place, love and life, questioned and answered wonderfully.

		<fullReview>This film is about an American writer who travels to Paris with his fiancée. A chance encounter at midnight brings him back to the Paris in the 1920's."Midnight in Paris" is very unlike a Woody Allen film, as it lacks the non stop witty dialogs and sarcasm that are normally his trademarks. Still, "Midnight in Paris" is highly intellectual and enjoyable. The way it entertainingly weaves through so many artistic masterminds in a story is quite genius. It gives me the impulse to go and study art history! The cast is magnetic; Owen Wilson breathes life into this confused man, while Adrien Brody is particularly memorable as Salvador Dali. Even Carla Bruni is in the film, which is almost a official recognition by the French that "Midnight in Paris" is a great film."Midnight in Paris" might be the most commercial film Woody Allen has made in years. It is a fun, and heartwarming fantasy tale. I am glad that this has translated to box office success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet summer surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are plenty of big, loud blockbusters making their way to a theater near you. 2011 is a little more lackluster than most. Still there is a little bit of originality left in Hollywood if you look for it and Midnight in Paris is a prime example.Woody Allen's new film starts unassumingly with Owen Wilson doubling for Allen as a Hollywood hack unsure about his aspirations to become a real writer. What he is sure of is he loves Paris and has joined his fiancé (Rachel McAdams) and fiancé's parents on vacation pining to discover the city in spring. His fiancé however really just wants to shop. It's all pretty basic really, in fact by the fifteen minute mark I kind of wondered where the movie was going. Then Owen Wilson's character stumbles into a back street in Paris, the clock strikes midnight and he is coaxed into an antique car by a gaggle of garishly dressed people.Inexplicably, Owen Wilson transports to 1920's Paris and literally walks in the shadows of his idols. F. Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, T.S. Eliot and Gertrude Stein all make an appearance in what is sure to be an English slash Art major's wet dream. This movie must have been an absolute joy to make and shows a historical and literary depth that rivals Allen's Love and Death.Truth be told, I don't consider myself an intellectual. I have never read Fitzgerald or T.S. Eliot and to be honest there were plenty of jokes that were just plain over my head. But there is still a genteel human touch and accessibility to this film that stimulated my mind without being pretentious.The performances are great. Wilson makes for a good doppelganger to good ol' Woody, displaying the neuroticism the screenplay requires, but adding on a good dose of naivety that only Owen Wilson can provide. The real treat however comes from the actors playing historical figures. Kathy Bates is great as the no-nonsense Gertrude Stein and Corey Stoll as Hemingway is truly inspired; speaking in strong masculine prose and challenging everyone in earshot to a fistfight. Adrien Brody also makes an appearance as Salvador Dali which can be best described as absurdly hilarious.Critics have been singing "Midnight's" praises but warning that the film isn't for everybody which is a shame. This movie can be for everyone, save little children. Sure the subject matter might be a little academic but the themes of living in the past and being the best version of yourself are universal.As a Woody Allen fan, I can say that Midnight in Paris isn't his best but awfully close. It's funny, sweet and stimulating without being too intellectual. Unlike a lot of the movies I've seen in 2011, it's original. For those who don't want to spend their hard earned money on a record year in sequels go see Midnight in Paris.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An enjoyable, if slight, Woody Allen comedy. I probably would have enjoyed this more on video than in the theater, however. I don't think there has ever been a film that invited more forced laughter than this one. It's funny, but rarely laugh-out-loud funny. But you wouldn't know that from the audience, who guffawed at the mere appearance of Henri Matisse. The one person in the audience besides me to have heard of The Exterminating Angel made sure to let me know by her laughter during the film's very unfunny Marvin Berry moment. Of course, everyone cackled loudly when Salvador Dali popped up. So everyone by now knows the story: Owen Wilson, playing the Woody Allen surrogate, plays a Hollywood writer entranced with the city of Paris during his trip there. He's annoyed by his stuffy future-wife (Rachel McAdams) and her even stuffier parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy). During a midnight walk through the city, he gets picked up by an old automobile and transported to Paris of the 1920s, where he meets F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill), Ernest Hemmingway (Corey Stoll), Gertrud Stein (Kathy Bates), Pablo Picasso (Marcial di Fonzo Bo) and other famous figures from the era. He also meets Picasso's current girlfriend, played by Marion Cotillard, and falls for her. Not surprising how quickly he would leave McAdams, who plays such an awfully detestable shrew it's hard to believe anyone even remotely like Wilson's character would put up with her for over two minutes, let alone propose to her at some point. McAdams and her parents are so awful that any sequence that takes place in the present are borderline painful. Fortunately, the sequences where Wilson visits the past, as annoyingly congratulatory as they are, are quite delightful. Wilson ain't half bad, and Cotillard, as always, is enchanting. Most of the historical figures are kind of fun to hang out with. Who wouldn't want to hear Ernest Hemmingway talk about hunting lions all night long? Of course, it helps that Paris really is beautiful, and Allen films it with a fine eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conceited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allen's conceit, if this movie is anything to go by, appears boundless. Or maybe his advance into dotage has seriously diminished his powers. It's not that he lacks imagination or flair, it's simply that he has applied his skills to a movie that ultimately has no warmth and no lasting worth.The movie does have a message -- the timeless "There's no place like home". Other movies have taken that moral and ended up with more convincing results. "Wizard of Oz", for example, comes to mind. In "Midnight In Paris", home refers to the present time the lead character inhabits, 2010, but he would prefer to live in a previous era, the 1920s in Paris. And he happens upon a method to whisk him back to that era -- a carriage which appears on a dim Paris street at the stroke of midnight.I happily suspended disbelief to see where the story would take me. What eventuated, and what destroyed the suspension, was the name-dropping exercise involving most of the famous artistic characters who passed through Paris in the 1920s. Allen intentionally manipulates the audience by pandering to their need to appear knowledgeable in front of friends. At every entrance of another noted artist, a murmur sweeps through the audience as people in the know are unable to restrain the urge to tell their neighbour who the new kid is. "That's Cole Porter at the piano? and there's Picasso." And this is where I hark back to Allen's conceit. Well, two conceits. The first, that a dull, would-be writer could somehow befriend the likes of Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemmingway and Gertrude Stein. The second, that Allan is so taken with his own persona, so enamoured with his importance as an actor, that this movie just has to have himself in the starring role -- but being much to old to play the lead in this movie, he clones himself. Like "Mini-Me" from an Austin Powers movie (except this Mini-Me is the same size as the original), this film's cloned Woody Allen walks and talks just like the real thing. And just like the real thing, the clone is irresistible to every gorgeous young woman he meets. Allen's fetish for young women is clearly on display.Entertainment at a superficial level is what this movie is about. On the surface it is not difficult to enjoy this film. The cinematography is clean and elegant: very little unnecessary camera movement, and no out-of-focus foreground that every camera hack overuses because they learnt at film school that that's how you give depth to a scene. The sound is crisp and appropriate, with little evidence of overly-zealous foley artists at work. And the basic story -- time travel -- is always of interest.Scratch the surface, however, and pus oozes. This film is diseased. The acting is mediocre, especially by Allen's clone; and the story itself, though inherently interesting, is undone by its ludicrous proposition -- that a dull American would be of interest to some of the most creative people of the 20th century. Pre-production, Allen was let down by people who should have put their awe aside and warned him: "Hey Woody, it's probably not a good idea to clone yourself for the lead role. And rehashing scenes from "Manhattan"? are you sure that's a good idea?"The disease is narcissism. It's quite okay to feature yourself in the lead role of movies when the lead is an ordinary bloke surrounded by friends; it's highly suss to keep doing that when you are much too old to play the roles, and instead, hire a young clone and set yourself amongst the rich, the famous, and the gorgeous.Having Hemingway in this film reminded me of a story about fantasy, lies, and Hemingway, in the book "Why We Lie" by Dorothy Rowe. The quote talks about the principles Hemingway used to guide his work:"The first ?- derived from newspaper experience which had trained him to report only what he had witnessed directly ?- was that fiction must be founded on real emotional and intellectual experience and be faithful to actuality, but must also be transformed and heightened by the imagination until it becomes truer than mere factual events? Engaging an audience and telling the truth requires considerable skill, particularly if you put the truth you want to tell into some kind of fantasy. You have to make sure that you never lose sight of the difference between the truth you want to tell and the fantasy. Only then can you control both elements of your material". (p147)Unfortunately, Allen did lose control of this film because he lost sight of the difference between truth and fantasy.Woody Allen was 75 when he directed this movie. If this is all he is now capable of he should step aside from writing and directing, and limit himself to producing. Bow out gracefully, in other words, before more movie failures expose his declining powers to even his most devoted fans.Woody, if you feel driven to continue writing movies that star yourself, write them for a man of your age. Here's an idea:1. An elderly Woody Allen realises his creative powers are diminishing.2. While wandering the streets of New York at night with three friends, talking about his mental decline, Woody heads off into the darkness by himself.3. He jumps in one of those horse-pulled carriages that roam New York and ends up back in 1979 on the set of "Manhattan".4. The older Woody and the younger Woody interact in some interesting way.Forget the science fiction, forget the women young enough to be your granddaughters. Act your age and your movies will probably turn out okay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I failed to make it beyond the first 20 minutes of Midnight In Paris. That miserable time was filled with a ever-increasing pity for such hopelessly self-absorbed people. Sadly, every Woody Allen movie I have seen, which is by no means all, has been populated exclusively with characters devoid of the quality that I cherish in real people; a recognition of some thing which is greater than themselves. Allen's characters always seem to follow the same, circular, shallow lives: It starts with conflicting introspection, then false-awareness, always followed by the deep, wallowing creep of a search for a self-induced problem that would not have existed had their self-absorption not been their best quality. Is Allen incapable of writing a character that has faith? Surely he must have met a person in his life to draw upon, SOMEWHERE, that was not endlessly bumping into other people's psyches, constantly wondering what is wrong with themselves! Well, maybe not...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that 75-year-old Woody Allen opens his latest film with a soothing yet slightly over-indulgent montage of countless Parisian places seems to have led many to believe that he is besotted by this famous city, but they are forgetting that a film director may often just be presenting a viewpoint, may not necessarily share it themselves. In this case, it is likely that this deep passion we see does not belong to Woody Allen, but his effortlessly lovable protagonist, Gil. Brilliantly brought to life by Owen Wilson, a popular comedic actor who often tags along with Ben Stiller, but has left him behind on this outing, Gil is an unshakable romantic who intends to pursue a career as a novelist, with Paris being his ideal writing station. It seems that the only thing holding him back is the insistence of his whiny, closed-minded fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her snobby, overbearing liberalist parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimmi Kennedy) to continue churning out formulaic but reliably profitable Hollywood film scripts as he is currently doing. As the four of them are trying to enjoy a decidedly uncomfortable parisian holiday, they have a chance encounter with Inez's overzealous but good-hearted friend Carol (Nina Arianda), and, much to Gil's annoyance, her insufferable know-it-all husband Paul (Michael Sheen, who rises admirably to the challenge of masking his natural likability), after which the women unite the two younger couples as travel mates for the rest of the trip, but the seething friction between the men make it a very awkward arrangement.As you can see, within the first half hour, the foundations have been laid for yet another zany romantic and situation comedy: the antagonistic goody two-shoes jerk; the clumsy and confused protagonist struggling to satisfy the other characters; the tough, hard-to-please parents, the well-meaning bystander; the tight setting that allows almost no escape; everything's there at the ready. Then Gil sensibly decides to withdraw from the unpleasantness and drop the contented façade, an act of ordinary intelligence that is commonplace in the real world but equates to a stroke of genius in the world of oddball comedy. Heavily drunk and a little out of his senses, he decides to take a nice leisurely stroll around the city streets seeking inspiration for his writing. At the stroke of midnight, sitting down in a particular spot, he magically enters his favourite Parisian era: the 1920s. When this occurs, we are just as surprised as he is, the film having so convincingly set itself up to be something very different. It is perhaps the most cunning and well-executed deception since Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). The audience is completely unsuspecting, and until Gil starts running into people like Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, T.S. Eliot and Scott Fitzgerald. After having such a fabulous night in what he has always thought of as the Golden Age, Gil becomes a regular visitor, returning to the real world each day with more and more quirky discoveries and fresh ideas, sending his loathsome companions into a state of utter bewilderment. This is another point at which the film diverts from the familiar route, where the female spouse continually complains and obsesses over the male protagonists apparent descent into madness and until he eventually comes to his senses and butters her up once more, because keeping their relationship together is paramount, no matter what the holes have to be patched up with. As Inez takes incessant whinging to soaring new heights, Gil makes no effort to appease her and instead finds solace in being with the lovely Adriana (the wonderful Marion Cotillard), an adventurous young soul, who is one of Picasso's numerous gorgeous muses and lovers. The end result of these relationship dynamics is highly interesting and genuinely surprising, so I won't spoil it.It is these surprising elements that Woody Allen has added used rather unpromising ingredients to put together a very smart and enjoyable film that in the end comes to a very insightful conclusion about Gil's nostalgic romanticism: the past will always seem more inviting than the present, regardless of what era the present might be, for it does often take many years for true beauty to be revealed and appreciated, and there will always be a yearning for that blissful innocence and security of the past. This is not just true of time, but also of place, and that is perhaps what may Woody Allen may have been alluding to in the opening sequence, that Paris is perceived as a perfect paradise, but, as shown with a few of those shots, much of it is as mundane and imperfect as any other Western city. These pieces of thematic material also help to lift this film above the ordinary standard, and make good use of its astutely controlled 94-minute running time, producing a very worthwhile comedic fantasy that also co-stars Carla Bruni, Kathy Bates, Léa Seydoux and Adrien Brody.</fullReview>

Unless you are a literary aficionado who takes great pleasure in 20th century stories and their authors, you will find no joy in this film.The main plot consists of a script writer attempting to get his book approved by famous authors who lived many years ago. If you, like me, take no joy in seeing F. Scott Fitzgerald amongst others portrayed on screen, I'd skip. The pace is slow and repetitive (he goes back in time every midnight at the same place, the only question is 'what will he do tonight?'. He doesn't do a whole lot if you're wondering.)The relationship between Owen Wilson's character and that of Rachel McAdam's is strained and watered-down to fit the short amount of time in the film that Wilson is in present day.Audience reaction: There were about 20 people in the theatre. There were several boos, not at the end of the film, but during the film itself! While audiences talking is usually frowned upon, several couples were chatting and nobody, including myself, seemed to care because their conversations were far more entertaining than the film anyway. Approach with an open and knowledgeable mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband and I found this film totally derivative. The opening sequence is Manhattan's opening, only with Paris and different music. The plot is too predictable. We even guessed which girl Gil would wind up with as soon as she appeared on screen (BTW: total Mia Farrow look alike.) I kept wishing the film was about the artists Gil encountered in the twenties, not Gil, who is, of course, Woody Allen. Allen did a great job of parody with the artists, though. I have been a long time fan of Allen but have to admit I am tired of his personna on screen. His last great movie was "Match Point." There is no Woody Allen schtick in that movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One night in Paris, Gil, the protagonist, decides to go for a walk. During his walk, he discovers a way to time travel back to the 1920s, which is a time period that he believes he was supposed to be born in. Traveling back to the 1920s, Gil meets the great writers of this time: Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and many others. He also encounters the great artists of this time: Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. Gil, who is struggling with the writing of his novel, seeks advice from these writers and artists, mainly Gertrude Stein. Gertrude Stein reads over his novel and gives him advice, which he takes and uses to fix his novel. As a result, Stein tells him his novel is turning out great. During his stay in the 1920s, he falls in love with a woman named Adriana, even though he is engaged to another woman. Similar to Gil, Adriana has a "Golden Age," which is a time period that is preferred over the present. Her present is the 1920s, but her "Golden Age" is the 1890s. Because of the difference in their time preferences, the two cannot be together. Furthermore, the woman that Gil is engaged to has a love for the present, and Gil has a love for the 1920s. Therefore, Gil finds himself breaking up with his fiancé in the end. Whatever happens with Gil's novel is still unknown. That is where the audience is left hanging.The acting and the dialogue was on point. I could definitely see Ernest Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald, and Salvador Dalí in the actors; this is how I imagined these people to be. Since the acting and the dialogue was on point, I felt a connection with Gil: I wanted to live in the 1920s and strike up conversations with these writers and artists. The comedy helped to make the movie less serious and more enjoyable to watch. But without the comedy, the movie would have been very plain. Most of the time, the plot was not predictable. At other times, the plot was predictable and cliché. It might have been better if there was more of a focus on Gil's progress in writing his novel. For most movies nowadays, there is the love aspect, which had a small presence in this movie. If there is a love aspect to a movie, the love should have a strong appearance. But in Midnight in Paris, love seems to be a small thing. Overall, Midnight in Paris seems to be mostly about visiting the 1920s. Therefore, there seems to be not much of a plot. What is the main point of this movie? It is possible that Gil can be a reflection of our nostalgic selves. We all feel nostalgic at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's weird for me that most of the story's ingredients didn't really interest me much. Despite with all those big names in the cast list I didn't really feel that it makes the story as a whole the more interesting. One thing that interested me the most is whether the whole thing is only Gil's imagination or what. And the movie did enough to show that it's actually a magical time travel movie after all. The thing is, just like many other Woody Allen movies, this one explored so many plot branches that becomes significant enough at the ending but this movie didn't give any of them justice in terms of solving them. This movie has many characters but they don't really develop much. The movie only relies on initial impressions of the characters much like they're monotonous in their life or experiences. The acting overall felt really decent. With all those bigger names in the cast list, it's strange that only Owen Wilson gets to do significant parts. That said, Owen's acting really is eclipsed by the potential that other cast members can have here but didn't do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Isn't It Romantic?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film will appeal to individuals with a certain orientation and background. If you feel the term "romantic" applies in your case, you will likely enjoy this movie. And if you are steeped in the romance of the Jazz Age and Belle Epoque you will likely love it. I saw it around the time it came out and just now again. Watching it this time, I appreciated the fact that Mr. Allen cast another actor to be his protagonist. The persona he affected on the screen was limiting as the novelty wore off. Having someone else in the lead makes him much more an Everyman given the context. I found the other actors successful in their roles but, as the late Roger Ebert pointed out, Kathy Bates is especially outstanding as Gertrude Stein completely fulfilling my idea of what Stein must have been like. If the times and place portrayed in this movie resonate with you already, you are in for a treat. If not, it's "Oh, no--not liver and onions again!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of My Favorite Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris has been one of my favorite films for a long time. It is a beautiful, thoughtful and artistic movie with a lot of fantasy, humor and irony. It impressed me and made me think about life in a very different way than any other movies have before because this movie taught me the importance of the present. It is even difficult to describe all the emotions I had after watching it.In this movie directed by Woody Allen, Owen Wilson plays the role of Gil Pender who is an American screenwriter who travels to Paris with his fiancée and her family. Wilson is amazing in the role of the nostalgic and romantic writer who is longing for living in a different era and tries to write a novel. One night, as Gil is walking around on the streets of Paris, he finds himself on a magical journey back to the 1920s which is his favorite historical time. From this time on, he goes back to the 1920s every night at midnight. He meets Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Picasso, Hemingway, Dali, Gertrude Stein and many more famous artists that he loves and idolizes. The artists are all played by amazing actors such as Adrien Brody and Kathy Bates. Gil Pender also meets a beautiful lady, Adriana, and they start to have romantic feelings for each other. However he realizes that he cannot live in the past anymore and should embrace and accept the time he lives in. I think this movie is on the fine line between a romantic comedy and an art film with a beauty of color that we can see in most of Woody Allen's movies.I would recommend Midnight in Paris to people who would like to see a peculiar movie with a fantasy world that takes us back to the past. It is very interesting to imagine and see how the most famous artists lived their everyday lives, but it is also important to have some background knowledge to fully understand and appreciate this movie. It is definitely not for everyone and may be even boring for people without enough background information. However, by the end of this movie I think we can better appreciate our present and see how important it is to stay more realistic and work for our goals in our everyday life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little more than an inventive romcom - even Owen Wilson is in it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An enchanting Parisian ode to the artisans of past. The ensemble cast is expertly used, making the audience simultaneously recognise the on-screen talent and the talent on-screen. Unfortunately Woody Allen's direction is utterly stagnant and unevocative - I would have much preferred an 'In the Mood for Love' approach to the film. But instead, a celebrous romp. Owen Wilson, I find placid and stolid (again), maybe good for the role, but maybe the wrong role for the film.Also, for a film about a man deeply entranced and influenced, Woody Allen's script is utterly uninspired and unevocative and only truly reminiscent. Dissolving into a half-assed abstract love triangle. Great for any lover of art (references), Paris and the 1920s though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen defining "Art" and "Artist" taking you back to the "Golden Era" of Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Escaping his life as a successful and under-demand Hollywood screenwriter, Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) travels with his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) to Paris trying to write a novel and make a real contribution to art, only to find himself going back a 100 years of time, to be surrounded by the artists of the "Golden Era".In his 41st movie, director and screenwriter Woody Allen leaves his most common two topics (love and death) aside, to discuss the art and the definition of the artist. And in order to achieve his purpose and deliver his idea, he uses, as usual, a stars-full and perfectly selected cast, from Adrien Brody playing Salvador Dali, to Kathy Bates playing Gertrude Stein.The costumes and decoration was chosen very properly to go along with the setting, which is Paris at the 20's. The Soundtrack was also chosen the same way, with an elegant mixture of classic Cole Porter and Sydney Bechet. But my favorite part was the Oscar-winning screenplay that succeeded to present a huge amount of valuable ideas using nothing more than a smooth, down to earth, day-to-day chats between very well-drawn characters.In total, Midnight in Paris is one of Allen's best movies, mixing all sorts of art in a smooth enjoyable way. I absolutely highly recommend it.</fullReview>

After watching Midnight in Paris it inspired me to read all of his books.Now I don't know if this is because Owen Wilsons character is a writer or just because I was fascinated by the concept of film. I believe its a really unique idea of a man that sits down in Paris and can be back into the 1920s. The film takes you on an exciting journey with Owen Wilson's character as he doesn't just explore his own fantasies of meeting legendary authors he also discovers more about himself and what is happening in his life.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone as I believe its a film that can be viewed multiple films and it still be entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De-constructing Woody (includes a warning)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nice pleasant way to spend time, one of his best, and with a clever twist on the time travel theme. That has been covered in the other reviews. However two things have been missed by the other reviewers. (WARNING: if you are a die-hard no-questions-asked Woody fan, stop reading here because you are not going to like what follows. Or, if you prefer, just bang the NOT USEFUL key a few dozen times in advance and you will feel better.) 1. Ever since he became too old to star himself in his films Allen has been using (abusing) his power as Director to cast other actors who essentially "play" Woody Allen. If you can, watch the film a second time and note how Wilson looks and acts from scene to scene. Everything from the ambling awkward walk, to the unruly haircut, to the hand-gestures, to the clothing, to the perpetually surprised and/or ironic glances, is pure unadulterated Woody. (And this reviewer saw WHATS UP TIGER LILY in a theatre, for money, and has been watching Woody for a very very long time). The irony is not merely that no one notices this odd vanity, but it relaunched Wilson's career, so this was win-win 2. Woody makes more films than he should. This is not a put-down, just a fact. The key to the mystery is that Woody is one of the last living writer-directors in the game, so he can bring to the studio a very attractive financial package from the start, and his name in turn attracts other actors. Therefore to the studio he is a guaranteed money maker, with a low up-front, and he gets to make more films. Whether he should, or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Paris Advertisement Ever Filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie opens intentionally kitschy; it couldn't be more boring: travelogue shots of Paris in sunny weather, in rainy weather, and so forth. The movie then proceeds to move along a different dimension: temporal, in exploring the city's glorious past, especially regarding the many celebrities of arts and letters who used to live and create there in various epochs. There again, Woody Allen comes dangerously close to kitsch -- but safely avoids slipping into that quagmire every time yet another superstar is introduced in the most typical fashion that one might expect to encounter him or her. How do you show Hemingway as "virile", and calling Paris "a movable feast", when all of this is so well-known and has been thrashed to death in countless articles and books and movies? Well, Allen relies on his unusual, "fantasy" story, bringing a new twist to everything that is overly familiar, and on fabulous performances by the entire cast, including Corey Stoll as Hemingway. Stoll's portrayal of Hemingway is so true-to-life and convincing you forget it should be kitschy due to your having known all of this about Hemingway before; Stoll's portrayal of Hemingway is the real thing, and no caricature typical of a comedy movie -- except in the sense that life itself can often be seen as a caricature or comedy. An equally superb performance is given by Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein; or by the trio (or quintet) of impossibly bourgeois US visitors, led by fantastic Rachel McAdams as the main character's fiancée. Owen Wilson is outstanding and authentic as an imitation Woody Allen; he has Woody's intonation and nervous, confused enunciation down pat, so that in many moments, you could have sworn you're watching Woody Allen, the actor, himself. It doesn't hurt that Owen is more handsome than Allen ever was, which makes the story's romantic angle more believable. The movie offers very nice philosophic overtones, in Gil affirming, leaning on Faulkner's words, that "the past is not even past"; and realizing that everything except for the present day is illusionary. And so, the movie is not only a celebration of the physical location of Paris in various time periods -- but also a powerful affirmation of the illusionary nature of *time* itself. While at the same time being philosophic and fantasy (resembling Allen's _The Purple Rose of Cairo_ of 1985), the movie also manages to be vintage Woody Allen comedy, with many amusing situations and even a few that made me laugh out loud. Congratulations to Woody Allen on such youthful effervescence at his advanced age!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the Hopeless Romantic in All of Us.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hadn't watched a Woody Allen film for a while and so being the hopeless romantic that I am, I decided to give this one a shot. It delivered what it promised - a romantic, comedy, fantasy film. Casting Owen Wilson as the lead role threw me off at first, but he definitely rose to the challenge. This has always been (I believe) one of Allen's greatest gifts - that is, as an actor's director. He seems to be able to bring out the best in them.The only setback for some watching this film may be the various real life characters that Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) runs into who were supposedly hanging out in Paris during the 20's. Though this does not distract at all from the feel and flow of the film, some of the subtler humour may be missed. For me, this is not a Annie Hall or a Manhattan, but it definitely hints at much of Allen's spirit and wit I've come to love. The film went on to win both the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the Golden Globe Awards for Best Screenplay; and was nominated for three other Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Art Direction</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris is a charming, surprising, and light movie. It's about being lost, then finding your way by magic and complete serendipity.I think this Woody Allen piece works because of the overt innocence of Owen Wilson's character. The fact that he is trampled by his controlling wife, played by Rachel McAdams, adds to his likability. His strange encounters are put together in a very simple manner with very little fanfare. The result is that we are transported without us breaking our suspension of disbelief. The fact that Paris is almost timeless also helps.The sets, costumes, score, and editing are just right. The well chosen cast also gives us a solid performance.Overall, there's very little negative to say, except maybe that the conclusion lacks a little bit of substance. It's simply that the transition when he finally understand is dropped on us very suddenly and he cuts off his ties quickly. It's very mature and realistic, in a way, but slightly unsatisfying. More over, the beginning of the film is a bit rough, but you get in to the beat quite rapidly.It's good, see it if you like low-key productions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Midnight in Paris", Woody Allen's latest crowd-pleaser, is one of the most original films I've seen in eons. Ripe from Allen's raw imagination, the film captures Paris at its most majestic and the vivid characters blend into the tasty concoction of humor, romance and nostalgia. This one's a pure Woody Allen picture.Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is a Hollywood screenwriter who longs to write something more creative than mundane screenplays. While working on his first novel, he takes off on a trip to Paris with his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents. Gil's nostalgic about Paris in the 1920s. Tired of his lack of interest in most activities, Inez advises him to stick to screen writing. Inez wants to tour Paris in the company of her friends Paul (Michael Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda) but Gil isn't interested, and one night he takes off for a stroll when he runs into a couple of people on their way to a party. Slowly snapping out of his drunken self, he realizes that he's actually been transported back to the 1920s, where he encounters the people he idolizes : Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. In the 1920s Paris, he meets Adriana (Marion Cotillard) whom he falls in love with. Finally, Gil is left to face a big question : Does he want to live in Paris and meet people he idolizes everyday at midnight or spend the rest of his life doing what he's currently doing : writing films?Just because this is a Woody Allen film, you know that the city will play a big role in the story. It does and how! Cinematographer Darius Khondji's magical camera captures Paris in the most subtle way possible. But what's special about this film is the superb writing, an art which no one knows better than Allen. The writing can't be categorized as comical but the humor is woven into the script with great finesse. The film depends heavily on the writing and the colorful conversations between the characters liven up the film which would've otherwise slogged. Apart from the marvelously written dialog and characters, the performances by the whole cast are exemplary. This is easily Owen Wilson's best performance and he brings a quiet confidence to his role. One sequence in the film, where Gil attempts to steal a pair of earrings which belong to Inez only to run into her and her parents outside the door, is so sharply written and enacted that it could well be one of the best sequences Allen has directed in years.Though the film is innovative, it's devoid of a plot, however. A small plot could've turned this into a great film, but nothing happens except Gil going back to the 1920s every night and meeting up with his idols. That is the only issue I have with this otherwise fantastic film."Midnight in Paris" may not be a great film, but Allen's buoyant writing guarantees you an enjoyable 90 minutes. Seldom has a fantasy-adventure been this funny since Robert Zemeckis' miraculous 1985 film "Back to the Future". Way to go!</fullReview>

Yet it felt like a celebration of these figures and also introduced me to the wonders of alternative filmmaker Luis Bunuel which is certainly not a bad thing. As with many of his films if Allen doesn't play the lead role then whoever does seems to be doing an impression of him. Wilson did do this but had enough charisma and ability to shine through.

		<shortDescription>MIDNIGHT IN Paris-A Valentine to the City of Lights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most productive and sought after directors (by actors), Woody Allen, has made dozens of films that deal with the often turbulent relationships between men and women. Almost exclusively a New Yorker by heart, Allen has begun a renaissance of sorts with his exploration of European settings in particular Paris, France, and although his films of the past decade have varied in quality, his latest, Midnight in Paris, is a standout and represents the writer/director at the top of his game.Opening with a spectacular collage of vignettes, Paris never looked more enticing or romantic (Manhattan redux). At the fabled Giverny, Monet's source of inspiration, an American couple, Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) are engaged to be married and yet squabble constantly. An idealist, He is smitten by the culture and history of Paris, and one night while strolling the streets alone, a vintage car drives by and gives him a ride to a café. Gil realizes that he has been transported to 1920's Paris and is mingling with the celebrities of its heyday including some famous American ex-patriots like Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Gil is struggling with a novel and needs some advice, so who better than Gertrude Stein (amusingly played by Kathy Bates) to critique the manuscript? Upon his return to present day Paris, Gil wonders if it was all a dream but the scene repeats itself the next evening at midnight when he meets Pablo Picasso and the beautiful Adriana (Marion Cotillard), who captures Gil's fancy. Thinking that Gil has lost his mind, Inez begins to show interest in another male friend. Meanwhile Gil is obsessed with Adriana, and as the couple visits the Moulin Rouge, they find themselves transported to an even earlier, romantic period in French history. Gil finds that Adriana has her own ideas about life, and he is about to find true love in the unlikeliest of places.This is Allen in high gear and, though it does not necessarily rank among his best, it certainly is a throwback to his vintage period of Manhattan and the film that this will be most compared to The Purple Rose of Cairo, with its similar combination of wistful fantasy, storybook romance, and sophisticated comedy. You do wonder how Gil and Inez could ever become a couple considering how much they bicker about most everything. It's also interesting how Allen uses a bit of sleight of hand by focusing our attention on Gil and Adriana that we miss an obvious connection. Such is love.Gil is a surrogate for Allen's inner voice. (One could even picture a younger Allen actually performing the role.) He is also a romantic in contrast to Inez's friends who are intellectuals. As for Paris, it plays a supporting role as its landmarks are adoringly featured throughout the film without detracting from the characters or story. It is clear Allen is smitten with the City of Lights as he was with his home base of New York City.There are some amusing scenes including the fate of a private investigator hired to follow Gil and ends up caught up in a different time running for his life. When Gil listens to old Cole Porter recordings or sees Picasso paintings in a museum, the joke is that he actually has met these men in real life! In another scene, Gil suggests to a young director, Luis Bunuel, a film idea which is the plot to The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie that he will make many years later (and win an Oscar). As Salvador Dali, Adrien Brody hams it up to great effect in a brief scene.Sure Allen has made some good films recently like Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, but it's been a long while since he made anything as imaginative, comedic, and romantic at the same time. Vive le Woody Allen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly charming, too often cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a coincidence: two of the films nominated for the 2012 Academy Awards Best Picture award--The Artist and Midnight in Paris--are magic-realism tributes from France to America and vice versa. The Artist does this elegantly, with a brilliantly original take on the classic riches-to-rags-to-riches redemption motif. Ironically, while fawning over Paris, Woody Allen had to spoil his movie by larding it with clichés about superficial, materialistic Californians. While The Artist was a pure and innocent celebration of Hollywood, Woody Allen is a typical young American effacing himself before superior European sophistication. Really quite sad, because the premise was clever, and charmingly carried out during those segments when the hero was soiréeing with historical cultural greats. I also love Paris, and also suffer the recurring fantasy of just simply...staying, maybe to write my book. My experience has been that haughty Parisians really are disarmed by Jerry Lewis-like Americans like me and Owen Wilson. ;) Call me another self-effacing young American, but a French director could have pulled off Midnight in Paris with grace and subtle humor while retaining his dignity. Irony noted.</fullReview>

As someone that enjoys writing myself, the story of a writer could easily connect with me, or it could have annoyed me. Luckily it did the former. Wilson plays a Hollywood screenwriter that wants to work on his novel while in Paris. Unfortunately, and I never thought I'd say this, he is engaged to Rachel McAdams. She has become comfortable with his lifestyle, and doesn't want him to give everything up for something he may struggle with. WHile in Paris they meet up with Michael Sheen, playing a pedantic ass to perfection. I just wanted to cave his head in, and Wilson played off him exactly the way I would have done. Sheen's so called knowledge is the sauce of humour during the early half of the movie, as he gets his facts mixed up. Wilson soon winds up in the 1920's and meets his own literary heroes. Finally feeling appreciated, he spends every evening with his new found friends. This is certainly a film about writing, art, creativity, and being accepted. But it also goes further, looking at how all past is glamorised to a certain degree. This was a lovely film, with my only gripe being McAdams' character. She was simply so unappealing, that I had no idea as to why herself and Wilson were together. There was no chemistry, and not even a hint at anything resembling love. Luckily, such a poor relationship made it easier to accept some of Wilsons' actions. A great lot of co-starring roles are filled out by A-Listers having a lot of fun as classic artists from the past. Midnight in Paris, really is for those that love to walk in the rain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paris never looked more beautiful and colourful to me (As if I have been there). Still, one has to appreciate the way Woody Allen captured the city and by doing so enraptured the viewers. The opening montage was so beautiful that one cannot help but agree with Gil Pender's (Owen Wilson) decision of moving there. At the start of the movie, we see our protagonist in a dilemma. The dilemma, then, seemed to be between choosing two cities, hence two lifestyles. But it was eventually between doing what one want to do, to create something which they strive for, and to accept other's opinions and have a relatively simpler life. Woody Allen created this perspective of Gil Pender, along with the romantic angle of course. This, I believe, is what Allen is master at. The blending of romance and fantasy is fantastic. The story is simple. Pender, after a disappointed evening with his wife and her pseudo-intellectual friends, wanders in the street of Paris and at midnight gets picked up by a couple of people who turns out to be from the 1920s, the Golden Age where Pender always wanted to be and live life. There he meets his literature and art idols. The story gets unfolded in an engaging way.The performances are appropriate and good, as one expects from an ensemble like this. I really liked Owen Wilson's performance here. He managed to reflect the innocence of his character quite well. Rachel McAdams depicted her character's superficiality well; Michael Sheen, always a fine actor, portrayed his character with finesse. All the cameos in different timezone by various actors were great, especially Adrien Brody's, Kathy Bates' and Corey Stoll's ones. But it was Marion Cotillard who gorgeously shone in her character.The cinematography and Art Direction deserves all the accolades and plaudits too, especially the way it helped to create the golden age of literature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen for the masses - and it works!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent movie... While it follows the same self-portrait that Allen did in other movies (with Owen Wilson surprisingly playing Allen well), it brings a lighter atmosphere, laughs, entertainment, romance that will please the audiences around the world, having as a background the most loved city and several of the appreciated and controversial artists who lived there.Rachel McAdams does a good job as the empty-headed fiancée, and Owen shows what each of us went through at some point in our lives: the feeling that we could be happier somewhere else or with someone else. He falls in love with the city, the artists and finally with a woman who intrigues and stimulates him in a way he can't find at present times.Great cameos by excellent actors (Adrien Brody is great). If Allen wanted to do a movie that was faithful to his roots, and bring fun to the audience while making his point in an artsy way, he certainly hit jackpot! I still prefer some other movies of his but this one does bring more entertainment!The message I got at the end is that no place is better than where we are, as long as our demons are well resolved and we can find there the things and people we love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a fun and enjoyable experience. The movie provides great atmosphere of Paris and really makes the viewer feel as if they are in the roaring twenties.Owen Wilson is the perfect actor for this role with his unassuming demeanor and funny wit. Rahel McAdams plays the uptight wife perfectly. The plot is very entertaining and the movie was never dull. The movie conveys a strong message about life in general and also provides comedic relief. It was great seeing Picasso, Hemingway, and others out and about in Paris. Everyone should check it out immediately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris is a very imaginative and entertaining film about that you should appreciate what you have in the present. The film is very nicely filmed and it shows much of the city's beautiful surroundings. It's a really fun film filled with wonderful music and the actors were really good. During the film there was a lot of funny situations that Gil (Owen Wilson) ended up in and I could identify myself with the character many times throughout the movie. Although I thought the movie was predictable I didn't think it was any less boring. I recommend the movie to anyone who just wants to watch a nice and fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually thought this movie was quite entertaining and had some rather funny parts. I was "forced" to watch WA films growing up and could/never have understood his appeal. I don't think any of his films are very funny and I've seen about a half dozen (parents love him). This film however appeals to a wide variety. Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdems aren't the only appeal but they certainly do help with the appeal of the movie. They played their parts perfectly but the content of the movie also should appeal to different generations and people of varying degrees of intellectual and humorous levels. I was not familiar with all of the characters but its not important to the overall storyline. Overall the movie was very entertaining and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Germans are saying "mittendrin statt nur dabei sein", i.e. "being deep- in instead of only there nearby". Movie drags you in and somehow you do not want it stops, when movie is over, you want more. Or at least that you want by yourself to explore the same locations or feel same feelings the main character was having, when you will be next time in Paris. Even more, you want to experience it as soon as possible. Paris is the most beautiful city in the world, it is full of history, lost souls, sorrows, passions - this is hard to oppose. What could (even though a recognized filmmaker but comparing him to Paris quite small guy like Woody Allen) tell us more then what we already know ? Far from being a Woody Allen fan this movie drew my attention. Of course you cannot miss and avoid typical neurotic speeches and characteristic behavior of the main character, who actually impersonates Woody himself, namely Owen Wilson acts like being Woody and not Owen, the actor. Looking at my remarks or resents to this movie, this would be the first one. The second one is the huge differences in characters of the couple who wants to get married. Why they would marry if they are sooo different ? Paris supposed somehow to contribute to this by enlarging already giant gap among both, I also understand the point yet this is shown rather weak, it makes less sense. And last remark would be a "cruel" movie ending, I would call it relatively rude discontinuation of the path that Woody carefully and gently built throughout the movie. Thinking it twice this is not necessarily a bad thing yet it leaves you a bit bitter taste when leaving the cinema. I only decide to write few words when I liked the movie, so ...Thumbs up for the movie, for the idea, for the acting and ... I am fully recommending it !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen directs his first digitally enhanced movie without losing the emotion while leaving the audience with a distinct aftertaste. A young writer finds himself in Paris with his wealthy inlaws and his soon to be wife typical American heiress. He has dreams, romance, aspirations to find his inspiration in a flat in Paris?.One midnight he gets absorbed in an illusion, he becomes a protagonist in a world of nostalgia, dreams, in an artificial temporary fantasy with beautiful sounds,vintellect, romance, intensity, excitement?.The sunrise brings him back to his wedding plans and reflecting on life and decisions?.A movie to watch in a cosy afternoon.?Owen Wilson, excels for one more time in getting the right balance between being naive and eventually true to yourself and others. Marion Cottilard, a 1920s' diva, as in le Petit Mouchoirs, she has a certain je ne sais quoi, she doesn't fails to be effortlessly attractive, powerfully captivating by her sincerity and self confidence. A movie that makes you feel like drinking red wine, listening to Cole's voice in a vinyl record and singing to yourself?Let's Do It, let's Fall In Love?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just enough of an intellectual angle to make it interesting, but really just a fun movie. It's fun to think of the what-ifs of meeting the bygone's famous, and to ponder the question: is life really greener on the other side of the time-continuum? and does everyone of every era feel this way? I loved the characterizations of past's characters -- just the way I'd pictured them (except maybe Pablo). Marion Cotillard absolutely devours the camera until there is no camera between you and her. You are invited into her presence, and it is just her and you and you are feeling and hearing what the receiving character is hearing and feeling. She is luminous.Weaknesses: I thought Wilson's performance was good, but there was no reason for him to be in this role other than star-power. Someone else could have given this role a new dimension, and perhaps the movie a new dimension as well. Same with McAdam's. I think she is a great actress, but maybe only took this part for a chance to be in a Woody movie. Even a one dimensional character needs more than one dimension, but still, I don't think the problem here was with her performance, as much as with casting. Just my opinion.Overall, I liked it very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine bit of magic from Mr.Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had my own Woody Allen 'moment' when going to see this movie early in the afternoon. I arrived 30 seconds late ? I always try to avoid the ads ? and in the darkness mistook an elderly gentleman's groin for the arm of my seat ? twice! He did'nt complain the first time so I assumed I must be in the right place. I groped my way to the seat in front of him whispering apologies along the way and sat while the cinematic sun rose. I left delighted at having seen - at long last ? a marvellous new film from Mr.Allen, delighted also at not having been jumped or beaten up. I think it would be pedantic to fault historical inaccuracies regarding the authors or painters encountered by Owen Wilson's character, begrudging to deny the pleasure of the turns given by Cotillard, Brody, and others, and simply mean to ignore the love and intelligence involved in the making of this film ? that magic we recognise from Annie Hall, through The Purple Rose of Cairo, to Deconstucting Harry. Because this film, after all the dross since those great Allen films that we admire (I assume) , has that quality that would (as somebody said) 'send you'.... And that's all this film tries to be about, sending, or 'transporting' you ? us. It's marvellous. I'll probably go and see it again, though I'll arrive a little earlier next time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure at first with this movie but when I started watching it I was hooked. I have only seen a few Woody Allen film but this one is definitely one of my favourite so far.Owen Wilson was perfect playing Gil. On the other hand, McAdams was completely unbearable playing her part. I have seen her act better than this but I think she was miscast. Michael Sheen was totally underused here. He is such a great actor and I think Allen could have done more with his character. Cottilard was perfect and so believable. I think if anything she stole the show as usual. What I love about this movie is the storyline itself. There is something so authentic about it but takes you to pure art fantasy. Seeing Paris through this movie just makes you want to go there and get on the magical car at midnight and meet all the world renowned artist from the past. This movie is a must see. Wood Allen almost never disappoint. A movie that's fun and and mystical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen at his blissful best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening of 'Midnight in Paris' is not promising. The 41st film from Woody Allen begins with a montage that practically revels in the world of cliché with its depiction of Paris ? there's people sitting outside cafés, some smooth jazz, flower shops, art galleries, berets, affluence, the Eiffel Tower; the only thing missing is a man in a striped top carrying a baguette. Then it's only ten minutes before Carla Bruni shows up. Essentially, it's an opening that is the polar opposite to the beginning of 'La Haine'. After this gorgeously-shot montage which felt almost like a tourist advertisement, I was uncertain about how the remainder of the film would pan out. Thankfully, any worry quickly evaporated as I found myself irresistibly charmed by it.In line with Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' it sees the prolific filmmaker once again venturing into fantastical territory, as Gil (Owen Wilson), a Hollywood screenwriter holidays to Paris with his beau, Inez (Rachel McAdams) in the hope of successfully completing his debut novel, only to find himself magically whirled back in time, coincidentally to his favourite era ? the Roaring Twenties. Here, he gets swept up in meeting a host of significant figures from the Parisian Café Society.These twenties-set scenes were the shining highlights in all-round wonderful film. Tom Hiddleston's F. Scott Fitzgerald is tailored and well-spoken with an affinity for the phrase "old sport". Alison Pill's Zelda Fitzgerald is unpredictable and somewhat uncontrollable with a fondness for alcohol. Corey Stoll's Ernest Hemmingway spouts profound literary advice while retaining love for a good fisticuff ("You box?"). Adrian Brody's Salvador Dalí is expectedly eccentric and insists of the proper pronunciation of his name ("Da-lee!"). The movie is full of other such people that appear only briefly, but if like me, you share Gil's love for Café Society culture, you'll struggle not to smile when they show up. I never really thought much of Owen Wilson as an actor, but here - essentially inhabiting the Woody Allen role - he proves to be a charming leading main and much like the film itself, very likable, because even though 'Midnight in Paris' is undeniably clichéd in its portrayal of Paris and the various historical figures, this all adds to the delightful charms of the movie. It is very light and even frothy entertainment, but this is a cracking little film that left a huge smile on my face. To use that saying Allen loves so dearly, it's "amusing". But y'know what? It's actually more than that, it's pure brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film which I will not tell you much about, storywise, because you need to be surprised when you see it, as I was. On a cold winter day I grabbed a few dvds from the local bookmobile and this is one of them. Figuring if Woody Allen' name is on something, I probably won't hate it. Au Contraire! I loved it! This film starts out with a picture-post card view of Paris and the film warms up from there. Mr. Allen shows why he is one of our finest filmmakers. In an interview, he says that when starting out, he just had the title with no story to go with it. What a neat story he concocted! I'd like to tell you more, but that would only spoil the fun for you. See this feel-good movie and see if you don't, well, just feel good by the time it is over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is there to say about Midnight in Paris? Hmmmmm? Wait a minute... Am I writing a review for Midnight in Paris or Lost in Translation? That is why this movie is not so original. So let's take a look shall we? Both take place in a different land/foreign country.(It does not matter how you got there.)They both have a relationship in development. And neither one can ultimately happen. Bob-wife and kids and as for Charolette-a husband. Gil-to be engaged and for Marion Cotillard-who ever she was going around with. And as for Inez,whoever Marion was with, Bob's family and Charolette's husband: nobody ever found out. I do not believe anyone even had any suspicions either. Also with the new relationships: nothing major happened between them. Midnight in Paris needed more action/events and less walking or sitting and talking about whatever. Now that I have thought about it...was all the to do with Gil's book necessary? He loves Paris. But didn't we find that out by him saying him and Inez should move to Paris and whatever happened during his time traveling? A nostalgia shop sells older stuff? Did Woody Allen actually call a pawn shop that? Lost in Translation came out years before Midnight in Paris so how could two very similar movies both win Best Original Screenplay? Why did MIP even get nominated for Best Picture and Director when how UNoriginal and boring it is?I wonder if it has anything to do with the stuff that I heard about the Oscar board is full of old white guys. What is Woody Allen? Old and white. I wouldn't give LIT the highest of praise either but LIT is more original and better. Oh...and my apologies if you have not seen LIT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another cute, but somewhat over-rated, Allen film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen, like most directors, has had some moments on pure perfection ("Match Point") and pure garbage ("Shadows and Fog"), but as much as I have the utmost respect for the man, I wouldn't say I am a fan, I just have merely loved a couple of his movies, hated a few others, and there are many I am sure I haven't seen or are somewhat indifferent about.However, "Midnight in Paris," for sure, despite being one of his most commercially successful films ever, is not one of his best works. Despite his Golden Globe win for Best Screenplay, this is not the best Screenplay of the year, nor is it one of Allen's best. And despite his Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical, Owen Wilson's performance is nothing more than acceptable. However, despite the inclusion of Rachel McAdams, I found this to be an alright little film.Wilson plays Gil, a screenplay writer who decides he wants to venture into more serious literature and write a novel. While in Paris with his new fiancée, Inez, and her parents, Gil begins to question how he really feels about his future wife, played by the always-annoying McAdams, after getting slightly drunk and being abandoned on the streets of Paris by her and her friends only to be randomly picked up by a strange taxi just after midnight, transporting him to Paris in the 20s...a period Gil has always fantasized about.While transported, he meets the likes of F.Scott Fitzgerald, Josephine Baker, Cole Porter, Salvador Dali, Ernest Hemingway, among others and even gets his novel critiqued by Gertrude Stein, all the while falling for a woman he meets named Adriana (played by the lovely Oscar-winning Marion Cotillard)...and thus leading him to wonder how he truly feels about the overbearing, non-too-supportive Inez."Midnight in Paris" is a cute little film, just like many Allen films, but is hardly a terribly significant cinematic entry and thus, I am not so sure the numerous accolades it has been given, including the Golden Globe, are really deserving. It's a fine film but, for me, ultimately forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris is about a writer in a trip to Paris with his fiancée and his future in-laws. He has a kind of aloof personality and being in Paris gives him the chance to change his style and he is trying to write a book with an intellectual content and get rid of his previous works which were successful for the Hollywood screen, but they did not satisfying him professionally. Now he is getting mixed in loopholes of time and space so he is in 1920 not anymore in 2010 and meets Hemingway, Picasso, Dali and many other artists of that time from where he gets some kind of understanding how to write a good book. Now he is in love with a beautiful Parisian from that time, and he is not capable to understand why this is happening to him. Finally it was happening because he was not happy with his time and space, the life he was living and so on, at least when he understood this he was no longer capable to go back in time, it was like a magic hour, and he was capable to live his life in his time not with his fiancée, but with Gabrielle the vendor of books, art and old recording LPs he just met the other day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Writer-director Woody Allen makes one of the best movies in his career, after changing cinema with his award-winning motion pictures from "Annie Hall" to "Hannah and Her Sisters". Now, one of cinema's smartest directors has made a movie showing the beauty and grace of the city of Paris, with an all-star cast including Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, Carla Bruni, and Michael Sheen. The movie is set in the middle of Paris, where Wilson plays a screenwriter on holiday, with a beautiful fiancée, distracted by the magical experiences of the beautiful city. Until he discovers the true magic of the city, every night at midnight, when he travels back in time to the era of the 20s and discovers the magic beneath when he meets his life-long artistic and literary heroes, and falls in love with Marion Cotillard as Adriana. This movie also brings a heartwarming message about if we had created a more brighter and creative society, life would be much sweeter. Director Woody Allen has provided one of his best movies to date. He has made such a well-written script with comedy, charm, and charisma. The casting ensemble is something to die for. Owen Wilson deserves total Oscar consideration for his excellent performance, Rachel McAdams was just awesome, and Marion Cotillard was just plain lovely. Every moment is plain laughable, from Wilson discovering the 20s every midnight, to acting like a maniac when talking about meeting famous icons from the past. Those moments are handled in such a unique way, and those laughs are deserving. It was safe to say that this movie wasn't a sequel, remake, or reboot. But it's an original romantic comedy, and it's truly entertaining and excellent. This is a movie with a hilarious premise, an excellent cast, and a smart director like Woody Allen. "Midnight in Paris" is by far one of the best movies of 2011, or probably any other year. Woody Allen deserves Oscar consideration for writing and directing this masterpiece, and this will be a nominee for the Best Picture of 2011. "Midnight in Paris", in my review, "a smart and unique romantic masterpiece".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the year's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen hasn't been having a good time when it comes to critics lately. It seems like whenever he does a movie that takes place in a different city, it does better. Lets see, he did Match Point in England, which did good. Then his next two films took place in England, and didn't do well(I still liked them). Then he did Vicky Cristina Barcelona, in Barcelona, and that did well. Then his next two films took place in New York and England, and didn't do well either.His latest film, Midnight in Paris, did do well. It's getting a lot of Oscar buzz, and I couldn't wait to see it. Well now I have, and I will tell you it's his best film since Vicky Cristina Barcelona. I really enjoyed his last movie, You will meet a tall dark stranger, and not so much for the film before that, Whatever works. Midnight in Paris is a wonderful and real film, even if it's premise is magically based.The film revolves around Gil and Inez(Owen Wilson and Rachel Macadams), a couple traveling with family in Paris. Gil, an aspiring writer,loves the city. While his fiancé couldn't care less. She is more fascinated with the things that Paul(Martin Sheen), a know it all moron, says about Paris. But at midnight, Gil discovers a time portal to the 1920's, where he meets famous dead artists like Ernest Hemingway, Cole Porter, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and gets involved in their lives.Gil also meets Adrianna(Marion Cotillard), who has had an affair with Picasso and now Hemingway, and is possibly falling for Gil. Meanwhile, back in 2011, everyone is starting to get a little suspicious of just what Gil is doing every night.Midnight in Paris is sweet and increasingly entertaining by the second. The performances, especially by, though I don't know his actual name, the guy who plays Hemmingway, is marvelous. Every moment with him and Alison Pill is very entertaining.It's one of those movies that you won't be able to stop thinking about for a while. I know because I am one of them. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it. I'm so glad I bought it because I can't wait to watch it again.It's the year's best romantic comedy. It's a rare one where you actually fall in love with the movie.This is been a great year for romantic comedy. We' ve had this one, Crazy stupid love and Friends with benefits, all very enjoyable films. But I feel that this one comes out on top. It's one of the year's best.A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HK Neo Reviews: Midnight in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even the bravest fans of Woody Allen will say that he misses his mark for a good decade already. However in his 41st film, Allen shows us the qualities that make us fall in love with him for. Witty dialogue, cynical nature, feeling out of place in society, life and everything in general, Midnight in Paris is a perfect dose of dream, reality and fiction. Allen's films are never for everyone and despite my nativity of the works of 1920s artists, the film simply intrigue me immensely. Owen Wilson impresses me and every minute movement reminds me of Woody Allen and in particular revokes one of his greatest achievement in Annie Hall. Marion Cotillard is simply breathtakingly beautiful, with brilliant on-screen presence and single-handedly lifts the film above its genre conventions. Cotillard is one amazing actress and it's difficult not to see why Wilson is falling head over heels over her. All in all, Midnight in Paris reminds those of us who feel as though we belong in another era. Then again at the same time, allude to us that people always get carried away about the past generation achievements of the Einsteins and the Shakespeares, when they themselves are the ones who can become the next Steve Jobs. As Allen puts it: "That's what the present is. It's a little unsatisfying because life is unsatisfying." At least the film is satisfying? Neo rates it 9/10.- www.thehkneo.com</fullReview>

For an hour and a half, we see the main character, played by Owen Wilson, enter a different world and realizing that that world might be better than his own reality. And that, of course, could only happen in Paris. It's an easy movie to watch, it doesn't makes us think too much; it makes us dream, just like the protagonist. Wilson isn't a sublime actor but gives us an easily likable character. A simple writer, he feels he was born at the wrong time and only wants the opportunity to live in another age. We can find some similarities with the seventies' Woody Allen... the way he walks, talks, the gestures... Maybe Allen intended that, by casting Wilson. Rachel McAdams plays his wife; arrogant, shallow, a bit naive, who isn't able to picture a a life beyond the one she knows. Michael Sheen plays McAdams ex-teacher, and it is when the couple crosses paths with Sheen's character that the incompatibilities between them become absolutely evident. But it's in the 'parallel' world of Wilson that we find the real interesting characters, with simple but effective performances by established actors, from Marion Cotillard to Kathy Bates, and 5 minutes of pure gold with Adrien Brody, as Dalí; and also good performances by less known actors such Corey Stoll or Allison Pill. Don't forget to check Carla Bruni's appearance, in a simple but charming role, that fits her quite well.Far from Allen's golden era, Midnight in Paris still scores by being different and original, which is something we can't always say about his movies. A picture with beautiful images and a plot capable of keeping us minimally interested for an hour and a half, but that does not go any further.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not particularly looked forward to this film as I am no fan of Owen and especially not in a romantic comedy as I thinks he is not suitable for comedy or romance. But that's my view, I'm elderly and grew up with Woody Allen so I'm biased. To make this film a much greater success Woody should have found a guy of similar build and personality like himself. I loved the music and the settings, the general conversation and I ask myself, once Woody Allen is gone what is left to enjoy.Woody is the only one who can make an everyday comedy stand out and it's sheer lunacy that he has not been showered with Oscars, the guy is a genius. So go and enjoy this latest masterpiece by the one and only Woody Allen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A frustrated American writer (Owen Wilson playing a role Allen would have played himself 30 years ago)on his hols in Paris with his obnoxious, materialistic fiancé finds his midnight strolls turning into time travel back to Paris' golden years of the 1920s and the 1880s and along the way meets all manner of artistic and literary greats from Paris' past such as Dali, Scott-Fitzgerald, Hemingway,Metisse etc and in the doing so realises that the past isn't as important as now. Both Wilson and Marion Cotillard shine in their roles as does Michael Sheen as a pedantic and ultimately sleazy friend of Wilson's fiancé. With great acting and beautifully filmed its a wonderful postcard of Paris now and in the past... 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where has he been - Woody Allen? I thought he'd retired but I would just like to think he was having a rest before bringing out this gem of a movie and it is a gem. Well up there and surpassing Annie Hall The main protagonist Gil (Owen Wilson) plays his role superbly (as well as the great cast that Woody Allen always seems to find and take from roles you had normally seen them in to roles you would never imagine they could perform)- he essentially has come to Paris with his fiancé and her parents who are as materialistic about life as well as being insincere. Gil wants inspiration to write a book and his fiancé just wants to buy half of France! But at Midnight in Paris Gil is transported back in time to meet all his idols writers and musicians and painters and he re thinks his book and re thinks his life as a consequence. As the story develops nicely before our eyes we see how he struggles with his present relationship and the one he imagines in the past. The film has everything humour, poignant moments and above all is thought provoking. Simply Woody Allen at his best a possible Oscar Candidate and a Tapestry of brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris - Reality becomes Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I wasn't sure what to think. As the movie started out beautifully filmed, great musical score. But almost like a romantic comedy that had gone very wrong.As the film progressed, something magical happened. Things started changing, Owen Wilson descending into his writing career and engaged to hid fiancé - and his dream of seeing Paris in the 1920's came true.From this moment on the film is pure brilliance, with Owen playing a fantastic yet whimsical writer - that at midnight in Paris. Is transported to the golden age of Paris in 1920. Along the way he meets greats like Hemingway, Picasso, and Dali. All supported by a really strong cast of actors, and a beautiful script and cinematography.It becomes his alternate reality. But as the way it's portrayed, it is indeed actually happening. His reality and fiction get intertwined in a Pan's Labyrinth'esque type of fantasy. The movie is a pleasure to watch and don't let the romantic part scare you, I won't spoil anything but lets just say there a quite a few twists and turns along the way.I think almost anyone with appreciation for good movies, cinematography, writing, or just something heart warming interesting and outside the box will really enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Allen's best film, but far from his worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is a big step up from "A Tall Dark Stranger," a Woody film I found one of the most pointless cinematic works I've ever seen. This actually had a plot, some character development and an ending, though an awfully pat one.Since it is Allen, especially latter day Allen, it is not about subtlety. It starts out with many slow shots of the beauties of Paris (no slums, traffic, etc. included; Allen deals with rich folk in this film). The parents representing insular America are Republicans, put down anything French, express a preference for things American (including wine but with the exception of furniture), and ?the film makes a big point about this ?spend an evening in Paris going to a forgettable American film (it would have really been funny if it turned out to be a Woody Allen film, but that would have diminished Allen's point about what insular rubes most Americans are).Allen's decision to make the time travel in the film real, versus imagined, as evidenced in a book, seemed a questionable one to me, but a scene where a private detective ends up way back in time was probably the funniest part of the entire film. Lucky for the film's characters, when they do go back in time no one seems to notice their strange clothes and, more importantly, the restaurants and bars seem to accept money of the future.The acting is mixed. Owen Wilson is a likable character, though I had a difficult time buying him as a literary expert. He came across as a naive, not-well-traveled county bumpkin the big city, even when supposedly commiserating one-on-one with the likes of Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald (each time greeting them with a "Gosh, you're . . ." While he was surprised to meet important historical characters, the idea of him traveling through time seemed almost normal to him. Kurt Fuller is an experienced, talented actor but seemed to be doing the same shtick he does on the TV sit-com "Better With You." Rachel McAdams plays a rather shrewish woman you are not meant to sympathize with any more than with her father. Carla Bruni is okay as a tour guide but obviously was used because she's First Lady of France (iAllen sucking up to the French??).All in all, a pleasant and diverting film. The ending will surprise few people but that applies to many films. It's not a film whose lessons you will ponder for long after leaving the cinema, but neither should you feel like you wasted your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant and underrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are numerous themes and layers in this film, without a doubt, which is why I loved it so much. It is one of those films that you either understand or miss completely. At the surface, yes, it is about the appreciation of the present and all that, as well as the affinity of like-minded people to, well, like-minded people. But there is more to it. At the bare bones of this film is the criticism of the pathetic pop-culture, Hollywoodesque intellectually-degraded world in which we reside, where the romantic, deep and profound elements of life have been left behind in some golden age. We live in a world in which hardly anybody appreciates good art: a world in which hardly anyone on the street these days has read Bulgakov, John Webster, Joyce, Dumas or Cervantes (let alone heard of them) but has watched Hangover II last week. A world in which some people actually believe that films like Batman are in the top 200 films of all time when, really, they aren't even in the top 1,000. There are French films from the 1980s that are ten times better than any superhero film.We live in a world in which shallowness is perpetuated in the media. A world in which we have completely lost touch with each other, where conversations start with "Hi" and end in "LOL". A world in which films are expected not to be predictable, not to have clichés, to have twists, or to focus on characters certain members of the audience would want to know about. And in such expectations, the point of the film is missed completely.You think literature is boring? You think art is boring? That simply means -you- are boring.This is about Gil: a man who is with a woman that, despite being from the same country, is of a completely different culture: today's pop culture. His fiancée would be the kind of woman who would go to a gallery just to say that she went there, to learn "facts" just to say that she is educated, to have books on the shelf to show that she's "well read" when in fact she probably wouldn't read a single one (and if she did she'd never really "get it" anyway), to do "yoga" just because it's "in", and in that mindset would never gain the depth, the romance, the humanity of Gil -- a man who is torn between two worlds, who realizes by far the most important and profound artistic worlds which humanity ought to embrace but fail to do so because of laziness, complete lack of appreciation, and the tragic shallowness surrounding them.So, to quickly address some of the retarded reviewers that completely missed the point: this film is making fun of people like you, which is perhaps why you do not realize it. Complaints about "Predictability": ---&gt; Yes, it is predictable, but that is not the point. Complaints about "Not dwelling deeper into the lives and personalities of the historical characters and just sort of passing them by" ---&gt; That is not a flaw. You're missing the point. If you haven't realized it, the film is not about those historical figures. The film is about Gil's journey. Complaints about "the detective and how he gets left behind..etc"That is not a flaw and not superfluous to the message of the film. In fact, it is central to the message. Anyone who says otherwise clearly does not understand the message. Go to the library, start exploring books, start exploring the past... and you will likely end up getting so deeply lost in them, lost in time, that it might become impossible to retrieve you. The final word: ---------------Watch it. If you do not like the film: stop and take a year before you watch it again. Read good, classic books and study them. Watch plays. Go the theater. Read authors like Chekhov until you feel at your very core the sorrow of the characters, until you really learn to feel -- not just interpret. Then watch the film again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I picked this DVD up in a backstreet, but when I got it home Paris Hilton was nowhere to be seen! Swindlers, I tell you! Okay, okay, this is Woody Allen's latest and again, another 'return to form'. My sister said it was delightful, but she had no expectations. Any UK guy might recall a BBC comedy called Goodnight Sweetheart from the 1980s in which a young man steps into a pub and finds himself back in the 1940s, where he meets and falls in love with a belle from back then, committing a kind of time-travellers adultery. This has a similar theme only it's an American Owen Wilson (who looks not wholly unlike Nicholas Lyndhurst) who gets in a Rolls and finds himself back in Paris in the 1920s, his ideal time.It's a decent premise. I didn't take to the film however. It has lovely opening shots of Paris, but the cinematography is very plain and grainy and Woody's style is very point and shoot throughout. Don't expect much depth here. Wilson falls into the trap of just imitating Woody, like most his leading men do, and it's a distraction. Actually, I thought Johnny Galecki from The Big Bang Theory would have been excellent in the role, as he has real comic chops and I'm not sure Wilson does really.Michael Sheen (Blair) turns up as a pompous bore, the sort you see in Allen's films sometimes, and gets plaudits for being wholly unlike his Blair persona. Initially you find yourself thinking that talk of him being a Bond villain is really not wide of the mark at all. Until, that is, you realise that he's doing another of his impersonations - it's a young Anthony Hopkins. Again, Sheen is not bad, but doesn't really nail the humour of the situation, though it gets indulgent audience titters.The scenes where our hero finds himself in 1920s Paris lack authenticity and is all too broadly drawn for my taste, with Hemingway seeming a real bore and the whole thing might as well be set in a 1920s themed speakeasy bar in Shoreditch. All these literary legends of the time take to Wilson, though he seems to bring nothing to the party at all, has nothing of interest to say to them. And you never get much sense of why he might feel disillusionment for the time: wouldn't a neurotic like Allen realise that they never washed their hands after using the john back then? What about the casual racism of the time? The smoke, the dirt in the air? It's all rather superficially done. As Hemingway says at one point, it doesn't matter what the story is, so long as it's told well, and I don't think this was told very well.Carla Brunei puts in a good cameo, she's actually quite good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing first time round but I fancy seeing it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote the other day that a mediocre Woody Allen comedy is still a good comedy by any other standards (or something like that) and I stand by that, but this is only part comedy. I mean, you wouldn't call Sleeper a sci-fi comedy, it's a normal comedy set in the future, and you wouldn't call Curse of the Jade Scorpion a crime comedy (although it parodies detective films) or Love and Death a historical comedy, they're very witty, mildly absurd, satirical comedy films with different settings.Anyway, this isn't just a comedy in a different setting, it's a fantasy romance with comic elements, a weak lead character and dependent to a great degree on Americans' views of Paris. The comedy isn't always the main concern, the fantasy setting is a bit stereotyped but there's a twist or two, the romance is romantic enough, suspense is kept up well, Owen Wilson is OK but not a good enough actor to make up for the lack of snappy dialogue, the dullness of the character and being vastly and madly outperformed by a certain Mr Hemingway and a Snr Dali, among others. It seems to my European eyes that this is aimed again at US viewers, rather than just being Allen's personal vision. The 'Americans Abroad' perspective just doesn't work outside the US.Worth seeing but don't expect to laugh out loud more than 3 times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly charming, beautifully filmed romantic classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the Woody Allen movies in all the art-house theaters in the world, this one is one of his truest, most engaging, most satisfying, and most existential. It's a gigantic treat to lovers of literature everywhere, but even if you don't know Toulouse-Lautrec from 2Pac, you should truly love either the tantalizing romantic angles or the mystery/fantasy underlying them all.Allen is getting too old to be playing himself in these movies, so the task falls to Owen Wilson (who doesn't have to change anything to do an Allen impression). Wilson plays Gil, a Hollywood writer engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), and they're tagging along with Inez's parents on their vacation to Paris. But while Inez is enamored with pretty, shiny objects and appearances, Gil instantly falls in love with the soul of Paris and wants nothing more than to wander its streets, particularly at night, to soak in its ambiance and perhaps get inspired to work on his burgeoning first novel. After all, such literary greats as Hemingway, Eliot, Fitzgerald, and Stein roamed those very streets; perhaps what they saw will help Gil.Now, the following is not a spoiler in least. A quick look at the list of characters should indicate a change in venue for Gil. One evening, a little drunk from a wine tasting, Gil sits on a church's steps; as the clock chimes midnight, an old car pulls up, exhorting him to come with them. Where? Why to the Fitzgeralds' of course. This leads Gil down quite the path of self-examination and inspiration.Along the way, Gil meets many of his literary heroes and discovers a little bit about what makes them tick. He's even able to make return visits by going to the same place at the same time. Of course, Inez doesn't believe him and is increasingly concerned with buying antique furniture with her bossy, snobby mother. The chasm between man and almost-wife widens.There are several reasons to recommend this movie. As usual, Allen's handpicked cast is up to its tasks. Some of these actors are known quantities to many people, but some are not; either way, they imbue their own characters with such a sense of reality that it's easy to imagine that actor truly is that icon. They deal not in caricatures but in realizations.Another huge plus is the way that the storyline is set up. On the one hand, you have the conflict between Inez and Gil, and on another you have his cathartic moments with his literary heroes. Along the way, Gil meets the Portugese Adriana (Marion Cotillard), a beauty who has inspired famous painters and who is in love with an earlier time ? just as Gil is infatuated with his own earlier time. The moral that ties these two worlds and their inhabitants together is a simple one, and Allen delivers it with subtle grace and beauty.I have never been to Paris, a faraway land to me. But look at what Allen has done with the way the movie is shot. Paris is idyllic in the daytime, a combination of markets and boutiques, air-conditioned restaurants and street cafés. At night, the city comes alive, even in the rain; the movie is shot with such unerring detail and each raindrop seems a work of art symbolizing Gil's various quandaries.I think that Midnight in Paris is one of Allen's finest over the past 20 years, perhaps one of his best ever, and certainly I'm not saying so idly. The man has a long track record of delightful, funny comedies and romances. He knows his audience well. But here, I think he surpassed some expectations; his recent spate of Euro-centric movies (like Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Match Point) were fairly well received by most critics (ahem, not this one), but Midnight in Paris far exceeds them both ? as well as just about anything Allen's done going back to the mid-1990s. It is a superlative film that's rich in texture, meaning, and elegance, and its ending is a little surprising but certainly plausible ? the perfect ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strengths and weaknesses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris (2011) was written and directed by Woody Allen. The bad news about this movie is that the "real" plot is ridiculous. We are supposed to believe that Gil (played by Owen Wilson) would want to marry Inez (Rachel McAdams) despite the fact that Inez is spoiled, selfish, immature, and comes as part of a package that includes her unpleasant parents and obnoxious friends. Yes, Inez is attractive, but as a successful screenwriter, surely Gil could find other attractive women with whom he'd be more compatible.The other part of the "real" plot that doesn't compute is that Gil, a handsome, strapping, Californian, would be channeling Woody Allen's nebbish character. When Gil whines, "That's crazy," in Allen's singsong voice, I just wanted to wince.The good news is that the "fantasy" part of the plot is great. Allen knows how to present cities to us in the best possible light (in both senses). Paris looks wonderful, the people in it look wonderful, and the "conceit" of going back in time worked for me.So, I recommend that you see this movie, ignore the "real" plot, and concentrate on Paris in an earlier era. As with most Woody Allen movies, this film will work on a small screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film with some flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Good: One of the most approachable Woody Allen films in years. It paints a lovely portrait of Paris, a real character in the film. It presents a nice message about the need to live in our own real time and make the life we want for ourselves. Owen Wilson is charming and pleasant in his role. The concept of reaching out and touching a group of legendary people from the past is fun and Bates and others give very intriguing performances as the literary/cultural figures in the time periods visited. Allen also spares us most of the clichés from a "time travel" film - the choice at the end whether to stay or not, the friends discovering the time portal, the race against time etc. No, this is a piece about the mood and ambiance of a different age, the time travel bit is more a flight of fancy and/or fantasyThe bad: What Allen saves in clichés on the time travel theme we gives back in terms of the characterizations of the other present-day characters. The fiancée, her parents, her friends all have next to zero redeeming qualities. They are extremely unpleasant to be around, making Wilson the only likable person in the present day by default. You hope from the onset that he will break it off with this woman, her family and friends, so there is little tension there.Not that much happens in the film. Yes, it's intriguing to meet Getrude Stein, Hemingway, Picasso but really they just say some clever things and that's the extent of it. Wilson is immediately and warmly welcomed into this tight-knit clique of 1920's artists and writers, apparently there is no need for money, he is invited in everywhere he goes. The film also fails to show any of the realities of the 1920's or the Belle Epoque, so Wilson comes to the conclusion it's better to live in his own time not by seeing the other time is not so great but because he sees Cotillard fawning over the Belle Epoque instead of the 1920's. Had that not happened, Owen would have probably gladly agreed to stay there, again with no immediate need for money, a place to stay etc.The movie is like a Parisian pastry, which is fun to eat but then later you wonder if it was worth all of the calories. It was a very sweet homage to Paris, some intriguing portraits of larger than life people but the final message in the end, the characters in the present-day were a little thin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming little romantic fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a lovely little film, extravagant in its visuals, with Paris serving as another character in the story, looking glorious of course. The photography alone is worth the price of admission. The premise is charming and is executed in a believable way. The filming of it is simple and effective, with no tricks, just as straightforward realism.The contemporary characters are out of Allen's stock barrel of characters. The two leads could be played by Allen and Diane Keaton, but they are now too old to play them, so the young actors serve as stand-ins for the two originals. Wilson has an interesting face but is too good-looking and too WASP-y to play the "Allen character". He does a spot on imitation of Allan's quirky mannerisms, vocal and physical, in this role. I wish he hadn't. I think a more original take on the "Allen character" might have been more effective. Here, he just seems like an imitation, and not a believable one.The writing is fair. The dialogue is Allen's usual "realistic" way of making his characters speak, which never seems like the way people talk, just someones Idea of how they talk.The best part of this film for me are the time travel scenes, populated by all of the main character's heroes from the past. They could be a dream, but they are executed with total realism. These roles are written and acted with more success than the 2010 characters, which all seem as if they actually belong in the 1970s, not the 2010s. All of the great people the hero meets in these episodes are done quite well, except for a stilted Hemingway (but how else could you portray a character who was mostly bluster and defensive pretense in real life?) Kathy Bates is the real standout as Gertrude Stein. She takes an underwritten part and creates a portrait of the iconic figure not at all as a caricature of her, but as real, breathing person, intelligent, savvy and believable.The real problem with this charming film is that it's too long for its slight story. This might have been better as a short or as one episode in a multiple-story film, which Allen has done before. Here, about halfway through, it starts to drag and you begin to wonder...I think this is a fine little picture, but not a great one, and not one of Allen's best. I think it is garnering the praise it's been getting because it's superb in contrast to most of the drek that's being released right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man returns to the 1920s in Paris...and I want to return the Blu-ray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris is one of the only movies lucky enough to be rented out by me and not returned with an expected refund...in respect for this supposedly good title I merely stopped the DVD less than an hour in, ejected it and placed it calmly back into its case. Now I understand the concept of the film, it's quite a cool concept, however apart from it already being unbelievable, as most movies are, making it believable should have been the director's primary aim, unfortunately it undoubtedly was and yet I didn't see it. Luckily for director Woody Allen it was set in the beautiful Paris which sold the title to me in the first place, I was looking forward too seeing the stunning French backdrop to reminisce on my recent travels...and the horrendous long introduction covered this, and then began the script and the character introduction; In short, the main characters, Gil (Owen Wilson) and the other one...his fiancé i think she was supposed to be (Rachel McAdams) are two people who live in the States and travel to Paris often, despite the obvious and constantly expressed dislike McAdams feels for the place which makes no sense to me at all. Gil, a script writer and keen novelist adores the city however and has a love for writing, art and the 1920s. So he often goes off without his fiancé which is the most believable part of the whole film as I do not understand how anyone would want to be around her, and at midnight every night he finds himself back into the 20s era spending time with Hemingway, Picasso and a bunch of other famous people he admires. Blah blah blah whats-her-name doesn't believe him but he keeps going back to get his novel proof read by some woman that's played by Cathy Bates of course and he finds out history's secrets and has a near affair with some chick who's with Picasso, whom we liked because she wasn't a winy brat like the other chick...OK, I didn't like her, much less whatever the wardrobe department kept dressing her in which included some horrific belts...never mind it was awful but um tangent city....Now, not that I continued watching once I discovered the story had no peaks or troughs, just a monotone that started at the bottom and stayed there, I realized that for the type of movie it was, it had the worst possible casting. Clearly the famous names and setting for the film were its only selling point; however had they been unknown actors it would have been far better in my opinion...Wilson is a funny guy...and always the same funny guy, he was so not needed here, and McAdam's was just there to look pretty, but her character's attitude didn't suit her and i feel sorry for her that she thought she had to star in this. All I really remember from this experience was turning to my boyfriend and sincerely apologizing for my choice of movie for which I begged but that's it! I have no idea what happened at the end of the film, or in the middle...but if anyone has the strength to find out it'd be nice to know if it actually ever went anywhere. Also, if you can stand the stupid (sorry) script, the uncomfortably annoying relationship between the main characters and Rachel's outfits then I commend you..but if you truly love Paris, maybe just watch the film on mute because it doesn't have much else going for it.

His films during the 70s and 80s were amongst some of the greatest cinematic art ever created. His development from zany, energetic comedic maestro to wistful, poignant, comedic/dramatic master is a joy to behold. I just wish that he'd stop making films. Now I know that I'm not the first to say this and that it may seem mean-spirited if he enjoys making films and there are still those who enjoy watching them (and there clearly are) but I just find it painful to watch this once brilliant talent regurgitate the same ideas, themes and characters but with less colour, wit and inspiration on each occasion. But let me talk about this film specifically. You'll have guessed from my tone that I wasn't impressed. What we have here, essentially, is a typical Woody dynamic of a central character caught in an unfulfilling relationship who wishes for something different and is taken on a journey of discovery. To be fair the journey of discovery usually involves another woman, and whilst that is part of the journey here, it is certainly not the full picture. In fact we get a "Purple Rose of Cairo"esque fantasy journey where Gil, the central character, this time it's Owen Wilson as the Woody cipher, travels to Paris in the 1920s, the time and place he professes that he would most wish to be alive.Now this device you will either find "amusing", as British reviewer Mark Kermode described it, or tiresome, as I personally found it. It was an indulgent, insipid and far too twee escapade of cinematic concept to carry any real weight or interest. Whereas in "The Purple Rose of Cairo" Mia Farrow lit up the screen with a genuine sense of wonder and excitement and the audience was carried along on the journey with her, here we have knowing nods and winks and anaemic characterisations of cultural icons from the past. Yes we get a nice message about the limits of nostalgia but this is hardly revolutionary fare. It's all just a little bit dull and pointless and unnecessary. I felt myself wishing that I was watching the luminous Marion Cotillard, who plays Gil's love interest, being directed in a film where there would be the energy available to match the heights of her capability as an actor, as Woody is no longer that man. What he managed with Diane Keaton, Mia Farrow, Alan Alda, et al, is a thing of the past. Woody has his pick of actors to work with, he's directing films around the world, but it's all superfluous, as he has nothing new to say. He hasn't for a while now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A time. And its crumbs. Nothing more. Game of testify and irony, pieces of lost memories and joy to describe, not very bad, Communism. The details are not important. The exaggeration is only for taste. It is not a documentary. But an exercise to say truth in soft way. So, it is nice and amusing. A form to imagine a death world who lives in every slide of Romanian reality. A story about people in the skin of totalitarian regime. A masterpiece if compare it with Autobiografia lui Nicolae Ceau&#x219;escu. With small ambitions and great sense of ridiculous. With desire to amusing and rediscover years when to survive was the first preoccupation. And title of one talented sugar daddy director. That is all.!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, one do miss a quality Woody Allen movie these days. Midnight in Paris: beautiful shots of Paris but no serious plot. Yes, many acclaimed stars, but no acting.Nostalgia is fine but this is very fake. I watched the film with my mind sending the relevant past clips from other beautiful Woody Allen films like Manhattan, Purple Rose of Cairo, Radio Days, even Vicky Cristina Barcelona. But bringing them together does not make a nice movie.I love rain in Paris but not like the last scene where the rain pours over only the cast not the bridge; is it cost-saving? And after all, why do we need Owen to mimic Woody?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I worried a bit in the beginning that I might find it a bit "banal" as I live in Europe and Paris is not exactly "exotic" to me. But -Oh My God- the plot was fantastic! Deep, meaningful and real. Owen Wilson at his best; I always loved his voice, natural talent and general style and in this movie his voice and general style is a unique asset. The casting was very spot-on! I would have hated to see any other main actor for this movie and the same goes for Carla Bruni's role, and most of the other smaller roles. The humor, the unexpected turn of events, the mystery, the romantic turn to the literary past of an old city, the beautiful people and gorgeous Paris scenes by day and by night were just "rich". I would see it again at the drop of a hat. Great job!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's striking midnight and we all know that means a walk back in time. It's an old story in an old city, and it's pretty to watch. Mostly charming, but often annoying due to the miscast of Owen Wilson. It is impossible to buy him in a role of a literary, well read author. He just can't pull it off. He and the actress playing Zelda are problems, and it's too bad for all the other really excellent portrayals. The actors playing Hemingway and Salvadore Dali are wonderful, as is the brooding Picasso. The fiancée, her family, and the know it all friend are great, too. A pleasant, pretty film with a great soundtrack and a casting department needing their heads examined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Utter drivel. This is quite possibly the most dull, drifting, lifeless and try-hard pretentious movie I have ever seen. The plot is weak and poorly realised, the cast disjointed and lacking chemistry, and the constant blur of references to history's literary/art greats grates quicker than a parmesan-happy Italian waiter. Be prepared for pockets of smug snickering and the odd guffaw outburst - "look Cuthbert, a fountain!!", while the rest of us (the majority) look on in bewilderment at what is unfolding before our eyes - "isn't that Owen Wilson? Isn't he normally quite good?". Errr, non.In between pretending to gouge my own eyes out to my wife, I did notice the Dublin cinema we were in had an unusually high amount of ceiling vents for its size (23!) and that the seats had considerably more leg space than our Ryanair flight over. I would have left early, but I'd paid ?5 for a pack of extra sour fizzy snakes and it felt like an endurance challenge. Interestingly I counted 47-and-a-half snakes in the bag. Not bad.I was hardly expecting the time travelling exploits of Bill &amp; Ted (though that would've been far more enjoyable), but I do wish I could rewind time and go to the cinema next door where they were playing 'Afraid of the Dark'. Instead I watched this, and now I'm 'Afraid of Paris'. Merci, Woody.In summary, I did not like this film one bit and it makes me sad that I will never, ever see those two hours of my life again. On the plus side, I nailed that bag of fizzy snakes, so I guess everyone wins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny in a nerdy kind of way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is great, begging to end. It's an original movie, it has themes like: Golden age thinking, denial and the real definition of success, which is not happiness.The cast is so wonderful. You would like to kill Rachel McAdams, or at least scream at her. Marion Cotillard is such a wonderful muse, Owen Wilson plays the lost dreamer perfectly and the 20's characters are so good too, they not only look like their parts but also act it very well. I saw an interview with Corey Stoll (Hemingway) and he said it was hard to play the confident macho surrounded by winning Oscar actresses. At least, he fooled me. I thought he was confidence personified.I read some reviews that said it wasn't funny. The only explanation I can give to that is the fact that it is a nerd movie. If you don't know who is Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Picasso and Dalí, don't watch it. It is impossible to relate to Gil (Owen Wilson) if you don't get the greatness of the people he is meeting. The first time I saw it I felt I was going to faint if I found Hemingway in a bar, and he is not even my favorite author, or how practical it would be to have surrealists as confidants. To really enjoy this movie, you need some background. I didn't know everyone, but the main characters of the 20's.Another warning, don't expect the Hollywood ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magic of Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The successful Hollywood screenplay writer Gil Pender(Owen Wilson) is spending vacation in Paris with his fiancée Inez (Rachael McAdams) and her parents since his future father-in-law is doing a merging business with a French company. Gil is an aspirant writer that loves Paris, and dreams on living in the city after getting married with Inez. Further, the romantic Gil believes that the golden age of Paris was in the 20's and he loves to walk on the rain through the streets of the City of Light.When the shallow Inez meets her former boyfriend, the pseudo-intellectual Paul (Michael Sheen) with his girlfriend Carol (Nina Arianda), they spend sometime together visiting touristic places. In the night, they drink wine in a party and Paul invites the couple to go dancing with Carol and him. However, Gil prefers to return walking alone to the hotel. At midnight, an old car stops and the passengers invite him to go a party and sooner he realizes that he is back to the 20's, where he meets his favorite writers, musicians and artists and lives his dream."Midnight in Paris" is another little masterpiece of Woody Allen, who returns to the genre of fantasy of "The Purple Rose to Cairo" to disclose his alter-ego Gil that falls in love for Paris. The metaphoric tale uses the magic of Paris to help the writer Gil to find his connection with the unsatisfactory real world and to live the life that he really wants. He learns that what would be the golden age for him, might not be for those who live in those years since life is not perfect at all. The film begins with a tour through the wonderful Paris, and has a marvelous cinematography unusual in Woody Allen's films. The performances are top-notch, with cameo of great actors and actresses, but I loved Owen Wilson, who is speaking in the same way Woody Allen does, Marion Cotillard and Kathy Bates. The soundtrack with (1) Let's do it ? Cole Porter; (2) Si tu vois ma m?re ? Sidney Bechet; (3) You do something to me ? Cole Porter; (4) Ain't she sweet ? Enoch Light and the Light Brigade (5) Charleston ? Enoch Light and the Light Brigade; (6) La Conga Blicoti ? Jospéhine Baker; (7) You've Got That Thing ? Cole Porter (8) Cancan ? Offenbach; and (9) Parlez moi d'Amour ? Juliette Greco; is nostalgic and magnificent. There are many jokes and my favorite is Gil suggest Bu?uel to think about a film with aristocrats trapped in a room without finding a way out. However, this film demands a minimum culture and sensitivity to be appreciated and this is probably the reason of a few bad reviews. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Meia-Noite em Paris" ("Midnight in Paris")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like literature and art...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read many reviews here saying if you don't like literature and art, don't waste your time going to see this movie. I'd like to add something to that: if you DO like literature and art, don't waste your time going to see this movie (or you should just go ahead, like me, because you can't imagine how bad it is if you haven't seen it). The premise of the movie seems promising: a struggling writer going back to the past to chat with important artists of the 20's (The Lost Generation) in Paris, and he has an epiphany at the end about life, art, or what have you, but the whole thing turns out to be a ridiculous mess. I bet you'd be better off at home reading your Hemingway than listening to the Hemingway in Midnight in Paris give a speech about life, death, and whatever that needs to happen in between, though. There are names that pop in and out of the movie all.the.times. Salvador Dalí, Luis Bu?uel, Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald (and Zelda). They converse, they talk about life and philosophy and art, and it feels like History of art 101 freshman year of college all over. Except you can't really learn much about art or literature or cinema or anything for that matter in 2 hours, so reading the first 3 lines in each Wikipedia article will give you more information than Midnight in Paris ever will. I can't believe the characters in this movie were so shallow and flat, especially the protagonist's fiancée (only 1 hour after the viewing and I can't recall the characters' names. Not that I want to.) She is just unbelievably crazy and demanding, but is that really necessary? Well, I was wondering what the movie is all about, but I finally found out at the end because guess what? The protagonist outright gives a lecture on treasuring the present and not being so nostalgic about the past. Thank you very much, I would never have figured out the message if the lecture hadn't been given. Being lectured is never fun, but I particularly detest it in movies; it feels like the director has no respect for the audience's intellectual ability. But hey, if you know who Luis Bu?uel is and whom Pablo Picasso had an affair with (and whom that lady had affairs with previously), and your friend doesn't, might as well invite them to the movie and make them feel bad for not knowing such important people. There's no better way to spend a Saturday night.I have to admit though, there was that part where Owen Wilson talks about Valium and Zithromax and antibiotics, and being someone who works in a related field, I found it pretty funny. But it was just because of the drugs. Maybe I would have liked it even more if Viagra was honorably mentioned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris -- a clever delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen yet again serves up a thought provoking, entertaining and brilliant film. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Have you ever wondered if it would have been better to have been born in a previous era? Woody Allen helps us answer that question by having us time travel a bit through the experiences of a young writer attempting to publish his first work which has as its setting a memorabilia shop filled with things of bygone eras which interest him. In this era, however, he travels with his shallow fiancé and her conservative condescending parents to Paris where the hero is smitten with its beauty and culture. What his fiancé does not know is that at the stroke of midnight our protagonist is transported to another era -- the Roaring Twenties ? complete with Cole Porter music, Ernest Hemingway literature, Picasso art and Gertrude Stein as critic of the book he has just written.This is a wonderful film especially if one has a general familiarity of the art, literature and music of that era as well as a general understanding of cultural settings in times other than our own. The film is brilliant and clever as only Woody Allen can be. The protagonist could certainly have been Woody Allen himself as he has played similar roles in many of his earlier works and if it were in a different era perhaps 20 years ago then Woody would have played the lead role instead of Owen Wilson whom I think was excellent.Allen's talent will endure long after all who have enjoyed the genre of his films have left the scene. He brings a flavor to his films that is unique to him and yet carries with it something that touches all of us by trying to understand the human condition, its philosophical dilemmas, its heartaches, its romantic love, its joys, its fears, its failures and its triumphs.Which era would you want to return? I always say the late 60's but "Midnight in Paris" warns us each era has its problems and its vicissitudes as mankind tries to improve upon his historical condition from generation to generation. It, therefore, gives us pause for thought maybe the era in which we do live is the best era of all. It is surely the only one we know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time to Retire Woody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that this picture is supposed to be a feel-good fantasy, with some mild intellectual insight. But I wanted to point out that the wildly Liberal Woody Allen doesn't show any minorities in his idealized version of the streets of Paris. Nor do most romantic comedies set in Paris or New York and geared toward an upper middle class, white professional audience.But given his politics, it seems ironic or telling, that he doesn't show groups of angry, young disaffected North African Muslims roaming the streets,nor images of black ghettos, Asian vendors, etc. To him, European Social Democracy is bliss, and Paris does not suffer from the plagues of urban decay that debase our cities in the U.S. Normally I would call him a liar and a hypocrite. Let's face it, he wants to live in a white, upper middle class world, no matter how virulently he jabs at Tea Party Republicans in this movie.Yes, he makes sure that his alter-ego, the main character, spews some vicious vitriol at his Republican in-laws-to-be. In addition, he portrays them as condescending, culture-less, materialists throughout.Owen Wilson does channel Woody Allen's neurotic persona to some degree, but I think that's o.k. It's Woody's film, and he used to play the main character in his films when he was younger. Wilson keeps it fresh, naive, and lovable, without conveying the cynicism of former characters played by Allen. I give both Allen and Wilson credit for this.The historical characters are over-the-top, comic book-like caricatures. I don't know whether Allen intended this. The plot device of time travel, while not unique, was mildly entertaining. I don't think the cinematography focused on the right images at all. Too many clichés, and not enough subtle hole-in-the-wall beauty.The dialog was nothing special, but the point made, about the past being overrated and relative, was more profound than what most modern movies serve us. I found the clarinet music obnoxious and oppressive, but I know that Allen plays the clarinet, and again, it's his movie. Maybe other people liked the music. That's fine with me.The bottom line is that Woody Allen is a Godless Liberal hypocrite, but he does have an endearing sense of romance and hope mixed in with his fear of death, and his loathing of half the human race.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paris and literature taken to golden heights of intelligence and humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever wanted to see Owen Wilson play a modern day Alvy Singer and then transport him into the 1920s? I'm assuming that nobody other than Woody Allen has even thought about doing that. But trust me, now you'll want to see it. "Midnight in Paris" pairs ingenious casting with Allen's usual parade of characters (a neurotic writer, a right-wing Republican ignoramus, and a pedantic know-it-all) and places them in Paris.Woody Allen movies are typically described as a love affair with the city, but this one is just so much more. It's not just a love affair with Paris, but with the romanticism of Paris, and with the idea of the best years of the city, and a love affair that is too crazy to be real that we don't even call it cheating.Here we get a romantic comedy, and at the beginning, one that appears that it could be a very standard romantic comedy. But we flirt with philosophical notions of loving and living in the past, and of wanting to live in a time that has past, and then we heavily flirt and engage with the golden-age of literature. That's where the intelligence, education and Allen's pure intellect come in, but he makes it hilarious, not heavy."Midnight in Paris" is, quite literally, one of the smartest and funniest movies I have ever seen. It's almost as smart as "Crimes and Misdemeanors" (1989) and just as funny as "Annie Hall" (1977). It will take a few more years and viewings before I can officially place it in that order of Woody Allen's best films, which for the most part is the same as the World's best films. But after the best night out at the cinema I have ever had, I have no doubt that's where "Midnight in Paris" will go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cinematic T?te-?-t?te with Surrealism, Art, and Literary Figures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EAPP11_Rev2016 After a decade of unsatisfying movie plots and bad reviews, Woody Allen is back in shape again since his critically acclaimed movies, "Annie Hall" and "Bullets over Broadway". He opens his latest film, "Midnight in Paris" with a three-minute video of countless montages of Parisian places with a dreamy soundtrack as the backdrop. As an overview, the movie is a soothing yet ambivalent view of nostalgia. Allen's perfectly crafted script hits all of the right notes and his direction is superb. The film is essentially a love letter to the richness of Paris' culture- past, present and perhaps even in the future. I watched the film as a movie recommendation of an Art page I encountered online a year ago. Much to my surprise, it became one of my all-time favorite movies.The movie revolves around Gil, an unshakable romantic who intends to pursue a career as a novelist, with Paris being his ideal writing station. It seems that the only thing holding him back is the insistence of his dreary, closed-minded fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her snobby, domineering parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimmi Kennedy) who force him to continue writing profitable Hollywood film scripts and eventually live in Malibu, California after the wedding. As he was roaming the Parisian streets, lost at midnight, along the Seine, Gil is offered a lift in what he assumes is a beautifully restored antique Peugeot. He hops in and finds himself in a party being thrown for Jean Cocteau, the other attendees of which include literary giants Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, musicians Josephine Baker and Cole Porter. It does not take him long to realize that he has been sent back in time to his favorite era, the roaring 20's. He is particularly dazed when he meets Ernest Hemingway, who is as most people would picture him: virile, and a heavy drinker. Gil asks Hemingway the biggest favor- to critique his novel but recommends Gertrude Stein as the editor. The next few nights find him waiting at the same set of steps for the same Peugeot to pick him up. Night after night he meets more members of the Lost Generation: Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, T. S. Elliot and the list goes on. However, what really draws him back, night after night, to the detriment of his relationship with fiancé Inez and her parents, is Picasso's mistress, Adriana. When Stein finished reviewing Gil's novel, which revolves around a man who works for a nostalgia shop, she said a particular line that struck him; "the artist's job is not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence." He realizes that he is in a constant state of perpetual denial of the present. He clings to a fallacy called 'Golden-Age Thinking', insisting that things were always better before and wished he lived in that era. The acting, dialogue, and the setting was on point. Even the soundtrack adds more sensation and feeling of Paris. I could definitely see Ernest Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald, and Salvador Dalí in the actors who played them. Because of the acting and the dialogue, I felt a connection with Gil: I, too, wanted to live in the past because things were simpler back then. The comedy helped to make the movie less serious and more enjoyable to watch. Without the comedy, the movie would have been very plain. Most of the time, the plot was not predictable. The movie might have been better if there was more focus on Gil's past experiences and how he had a relationship with Inez, who is clearly his opposite. I also consider the ending as a cliffhanger. Maybe Allen intentionally left us hanging to contemplate about what happened to Adriana after the bitter ending of her short affair with Gil. Overall, Midnight in Paris is a perfect blending of historic non- fiction and surrealism. Therefore, there seems to be not much of a plot. What is the main point of this movie? It is possible that Gil can be a reflection of our nostalgic selves. We think that the present moment is not our "Golden age", therefore blocking and distorting the nature of the present reality. As a resolution, he decides that he can no longer live in the past - literally or figuratively - and decides to make the most of his life in the present, even if is unsatisfactory in many ways. This is really a wonderful film about the dangers of idealizing to such an extent that it affects our life in the present. The magic and the realism, both requiring hard work from the protagonist, lead to surprising understanding of human nature, the delusion of nostalgia and Paris, and hope for a present that brings love and inspiration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight In Paris Is Paris, As Seen Through The Eyes Of A Hopeless Romantic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whimsical, witty &amp; wonderful, Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris is a heartwarming blend of romance, fantasy &amp; nostalgia that finds the legendary filmmaker in terrific form, is regarded by many as one of Allen's finest works in recent memory, and is an exquisitely photographed, pleasantly narrated &amp; delightfully amusing tale that's further strengthened by its cast's sincere inputs.The story of Midnight in Paris follows a Hollywood screenwriter who is struggling to finish his first novel. Vacationing in Paris with his fiancé's &amp; her parents, he finds himself transported back to the 1920s while wandering through the city's streets one night and embarks on a journey to the heart of the city where lies the ultimate source of inspiration for his writing.Written &amp; directed by Woody Allen, Midnight in Paris serves as his love letter to the city's heritage and the opening montage that captures the beautiful locales of Paris is something that viewers are instantly going to fall in love with. The story radiates the usual charm &amp; warmth of an Allen film, is sensibly scripted &amp; gleefully humoured, and pays a heartfelt tribute to Paris' rich history, literature &amp; wonders.Shot entirely on location, the background is always brimming with bright, warm colours and even in night segments, the lighting aspect of its cinematography is deftly utilised. The transition from one era to another is smooth, the plot is simple &amp; accessible, Editing unfolds all events in a streamlined fashion, set design team does a brilliant job to bring those bygone eras to life, and the background score is complimentary.Coming to the performances, the movie features a vibrant cast in Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, Carla Bruni, Michael Sheen, Tom Hiddleston &amp; others. Wilson is unexpectedly impressive and does a brilliant job at both playing his part &amp; narrating the whole story. McAdams also does well with what she's given. But the best of them all is Marion Cotillard who steals her moments with effortless finesse.On an overall scale, Midnight in Paris is an affectionately crafted, exuberantly photographed, aptly performed &amp; nonchalantly humoured cinema that's original, mesmerising &amp; evocative for the major portion of its runtime and will not only enthral Woody Allen's fans but will cast its spell on even the most casual filmgoers, hopefully. An invigorating adventure, a touching romance &amp; a resourceful fantasy, Midnight in Paris is Paris as seen through the eyes of a hopeless romantic.</fullReview>

But never mind. Midnight in Paris ... is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's pure cinematic originality, Woody Allen is a genius in the director's chair as per usual, It's definitely Owen Wilson's best film and I have to say I feel like I've honestly had dreams none too dissimilar to this movie. The romance of Paris captivates you until the very end and after the movie finishes, the characters are all amazingly done, you hate Elizabeth Banks and Michael Sheen but you love Kathy Bates and Corey Stoll. Also on a side note, Marion Cotillard is also perfect in this movie. Also I felt I could really relate to Gil in this movie, just his mannerisms and his views resemble my own quite frequently. Not only is Midnight in Paris my favorite Woody Allen movie but It's also in my top 10 Movies of all time. When I eventually sort that out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully shot and transports you to a different time and place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has visited Paris and finds themselves feeling that they miss the city should definitely watch this movie. It manages to capture that palpable atmosphere of the city from the get go and then transports you right into the 1920s. The great artist of the era are effectively played by prominent actors with Dali and Hemingway standing out in particular. Marion cotillard is great playing the muse and captures the essence of a Parisian beauty with mystery and beauty. The Themes of longing for life in a different era is something that I personally fond myself relating to and the way in which the story resolves itself is very satisfying as you see the protagonist grow. Also as a North American I was able to relate to how Gil finds a certain magic to Paris or Europe that other people do not appreciate. The dialogue between the actors of the modern era isn't as snappy as you come to expect of woody Allen films but it further shows why Gil longs for a different time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Escape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually really enjoyed this movie. I found it to be enlightening and it was also the first movie I actually really disliked Rachel McAdams. She has never played a bitch so impeccably before and I was very impressed because I didn't know she was able to do it so convincingly. I had read the book A Moveable Feast just before seeing the movie and I think it really made the movie that much more enjoyable, even though I didn't enjoy the book. It made the references to Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Gertrude Stein really come to life. It made me able to see them in a way I probably wouldn't have been able to had I not read the book, especially so close to seeing the movie. It is a movie that really encompasses the theme of "the grass is greener" because characters are always talking about how much better the past was and how they want to go there. Owen Wilson is one of them and thinks 1920's is the "Golden Age" and is able to actually go there, but when he gets there another character from the 20's wants to go to the 1890's because she thinks that's the "Golden Age". When they got to the 1890's the characters there were saying how they wished they could go to the Renaissance because that's the "Golden Age". They all want to keep going back further truly believing it was better than what they currently had. In reality, going into the past was their way to escape the present and whatever made them unhappy there. The past is easier because we know what we are getting because it's already happened. The present and the future either are happening or haven't happened yet and there is so much beyond our control that it is terrifying and overwhelming sometimes. There are other times, though, that it can be exciting and incredible if we do it right and just let it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Quick Trip to Paris is What Everyone Needs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris I will start by saying I saw this movie in the theater the month before its national release. I also saw it three more times in the theater after that point. I now own the video as well. This movie is a quintessential love letter to Paris from Woody Allen. From the cinematography to the music to the views, it has positioned itself securely in my top favorite movies of all time. I am a Paris, France lover. The details that Allen captures in this masterpiece from the monuments to the people of the era are precise. It gives the viewer the sense they are actually living in Paris from the breaking scene of Paris at dawn through night fall and finishing off with the glittering lights of the Eiffel Tower. We have our subject ? Gil Pender who is unhappy with his life in Los Angeles as a "film hack." He is attempting to become a novelist. Saturated in Paris, France where all the great writers and artists of the 1920's, you hope his location has some catalyst on his writing skills. He is trapped in what appears to be a very unfulfilled relationship with his demanding fiancée Ines played by Rachel McAdams (who incidentally plays the b word so well, it is ridiculous). It takes another character in the movie Adrienne played by the lovely Marion Cotillard who embodies the essence of Coco Chanel to help Gil see where he is going wrong in life. It seems to always be the case in life, where one needs to see it happening to someone else to realize they are, in fact, making the same mistake. Gil thankfully opens his eyes by the end of the movie and experiences the peripeteia moment we all hope he has. This movie is filled from beginning to end with rich historic Parisian life. Keep your eyes open as you will see may notable historic figures within the art community from directors, singers, songwriters, writers, and painters. This movie is too good to miss. It is like bringing home a slice of a life you never knew you wish you had had!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whimsical, Imaginative Fun,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's a very unique film, I guarantee you will not find anything like it, as we follow writer Owen Wilson, vacationing in Paris, accidentally stumbling in to 1920's France and communicating with the writers that have inspired him, its filled with laughs, a lot of heart and stellar performances. The only problem I had was that it did not take enough advantage of some of the actors portraying historical figures, particularly Tom Hiddleston as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Corey Stoll as Ernest Hemingway, showing a full understanding of these men in terms of their demeanor and mannerisms, but in the end they sadly did not get enough moments to truly showcase them. It's very real, despite the bizarre set up, the dialogue is very relatable and pure, particularly Owen Wilson and Marion Cotillard's scenes together, which had me questioning my own life, Woody Allen always succeeds with realism, no matter how exaggerated his story may be. Sweet, dramatic, creative, Midnight in Paris is an absolute treat and should not be missed by fans of Woody Allen, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or comedy. A nostalgic screenwriter finds himself going back to the 1920s every day at midnight. Best Performance: Marion Cotillard</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely delightful romantic fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of only three Woody Allen films to be nominated for Best Picture, this is an absolutely delightful romantic fantasy. In many respects, it reminds me of one of Allen's best films "The Purple Rose of Cairo" as both feature protagonists who would like to experience another world as they find their real lives unsatisfactory and are given the opportunity to do so through a fantasy conceit which does not require an explanation. In the earlier film, it was the glitz and glamour that existed in Hollywood films of the 1930s. In this one, the personal Elysium in question is Paris in the 1920s. While the other world in "The Purple Rose of Cairo" is pure fiction, it becomes clear over the course of the film that the idea of an historical Golden Age is likewise illusory. Allen's perfectly crafted script hits all of the right notes and his direction is superb. The film is essentially a love letter to Paris - past, present and perhaps even future - and it makes me want to visit the city more than anything else that I have ever seen.The film stars Owen Wilson in a first rate performance as Gil Pender, a successful Hollywood screenwriter who has grown dissatisfied with the artificiality of Tinseltown. He does an excellent job of conveying Gil's unbridled enthusiasm for one of the numerous episodes in the City of Lights' history when it was seen as a major centre of art and culture. He was almost like a puppy at times. As is common in Allen's films, Gil is having an existential crisis as he has come to doubt the artistic merit of the Hollywood assembly line on which he has laboured for years. He seeks to make a real stab at what he considers proper writing through his first novel. At heart, Gil is a very romantic soul and he regrets that he did not move in Paris when he visited the city years earlier. In contrast, his fiancée Inez, played very well by Rachel McAdams at her most unlikeable and antagonistic since "Mean Girls", does not have a romantic bone in her body. A very good indication of the difference in their personalities is provided in their first scene when Gil comments that Paris looks gorgeous in the rain and Inez asks, "What's wonderful about getting wet?"Gil would prefer to work on his novel but he is forced to spend a great deal of time with Inez's obnoxious Francophobic parents John and Helen, played in a pair of great performances by Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy, and her even more obnoxious, pedantic friend Paul Bates, played in a suitably smarmy and insufferable fashion by Michael Sheen. Paul belongs to that category of persons whom Allen seemingly despises the most: pseudo-intellectuals. He is a self-appointed expert on Rodin, French wine and Monet and even argues with a tour guide - played by France's then First Lady Carla Bruni of all people - over whether Camille was Rodin's mistress or wife. Unsurprisingly, he is in the wrong but refuses to accept it. Gil clearly wants to beat the bejesus out of Paul and I could relate to that. While attempting to avoid all of these people (for some reason...), Gil is picked up by a beautiful 1920s Peugeot. He is promptly taken to a party being thrown for Jean Cocteau, the other attendees of which include Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, Josephine Baker and Cole Porter. It does not take him long to realise that he has been sent back in time to his favourite era. He is particularly starstruck when he meets Ernest Hemingway, who is as most people would picture him: bearded, brooding and drinking. At one point, Gil visits the nightclub Chez Bricktop. Although Bricktop is not depicted in the film, the genuine article had previously appeared as herself in another Allen film "Zelig".In spite of all the attractions provided by all of these literary and artistic giants, Gil is most captivated by an aspiring fashion designer Adriana, who has a tempestuous relationship with her lover Picasso and is an object of lust for Hemingway. She is played in a brilliant performance by the simply enchanting Marion Cotillard. A romantic who idolises the Belle Époque of the 1890s, she has far more in common with Gil than Inez could ever have. Over the course of several nights, Gil falls in love with her and the feeling is mutual. He begins to wonder if he can love two women and then if he even loves Inez at all. Adriana is attracted to Gil's naive openness while he believes that he has found a kindred spirit and maybe even a soulmate in her. In a great sequence, the two find themselves back in the Belle Époque where they meet luminaries of that era such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Paul Gauguin. The latter reflects that he would prefer to have lived in the Renaissance, dismissing the artistic endeavours of the 1890s. This shocks Adriana but it leads to an epiphany for Gil. He comes to realise that no era is perfect and people throughout history have wanted to live in a bygone Golden Age. More to the point, he decides that he can no longer live in the past - literally or figuratively - and decides to make the most of his life in the present, even if is unsatisfactory in many ways. As well as the actors whom I have already mentioned, the film features great performances from Tom Hiddleston as Fitzgerald, Alison Pill as his erratic wife and muse Zelda, Corey Stoll as Hemingway, Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein, Léa Seydoux as Gabrielle and, in a wonderful cameo, Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali. Overall, this is a wonderful film about the dangers of idealising or idolising to such an extent that it affects your life in the present.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today I watched Midnight in Paris and I loved this movie and ended up shedding a few tears. "Paris &amp; Rains" I love both. I've never been to Paris though but just like the character was in love with 20's so was I. For past many days I have been thinking for a way to escape from time. Creating and evaluating the philosophy of time.My theory, "Present moment is a collection of events happening in association with people around. Time is an illusion. We live at once in Past, Present and Future."The first question that came to my mind was, "why people first bring physical alignment and enter into toxic relations then struggle hard all their lives to align emotional aspects of the relation. It is common in many of our societies that, that people first align bodies and physical aspects then consider emotional and spiritual aspects. The writer in this movie is continuously being humiliated and emotionally abused by his partner. Only he knew that, that he was right. He struggled emotionally and found the way out? Ah! Rains! Rains! Rains!"It was an honest book and that's what war does to men and there's nothing fine and noble about dying in the mud unless you die gracefully and then it's not only noble but brave."E.Hemingway: You'll never write well if you fear dying. Do you?I believe that love that is true and real creates a respite from death. All cowardice comes from not loving, or not loving well, which is the same thing.Hemingway: No subject is terrible if the story is true, if the prose is clean and honest, and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure.Hemingway: If it's bad because I hate bad writing. If it's good I'll be envious and I'll hate it all the more. You don't want the opinion of another writer.Gertrude: We all fear death and question our place in the universe. The artist's job is not to succumb to despair, but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence.Adriana: That Paris exists and anyone could choose to live anywhere else in the world will always be a mystery to me.

		<shortDescription>Cute and adorable, but a little too perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very playful and upbeat story line. There's no real and genuine conflict. It's all a little too perfect, in my opinion. I can't pinpoint a really climactic event in the movie at all. I have a feeling Rachael McAdams, Owen Wilson's fiancée, would have blown up and thrown a temper tantrum instead of calling him a crazy lunatic whatever. I think everything was tied up too nicely in the end. Aesthetically, it's beautiful, but that's because it's Paris, not because of any special camera work or anything. Honestly, the best part of this movie was Brody as Salvador Dalí. Fantastic work on the accents, fantastic representation of how weird he was. I think he really caught the essence of Dalí. (On a similar note, would Hemingway really talk how he writes? I feel like all that deep nonsense isn't Hemingway, the lusting after a pretty French girl and the free and unabashed flirting is...)That being said, I don't regret watching it and it was a nice little film. Just a bit too perfect.Also, it occurred to me several times throughout the movie that the 20's time travel was all just inside Owen Wilson's head and that it was a metaphor for his self- discovery. In which case, the movie becomes a little bit less "meh." But not much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent kind of job from Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So often we hear that Woody Allen is "back to his best" and that he is producing work that maybe even matches that of his critically acclaimed works decades ago, this movie I feel though does not match those claims. Take nothing away from this film, it is a good one and it is pretty fun with some well created characters and a witty script, it isn't however a great movie and that I feel is the least it has to be if it is to be considered one of Allen's best. The story is a fantasy basically and how a Hollywood screenwriter visiting Paris (although with hopes to live there one day) is whisked back and forth at the stroke of midnight into the 1920's, full of famous faces. The film feels like it's Woody Allen not just from the pretty quirky story but just the music that is used, if you walked in on this film and had no idea what it was, the music I feel would show you it is one of Allen's. The film explores the Paris of the past that inspired the very best of writers, painters and entertainers and really brings at least a fresh story with it, one that is fairly un- generic as well. I don't think the movie excels massively in the comedy area but does have the odd good laugh and when most jokes are done they are smartly done, but not always though that laughable.Owen Wilson is Gil Pender the man who is travelling back, Wilson is pretty nice in the role and is extremely calm, I swear this is one of the most laid back acting performances ever. The cast is full of names like Michael Sheen, Kurt Fuller, Kathy Bates, and Marion Cotillard and also features Rachel McAdams who as Wilson's extremely annoying fiancée is really hard to like, but acted well though. Allen brings together a cast that can seem randomly placed, new people arrive around every corner and some are just never seen again, Allen paces this pretty fast but does manage to slow it down when it needs to be at least.You know Woody Allen doesn't do a bad job at all of directing and writing this but also at the same time doesn't make this fantastic, even with the nice fantasy element he fails to make this completely charming. There is no doubt Allen is considered one of the masters of the romantic comedy genre but here is no mastery, it is good work but is far from the level most expect of Allen, some may find this excellent but for me this is just straight good and no more. I don't think Allen makes mistakes but this I just feel is not made at a great enough quality as all.So Midnight in Paris is a Woody Allen work that probably won't rank highly in his catalogue but is easily a welcome addition and is recommendable, and not only to the fans of the man in the directors chair. I think it's the kind of thing that all can enjoy and it doesn't focus so much on the romantic element that it becomes bogged down in it, it mixes the fantasy into it very well too so that the story becomes nicely balanced, oh and add a little comedy to that balancing act too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen travels through time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Owen Wilson plays a screenwriter called Gil Pender who goes to Paris with his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams). He has troubles finishing his first novel, and then all of a sudden he finds himself from the 1920's, his favorite era. There he has a chance to talk to people like the Fitzgerald couple, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein and Pablo Picasso. Midnight in Paris (2011) is a movie directed By Woody Allen. This Jewish New Yorker born as Allan Stewart Konigsberg turns 80 today, and still comes up with a movie per year. Now there's an achievement! He has made most of his movies in New York, but in the latter years he has gone to Europe. This movie made in France works very well and is one of his finest movies made in Europe. I am a big fan of time traveling, and that's one of the reasons I like this movie. This is like Back to the Future, in Woody's style. It's most intriguing to watch this 21st century guy interacting with celebrities of the past. The meeting with Salvador Dali must be the funniest. The acting work works as it always does in a Woody Allen movie. Owen Wilson is really good as Gil. In supporting roles you can see people like Michael Sheen, Kathy Bates, Marion Cotillard and Adrien Brody.If you want to see a time travel themed movie handled in an intellectual way, you should see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Golden Age Thinking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The interesting thing about Midnight in Paris is that it sets you up into thinking this is another Alvy Singer - in Gil's first lines are those disparaging Hollywood hacks like himself and wishing to write something real, something substantive that can be counted amongst the literary canon. You know, the Hemingways, the Fitzgeralds, the Steins. Then it sort of switches it around a little, and Gil becomes the hopeless romantic who is forever entranced by the rainy streets of Paris and Inez is the one who disparages him for this. And then finally Allen settles on a happy medium, where both possess different types of pretentiousness. The city of love is established well, with the same loving treatment as the beginning of Allen's Manhattan. Before we are introduced to our couple, we are treated to a few minutes of a travelogue of sorts, postcard shots of the bridges, the streets, the park fountains, and of course the Eiffel Tower. Khondji bathes the entirety of these exterior shots in a warm golden glow, and we become aware of just how gorgeous it is. Later as Gil slips into the past, it becomes even more yellowy, the period sets becomes warm and homely, and the music fits - romantic saxophone, then the tender voice of Gale Porter. When Gil tries to hurry back to the party, he stumbles upon a sterile laundromat instead, lit harshly in blue green. The dream is over for tonight. When the group visit Monet's Water Lilies, Allen shoots them distantly, removed from its beauty in the sterile white oval room, and when we get a close-up, the painting is quickly obscured by the bickering of Inez and Gil, trying to get a word in. Some might call Allen's Paris too idealistic; you would be hard pressed to find a shot not in shallow focus, blurring the city lights, and the backdrop crisply clean. Well, the answer to that is, Gil sees what he wants to see.From the first moment we are clear that this engaged couple is not meant to be. They exist on too entirely different world - Alvy Singer is not Gil, but in fact Paul, who is described as a pseudo-intellectual and pedantic. He is a professor of something, which allows him to be the expert on many things and drive a wedge between this engagement. Adams is fantastic; she certainly is sexy as designated by Gil, but there are little moments which make you wonder how she can be so sexy yet so infuriating. Gil is caught red-handed trying to pawn off her pearl earrings for some back-in-time sex, and here we have a scene in every romantic comedy, and it is so easy for Inez to get suspicious. But instead she vainly gestures at herself when seeing the present: "For moi?" Her parents are considerably more insufferable - right wing, high class and jealous parents stereotypes who dismiss chairs that are less than twenty grand, who set upon private detectives on soon-to-be son-in-laws, and from whom no doubt Inez learned her disdain for the help. That is one little line that speaks volumes of this relationship; another is the hilarious moment where Gil tries to justify it to Andriana, and mumbles out a compromise about "some types of Indian food". The dreamy time travel sequences are not contemplative to their fullest extent. It's never easy to portray figures who have already been immortalised. Allen does it lightly and winks here and then; Hemingway drunkingly tries to spark a boxing match and talks pointedly of hunting and manhood, Zelda Fitzgerald is ditzy and given little time to really justify committing suicide, and that delightful scene where Gil offers up the idea of The Exterminating Angel, and Luis Bu?uel is left bewildered at his own work of art. Gil explains his situation to a group of surrealists, and they seem fine with it. Another hilarious moment is when Kurt admits to having Gil tailed, and then we cut inexplicably to the poor man stuck and terrified in 18th century Versailles, and perhaps these events were real after all. The important thing is that Gil realises these legends aren't so much different than us all.Of course, the detractors point at the twee and the remarkably idealistic romance of it all. Allen has Gil realise that nostalgia is denial, yet paradoxically places him within a very very beautiful modern Paris. In Gil's aspirational journey he uncovers another paradox; the endless cycle of nostalgia, and is shocked to discover that Andriana prefers the Belle Époque era to this wonderful period. So he departs for the inescapable present. Another director might have made Léa Seydoux's sweet character some sort of descendant of the Picasso mistress, because isn't that magical? But they make their own magic in the rainy streets of Paris. Up above, Van Gogh's starry night swirls. Everyone yearns for this sort of ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plastic Movie - plastic people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me several attempts to make it through this movie and I only finished it out of curiosity how Woody Allen would find a plausible ending to this ridiculous story. Ridiculous not because of the concept - but because of the way it was implemented. Had there not been quite so many famous people from the twenties trotted out for our perusal, an interesting idea could have been turned into an enchanting movie.Plastic prototypes almost shoved down our throats, all behaving exactly how someone like Woody Allen would have us believe they would. Notably awful was Corey Stoll as Hemingway, who delivered his lines as if he was reading them off a teleprompter.In order to enjoy a story such as this it is imperative to suspend disbelief and immerse oneself in the events as they unfold. Never for one moment did I come anywhere close to this in spite of the enchanting views of Paris and the music, which is probably the best thing in the film.In the past Allen gave us some wonderful trips back into the past, moments of unforgettable fantasy and characters who (although rather over-the-top) were engaging and believable. Midnight in Paris falls down on almost all of these factors and I am sure that if it had been made by anyone other than Woody Allen, it would have been a total flop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I turn to the film itself, a few facts about me: before watching, I didn't like (and even a little annoyed by) the actor who plays the main character (Owen Wilson). I don't know why. But I like Rachel McAdams (the bride of the main character) and Marion Cothiar. I'm not a fan of Paris. For some reason, I don't really sympathize with him, even though he is so romantic. Sometimes I'm also nostalgic for the past I was never alive for, but not as much as the protagonist, and now very rarely.Now about the movie: I find it difficult to get involved in the atmosphere. &#x410;fter the first fifteen minutes I was sure that I would give him a maximum of 7 points and write that the movie was good, but nothing special, however... probably due to the fact that the movie is simply gorgeously filmed, I was impressed by its simplicity, romance, and dreaminess. So much so that after some time, I already loved the atmosphere, which I hadn't liked at the beginning of the movie. It seems that Woody Allen (the director of the film) was very much in love with Paris; otherwise I can't explain how he was able to make such a gorgeous film from this simple plot. In General, objectively I would give him eight points, but for the emotions - Nine! This movie has penetrated deep into my soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Midnight in Paris" does not have Woody Allen on a screen - but his alter ego is present in character of gentle dreamer (Owen Wilson) who roams romantic streets of Paris with his obnoxious fiancé and her parents chained to his leg. Its obvious that this is not a good fit and why would they even insist of catching him as a bridegroom when they hardly bear him is not truly explained, but director suggest it would be just another marriage of convenience. "Well, we have lots in common..." muses Wilson "for example we love Indian food..." and as the city gets under his skin, this dream seems to vanish because he can clearly see himself living different, another life far from these materialistic people. What follows is another typical Woody Allen magical realism where characters get lost in time. If anyone else made this, it would be sacrilege because it has already been done - but Woody Allen has all the right in the world to play with his own older ideas and he does it with grace, humor and magic. There is a very interesting question somewhere in all of this, about meaning of "good old days" which are always imaginary Heaven when compared to present time, movie suggest that this is illusion because any time was difficult for people for whom it was present. The movie charmed the socks off critics and audiences around the world and reminded me how much I always loved Woody Allen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Script backed by a stellar Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris is the first Woody Allen movie that I have seen. The film is set in Paris where Gil and Inez, who are engaged, have come to visit Inez's parents. The city is shown in its full glory through some beautiful cinematography and a background score that complements the movie well. The cast is stellar with Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams in the lead roles. The movie also consists of Oscar winners Adrien Brody and Marion Cotillard in Supporting roles. The best aspect of the movie was the script which is highly original that shows Gil go back to a different era every midnight. On viewing the movie, the characters seem completely realistic and it never feels like anyone is acting as all the performances are natural. Throughout the movie, the director hints at the dissonance between the soon to be married couple. The interpretation to the fantasy world that Gil enters is not resolved. It is left to the viewer to make out what really happens. As the movie is a romantic comedy, it has certain aspects that are common to the genre. The sense of humor in this movie comes mainly through Owen Wilson who tries to explain how he goes back to a different era every midnight despite the disbelief of her fiancée. The movie is short and well edited which makes for a memorable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris (2011): Dir: Woody Allen / Cast: Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Michael Sheen, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hiddleston: Ravishing revisiting of those historical moments that spellbind our thoughts. Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams play engaged couple Gil and Inez who join her parents in Paris but he desires the Paris of the 1920's that homed his literary heroes as opposed to the modern highlights. While Inez goes dancing with friends, Gil, at the strike of midnight is picked up in an old style car and whisked into the 1920's Paris where he holds humorous conversations with Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and his fragile wife Zelda, Cole Porter, and Gertrude Stein who offers to read his novel. Woody Allen doesn't give reason as to why this occurs but he asks that we bask in the old style beauty of Paris just as Gil does. This is not one of his great films like Everyone Says I Love You and Small Time Crooks but it is charming and often funny. Wilson plays off an unfulfilled screenwriter longing for a mystical past and embarks on pure fantasy. McAdams is unfortunately underused and seems there only to be hinted in an affair with her friend Paul, played by Michael Sheen. These roles seems like a bypass thought that needed more build. The literary characters are grand, particularly Marion Cotillard whose presence seduces Gil's wonderment until she comes to some realities of her own. Many literary characters including Tom Hiddleston playing F. Scott Fitzgerald. The literary references will make big Allen fans enjoy this midnight stroll in Paris. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done crowd pleaser with room for dissatisfaction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My primary recommendation for this movie is: don't let the genre or the actors or anything else sway your decision to give it a try. I watched this movie in English class to learn about the Lost Generation writers and probably wouldn't have watched it by choice, but I'm glad I saw it. You don't have to like the comedy or the romance elements to enjoy it. It's light for the most part also has some deep moments, kind of like John Hughes movies. The progression of Gil's story is pretty interesting, but maybe I think that because I'm an aspiring but unpublished screenwriter and author like he is.Our main character is Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), a fish out of water with his fiancé's family. Much of the first half hour involves the excitable and artistically inspired Gil trying to politely endure his fiancé Inez's (Rachel McAdams) high classed and touristy friends and parents. He is very taken by his idealized perception of Paris and the literary wonders he finds in. Inez gradually loses favor with Gil (and hopefully the audience) as she and Gil disagree more and more. If you get down to it, the root of most of their disagreements comes from differing artistic tastes. Her character is written well in that she has a lot of good off screen progression. Paul is very hateable from his constant repetition of "if I'm not mistaken . . ." to his big beard that's a lot sillier looking than he probably likes to think. Adrianna (Marion Cottilard) is written to be appealing to the audience in that her darker side is addressed rather than shown and in that she automatically clicks with Gil. The other minor characters that Gil meets throughout the city, present or past, are included mostly as traffic directors for the various story lines and make sure they don't take any detours even when the characters are included for comic relief.The plot seems to move rather aimlessly as Gil enters deeper into the 1920's version of Paris that he finds. The two, or maybe three, story lines consist of Gil's confused relationships with his fiancé and his new love interest of Adrianna, and the smaller line of him gaining inspiration and guidance from his heroes of the past. SPOILER ALERT The plot culminates in Gil breaking up with Inez after she unsurprisingly cheats on him with Paul and Adrianna staying in her golden age of the 1890's Belle Epoque. The golden age theme is pretty interesting, and is really the only positive thing Paul contributes to Gil's life. I think it's a great theme because everyone has felt symptoms of it at some time, even if your golden age isn't actually a time period. But in the end, as Gil says, we have to accept the present and all the opportunities it gives. The time travel impacts Gil's life tremendously, but not in a Back to the Future way where he alters his past and present.The script is pretty good, though it treads on some shaky ground with the historical figures since people might not like the way their favorite artist or author is portrayed. All of the actors give decent performances, but nobody really stands out. The jazz music adds a nice touch to the overall mood, though playing an entire song for the opening sequence was probably a bit much even if it was different.I would lightly recommend this to pretty much anybody, except for those who absolutely abhor all forms of fantasy. You really have to just accept the time travel as given to enjoy it, just like with the implausible elements of Bedtime Stories, Inception, or any other movie where the plot basis balances on one thing that defies reality. If any of said films tried to explain how everything in their respective fictional universes, it would have screwed up the story. Midnight in Paris is a good pick if you're seeking a crowd pleaser, but it's better if you aren't tempted to talk with the people you're watching it with. The ending or characters might disappoint some. If you don't like the characters, at least the protagonists, after the conclusion of Gil's first midnight walk, the rest of it probably isn't worth your time. Overall Rating: 7.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing. Beautiful. I fell in love with the movie. It starts with shots of Paris-cafes,parks,during the day,during the night,while raining...is there a more beautiful city than that one? Gil loves Paris. He also is a writer. And he struggles. Nothing weird there. Owen Wilson is great in a role and Rachel McAdams is great as his rich,but very different finacee. While he is an intellectual she comes off as a snoby shallow rich girl. From the beginning it is clear they are not for each other. She wants to live in elite Malibu while he wants to live Paris. He would like to walk on the rain while she obviously isn't keen on the idea. And so one night when he gets lost a car stops...and gets him the world of gold 20's where he meets Mr and Mrs Fitzgerald,Hemingway,Piccaso and his beautiful mistress played by Marion Cotillard. He is instantly dazzled by her. I don't wanna go through the whole movie because I would write an essay. In the end doesn't marry Inez of course and Adriana stays in the age of Bel Epoque-for her the golden age of Paris. The message is:people are never satisfied with what they have or where they live or when they live. Gil wants to live in 20's while Adriana wants to live in 90's of 19th century while people living in that age wish they lived in renesance..."the grass is always green on the other side." In the end Gil is walking and meets a girl he met before while buying some old things.. Gabrielle played by Lea Seydoux has been on dinner with friends...the rain starts and she says how she doesn't mind rain because "Paris the at its most beautiful then". The music is beautiful. Carla Bruni also makes a nice cameo...all in all...beautiful. "Say hello to Trocki!" Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of Woody Allen's work, but this movie wasn't bad. However, I feel it was certainly not great, and felt rather flat in retrospection despite enjoying the majority of it.The movie begins with about four minutes of footage showing Paris in the rain, which in my opinion was a bit of a wasted time. It didn't further anything and didn't evoke any emotions toward the city. Later, we are introduced to our main character and his fiancé. They spend their time in a vacation in Paris, and we immediately understand how much our protagonist is in love with the city. Sadly, all the characters felt very shallow for me. There is the neurotic protagonist who doesn't really do anything and things just happen to him; we don't know a thing about the fiancé besides the fact she doesn't want to live in Paris and is in love with another sophisticated man; and all the other side characters show only one main quality rather than being three dimensional characters. The film doesn't try to present any logical themes about the time traveling stuff, but rather takes the time travels easily, which isn't a bad thing. The story doesn't make much sense and there are many plot holes which are not addressed, but it didn't bother me too much overall. The parts which I liked the most are the ones in Paris in the 1920's, and the various well known figures we meet there. It was pretty fun, and the characters were colorful enough to enjoy them. However, at some point towards the end of the movie, I realized there isn't a real emotional hook to keep me interested in the characters and what happens to them. I was left a little underwhelmed, and the moral of the story was shoved in the audience's throats. In the end, it was pretty enjoyable, but not much more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a compact movie with a simple conceit that initially looks to be hokey but ends up driving home its payoff quite memorably. Were the writing and acting better, it could have been a classic, but alas it falls well short of that mark. Owen Wilson was an acting high point, but even then his performance was just OK - nobody else was in the least bit identifiable as an actual human rather than an actor playing to a script. True, some of the the 'historical' figures were supposed to be caricatures, but even beyond this, the 'deeper' characters had no depth or chemistry. Worst of all, for a movie supposedly set around Paris, all I saw was a really poor American take on Paris; very little reminded me of that city which I know quite well. Heck, the "French" characters' "Frenglish" accents were barely identifiable as such.A real pity, since, as I said, the payoff and the idea were very decent for a compact movie like this. I did not dislike it, but thought the acting and writing let the whole thing down quite a bit. A 90 minute good date movie for an undergraduate trying to impress a girl who fancies herself an intellectual but has never been to Paris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of Allen's movies, but I must say this is a nice one. I felt really happy and after watching it. Although it's not exactly a masterpiece, it lives up to what I expecting. It gives you a good message. If you like a script that tries something new bu simple, for sure you're going to like it. The Paris scenes at the beginning were great, it couldn't start better. Some characters are not well fit into to the story like Rachel McAdam's parents. Speaking about her, though her character it is the definition of the expression "pain in the ass", she really shows that she is improving and soon or later we are going to see her at the Academy's nominees. I never thought I would make a compliment about him, but again, nice surprise. He carries the whole film without making huge mistakes and most of his scenes are really but really funny. When he mets Salvador Dalí is probably the movie best part. At last, i recommend this. Not a huge production, but it gives you some piece of mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008), this is one of Woody Allen's most fun and entertaining movies, although this one possibly has more depth if you're looking for that. A successful writer called Gil (Owen Wilson) is drawing apart from his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) with different outlooks on life. They've come to Paris on holiday with her parents but she spends all her time shopping and eating with friends she runs into. Gil wanders the city at night, and on one of his jaunts is picked up by a vintage car that propels him into the 1920s. He finds himself in clubs with all his artistic heroes: Zelda and F Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso and Cole Porter. He also falls in love with Adriana (Marion Cotillard), Picasso's mistress, who actually pines to be back in the Belle Epoque turn of the century, and not the 1920s. The film is very firmly a comedy but it has something to say about nostalgia, wishing to be somewhere you're not, and choosing your own path. But like Vicky Cristina Barcelona, the film also works well as light entertainment. It looks and sounds great and like most Woody Allen films, is made with great affection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris is refreshingly original romantic comedy (there is time travel involved) yet a familiar Woody Allen film in that it is autobiographical in nature and shares similar themes with his other films. The story is about a writer (Owen Wilson) who is dissatisfied with life and wishes he could have lived in Paris in the 1920s. Low and behold he enters an old taxi which takes him to this very time and place every midnight where he meets many famous Parisians of the time like Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. These historical characters are all brilliantly acted, my favorite being Adrian Brody as Salvador Dali who is hilarious. The film has a great ensemble cast which makes Allen's writing all the more impressive in that he is able to flesh out all of these characters in only an hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I could live anywhere, it would be a night in Paris in the 1920s. I have to agree with Gil. Midnight in Paris is a beautiful well-made film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Paris, the film follows Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), a screenwriter, whom is vacationing with his materialistic fiancée, Inez (Rachel McDonald) and her wealthy, conservative parents. Gil is struggling with writer's block, trying to finish his first novel, about a man who works in a nostalgia shop in 1920s Paris. It doesn't help that Inez and her family continue to dismiss his ambition as a romantic daydream and encourages him to stick with the more lucrative screen writing. One night, as Gil was taking a walk, he found himself transported to 1920s Paris. It's there, he finds himself exploring and questioning his nostalgia and modernism beliefs, forcing him to make a decision: should he go back to his own time, or stay in theirs. Directed by Woody Allen, Midnight in Paris seemingly struck a chord with audiences. It's one of the few movies, beside 1977's Anne Hall that I honestly like from him. Midnight in Paris is a story about learning to live with the past. Gil obsesses over the past and its artifacts, and his unhealthy obsession continue to make his present life, a bit dissatisfaction. It wasn't until he got to see the past for what it is, that he knew he was dreaming a 'Golden Age' Fallacy. The movie does expose the dark truths behind the belief of the 'Good Old Days' and that's the best thing about it. The main actors were all pretty good. Owen Wilson was pretty much playing Woody Allen. As is customary with Woody Allen films, main character Gil is a stand-in for Woody Allen, from the tucked-in shirts Gil wears to the nervous way Gil talks. Owen Wilson, at first, I couldn't see him as the actor that could able to adapt a fitting characterization to match the films tone, but I was taken aback by his performance. It was alright, but really no big stretch, here. Both, Allen &amp; Wilson mumbled and speak as if they are being tickle. It's not the best out there, but alright for his role, even if it's a bit annoying. Another problem with the film is Marion Cotillard's thick French accent. I can't understand a lot of things, she's saying. I thought, it would be better if she spoke in French throughout the whole film and don't bother with English. Just add sub-titles. It would make the film, more realistic. Still, it was hard to believe that everybody that Gill meets in the past, besides Marion Cotillard's character, Adrianna is famous. Still, it was very nice to see the countless amounts of famous historic real life supporting characters, playing cameos throughout the film. You got singer, Cole Porter, artist, Pablo Picasso, author, T. S. Eliot, dancer, Josephine Baker, film maker, Jean Conteau, artist, Man Ray, bull fighter Juan Belmonte, and others. Some of the key character to look out for, are absurdly intense author, Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), straight forward writer counsel, Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), crazy artist, Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody), and the dysfunctional couple of Zelda &amp; F. Scott Fitzgerald (Alison Pil &amp; Tom Huddleston). They all play big parts in the plot. It's really hard to believe that all those legends really did converge on Paris around nearly the same time. If they did, I really doubt they all hang out, together in nearly the same places. There were a few historical inaccurates and plot-lines, but I can't blame Allen. This movie is pure fantasy, after all, and doesn't make any claims toward historical accuracy. Surprising, most historical elements were in fact accurate rather than exaggerated. It's fair to say, that this surrealism movie is a love letter to Paris. The film paints it, like every tourist wants it to be: romantic. The city was beautiful shot. If the place wasn't romantic, enough. This film will kinda overdo it. It really feels, a bit too gimmicky, buffeting you with every tourist site, the production can get their hands on. It's paint Paris in a good light, rather than showing you, any of the bad things about the city. The writing is pretty clever, and funny. It's perfectly paced, hits all the right notes. Glad, Woody Allen won Best Original Screenplay for that year. The music score was spectacular to listen to. The main theme "Parlez-Moi d'Amour" (Speak to Me of Love) work so well. It was written by Jean Lenoir and first made famous by Lucienne Boyer in 1930. This must be one of Woody's favorite songs, because he includes it in the 20's scenes notwithstanding that it hadn't yet been written. One song that would be funny to add is original lyrics to "Let's Do It (Let's Fall In Love)", by Cole Porter, but I guess that would be too racist. Overall: The movie is very funny, romantic and whimsical. If you love Paris, art or history, you have to see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Midnight in Paris" which is written and directed by Woody Allen. At first, I did not have special reasons to decide to watch this movie, I just thought that it seemed to interesting and the disk jacket was good. However, this movie was much better than I had expected.This movie is said that the best movie of Woody Allen's works and released an opening movie at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival for the first time. It got the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the Golden Glove Awards for Best Screenplay in 2012, and it was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Art Direction of the Academy Award. In many other movie festivals, this movie won some prizes and was nominated.The setting of this movie is Paris and there are many things related to Paris and the history of art and literature. The main character is Gil Pender who got a success as a Hollywood screenwriter. He has a wife, Inez, and her parents are rich. When her parents go to Paris, Gil and Inez also go with them. Gil loves Paris because he likes the 1920's literature and he longed for live in Paris. In addition, he wanted to be a writer in spite of his success at Hollywood. One day, a strange thing happened. When Gil was walking with drink on street at Paris, an old car ran to him. Some people in the car called him, "Come on!" then, he rode the car. The place he arrived was party but this party was not usual party. He was talked to by a man and he asked the man's name. The man's name was F. Scott Fitzgerald. Gil was very surprised and he thought "Is this man kidding me?" F. Scott Fitzgerald is a famous American writer and he is part of the Lost Generation. Gil realized he stepped back in time to the 1920's. Other days, he repeated time travel and he met many famous people, for example, Ernest Hemingway and Salvador Dalí. He experienced many things through his unique t Ike travel.At last, I will introduce three interesting points of "Midnight in Paris." First, there are many views of Paris and they are very beautiful. They make you comfortable and you can feel you are in Paris. Second, storyline. The kind of this movie is comedy and fantasy. These setting is often used but this story is not expectable so you can enjoy watching this movie. Third, unique characters. The main character, Gil, is very kind and interesting man. His action and talking are very fun! In addition, there are many unique people for example, Salvador Dalí. He is very funny person and the actor who played Dalí similar. These three ways, I really like this movie and recommend you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris is a fantasy/comedy shot in a beautifully and descriptive way. The movie tells the story of a nostalgic screenwriter named Gil (played by Owen Wilson) who goes to Paris on a business vacation with his fiancée Inez (played by Rachel McAdams)and her parents (played by Kurt Fuller, and Mimi Kennedy) and every day at midnight Gil goes back to 1920's Paris where he meets his literary idols such as F. Scott Fitzgerald (played by Tom Hiddleston), Ernest Hemingway (played by Corey Stoll), Gertrude Stien (played by Kathy Bates),Salvador Dali (played by Adrien Brody who is hilarious because he keeps on talking about rhinos), and his possible favorite artist Pablo Picasso (played by Marcial Di Fonzo Bo). With this movie I think that Allen's direction for this film was much better than his direction for Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) (I hope that all you other Woody Allen fans don't get offended because I still liked Hannah and Her Sisters.)-But in the end the end I think Allen's works are bizarre and interesting at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Travelling on streets is good but travelling in time is marvelous.I have heard of time travel in the film Shining but saw it happen one time after another in this film. Aptly titled, this film is about the mysterious life in Paris that revels in nostalgia. It still has the fragrance of those great artists that adored this great city from a Picasso to Hemingway to so many.Now there is our protagonist Gil Pender who loves the 1920's and very fluidly travels to 1920 and makes connections with the artists. Actually, there is not much of a story, but everything pops up in between, there is an artistis desire, there is infidelity there is an envy about another man and there is love for multiple woman. But all of that said, it's a journey of an artist.Oh, did I mention that this is a Woody Allen film, yes it is and its very Allenish. Now there can't be a movie without Allen so our hero Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is the Allen of the film who is very subconsciously driven and speaks out long sentences that make little meaning to others (but I could make out what he meant). He dreams, and when he realizes he seems so very lost, he does not know what to do and again gets lost. He just knows, he wants to stay in Paris. His every move evokes love for the great city.The art direction if anything is superficial and I envy every bit of it coz the Hollywood for every story have superb technicians and the way they use technology is simply superb. The cinematography is simple for few scenes like a chat between the characters and terrific when it has to bring Paris alive. Yes, certainly Paris is a character of the movie and right in the first few frames I realized this and in fact those first shots were the best of the movie in terms of showing Paris. Did I tell there is infidelity as common theme as in an Allen movie.All through, I can see Allen and his hope for bringing out yet another film that says Art for Art's sake and he succeeds yet again and he cannot fail coz there is a protagonist so strong in him that we can vie for and woo for. We surely want him to simply follow his dreams.It's a charming and an enchanting film nevertheless but it's not a story that we shall for long remember I believe. It did not engage me much in terms of screenplay or characterization to say so except for the enticement caused by the camera.Hail Allen, I give it 3/5. A good one to go for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgia questioned and Paris showcased at its loveliest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris does a great job of capturing the city at its best, and via the story of an engaged couple's adventures in Paris, takes a hard look at people's longing for an idealised past. Gil is an aspiring novelist who wants to ditch his job as a Hollywood scriptwriter and move to Paris. His fiancé Inez is the typical upper-middle class American tourist and of a far more practical bent. Everyday at midnight, Gil is transported back in time to 1920s Paris where he meets various literary and artistic greats (the Fitzgeralds, Hemingway, Picasso etc) who were living in the city at the time. He at first tries to bring Inez into this other world with him, but she is caught up with other pursuits.The cinematography was fantastic and showcased Paris at its loveliest (sans litter and crime and bad smells). The opening scenes showed many of the city's iconic spots, and served as a sort of explanation of Gil's great love for Paris that we later discover. There was no reason given for his travelling back in time, but somehow, it just wasn't needed. I love how Woody Allen used this same device to show how people romanticise the past, not realising that the present is actually pretty great. While in the 1920s, Gil, who sees that period as Paris's best, meets Adrianna, who longs for the Belle Epoque of the 1890s. And transported into that era briefly, they meet the men of that time who idealise the Renaissance. Beyond the message on nostalgia, I also liked how the film portrayed one of the (oft-neglected) possible effects of travel on romantic relationships - it can bring to light the differences between people that would, in a familiar environment, be hidden.I wouldn't say that this is a must-watch movie, but I think anyone who's into culture or has visited Paris will enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a concept. While on a trip to Paris with his fiancée's family, a nostalgic screenwriter finds himself mysteriously going back to the 1920s every day at midnight. Unfairly dismissed by some, this is a funny sex comedy. . It's not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something uplifting, or something with tons of action. The film is more than just a glimpse into the life of a man who does know how to live, but I was wondering if he served more as a metaphor for everyone of us as a part of the human race who live better when we're on a leash. I give it a final rating of 7 out of 10 because it's good but also kind of flawed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Looking Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this might be the easiest of Woody's movies to follow, and maybe the most entertaining. If you're not generally a fan of his brand of filmmaking, you might still enjoy this one. The movie starts out following the lives of a couple vacationing in Paris, Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams. They are engaged, but her parents aren't very approving, and Owen doesn't really fit in with her friends either. Everyone does a great job of being extremely unlikable, which makes it easy for the audience to side with odd man out Wilson. He eventually breaks free when he takes walk and gets transported to the past where he meets and parties with historical figures. Wilson's enthusiasm and timing are what made these scenes fun for me--he is so excited to be hanging out with Cole Porter and Zelda Fitzgerald. I was hoping Tom Hiddleston would be one of the highlights, but he isn't given much to do. Instead, the guy playing Hemingway totally steals it, and the rest of the movie doesn't have anything as awesome as his scenes. Except for the cinematography, which will make Paris look like the most amazing city on earth. Wilson eventually comes to understand that he doesn't want to live in the past, and that there are people from every generation who romanticize the time period before theirs. He embraces life and breaks up with McAdams' shrew, a much more evil character than the one she played in a movie that promised "Mean Girls" in its title. Although there were only a few scenes where the dialog was at its best, I am sure I will watch this movie again just for the incredible shots of the scenery. It's relaxing just thinking about those street scenes with the light rain reflecting off the pavement, almost like a perfect memory from a great vacation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie took me to a better place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The casting of this highly complex, imaginative film is spot on. Hemingway, Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Josephine Baker, Dali charm me into their world of literary and artistic wonder. I bought the film and have watched it several times; I realize that it's actually about the philosophy of living your best life at the best time, which seems perhaps narcissistic, but I personally wouldn't mind going back to the twenties in Paris. At least the traffic would be manageable. :) When Owen Wilson quotes Faulkner, "The past isn't past; it's still important and affecting us," (paraphrase), I began to see the philosophy of this important film, which Owen Wilson self-effacing charm adds volumes to. I see this as an important statement about living life to the fullest with the right people at the right time, face-to-face. It's a challenge to the cellphone, computer absorption of our current 2014, which erodes the significance of human emotions, encounters and literature. I love this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris is a confuse film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris is a romantic, comedy and fantasy film, written and directed by Woody Allen. The film was released in 2011 in United States. It has famous actors as Owen Wilson, Marion Coillard and Rachel McAdams. However, is a boring, tedious and confusing film.Firstly, the plot is not good. The story is about Gil (Owen Wilson), an American author and screenwriter, which always wanted to be a famous author (recognized by everyone). Once, he traveled with his wife Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents to Paris, where Gil stayed absolutely impressed (besides that Paris is an incredible city). He performs several night rides all alone. Furthermore, he discovered a magical and surprisingly thing, when the clocks stroke of midnight, he was transported to Paris of the 1920s (the time and place considered the best of all). This "travel" to the past made Gil spoke with several intellectuals and artists that he admires, as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.Moreover, he fall in love with Adriana (Marion Coillard), a beautiful girl, but he could only see her after midnight (when he was transported to the past). This because she doesn't really exist (she had already died). Therefore, when he came back to the past, he could see the authors (because in 1920 they were still alive). In the end of the story, Inez discovered that Gil was in love with Adriana (she discovered by a private detective hired by Inez's fathers). As a result, Gil stayed alone, trying to understand what happened with his life (the ''travel'' after midnight, his experiences, his relation with Inez, etc). As it is clear, the story is very confuse. It's very easy to get lost and people don't understand the main message. Besides Woody Allen is a spectacular screenwriter, he always want to send a message for people. However, the problem of the film is not the director, but is the plot, especially the chronology of facts and the knowledge that people must have before seeing it. Due to it, a person that didn't know about Paris and about famous intellectual and artists will undoubtedly not understand the film. Midnight in Paris is not a film that explain the facts. It just show them and don't explain about the artists, their life, what they have done, why they are important, etc. Consequently, it is quite difficult to understand the film, the relation between the main character (Gil) and the artists (each one specifically), and Gil's life (because past and present are mixed). Moreover, even people that have this history knowledge, get lost. This because the film started showing the life of an important artist and then, suddenly, it changed and started to tell about another famous artist. As each artist has specifically characteristics, lifestyle, we didn't understand what Woody Allen pretend to say with it. Consequently, the person that is seeing it get really lost, she doesn't know exactly when he is in the past and when he is in the present because those times are mixed, making the film kind of incomprehensible.Another relevant point is that the special effects are not so good. In the beginning of Gil's ''travel'' it is acceptable, but, the others special effects are really bad, and they don't contribute to the comprehension of the story (making the person, again, totally lost). Also, Gil's life is very confuse, sometime he is talking with some artist that has already died and sometime he is talking with her wife (there is a confuse communicate with past and present). To sum up, the plot is relatively creative, but it is really confuse, it doesn't has chronological facts (always mix the present and the past), the special effects are really bad, and the film requires a history knowledge that some people haven't. In my point of view, a good film doesn't require people's prior knowledge, but take them into the story, as if the person were in the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautifully Restless Look at the Human Condition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris tells a beautiful story of restlessness and creativity in life, through the eyes of writer Gil (Owen Wilson) ? Bored of current life, Gil finds himself captured by nostalgia on a trip to Paris with his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her family ? and every night at midnight he finds himself strangely visiting 1920&#x2032;s Paris.Set against the romantic backdrop of Paris, the film is visually stunning: Paris itself is a wonder both on screen and in real life and the film manages to capture its natural beauty perfectly without being too cliché. The clash between modern day France and the 20&#x2032;s setting that Gil visits is wonderful and has a real atmosphere of opportunity and promise, the very things that draw him into the midnight "world" in the first place. Wilson is charming as the lost writer, a refreshing and pensive difference from McAdam's character who jars against his creative nature, drawing a deeper void between their relationship as their time in Paris progresses. Contrast is used to perfection in this in every way. Wilson's character meets many literary greats on his midnight journey who help him write his first novel: anyone who's familiar with the works of writers such as F.Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll) will enjoy the many literary references throughout their conversations with Gil.What really drew me in was the story and its raw examination of the human condition, which in itself is a fascinating topic. It looks at those things that are inherent in each and every person: in this context, curiosity, restlessness, and desire. It doesn't try to sugar-coat it ? Gil is unhappy with life and he doesn't make any attempt to prevent himself from going in search of a new one (albeit in the past). That's what makes this film so enjoyable, the relatability of the desire for something better ? "the grass is always greener" ? and the restlessness that we feel when we're searching for that something better.Midnight in Paris is beautiful: the story is captivating and keeps you thinking long after it's finished. Few films manage such an honest look at the restless nature of humans, let alone done in such an intriguing style as this. Prepare to have your curiosity captured by creativity and the promise of opportunity: it may just make you feel like a midnight stroll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>strange and surreal, typical Woody Allen, yet not in NYC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a love letter to Paris, a picture postcard of the city at it's most beautiful, even in the rain. Owen as hapless Gil Prender is the artistically minded writer who dreams of Paris in the 1920s and through a medium that isn't mentioned or explained, ends up there - in the 1920s and meets many of his heroes, and falls out of love with his fiancé along the way.At first intriguing and exciting, the film becomes a little lack-lustre as the characters from Gil's own belle epoque come thick and fast on the screen; Hemmingway, TS Elliot and F Scott Fitzgerald to name a few, and so it becomes a little silly. It's a philosophical (typical of Allen) existential piece with thought provoking monologues on man's inability to see the perfection of where he is now rather than hankering for a time long past and much is made of lights at night in the rain, and art and the artist's search for perfection and beautiful women. Quelle surprise! Owen was perfectly cast; hapless, romantic, a little of the underdog but still attractive and witty and with plenty to offer, although his current fiancé doesn't seem to see that. From the start they don't seem suited and his Inez played by Rachel McAddam, is instantly unlikeable. Comedic only in a dry Woody Allen-esque observational way, there are few laugh out loud moments but the film is humorous, uplifting and ultimately pleasing whereas the first two thirds you are stumped how it is going to pan out. Time travel aspects aside, there is much to enjoy, and whilst I enjoyed the time travel bit, it would have helped if there was some sort of explanation but Owen's disbelief, to incredulity to joy were good enough, and really well depicted.A strange ensemble cast of many familiar faces, and a very well directed and realised story. The dialogue was a little bit staccato in places but overall I enjoyed this film a lot and felt "good" after it. A sort of loss of romance romantic film... if you can imagine such a thing. Would watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Literary Fantasy not my taste but I won't hold it against the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gil (Owen Wilson) is on a trip to Paris with his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her rich conservative family. One night, Gil takes a walk by himself as Inez goes dancing with her friends. A car stops and picks up Gil who is a little tipsy. He ends up in a party in the 1920s with some literary luminaries of the times. He's an amateur writer and is in awe of the company. He can't seem to take Inez there, but he goes back every night to see his new found friends especially Adriana (Marion Cotillard).This must be what a fantasy looks like to the literary set. There is a lack of tension. This is more lyrical and more whimsical. The real world holds no interest for me, and I couldn't care less if Gil walks away from it all. My solution would be to fuse the characters Gabrielle (Léa Seydoux) and Adriana together. The fantasy world isn't real enough for me. Gil is constantly in awe. It feels like a costume party with all the literary name dropping. It's not really my field of expertise and I may be missing a lot. It is however very well done with Owen Wilson's great wide-eyed character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew nothing of this movie as I brought up the stream from Amazon IV this afternoon. But I love Paris. And I was bored. I didn't bother with any reviews, I just went for it..I actually groaned as the opening credits cited "Written and Directed by Woody Allen". I'm just not a fan of his work, being as I am a stage actor who's used to tight dialogue with no sign of improv. I'm also not big on Owen Wilson, who to me is a rather whiny, limp wristed actor. Perhaps that's why Allen chose him for the film.But Wilson actually does a very good job as the insecure writer, Gil, with lost puppy eyes who's run roughshod by his fiancée (Rachel McAdams) and her wealthy overbearing parents. In fact the cast is superbly chosen, from Michael Sheen's smarmy, pedantic, arrogant professor through to Adrien Brody's marvellously weird, rhino-obsessed Dali.And then there's Marion Cotillard, with whom I fell in love in A Good Year, and who never fails to bring a scene to life with her sultry smile, fabulous accent, and flawless delivery.It's a slow-starting film, with not a lot of substance until Gil drops back in time to the 1920's and starts bumping into his heroes. Then the wit and the charm come rolling forward, buoyed by some stunning sets and equally stunning costumery.If you like your art and lit, you'll love this. It's not without its flaws, but it has enough substance to overcome them and take you right through to the (somewhat corny) ending with a smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ode to to the city of love and love itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the start it get's pretty clear that the director (Woody Allen) has a a big love for the city of love by starting with a few minutes of shot's from the streets Paris. What a coincidence that love is also the main subject of this movie. Not only the love struggles of the main character But also the city itself is adored by this movie. Being noticeably present in the background by showing famous places and people who have lived in in the history of Paris. Right now this might sound more like a documentary but it definitely isn't. It's more like a love letter about love to a charming place called Paris and the result is a really fine and charming movie. The main character is played by woody Owen Wilson. He's a slightly melancholic and daydreaming writer, traveled to Paris with his almost wife to gain some more inspiration for his newest book. It appears that a writer's block isn't the only problem he's struggling with because dealing with love appears to be the biggest problem for him when he falls in love with a girl not being out of his league but in another century. In case you were wondering how some historical figures ended op in the movie, well this is the moment to explain. Midnight in Paris take's an quite original and refreshing take on time -traveling movies by not portraying time traveling with an machine or another mysterious device. The main character just appears to be in the roaring 20's all of a sudden when the clock rings 12 o clock and midnight starts. This make's the concept of time traveling way more fascinating because you start to wonder whether what's happening is real or of it's just the main character getting lost in his own fantasy and in the city of love. Throughout the story, the movie will give some hints about if it's real or not. Owen Wilson does a really great job playing an eccentric and dreamy guy who sometimes kinda lives in his own world for a bit. The movie also does a really great job of capturing the mood he's in and gives the movie a slightly dreamy but still really enjoyable vibe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hesitant to see the movie first. I must admit that I underestimated the acting qualities of Owen Wilson. He should be given more opportunities to act in good movies. It's was an attractive movie, in the real sense of attracting. I didn't stop watching it until the end. I even listened to the music at the very end when the film credits where running over the screen. Something I seldom do.To paraphrase the movie: I saw a photo. I saw a film. I saw a rhinoceros. The past is not dead. It's not even past, you know. Actually, Paris is the most beautiful when it rains. It was like a dream. I was dreaming. Even educated flees do it. You should dream too.

		<fullReview>Woody Allen, hmmm, what is there to say about this clown, this writer, this I guess non-actor, or voice and heart of sleeze and wine. I think it's wonderful, that Woody started his career writing comedy, that eventually lead to standup and then into the movies and with it, his version of Hollywood.He brings a Nerdtopia to his films. If a joke can make you feel more attracted to the balding man, the elder fool, the goofball and intellectual. Eclectism reigns king with Mr. Allen, a newyork aristocrat.As, much as I like Woody, I don't like his films! With the exception of this romantic comedy. Midnight In Paris, is a excellent movie in English. Some of these scenes look like paintings with camera framing and coloring. I, do think Woody has reached his best work here, and, I am sure more to come from the aging star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you forgive an old man his whimsy? If so then this is a good film, not a great film, but a fine piece of comedic fluff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been quite a few years now but still every new Woody Allen film is greeted with praise of "return to form" just as surely as the next film will also be greeted the same way. Midnight in Paris is one such film although I wasn't so sure and although I like Woody Allen, I never got moved to actually watch it until recently. The film opens with a visual feast of Paris ? which is a beautiful city but one I find too expensive and, contrary to this film, it is no fun at all when it is chucking down with rain. The opening shots are more than just to get you in the mood for a film that loves the place and the history, it tells you a lot about the film itself because this is a romantic fantasy where Allen loses himself into whimsy and lightness.The tone throughout is typical Allen, with the intellectual humor played out in the style you expect. I will not pretend to get all of the references but at least knew enough about the characters and their work to be able to keep up with it (ironically some of the people I know because of Allen's other work). It is never more than fluff though, so to enjoy it you do need to go with it and forgive the film for being what it is ? if you are not in the mood for this then I think it will grate on you heavily. Personally I enjoyed it because of how light and easy to enjoy it was, but I did still need to forgive it its fantasy and muddled nature ? the conclusion of the final few scenes sort of contradicts itself and is all too silly and romantic, but by that point you'll probably have warmed to it or switched it off.The cast buy into the whimsy pretty well. Wilson leads the cast well and his natural style actually fits the Allen-impression that every leading man ends up giving in one of his films. McAdams is really enjoyable next to him ? again she fits that role that you see so often in Allen's films. Support is good from Cotillard (who really is a lovely presence as required by the character), Sheen, Hiddleson, Stoll, Brody, Bates and many others. Everyone has that light touch that fits so well with the tone and place of the film.Overall Midnight in Paris is not some wonderful return to form but it is a light and enjoyable piece of whimsy that fans of Allen will enjoy and forgive ? but even they will need to have some forgiveness because it is fluffy and light. Those that dislike the man and his style will find a great deal to hate here but for me I liked it once I got into its tone and pace ? it is as charming and as make-believe as the places our main characters jump to, but it works for what it is. A good film, not a great one unless you're in the mood, but it could be a fine comedy. And then Hemmingway punched me in the mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This dreamy film is especially moving due to its atmosphere, and I admit I didn't know how to explain it. Of course the visuals are stunning, but it's not just that. Obviously the 'artsy' premise is decisive for that magic feel. Even Owen Wilson, whom I usually don't like, added a touch of innocence and credibility, despite the fact that his character was a 21st century Allen (and well done, for that matter). It's very rare that a film suggests so strongly an atmosphere. I don't know how much has this artistic and idealized Paris in common with the one in the real world of today. But it's worth it. Previously I wasn't that fascinated by Paris as some of my friends... Previously!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A whimsical romantic comedy that captures the viewers attention.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Midnight In Paris, Directed by Woody Allen, is a whimsical romantic comedy that captures the viewers attention. In the beginning, Woody Allen shows the characters Inez (Rachel McAdams) and Gil (Owen Wilson) to be madly in love. Because Gil is as in love with Paris as he is with Inez, they visit with Inez's parents. Oddly enough, Inez runs into a friend from college who doesn't ring Gil's bell. Gil tries to avoid him throughout the whole movie and ends up wandering the streets of Paris. Allen creatively transforms current day Paris into Paris in the 1920's without showing how time was turned. There are a few underlying themes in the movie. Between Gil and his fiancé there is a mistrust in the relationship. Inez doesn't trust Gil because he thinks about giving up on his career and Gil doesn't trust Inez because of the guy she reconnects with from college. Also, there is strong theme of nostalgia. Gil believes that he belongs in the 1920's, while his fiancé just wants him to snap out of it, causing more trouble in their relationship. I thought it was clever to intertwine something that Gil is so passionate about into ruining the "love." When picking the cast for this film, Woody Allen sold the part of Inez to Rachel McAdams by telling her, "You don't want to go through life playing these beautiful girls. You want to play some bitchy parts, it's more interesting for you." Allen and Owen Wilson have such great chemistry together that it made the movie very easy to film. The only reason that Woody Allen made this movie was because he likes to make movies. He enjoys making films and claims that it only helps that other people like them. The way that movie came together from the beginning to the end was very interesting to me. Allen does a fantastic job of capturing the beauty of Paris throughout the film. Every step of the way there is something beautiful on the screen, whether it's Paris itself, a woman, or a couple. I loved every camera shot and how the cinematographer caught the essence of "real life" in a great portion of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At school children are made to read Shakespeare and told that it is good for them. As you get older, critics tell you to watch Woody Allen films because its good for you, whilst you think my word that was a chore and that's watching one of his more acclaimed film from the late 1970s and early 1980s.In the last decade Allen has spent more time making films is Europe with mixed results although I liked Match Point and Scoop.Midnight in Paris allows him to give us picture postcard portraits of Paris, be funny, whimsical, allow time travel and conclude that its better to live in the now rather than hark back to the distant past and a mythical golden age.Owen Wison plays an aspiring liberal novelist having a break in Paris with his fiancée and her wealthy Tea Party supporting parents. Whilst having a stroll on his own one evening and getting lost, he gets into a vintage car and is transported to the 1920s where he parties with Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway and the like. The events stir up his creative juices and realises that he needs to confront issues in his present life.Owen Wilson takes a break from his normal comedy films to do his turn for Woody Allen and acquits himself well. He is outshone by the cameos from Adrien Brody, Tom Hiddleston, Marion Cotilard, Kathy Bates who play famous artists and writers, muses from the past.Once the film gets going, its enthralling, maybe too much of a tourist advert for Paris but its nice to see Woody having fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exquisite scenery, clever observations about life, and witty dialog are all part of its charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Plot) Owen Wilson embarks on a journey back in time to the 1920's where he gets inspiration for his novel. He begins to wonder about his current situation with fiancée (McAdams) whilst in this magical time period and even indulges in romance and other pleasures of lifeIt's really hard to write a review about this film without spoiling so much of the wonder or the amazement. The big thing you must do in this film is go with it. If you choose to concentrate on the believability of it all, you'll most likely find your viewing experience tarnished. It's a fantasy type of premise, so you should know going in that it might strain credibility for you if you focus on it, but if you decide to go into the world of Woody Allen, you'll more than likely have a blast like I did. I'll be honest. I haven't seen many of Woody Allen's films, but Woody Allen never skimps out on making sure the dialog is crisp and witty, and this film was no different. It's just a terrific film that put me in a good mood after it was all said and done. Owen Wilson usually annoys me to no end, but he was perfect for this part. I shockingly enjoyed him very much, and loved his performance. He can be talented after all! Rachel McAdams is charming as per usual, even if her character is a tad snobbish. The rest of the cast does greatFinal Thoughts: Just go with it. If you can't find enjoyment from this movie, I'd really suggest that you put a halt to watching movies in general. There is real magic in this movie, and I just hope you appreciate it8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people might say that this is a very easy movie. Well, they're not wrong. It's not super complicated. It's quite predictable actually. But still, do all movies have to be about the meaning of life, full of wisdom and so on? I think no. Some movies are just there for relaxation.I'm not saying that this movie is really simple and not worth watching. On the contrary - it has quite an important subject nowadays. How many times have you bee speaking to other people and heard that they do not belong in this time? "oh, I should have been born in the 70s, because I so belong there" "the music is not good now, I wish I have lived in he golden days of AC/DC and Led Zeppelin" "people don't know how to behave now, I should have been born in the 50s" and so on. Or it's not the right country, not the right attitude of people or? The list in my opinion is endless.So, what this movie does, it takes a confused writer and sends him to the golden age where he meets Hemingway, Fitzgerald and others. His writing improves, his view broadens. But through his journey we come to understand that if you are unhappy with the present, you will always find excuses. We come to understand that it is not the time that makes the age golden - it's the people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. For me it's a mix between the charming, old Paris, and the mind of an artist(writer). And Paris seems the perfect place to spark one's creativity. So many artists were inspired throughout history, by the magic of this place. Another great part of movie is Gil's desire to live in past times, and again Paris is the perfect city for this too. The old but perfectly preserved buildings, the paved streets, and the whole atmosphere makes you feel like you're not in the present anymore. I think his relationship with Inez is just a representation of his imagination and inspiration, which are trapped in the present and this is a drag for him, as a writer. It's a lovely movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen's best movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having made 40 motion pictures, one would think that a screenwriter/director can't come up with new material anymore. But Woody Allen, cinema's greatest veteran, always presents us new ideas for the big screen. By declaring his love to Paris while subtly including time travelling, the septuagenary New Yorker managed to revolutionize romantic comedies once again; a task that seemed virtually impossible given the copious amounts of romcoms that have been brought to us over the years. And not only did he renew the game with Midnight in Paris, Allen also created one of the most beautiful movies in recent history - both on the outward and the inward.Don't get frightened after the first three and a half minutes, Woody Allen also has something different to offer than shots of Paris' most beloved sights set to the soundtrack of a bygone era. Soon afterwards, we make an acquaintance with Gil Pender, an established Californian screenwriter turned author that holidays in Paris with his fiancée Inez. Gil's adoration for their resort is made clear in the first spoken lines of the movie when he suggests giving up their Pasadena residence for a gorgeous little house in the city of love, while Inez is dismissive and obviously more interested in silvery wedding rings and grossly overpriced interior decoration than in the Montmartre or the Champs- Élysées. Then, the introduction to some other cast members is made - unsympathetic supporting characters that are high in number: Inez' parents as well as her teenage crush Paul and his wife are on the spot and they are the epitome of bourgeois douchebags. Understandably enough, Gil isn't very pleased with them and isn't able to take their presence for very long, but because his future wife finds more pleasure in dancing with Paul than strolling with Gil, he finds himself giving F. Scott Fitzgerald relational advise and getting writing tips from Ernest Hemingway moments later. Okay, now that last part didn't make sense.In short, Midnight in Paris is the typical Woody Allen movie (amusing relationship problems plus beautiful images and music) with a twist. The time-travel thing is really not what audiences had expected from him, but thankfully, we're not taken in an odd future world in which a love story between humans and aliens is showcased. We are taken into the golden age of the 20s in which a love story between humans and dead humans is showcased. If you think about it that way, it doesn't become any less weird, actually. But hey, it's Woody Allen. That guy is the master of romantic cinema so why not try depicting necrophilia?Forgive me for the last stanza, Midnight in Paris is, in fact, one of the loveliest romances I've ever seen. Paris as a setting makes every movie better, but there's more to it than that: an exceptionally good screenplay full with witty dialogue and interesting characters, a myriad of talented actors, and the basic nostalgic urge that almost everyone possesses. Allen fingers with this and shows us that is isn't a 21st century delusion in a clever way. And if you weren't aware of being nostalgic before, this movie will surely change your mind and maybe will make you go to the Rue Saint-Étienne du Mont on your next vacation in Paris, waiting for a vintage car to bring you back in time just in the manner of Gil's midnight journeys. As always in his movies, Allen has piled up a tremendous amount of prominent actors with the unusual choices of comedy players Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams in the leading roles. I don't want to exaggerate in any point, but those two totally perform better than ever in Midnight in Paris and when I watch the movie, I always like to think that their roles in it are the only roles they've ever played, so I can blank out the weaker moments in their careers. The supporting cast includes surprises like Oscar winners Marion Cotillard, Adrien Brody (as a hilarious Salvador Dalí), and Kathy Bates as well as France's former First Lady Carla Bruni as a Museum Guide, Tom Hiddleston as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Michael Sheen as the aforementioned overdouchy Paul. In some cases, the characters are better known as the actors playing them, for example when seeing Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, Luis Bu?uel, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, or Paul Gauguin. Furthermore, Allen's mise- en-sc?ne is absolutely masterful in terms of stage design, cinematography, or the soundtrack choices and all in all, he managed to create a diverting nostalgic romcom that kept me grinning like an imbecile during its full 94 minutes running time. Midnight in Paris is a fantastic movie even if you don't spend time thinking about why it is fantastic; it simply makes you happy and will probably tempt you to move to Paris. It's a funny, romantic, and most of all realistic take on love that is completely flawless. And additionally, you'll want to watch it again right after finishing and that's what made me give it 10/10- rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accurate Representation of Human Dissatisfaction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many different ways, Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris very accurately captures the subject of human fascination. Not only does the scenery and imagery of the city lure and mesmerize, Allen's story line accurately depicts the mystical illusion that is Paris; a place full of beauty, romance, and wonder. Placing this story line in such a place emphasizes this theme of fascination considering the ever present attraction to Parisian lifestyle. The protagonist, Gil Pender greatly shares in this view point. Obsessed by the idea of the magical city, Gil makes Paris his muse and immerses himself in the scenery as a source of creativity and inspiration. Through late night walks and immersion in the culture, Gil becomes more familiar with the city and later finds a new enthrallment when another time period whisks him away from his own. His fascination with this other life draws him further away from his reality. Now, the idea of Paris alone cannot be enough to fulfill his need of inspiration and life satisfaction. His muse no longer lies in modern day Paris, but the Golden Age of the city; the 1920's. However, Gil can hardly be blamed for his determination to be immersed in such a romanticized time period full of overwhelmingly glamorous, luxurious, and creative individuals. The question of Gil's desire for the past becomes answered when he meets Adriana, a beautiful and intriguing woman living in the twenties. The answer does not lie simply in his infatuation with her entirely, but through the idea that she too has grown discontent with her own time period. Once Adriana and Gil travel to a completely different time together, Adriana feels like she would be more happy staying there rather than going back to her own. Gil cannot comprehend why Adriana would want to leave Paris in the 1920s. Not only does Gil find this time period so inspiring, it has a reputation of being the 'Golden Age' and is so widely appreciated. The idea that Adriana would want anything but her current life initially stuns Gil. Therefore, sensing Adriana's discontentment with calling that time period her home makes him realize his reasoning behind his own longing to venture into the unknown. The unfamiliarity of the twenties makes life so exciting for Gil, especially compared to his increasingly dull relationship with Inez, representing human beings boredom, but comfort with the familiar. Fascination strictly drives Gil towards the past throughout Midnight in Paris. His decision to ultimately go back to his reality stems from the realization that he attached himself to an idea of a better life, when actually, he would simply be the same person stuck within a different setting. Nonetheless, the 1920's gave Gil a significant amount of stimulation. He sees that it was not just the 'Golden Age' he gets mesmerized by, but the idea of a whole new life, conveniently placed during a time when he is getting closer to settling down into an unsatisfying relationship. The twenties serve as an instrument of freedom where Gil is finally able to express the creativity that Inez looks down upon and therefore limits. Hence, when questioning why Gil feels the desire to back in time in Midnight in Paris, it is because he is simply fascinated with a world that is not his own. He sees a different life and pictures himself being more content there. The exact same can be said about Adriana, proving the relevance of fascination in this situation. Gil's reasoning is completely understandable and even relevant in daily life. It highlights the common struggle of dissatisfaction felt by each person. Instead of running away permanently to his new life, Gil decides to correct the problems in his current one. By using self reflection, he finds what he can change in his own life to make him happy, rather than running away to a new one. He realizes that fascination can only go so far, until the new life gets as familiar as the old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Owen Wilson plays Woody Allen in a total repudiation of Allen's 1990s movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Midnight in Paris" confirms what I've always thought: Woody Allen's best movies are the ones in which he goes straight for comedy. With Owen Wilson as a neurotic writer on vacation in the French capital and traveling back to the 1920s to meet the American writers who lived there at the time, it's one of Allen's cleverest movies. I felt like I was never going to forgive him after he made the über-atrocious "Everyone Says I Love You" (about which there was NOTHING to love), but his movies got better after that (I especially liked "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion" and "Scoop"). But this one is the cream of the crop. Allen definitely needs to make more of these. I'd also like to see him make another sci-fi flick like "Sleeper". Maybe even his very own slasher flick (he would presumably play a neurotic guy who rambles about intellectualism while butchering depraved teens).Anyway, this is a really good movie. You gotta see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this movie really tells a message that our present-day world is in need of. It aims to make us understand that we should escape more often the rules that govern our daily life, our society, our entourage, everything that surrounds us and makes us act like some robotized creatures, dominated by mercantilism and falsity. It tells the story of the intellectual who confronts himself with so-called social problems because of his different way of seeing and experiencing life. Paris is a portal for the protagonist through which he accesses the past eras that he thinks he belongs to, but also the change of the living ambient that reveals the differences between his and his wife's ways of seeing things and living. Great script, the movie is catchy from start to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris at Midnight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today at noon I watched this great movie second time by one of the finest director Woody Allen. The movie does it's best in all aspects, It has pretty good screenplay, astounding cinematography and melodious music. When I watched it firstly it was nearly midnight. And I got to say that the movie's real magic works at midnight. Though I liked it more or less the second time. Editing was superbly creative. I remembered the title sequence at the starting just when Gil starts to talk with his fiancée you can see "Midnight in Paris" which remarkably fits the space. The theme is creative and I always thought about nostalgia and I guess it haven't been yet shown in any other movie. We all have conceptualized the golden era by our notion. The movie portrays this very well. I must say that it is one of the best movies I ever watched. I think the movie inspires me both on cinematic achievement and characterization.If you haven't watched it you are missing a whole lot fun.Remember to watch it at midnight!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody nails it this time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie doesn't make you want to up sticks and move to Paris instantly, you must be as dead as a cold dead fish that's been dead for a really, really long time. The beautiful imagery of the Parisian streets, lights, bridges, markets, monuments, cafés, bars and even the muddy Seine itself seem to explode with vibrancy and colour (especially in the rain). Owen Wilson plays Gil, a troubled and insecure writer trying to escape from the grind of rolling out formulaic Hollywood scripts so that he can use his writing talents in a more edifying way. His fiancée, Inez (played by Rachel McAdams), is not particularly supportive of his desired career change (nor of him in general it seems) and her 'one-dimensional' parents are openly dismissive of Gil and are generally the kind of people that Woody Allen despises and is not subtle in the least about showing it!.Gil and Inez end up in Paris, tagging along with Inez's parents and Gil falls totally in love with Paris. The more enamoured he becomes, the more apparent the differences between him and Inez become. This movie very cleverly (but rather blatantly) exposes the great rift between 'romantics' and 'materialists' ; 'dreamers' and 'realists'. Gil's obsession with Paris in the 20s leads him to question his modern life and drift back to the nostalgia of an age long past. One questions whether Gil is deluded by his romanticism and is just 'trying to be happy' - seeking the things he loves, the era he loves, the authors, painters and literary figures he loves but it really doesn't matter because this movie is touching, sumptuous in its portrayal of Paris, and Owen Wilson so perfectly captures the Woody Allen-esque character of a slightly troubled man who is not always in his comfort zone around his peers. In fact Wilson's portrayal of Gil and his acting out of many of Allen's gestures and foibles is subtly and brilliantly done yet all the while he manages to maintain his unmistakable 'Wilson-ness'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sells Paris But Little Else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no idea what to expect when I rented this movie. I actually decided to rent it because I LOVE Rachel McAdams. Unfortunately, her character was not likable in this movie and her role was not all that important in the grand scheme of the movie either.This movie was different to say the least. I found the parts that took place in the past to be the most interesting. Although I understand what this movie was saying, basically "the grass is always greener on the other side", that is not the aspect that pulled me in. The storyline was interesting, and I was intrigued by the famous people of history brought in.The downside of this movie is that it isn't all that entertaining. I wouldn't watch it again out of any fond love for this flick or for entertainment value. I would absolutely never consider this movie a comedy. I didn't laugh once. If anything it is a romance/drama. I really don't get the huge success of this hardly heard of film either. It just doesn't stand out as a great film to me, although the ones that win awards rarely do.The one lovely aspect of watching this film is that I absolutely want to visit Paris now. If they were trying to sell Paris or vacations to Paris, this flick would do it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Thought It Was Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just say, it is refreshing to see that people are once again putting heart, soul, and character back into movies. I am a huge fan of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Picasso, and many of the other figures that appeared in this movie, and I was happy to see them portrayed how I felt to be effectively. Even as a Conservative, I was able to laugh at some of the jokes at the Republican Party's expense, and the tasteless view of the world Gil's fiancé and in-laws were supposed to have as Right-Wingers. It didn't deter the magic of the movie for me at all, and goes to show that even though I might completely disagree with Woody Allen politically, there is no denying his true genius in cinema. Very funny, very charming, and somewhat inspiring. I could see myself in Gil more than once, and it felt good to have some of my closeted inner feelings about my own generation expressed on the silver screen. Great movie, would recommend it to anyone for an easy and fun viewing. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While vacationing in Paris, and engaged couple realizes that their views on life are maybe too different. While the couple is going separate ways, the movie focuses on how the man, Gil, is finding himself and falling in love with the city itself and the secrets it has. The characters of the movie were cast well, each bringing something new to the scenes. You can see the relationships the way that some relationships change whether they be for the better or the worse. While I enjoyed the film, I have never been partial to sci-fi aspects in movies. The sci-fi in this film is just the idea of time-traveling. While it was a feel-good film that I thoroughly enjoyed, I didn't find myself getting lost in the story. Midnight in Paris has two groups of people that are quite literally separated by time. The only connector that can jump between the groups in Gil, the main character who jumps from present time to the 1920's (his idea of the golden age); but then again that could make him a whole new group for just himself. One group is from the 21st century, present time. This group includes Gil's fiancée, Inez, and their friends such as the museum Guide. The other group is the characters that Gil meets in the 1920's. He meets the famous author Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Picasso, Dali, and the beautiful Adrianna. The group from the 1920's is very lively and Gil finds himself waiting until midnight so he can go to visit them. He develops a feeling that he belongs there rather than in his own time. Gil is even working on a novel, but having trouble so he asks Ernest Hemingway for help and advice. Gil and Inez go to Paris to have a nice vacation together before they get married. During their vacation, they each want to do completely different things and don't necessarily end up spending all that much time being together or at least happy while they are together. To spend the rest of your life with someone who doesn't want the same things as you, seems unreasonable to not only yourself, but the other person in the relationship. Allen uses this marriage/pre-marriage relationship to move the story along and emphasize that Gil is happier in the 1920' rather than the time period he was born into. We see this relationship falling apart in the movie, but if you look around in the real world, relationships fall apart due to similar reasons all the time. People in today's society are so strong-willed and outspoken that it is often more difficult to find someone that wants all the same things out of life as you. Woody Allen uses this film to emphasize that the present day generation is so focused on itself. We don't really take the time to appreciate the past, such as the 1920's, and everything that was popular at that time. Gil believes he is born in the wrong time and would give anything to live in his golden age, the 1920's. Then Allen goes on to show that every generation focuses on themselves. Adrianna, although she is from the 1920's, wishes she were farther back in time in a different era. Allen shows that appreciation for our history is healthy for individuals in society. While not a fan of the sci-fi/time traveling idea, I enjoyed the lessons that were learned by the main character throughout the story line. And I liked how time travel was used subtly in this film. Midnight in Paris wasn't advertised because of the time travel aspect, it was advertised because of the infatuation with the 1920's. Gil, the main character, sees this era as the golden age, and loves his time spent there more than his time spent in present day Paris. Woody Allen, the director, taught me with the film, that sci-fi doesn't necessarily mean there are going to be aliens and witchcraft present. Escaping to Paris in the 1920's brings Gil a new sense of how to live life and be happy at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris was released in 2011. This film mixes comedy, fiction and love, all under the signature of Woody Allen. The film tries to reflect a utopian view of "The City of Light" where everything can happen if you dream, and of course, if you are a true romantic. The film is essentially about meeting with the past to be in peace with the present. It is interesting how the main point of the movie is not getting stuck in one glorious moment, to move on in life, yet it seems like the whole setting of the movie has an obsessive relationship with the city of Paris. All the shots of Paris, especially the ones from the 1920's, appear with a sense of gold color to build the image of a romantic, sensual city where anything can happen. The film definitely tries to give out the image of a place to fall in love. A little bit into the movie, Inez decides to leave Gil and go partying with Paul and his wife. When they get inside the taxi, Inez is the one sitting in between the couple which gives the audience the impression of some kind of adultery about to happen in between Inez and Paul. We can classify our protagonist (Gil) as a pure romantic, even when his wife has clearly cheated on him, he does not want to admit it until someone else tells him. He lives in his own little world of beauty and romance where everything seems to be more appreciated the older it becomes. He soon realizes that something is missing in his life as a Hollywood screenwriter, and he is not satisfied with his job, in his attempt to pursue something to make him happy he decides to start writing a novel. He doesn't realize that his novel is nothing else but the reflection of his own life. He lives in a perpetual stage of nostalgia, wishing to live in "the good old times". The main reason for this to happen is because of his non-fulfilling life that he definitely needs a change, and he comes to that conclusion in Paris. There is a very well defined classification of people in this movie. We find the empirical, unromantic and materialistic side of the world. This group is represented by Inez, her family, and Paul. On the other side we find the intellectual, idealist and romantic type of people. This group is represented by Gil and all the artists. Also at the end of the movie we see those two worlds collide, presenting the beautiful young woman who seems to be the perfect fit for Gil. She is a dreamer, she likes "Paris under the rain" and she is from the same decade as Gil which shows that at the end, people can find happiness if they keep their eyes open. It is quite obvious that the director tried to make the two different kinds of people very weighty in the movie. Inez strongly represents the empirical part of the society while Gil represents the complete opposite. Both personalities are exaggerated to show the division of the world between believers and non believers of love. This particular young couple has an interesting reaction to Paris. It is known that Paris is the city of love, many couples escape to that romantic place to fix their problems. The surprising component of this movie is that Paris does nothing but tear apart their relationship. They come to realize that they are complete opposite and that their relationship has no future. The city of love, teaches Gil that his love is not meant to be. There are certainly many different characters in this film. Sometimes it can even be a little confusing to keep track of all the people and everything that goes on, but it also seems like every one of those characters, with their different personalities and their different views of the world, have something to provide to the movie. Although they contribute to the film some of the character's view points are irrelevant to the story. What Gil believes is love at the start of the movie, progressively changes. He realizes that everything he thought was love is wrong. In order to find true love he had to find himself, which he did every midnight in Paris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Midnight in Paris" is a film that immediately brings the viewer up to speed with what a large message of the film is. Think of the intro, before any person is even shown, where the screen flashes through several historical places and forms of art; all the while, music is playing that would give a sense of history and cheerfulness. The message that is being depicted is one of art, history, and a sense of passion, or romance. This message is further depicted in the main character Gil who is truly inspired and passionate about the beauty of Paris in not only the present, but even more so in its past. The icing of top of the cake for demonstrating this message would however have to be Gil's adventures into the past. The main message in this film is strongly supported and easily picked out. The film never seems to stray far from the message if at all. The film itself was well written around the message. The film shows a good amount of combinations as well. The first is in Gil and his fiancée Inez; where she is the ultimately ignorant and he is open-minded and embraces the beauty in all that is around him. Another good combination is between the past and the present. The past represents a more enlightened in an art and romantic sense, and seemingly more laid back and living life by the moment. The past also recognizes all forms of art such as writing. The present is more scheduled and ignorant to the beauty in art. The present also seems to ignore older forms of art and strictly deals with the present. There are several other combinations in the film as well. The introduction of the little black book that Gil buys at the market starts out as nothing, but grows. It first causes Gil to want to see a girl from the past again and to steal his fiancée's earrings. It would later cause him to take this girl from the past on a date where she would stay even later in the past. I also believe that it had a big part in Gil wanting to stay in Paris instead of going back to America. The general assumption that Paris is a city of beauty and romance hits Gil hard in the sense that he strongly believes and accepts it. This has a big effect on how Gil acts and thinks throughout the film. He expects to see beauty and romance, so he does everywhere he looks seemingly. I really liked how the film mixed both past and present to make its message clearer. I also really enjoyed the use of real life historical facts and people to make the film and story better. Probably my most favorite thing that is done in this film is the use of night as a lively time for the past."Midnight in Paris" is a historical, romantic film with a large focus on writings and arts of the past to provide a powerful message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came across this movie on the Starz channel today and fell right into it! As someone who feels exactly like Gil (Owen Wilson), who feels like the present is dull and that it would be better to live in a different time, I connected with this movie beautifully. This movie is set in Paris, obviously, and it's about Gill and his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) who are there because her parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) have a business venture there. One night, while a little intoxicated, Gil Pender gets into an antique vehicle and is taken back into the 1920's Paris where he meets many historical figures including Cole Porter, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso and more.The only problem that I have is that I didn't recognize a few names (which is my fault for being unfamiliar with those names). I thought the movie was beautiful and very easy to understand! I recommend this movie to anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could not manage to say a word after watching this film. It perfectly captured history, and the personality of the figures in history, like F. Scott Fitzgerald, his wife Zelda, and Ernest Hemingway. Owen Wilson does a great job, as he always does, and plays the role with heart. He gives the character a personality, in a way that not a lot of actors can. The writing was good, and no doubt that helped, but it takes a great actor to truly bring a character to life, as Owen Wilson did in this film. The most remarkable thing about this film, however, is its beauty. It looks incredible. Paris is a gorgeous place, as everyone knows, and it is captured perfectly. Everywhere they go has a unique beauty to it, and, if nothing else, it is gorgeous to look at. But the story, the characters, and the acting make it so much more than just a gorgeous film. It is excellent, and I pity you if you have not yet seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK but could have been so much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the man at the movie's core, I was hoping to be transported to a different time and place while watching Woody Allen's universally acclaimed "Midnight in Paris." What I got instead was a sporadically charming but surprisingly earthbound little fantasy that had me pining away over lost opportunities with the Lost Generation.The conceit - not terribly original in and of itself but filled with promise and possibilities - involves an American writer visiting modern-day Paris who is whisked away every midnight to the 1920s where he hobnobs with many of the great writers, artists and thinkers of the time: F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway, Josephine Baker, Alice B. Toklas, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, and others.So far, so good. Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is portrayed as a hopeless romantic who, as we are too often wont to do, believes that life was better in a time before he was born - an idealized era where life was richer, simpler and somehow more satisfying than it is today. For Gil, that ideal period is the Paris of the 1920s, which he envisions as a scene of endless literary and intellectual discussions amongst a rarified elite. He's engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), a much more prosaic 21st Century woman, whose father (Kurt Fuller) is a right-wing tea-party type and whose mother (Mimi Kennedy) looks with disdain on her daughter's life choices, including the man she's picked to marry. No wonder Gil rushes back every night to that space/time continuum portal that allows him to be with the people he really likes and who seem to like and understand him.The main problem for me with "Midnight in Paris" is that it is unable to bring its roster of extraordinary historical figures to life. In fact, they emerge basically as some of the blandest people you are ever likely to meet, this century or last. They wouldn't even make a good cocktail party crowd. Not one of them says anything insightful or witty that would in any way indicate that they are world-famous artists and creators of lasting works. And without that dimension, Gil's trips to the past have all the excitement and authenticity of a dress-up ball that never ends.The scenes set in the present are scarcely any better. Inez' family and their pompous, know-it-all friend, played by Michael Sheen, are just the Ugly American writ large, and the humor is surprisingly toothless and lacking for a Woody Allen movie. Wilson, who has been effective in other roles, here feels too much like a stand-in for a younger version of Allen himself to make much of an impression of his own.So what of the glorious views of Paris that one would expect from such a film? Surely, those are worth the price of admission. Actually, not really, for the cinematographer, Darius Khonji, has, for some inexplicable reason, seen fit to cast the city in a strangely sickly yellowish glow that robs the place of much of its natural beauty and luster.So what is good about the film? Well, there are some genuinely tender moments between Gil and Adriana, the on-again/off-again mistress of Pablo Picasso, who suffers from Gil's idealization of the past, only to her, that rosier past lies in the era known as La Belle Epoque. And there's a very funny in-movie scene in which Gil gives a bemused and befuddled Luis Bunuel the idea for what the surrealist will later turn into "The Exterminating Angel." The movie also does a nice job fleshing out its theme - of the illusion of a Golden Age vs. the reality of a present day - in the final reel.More virtues like these and "Midnight in Paris" might have been the truly transporting charmer it was meant to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The colorful musical romantic movie is a special creation by Woody Allen. The movie was remarkably beautiful, the music and background score and cinematography are absolutely fantastic.The Director cleverly balanced the future and the past of Paris through his cinematic astuteness.The acting of Owen Wilson was nice and the characters are made so true that it never sounds like acting in this movie.While watching you will definitely feel the warm colors,soothing music and charisma of dialog in the movie. After watching you felt like satisfied and seems like the movie has left a colorful romantic musical print on your mind and heart. It would never be wrong if I say it is one of the best romantic colorful movie made in the recent era. People who love to read classics and admirer of musics and cinema definitely will love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen, 74, hasn't taken any steps back in his career of late. He keeps up an enviable work rate, releasing on average a film a year. In total, he has directed 46 films since the 1960s."Midnight in Paris," which opened Cannes, earned him an Academy Award for Best Writing and Original Screenplay. In this tribute to the city of light, and the greatest artists of the 1920s, we are invited to visit the brain of Woody Allen and get carried away with his view of the world.Successful Hollywood screenwriter Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) visits Paris with his pushy fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams), and her very wealthy conservative American parents. Gil finds in Paris an inspiration for the completion of his first novel about an antique shop, but Inez finds in his passion a useless romantic daydream, especially when he reflects leaving his career behind and moving to Paris. Inez wants to live in Malibu after their wedding. By chance, the couple is accompanied by Inez's friend Paul, a pseudo-intellectual who speaks with a demeaning confidence without real insights, but Inez finds in him the man Gil should be.One night, Gil wanders the streets of Paris while Inez goes dancing with Paul and his wife. At the stroke of midnight, a vintage car pulls up, and the passengers, all dressed in 1920s clothing, invite Gil to join them at a party. Gil is transported into the 1920s which is an era he is fond of, but on the first night he tries to grasp what's happening to him as he starts meeting with the legendary F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda, and Ernest Hemingway who agrees to show Gil's book to Gertrude Stein. Gil also meets Picasso, Bunuel, Dali and many others.This type of nostalgia is not unusual in Woody Allen's films. If he's not playing the role himself, the main characters speaks his tongue which is exactly what Gil is doing. The dialogue is typical of Woody Allen's way of thinking.The film is also obviously a tribute to Paris and European cinema. It's true that Gil finds himself against the world, against his never-satisfied in laws, discouraging fiancée, and pseudo intellectuals like Paul, but it's a circle one can step away from. Throughout his career, Allen has always taken a stand against those who pretend to know a little too much. He ridicules them in this film.At the same time, Gil's nostalgic reminiscences help him step out of the denial of his current relationship. They clear his mind. He starts realizing that he has nothing in common with Inez; in turns, he grasps at the best out of his fantastic experience.This is the second film this year to transport us to old Paris Both Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris and Martin Scorsese's Hugo are both drenched in nostalgia, inspired by art, but they end up in opposite places. Allen, shows respect for the filmic past and his favorite artists; Scorsese's film is an homage to Georges Méli?s, the French cinema pioneer. Both hint at the power of the movies to heal and transform our lives.It is a very enjoyable film with thorough and very witty insights to the way great intellectuals of past decades may have been. They're portrayal is unpretentious and realistic. It is also devastatingly funny.Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

		<fullReview>Ever wondered what it might have been like to live in 1920s Paris and party with Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, Gertrude Stein and all the other superstar bohemians who were there? Owen Wilson plays a 21st century screenwriter who visits Paris with his bride-to-be and is magically transported back to this fabled era -- but only between midnight and dawn. The results are hilarious,the portraits of the artists as young men and women are both wonderfully satiric and accurate. Owen Wilson is great interacting with these characters; I loved his slack-jawed disbelief and excitement. Lots of magical, beautiful romantic shots of Paris make this movie even more of a joy.Unfortunately, many other elements of this movie are a drag. Allen always gets the best actors, but here gives many of them nothing to work with. Wilson's fiancée and her parents are unfunny caricatures of materialistic, philistine Americans. Whenever Wilson is with them, he becomes an annoying California blonde version of whiny Woody. Another really familiar Allen target -- the pretentious pseudo-intellectual -- is portrayed by the usually wonderful Michael Sheen and the results are equally flat. Allen's been egging eggheads since the 1970s; it was really funny the first 20 times or so, but not anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, yet somewhat unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not generally a fan of Woody Allen movies. I find them somewhat pretentious and yet, you can't help but see an undercurrent that actually mocks the pretentiousness. Vicky Cristina Barcelona was one such kind of movie. I didn't really "like" it, but it was good enough to watch.This movie has a very nice premise, and I fully agree with the protagonist's final conclusion about how every person has their own golden age or perfect vision of how the world should be. However, the execution was not so good. The relationship between Inez and Gil is so strained that it makes one wonder how they ever got engaged. I've never been a fan of the way Owen Wilson acts and he does not forget to disappoint in this movie. He seems to think an awkward, stammering individual is a good way to play all his roles.Michael Sheen is a good actor, and should have been utilized more in this movie. The same goes for Tom Hiddleston. Also the movie towards the ending was just plain bad. Inez admits to having an affair and tells him to just "get some perspective"? Really contrived. It's really amazing how they could ever have gotten engaged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shot Paris in a beautiful light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just seeing and hearing the lights and sounds of the city in Midnight in Paris will make you fall in love with it.Written and directed by Woody Allen, the film stars Owen Wilson as Gil, a successful yet easily distracted screenwriter who's vacationing with his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her wealthy parents (played by Mimi Kennedy and Kurt Fuller). Struggling to finish his first novel, Gil is inspired by the streets of Paris and tries to encourage Inez to move there with him. Inez on the other hand, would much rather go shopping and make a home in Malibu.When Gil gets drunk one night, he decides to wander the streets of Paris and gets lost. At midnight, a vintage car pulls up and the inhabitants inside encourage him to join them. Suddenly, Gil is taken back to the 1920s, a decade he has always idolized.There, he comes into contact with Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald (Alison Pill and Tom Hiddleston), who take him to meet Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll). Hemingway agrees to send Gil's novel over to Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates). When Gil goes back into the present, he encourages Inez to come with him. But thinking he's mad, Inez refuses and would rather spend time hanging out with her pretentious, pseudo-intellectual friend Paul (Michael Sheen).As Gil transports back to the 20s every night, he soon becomes infatuated with a costume designer named Adriana (Marion Cotillard). But while it's clear that there's chemistry between the two, Gil's from the future and his engagement proves to be an issue.Packed with a talented cast and colourful characters, Midnight in Paris is a real delight to watch. But while the fantasy is nostalgic, it does come with tension. As Gil gets trapped with time and travel, he must decide if he must stay in the past or live in the present.Creatively written and shot, the movie is like a digital postcard celebrating the life and culture of Paris through the decades. While we wish we could live in another era, the film is probably the closest we'll come to what life would be like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some people want to see the future some wants to experience the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever wanted to exist in a different time period in the past? Well that is the case with Gil Pender(Owen Wilson) who also has a huge infatuation with Paris. And has a bigger infatuation for the 1920's a time period where some of his favorite writers lives. And he literally thinks that is the golden age. He is a script writer for movies in Hollywood but wants to be a writer in Paris. It might be more risky and might not be financially better than working for Hollywood but that is what he wants. So this movie has different themes and different questions on life, especially romance. One is would you choose to struggle and do what you want to do or be in comfort zone over where you want to be. The couple Gil Pender and Inez(Rachel McAdams) are complete opposites, sometimes opposites attract and everything is fine but that isn't the case here. Pender is free spirited and isn't always logical and goes with the flow and his dream while also having a bit of anxiety and his fiancé is confined to comfort and how society do things. But one day something magical happens, kinda like Cinderella except the magic starts at midnight. And is sent back to the 1920's and experience that time period and meet the writers he admirers. Micheal Sheen plays a character in the present who is basically the epitome of a pedantic character. Basically a know it all that shows off his knowledge of the past but doesn't have any creativity and imagination. And is superficial like Inez and is proud because of his knowledge. But Gil is the one that lacks in art history but wants to create his own art. So the movie is basically colliding of imagination, creativity and free spirit over comfort and society.Before A man falling for a woman in a different era also plays a part in this. This movie has multiple themes and different things going on but it rarely goes in a inconsistent direction. This movie reminded me of "Before Sunset" except it's more broad and isn't just about 2 characters discussing there view on life. And "Night at the Museum" with a much much better script. Yeah some stuff don't fit together completely when it comes to the past to the present, but not everything has to make sense. If you know some of the writers, musicians and painters than this movie will be way more enjoyable. Cause it's like watching historical characters you know in a movie.8.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A screenwriter who happens to be an uber fan of literature time travels to 1920's Paris to hobnob with his idols, while having doubts about his impending marriage in the present. The fantasy element in the plot line coupled with sharp Woody Allen dialogue makes this film quite enjoyable. Although Owen Wilson plays Owen Wilson, the famous acting cameos keep it interesting. The cinematography captures the whimsy of Paris albeit true to reality or not and the soundtrack gives the film a signature sound. Allen has a habit of recycling his plots and inner conflicts. MIDNIGHT IN Paris is no exception; it mirrors MANHATTAN in many aspects. Allen's foray into the semi-fantasy genre after nearly ten years pays off in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>" Nostalgia is denial - denial of the painful present... the name for this denial is golden age thinking - the erroneous notion that a different time period is better than the one ones living in - it's a flaw in the romantic imagination of those people who find it difficult to cope with the present " , dialog mouthed by the pseudo-intellectual Paul almost typifies the movie "Midnight in Paris " &amp; what it is about.It is a romantic comedy set in Paris by the most romantics of all Woody Allen. It tells the story of Gil Pender, an dissatisfied writer working in Hollywood trying to get inspiration for his first novel in Paris and how he travels back in time to meet the great artists , writers &amp; legends who have set their foot in Paris in the 1920's . However romantic &amp; alluring the past may be it is always good to accept present for what it is is what Gil finally end up realizing.It is one of the best movies of the year &amp; boy , it is an interesting piece of work from the grand old man after a long time . The movie moves at a lively pace with no scope for boredom anywhere in between. The manner in which the script seamlessly blend the present with the past &amp; the resonance it has in the present life is amazing piece of work.And they have tried to capture the real people ? who they were &amp; how they were , whom we know only by their piece of art rather than who they are in actuality. Ernest Hemmingway , Cole Porter , Zelda &amp; Scott Fitzgerald , Gertrude Stein , Picasso ,Salvador Dali, Man Ray , Luis Bu?uel &amp; the rest who made Paris their home in the 1920's are seamlessly blend into the script &amp; interestingly at that. And Gil gets attracted to one of the mistress of Picasso , Adriana who has mysteriously mentioned about him in her biography.In the present Gil is caught between his love for Paris &amp; his desire to stay back in Paris and his wealthy &amp; intolerant fiancée , Inez who want him to get settled in Malibu and continue with writing scripts for the Hollywood. Finally he realizes what he wants &amp; takes action as the movie ends with a romantic twist in the end.It is the best of Owen Wilson , the quintessential "pin-headed" hero of mindless comedies. He has acted in a subtle manner for the first time on screen as Gil who travels back &amp; forth in time. Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein is reliable as ever , Marion Cotillard as Adriana is stunning , Corey Stoll as Ernest Hemmingway is brilliant , Adrian Brody as Salvador Dali is darn funny .Rachel Macadams is neat as Gil's arrogant fiancé Inez while Kurt Fuller as he dad is good. Michael Sheen as the pseudo-intellect Paul Bates gets to mouth couple of sparkling lines.Apart from an neat script , marvelous cinematography ( Darius Khondji &amp; Johanne Debas) &amp; pleasant background score (Stephane Wrembel ) , splendid dialogs are another gratifying aspect of this movie." Sex and alcohol. Fuels the desire kills the performance " , "The artist's job is not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence " , " I'm jealous and I'm trusting. It's cognitive dissonance" , "That's what the present is. It's a little unsatisfying because life is unsatisfying." , " No subject is terrible if the story is true, if the prose is clean and honest, and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure ", "You always take the side of the help. That's why Daddy says you're a communist" are few of the many wonderfully written dialogs by Woody Allen admixed with quotes of those famous artist of the yore.On the whole , "Midnight in Paris " is a wonderful piece of art that strikes you in your head with a message , don't always try to find refuge in the past when the present gets rough , get on with your present life.Bottomline : Come , fall in love with Paris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies I've seen this year. This is a movie about Gil, a dreamer, a romantic who is trying to convince his very materialistic fiancé Inez into movie to Paris after they get married over the course of their vacation with her parents. Gil is obsessed with the romantic notion of Paris in the 20s and one night after dinner he goes for a walk and finds himself transported to the era of his dreams. This movie is filled with colour and light as Gil meets his heroes of the era, falls in love with Picassos muse and discovers that the past might not always be better.Now this movie was very interesting. From a critics point of view, its gold, but from a viewers perspective its also a wonderful movie. It has humour, a fun soundtrack, famous figures from the jazz age, but also makes you think. The end message, that people are never satisfied with what they have, had me thinking long after I had left the theatre. This is definitely a movie you have to see at some point. A real triumph for Woody Allen, and Owen Wilson, who I am actually not a big fan of, I think did wonderfully by playing the kind of role Allen usually plays. As the title states, it was simply magical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen and the perils of nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the seventeenth century, Swiss doctors identified a new disease: nostalgia, a pathological homesickness that turned those afflicted with it indifferent to their surroundings and aching for the past. Nostalgics were treated with opium, leeches and warm emulsions, but for the demoralised Swiss mercenaries serving in foreign armies the best hope for cure was a swift discharge and a walk in the Alps.Nostalgia has lost none of its paralysing powers, but the idea that it should be purged now seems bizarre, even immoral. Our fast-paced modern lifestyle is regarded as rife with danger, stress and vacuity. It's nothing, in other words, like the good old days, which always seem so great precisely because you can project on to them whatever fantasies you have of how wonderful life would be, if only? But there's no use, of course, in being nostalgic for the days when yearning for the past was seen as a fatal weakness rather than a virtue.In any case, it's perfectly common to wish that you had a shot of experiencing life in a different era. In Midnight in Paris, Woody Allen's Oscar-nominated film, an aspiring novelist is granted this wish as he is transported to Paris in the Twenties, a time when American writers settled in droves on the bohemian Left Bank and attended the soirees of Gertrude Stein, who dubbed them 'the Lost Generation'.Gil's (Owen Wilson) nocturnal time travels take him away from his well-to-do fiancée and in-laws who, after just a few days in Paris, are homesick for California. When Gil suggests long walks in the rain, his wife-to-be Inez (Rachel McAdams) insists on lunch in upmarket restaurants. When Gil fantasises about living in a Parisian attic with a skylight, Inez reminds him they have settled on a Malibu beach house.Apart from an iconic city, a self-deprecating writer, a mismatched couple and cerebral banter, Midnight in Paris has another Allen hallmark: an unbearable pseudo-intellectual. The know-it-all pedant Paul (Michael Sheen) is in town with his girlfriend Carol (Nina Arianda). He's been invited to lecture at the Sorbonne but, an apparent connoisseur of everything from Monet to the Ancien Régime, Paul has seemingly endless time to guide an impressed Inez and a dejected Gil around the city. At the Musée Rodin, he even insists that the guide (played by a pouty Carla Bruni) doesn't know her art history. And at the Palace of Versailles, he deconstructs the premise of Gil's novel, which centres on the owner of a nostalgia shop.'Nostalgia', says the smug Paul, 'is denial; denial of the painful present? And the name for this fallacy is called golden-age thinking - the erroneous notion that a different time period is better than the one one's living in. It's a flaw in the romantic imagination of those people who find it difficult to cope with the present.' Understandably, Gil finds it difficult to cope with Paul and one night, after making his excuses, he gets lost on his way back to the hotel. At the stroke of midnight, an antique car swerves by and he is swept off to a night of Twenties-style revelry in the company of Cole Porter, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. The magic teleportation repeats itself night after night. Gil gets his book critiqued by Gertrude Stein, has a surreal conversation with Salvador Dali and gives Luis Bu?uel an idea for a movie about bourgeois guests trapped at a dinner party (Bu?uel doesn't understand why they wouldn't just get up and leave).The artists and writers whom Gil meets are figments of his - and our - imagination. Allen makes them conform to stereotypes: Picasso is a brusque womaniser, Hemingway is a macho bottle-swinger, Gertrude Stein is a mother hen for artistic geniuses. No wonder Gil wistfully says they are exactly like he pictured them.It's Gil's romance with serial artists' mistress Adriana (Marillon Cotillard) that eventually brings him back to reality and makes him accept that he really belongs in 2010. Adriana dreams of La Belle Époque, a time when Parisians rode around in horse carts and Tolouse-Lautrec, Gaugin and Degas hung out at Maxim's. But they, it turns out, feel their generation 'lacks imagination' and wish they'd lived during the Renaissance so they could have painted along the likes of Michelangelo.Perhaps the obnoxious Paul had a point after all? Golden-age thinking can certainly be stifling. Woody Allen, if anyone, should know, as his films always seem to be measured against his past greats. But Midnight in Paris doesn't disappoint. The film is whimsical, intelligent, romantic and, yes, wonderfully nostalgic. After all, at a time when those insisting we should forgo modern life in favour of a simpler past seem to be dominating, Allen lets us escape to a world where those pessimistic bores weren't quite so numerous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American cinema of late has not produced memorable films. Out of a few hundred films that come out of Hollywood every year, most if not all are forgotten immediately.Just as I was starting to realize that golden era of filmmaking is long gone, that there will never be great acting and great stories told on the big screen, came "Midnight in Paris". What a joy to watch! Midnight in Paris is a film about a writer(played wonderfully well by Owen Wilson) who is on a trip to Paris with his fiancée (played equally well by Rachel McAdams) and who is longing for the "good old times" of early 20th century.It is probably best to know as little about this piece of magic filmmaking before watching it. Suffice it to say that one would be hard pressed to find a film which represents a more perfect combination of great story, with great sets and locations, great art direction and costumes, perfect performances by all actors including some surprises such as French first lady Carla Bruni, and beautiful music, photography, some of the best dialogues ever written for the big screen and above all - simple feeling of joy after watching a truly good film.All in all, this is a film that can be enjoyed many times over and in my book it gets a well deserved place among some of the best films ever made.If there are any regrets about it, it would be that it deserved many more Oscars than it got.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dear Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was it possible for this movie to be created in any other cities except Paris? In New York, Tokyo, Rome or even London, for instance? I don't think so. Midnight in Paris is tightly lashed to Paris, and it wouldn't be enchanting if it wasn't about Paris.The movie starts with a 3-minute scene, showing a usual day in Paris from dawn till dusk. Eiffel tower, Champs Élysées, Moulin Rouge,...it seems like a map presented by Woody Allen, reiterating this fact that Paris is more important than anything else in this movie. Even the screenplay of the movie is incredibly easy-to-understand, helping you enjoy Midnight in Paris more than you expected, and that's the genius of Woody Allen. The others try to make their movies more captivating for the audience by writing more complicated screenplays day after day, while in his movie Gil just need to take a cab in order to meet with Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein and T.S. Eliot. Gil Pender is a writer from California who came to Paris as a vacation with his fiancée, Inez. He's a 1920's enthusiast, and his new novel's character works in a nostalgia shop. While the others usually like the present, he prefers to live in Paris in 20's. For the others, he's one of those guys who lives in the past and has a kind of Golden Age Thinking. But Paris has a special gift for the man of our story; a cab which takes him to the 1920's. Everything is such a dream for Gil, but he just forgot this fact that Paris is the city of dreams. Soon after, he meets a woman named Adriana, who makes some crucial changes to his life.Well, I've read some reviews and people's comments about this movie about six or seven months ago, and what I had in my mind before watching it wasn't so positive. My anticipation was that I won't really enjoy this movie because I'm not really a bookworm. While watching Midnight in Paris, I just knew that T.S. Eliot, Fitzgerald and Hemingway were great authors who had great novels. But I was wrong. Of course being familiar with these guys will help you enjoy this movie more, but Midnight in Paris has many other things for you. We have Paris ? this amazing city - as the setting of the movie, a good art directing by Jean-Yves Rabier, terrific performances, and of course, another fascinating movie by our popular director Woody Allen.Many people discourage you from watching this movie, especially some critics, but don't listen to them. You will be overjoyed to watch this movie, as I am right now. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable fluff for the fan or Francophile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really baffled by the praise for the film, and Woody is one of my favourites. He obviously loves Paris and he wants to stage the fantasy of 1920s Paris as his, perhaps it could be anyone's, his point is simply the classic Romantic line that forces that move us to be interested in another time and place are unappreciated by capitalist materialists. The characters are generally flat, and Owen Wilson as the protagonist is another of the awkward stand-ins that Woody ventriloquises. There is little of the detailed structure of interpersonal engagement that usually give his films something to chew on. All the figures of Euro-American modernism that are celebrated in the film are also flattened into stereotypes.The art direction is superb and the city looks its best version of its cliché. But where Manhattan paired the visual city with the interior world of its inhabitants, this one is all about the surface.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really absorbed in this film. My loving connection with that Paris group got me off on the right foot. I know they are stock characters, but the pretentious idiocy of the future family of the Owen Wilson (Woody Allen) gives us a guy to root for. The tiresome being of the woman he is to marry would lead me to want her to be found floating face up in the Seine. Anyway, the fantasy world of the great writers is done charmingly with a second food in the present. It never gets silly and contrived with a limited amount of the conflict that other comedic directors could not handle. He slowly makes the rounds of his dreams and follows them, and the earth doesn't collapse. Actually, the woman in question really gets what she actually wanted. I won't spoil it by saying what that is. The characters vary in effectiveness. It was nice to see the portrayal of the young Hemingway with his bravado and insensitivity, even a touch of naiveté. There are romantic symbols and the cinematography is gorgeous. I know some think Owen Wilson is an odd choice for the protagonist, but I find him endearing and so patient. Also, there has been criticism that it's not edgy enough. The movie never tries to be a social statement. It's much more personal. When we leave the theater we feel that we have been involved in a little secret. The Philistines have been conquered in their own way and allowed to go on with their insipid, self-important lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can You Say about Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He's brilliant, Woody Allen. He can have so many things going on and make you look at what's wrong with all of them and at the same time be smart about it, without getting too condescending. Midnight in Paris is basically telling you 'come to terms with what you really want, stop the denial, stop fighting what is.' Owen Wilson's character wants to live in Paris. He finally does that. Let's take a look at the Life Lesson 101 this film is dealing with: 1. Would it matter what time period you lived in? Allen is saying no, as Joel O'Steen says, 'Happiness is a choice', almost to the eye of the beholder. Where ever you go you'll be happy or unhappy, the glass is full/half full concept.2. If Rachel McAdams' character had some awareness, she would have realized that Wilson's character was 10 times more brilliant than her one dimensional 'so called' intellectual friend Paul. This is the case with most people unfortunately in relationships, friendships, and families. 3. In order to have new growth, you have to let go of what's dead, in this movie's case Wilson's character lets go of McAdams' character and the United States, and the new growth that comes to him is living in Paris, writing a better book and meeting a new girl who is nice, who doesn't mind walking in the rain and who, I might add, doesn't have a stick up her butt like McAdams' character and her parents. 4. You can learn anything about life from anything and anybody if you're open to it. I believe Woody Allen is saying Read some freaking books because you'll learn a lot about yourself and the great riddles of life through some great books such as books by Hemingway, Eliot, and so forth and so on. This is definitely a movie worth watching for the viewer, to almost find out and to get down to the nitty gritty about what we really want for our individual selves in this life. Not what we think we should do, or what we think is the right thing to do, or what is safe, but just what we really want without worrying about what anyone else will think of us. A great movie to see!</fullReview>

Paris, like meetings of Gertrude Stein or Hemingway is only imaginary place, silhouette of a dream and this fact is, in same measure, good point and huge error. result - a poem - wine in the flavor of fantastic, with strips of fairy - tale, medicine against the heavy, boring, cold, ambiguous reality, presence of madame Sarkozy in not inspired role and touching Owen Wilson as Gil - new Don Quijote.delicate Marion Cotillard, darling Kathy Bates, Michael Sheen in perfect skin of fake hero are precious ingredients of this story of Abu Hassan and his lesson about heart of life sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quite brilliant comic fantasy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have long been a fan of Woody Allen's films. "Annie Hall" and "Hannah and Her Sisters" are two of my all-time favourites. But Allen has surpassed himself with this absolutely brilliant comedy about the pitfalls of nostalgia. "Midnight in Paris" is quite simply one of the best films I have seen for years. It is funny, charming and thought-provoking; it is brilliantly acted by all concerned; its soundtrack is superb; and it is masterfully scripted and directed. Gil Pender (played by Owen Wilson) is a Hollywood screenwriter who yearns to be a serious and successful novelist. He believes he has been born in the wrong era. He is a devotee of the 1920s and wishes that he could have lived in Paris during that culturally creative decade when his literary and artistic idols were there and at the peak of their powers. While on holiday in modern-day Paris with his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents, Gil goes for a stroll on his own late at night. While doing so, he gets picked up by a vintage Peugeot. He then finds himself transported back to the era of his dreams, during which he is introduced to the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Gertrude Stein and Cole Porter (to name just some of the characters he meets). This happens on other nights and Gil eventually strikes up an intimate relationship with Picasso's French mistress Adriana (Marion Cotillard). However, many of the idols whom he meets are themselves nostalgic for what they regard as an earlier golden decade, the 1890s (the beginning of the period known as La Belle Epoque). This makes Gil wonder about the wisdom generally of yearning for an apparently better past at the expense of making the most of the present and of moving forward. "Midnight in Paris" is an intelligent and very funny film. The character of Ernest Hemingway (brilliantly played by Corey Stoll) is given a number of very amusing one-liners, including one about self-effacement being an unmanly character trait. He also says of Picasso at one point that "he's great but he's no Miro"! There is also a very funny debate between Gertrude Stein (played by Kathy Bates) and Picasso about the merits of the latter's portrait of Adriana. The information Gil gleans from this enables him to score points against Paul (Michael Sheen), a pompous and pretentious American friend of Inez who happens to be visiting Paris at the same time. There are many other very funny lines and scenes in a film that is a brilliant amalgam of comedy, romance and fantasy. The music is wonderful - Cole Porter's song "Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love)" features prominently. And I particularly liked the opening 2-3 minutes of the film, which consist entirely of shots of the beautiful city of Paris to the accompaniment of a plaintive jazz soundtrack. "Midnight in Paris" is a superb film. 10/10.</fullReview>

The party includes a young engaged couple who are forced to confront their differing views of a perfect life.First and foremost, Owen Wilson deserves some kind of applause for this. He can play goofy, cheesy roles, but is not really a strong character. Woody Allen found a way to make that work here, making the timid Wilson a strong lead.The film, of course, was nominated for best picture and won best screenplay. I think this is perfectly fair. Allen's strength is his writing. He is nothing more than an average director, but his scripts easily carry his films -- the intellectual dialogue is appealing without being pretentious. How he does that is beyond me.And seeing Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali... nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Owen Wilson gives a winner of a performance playing a character that the director might have done twenty, thirty years ago</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The protagonist in "Midnight in Paris" is the sort of character than the film's writer/director, Woody Allen, might have played thirty years ago. Alas, Mr. Allen is now in his seventies, so the role had to go to somebody with somewhat shorter branches. Nevertheless, the director made a sane choice in casting Owen Wilson, an underrated actor who specializes at playing nebbish simpletons.Now the ads for "Midnight in Paris" are a first-class example of Hollywood's fiscal-minded schemes. You see Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams strolling through Paris, smiling, arms around each other. If memory serves me correct, that only happens once in the film. The rest of the time, they are squabbling toward a non-reconciliation. The reason? One night, Mr. Wilson takes a drunken walk through the streets of Paris and is picked up by a mysterious yellow car. The car takes him, literally, back in time, allowing him to meet the great artists of the 1920s. Ernest Hemingway, Salvadore Dali, Pablo Picasso, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, just to name a few.The transitions where Mr. Wilson goes back and forth through time are a little skimpy and rough toward the beginning of the picture. They don't exactly convey a sense of mystery or bewilderment; as far as I was concerned, the protagonist was being duped. However, as the movie progresses, this lackluster mode of transition almost becomes suitable, if only because the filmmaker is allowing it to become familiar. In the midst of these fantastic adventures, during which Mr. Wilson falls in love with a French costume designer (Marion Cotillard), Woody Allen explores a common feeling among contemporary artists: the wish to have been born during a perceived "golden age." The "golden age" being determined by one's personal sense of admiration for those before him.Despite a somewhat uneven narrative and those pesky transitions, "Midnight in Paris" is still a modestly interesting experience. Most of the credit is due not to Mr. Allen's screenplay or direction (although both are just fine) but to Owen Wilson's flabbergasted, captivating performance. The actor gets inside his character's head and personality and blurts out complicated streams of dialogue without bloating into a hammy, nightstand performance. Miss McAdams, as his snotty fiancée, is also in fine form. Some very versatile talents also play the famous folk of the past, some only for very brief scenes. For instance, there is Adrien Brody playing Dali with a surprisingly good French accent. Marion Cotillard is also very good, but she's no stranger to praise from me.Perhaps the movie has too many characters. Too many romantic interests, chiefly. First of all, there's Miss McAdams, whose character I'm fine with. Then there's Miss Cotillard, who I liked the most. Then, however, there are two others: a tour guide played by Carla Bruni and Lea Seydoux as a Parisian record salesgirl. In all fairness, it was not a bad idea to provide a contemporary-era love interest for the hero, but these last two characters could have been all too easily combined into one person. Being separate, neither seems to have much purpose or development.The heroes of this film are Woody Allen and Owen Wilson. The latter does a stupendous job at playing the character, and the former sculpts the personality for him to play. The movie as a whole is also enjoyable in spite of its jumpy way of playing out its story. It also has a classic time-travel joke toward the end involving a gum-shoe and 1700s France. I'll let you check it out for yourself. About the only dreadful thing I could spot was an obnoxious music score, which unfortunately refused to stay in the background.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen gifts us a 21st Century fairytale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember the first time your mother read Cinderella to you? And how you cajoled her to read it to you again and again? Midnight in Paris is sure to cast a spell on you. Set in the city of orange skies, quaint tales, classic lamp posts, accordion notes and vintage wines, rouged cheeks with flirty beauty marks, unravels the tale of Gil (Owen Wilson), a Hollywood screenwriter wandering the syrupy Parisian lanes only to slide back into time to witness the glory of the city in the 1920's. He tangos with Djuna Barnes, discusses the freedom of war exploits with Hemingway, and unwinds over supper with Salvador Dali and Man Ray over surreal imagery and falls in love with a girl from the Coco Chanel's posse! A time when the who's who of the city were who else but Pablo Picasso, Scott F. Fitzgerald and Matisse and Monet paintings were sold for 500 francs! Gil, much like anyone else, finds that era as the most enthralling of all times and tries every trick in the book to hold on to that which has Cole Porter swooning its people with his ballads, when it dawns on him that he isn't the only one trying to scamper off into the past. Adriana (Marion Cotillard), Chanel's protégé and Picasso's muse, finds herself darting for ritzy Paris scene in the 1890's, with Moulin Rouge, green fairies and casinos and Belle Epoque, which she considers 'Golden age' of the city. Only to find that Henri Lautrec applauds Renaissance as the greatest period!As the red and gold melt into one for romancing the city of lights, Woody Allen's effervescent writing deals with sensitive veracity of our everyday lives, which is that the present is unfulfilled and the past always seems magical. Nostalgia is another shade of denial and there is always endless yearning for a moment of magic. Inez, (Rachel McAdams), playing the cheating fiancé to Gil delivers adequately as she doubts his wayward ways by saying, "That's why Daddy says you're a communist." If there were an Oscar for the Best Cameo, it would go to Adrien Brody for his portrayal of Dali and his "Rhinoceros!" Michael Sheen, playing shrewd art expert (or pseudo expert!) does an interesting portrayal his character. And if someone had to bring France's former First Lady, Carla Bruni's charisma to the Hollywood screens, it had to be Allen.All in all, a lovely evening comedy for art lovers. So when you're over the multi-million dollar Michael Bay robots, and are looking for the some charming gourmet magic meals, watch out for the 21st Century Shakespeare, Allen, respelling fantasy realism like no one else does!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Summer is all about traveling to distant places. Summer is all about dreaming of and fulfilling all of the greatest desires. It is also a bit about escaping from the every-day reality of a boring life for even a couple of days. Everyone should do so one in a while. So, what would YOU do if you were able to go to a beautiful place like Paris and discover all of the wonderful and magical attractions that it can offer you?Place yourself in a position of Gil, a struggling Hollywood writer, who flies to Paris on a business trip, along with his girl Inez and her very annoying parents. He needs some inspiration for his next novel, that is why he wants to take a trip around the city and experience it through all of its poetic magnificence. However, in order to do so he has to somehow get rid of his ignorant girlfriend for a while. And it so happens that on one evening she goes dancing with her friends and Gil is left all alone. He finally gets that quiet and peaceful time that he needed so much. And this is when all the magic happens.The whole situation seems to get a little out of control - he walks around town and just as the clock bell rings at midnight the whole reality changes. It's like he accidentally found a place that acts as a time machine and transports you back to the magnificent and artistic 1920's. This is the true beauty of Midnight in Paris. The viewer is able to experience all of the sensations and glamor and bourgeois lifestyle of that era along with Gil and the newly met eccentric woman named Adriana. She introduces him to her extravagant friends, who happen to be the biggest 'stars' in town.I love the portrayal of all the famous people that resided in Paris in that period of the 20th century. When you think about it, during those prominent times you were able to meet many of the greatest artists in the history of mankind on every single corner of the street. I love all of the witty jokes and remarks that they make during meetings with the protagonist. Finally, I love the fact that they actually seemed like they didn't have any problems back then and simply lived for the pure appreciation of life. Amazing.One of the best qualities of this film is the wonderful representation of the classic art deco design of various restaurants and bars, that started to flourish on the Parisian cultural scene in the 1920's.I must say that this is one of the best Woody Allen pictures in years. Apart from many intelligent laughs it addresses one very important message - that all of us sometimes yearn for the times that we didn't live in. It happened to Gil. But it also happened to Adriana, which makes us realize that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. And even though we may think that we don't belong to this particular place and time, we can't be sure if we would be comfortable somewhere else either.One last remark: I can't say that I'm a fan of Owen Wilson's acting career, but he certainly deserves recognition for his performance here. He fits into the role of this clumsy writer, who is also an excessive dreamer, just perfectly. Great job, Mr. Wilson. You just made the romantic Paris look more magical than ever!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight: Paris is Most Beautiful in the Rain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris is a magical comedy that makes the past more present than ever. Gil Pender's (Owen Wilson) Paris is at once whimsical, alluring, and neurotic. The midnight vistas Woody Allen sets are a cinematographers dream, from the sparkling champagne flute Eiffel Tower to throwback gas lit lamps outside Maxim's. As Gil meets and greets with art world and literati major figures Salvidor Dali (Adrien Brody), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), and the Fitzgeralds (Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill) he increasingly loosens his ties to present Malibu raised fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams). Midnight escapades with the alluring Adrianna (Marion Cotillard) lead him even farther into Paris' past. Together they learn that dissatisfaction plagues every period and is the burden that every artist bears. Allen has clearly coached Owen Wilson extensively on his personal traits; midway through the film when Gil states that in a dream "I ran out of Zithromax, then I went to the dentist and he didn't have any Novocaine" it is as if Allen himself is on screen. Neurosis is intimately woven through the script as are Allen's classic liberal lines, once referring to Tea Party Republicans as "crypto-fascist airhead zombies." With McAdam's character Inez there is little to love. She is spoiled and expects her lifetime of happiness to come with an unlimited joint checking account and a American Express Black card. Not to mention she spends her time in Paris kvetching about the rain and slipping away to dance with a married man, a college crush who is also visiting the city of light. Allen doesn't linger on extra characters long though. He cuts to the meat of the story almost immediately giving relationships plenty of time to develop and the viewer leeway to chose: is it the past or the present Paris that holds all the allure? One thing is certain though, "Paris is the most beautiful in the rain." -ROM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timelessly magical Parisian love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's recent tour of Europe has taken in London (Match Point) and Barcelona (Vicky Christina Barcelona), producing two of his finest films for some time. The third stop on the European tour is Paris, with the wonderful Midnight in Paris. Will it be third time lucky? It is, very much indeed.Right from the beginning of the film we can see the affection that Allen holds for Paris. The opening scenes are full of picture postcard moments depicting every day Parisian life and almost all of Allen's lead roles spend the film espousing the joys of living in the city of lights. There are of course some dissenting voices, but these are lost amongst the chorus. A word of warning; even if you have been to Paris 20 times, or never visited at all, this film will make you want to go back and soon.Allen's lead Paris champion is Owen Wilson who plays Gil, a commercially successful, but clearly disillusioned Hollywood script writer/doctor who before selling his literary soul to Hollywood, spent time in Paris trying to write his first novel. Now he is back and wishing he had never left, but this time he is accompanied by his materialistic wife to be Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her overbearing parents(Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy).As soon as Gil touches down in Paris, his love affair is rekindled. He is a true romantic at heart, who wants nothing more than to walk the streets, sit in the cafes and dream of living in Paris in the 1920s, a time he perceives as the Parisian golden years. Paris is the place Gil has decided he needs to be to make the break from Hollywood and finish his book. Inez, clearly horrified at this thought finds solace in a pretentious American couple Paul (wonderfully played by Michael Sheen) a cringe-worthy pseudo-intellectual in Paris for a conference and his wife Carol (Nina Arianda). Paul whips Inez and Gil of on a whirlwind tour of Paris, primarily it appears to allow Paul to spout intellectual rubbish in a bid to impress Inez, until put firmly in his place by a museum guide played delightfully by Carla Bruni.Gil can take it no more and after a red wine fuelled dinner declines the invitation to go dancing preferring to walk back to the hotel. After losing his way, Gil is picked up by a mysterious car that appears at midnight, and transported back to Paris in 1920s. Over a series of nights, Gil gets to experience what he has so long desired, that is Paris in the roaring 20s. He also picks up some literary inspiration and critiquing from none other than F Scott Fitzgerald (Todd Hiddleston), Earnest Hemmingway (Corey Stoll), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) and experiences romantic distraction from the majestic Marion Cottiard as Adrianda, a model and girlfriend to the stars, who simply and elegantly steals every scene that she is in.Wilson as Gil, displays a deft and charming touch, not often seen in his career to date. He channels, rather than imitates, Allen's quirkiness and seems to spend the entire film in a slightly confused but happy state; seemingly quite content to sit back and let Paris roar over him. His scenes with Gottiard are quite superb and the highlight of the film. The supporting cast all play their characters with energy and aplomb; how historically accurate they are I do not know, but boy are they watchable.Allen's screenplay is fully deserving of its Oscar triumph, delivering crisp, refreshing dialogue which manages to stay light and airy, without getting dragged down into literary swampness. Allen throws in a lot of historical and literary references, which (thankfully) you do not need a degree in English Lit to follow. Allen does ask you to take a few liberties and not to question certain aspects of the story, the time travel for instance, but when the story is as engrossing as this one, the audience will be happy to just sit back and accept what is being shown.This is a film of many love stories, straddling different eras, time zones and perceptions. The film ultimately raises the question of what are the benefits of looking back, compared to focusing on the future. This can equally be applied to Allen's career. We seem to spend an awful lot of time looking at his back catalogue and reminiscing over Annie Hall, Manhattan and such like; maybe we should be concentrating on what he is doing now, as it is pretty darn good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun from Woody Allen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a wonderful guilty pleasure for you: Woody Allen's latest love letter to a beloved city. This time, it isn't Manhattan, but Paris, and although this isn't anywhere near the calibre of his earlier films (it is generally agreed that Allen is a director way past his heyday), it is still a lovely, warm, harmless piece of filmmaking. For all the ways that we can find to shout Woody Allen down, one think he absolutely excels at (now as ever) is filming a city. Paris has never looked more gorgeous ? to look at some of the shots that open the film is to swoon headlong, cementing the French capital in our minds as the city of love. Owen Wilson's character, Gil, is a writer who, like many literary types before him, as fallen head over heels for the city. He is a hopeless romantic, and instantly adorable. He wants to take midnight strolls and walk in the rain ? fascinated by the literary allure of Paris and the 1920s in particular. Unfortunately, his fiancée ? Rachel McAdams ? is slightly less impressed, and perfectly vexed when he starts to suggest moving there. Her parents ? snotty, uptight individuals ? hate his guts. Cue some mildly funny dinner exchanges. Three things make this film special and memorable. One is the fantasy element ? I won't divulge too much, but suffice it to say that some degree of cultural knowledge will help immensely. Being a bookworm and a film buff, I loved Allen's exploration of the literary figureheads of yesteryear. Discussions that Gil has with a man called Dali and a man called Bunuel (get the hint?) are incredibly amusing, as is a short, witty scene involving a private detective and the Palace of Versailles. The second is the stellar cast ? showcasing British talent (Michael Sheen crops up as a pedantic wannabe scholar, friend of Gil's fiancée), American stars (Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody in cameos both make an impression) and the ever brilliant Marion Cotillard, Allen has created an immensely watchable ensemble piece. The third, as previously hinted at, is the cinematography: 'Midnight In Paris' is simply gorgeous to look at, particularly as we are shown Paris in three different time periods. The film oozes style and opulence, and works well as a laid back fantasy rom-com. You have to hand it to Allen ? he still has imagination.This isn't a masterpiece. Some will inevitably find it mediocre, or even boring. I have to say that it is utterly predictable and saccharine sweet; however, it never strays into the realm of the melodramatic, and Allen's imaginative style is utterly captivating and somewhat endearing in its innocent reverence for his beloved city. For everything else we can say about it, 'Midnight In Paris' is a charming, light, frothy piece of entertainment. Of course, it's absolute nonsense ? but that's not always such a bad thing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spot the faces and the names</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic film genre is what might be called the 'fish out of water' scenario where the central character is in a different country ("Crocodile Dundee") or culture ("East Is East") or planet ("John Carter") or body ("Big") or time ("The Time Machine"). Writer and director Woody Allen has used the shift in time approach in many of his films and it is central to "Midnight In Paris" where we visit both the 1920s and the 1890s. Now in his seventies, the role he would in the past have filled himself is taken by the engaging Owen Wilson, but essentially it is the same character that Allen has played so often: a writer troubled by his personal and professional lives and musing about alternative choices that he might have made or might still make.The line up of characters - both in the narrative and in the cast list - is amazing. The story features writers like Scott Fitzerald and T S Eliot , musicians like Cole Porter and Josephine Baker, and any number of artists from Picasso to Toulouse-Lautrec. The actors include Rachel McAdams, Michael Sheen and Kathy Bates - with even a cameo role by the French President's wife Carla Bruni. So it is very much a film for spotting faces and names as well as listening to Allen's witty script with its constant cultural references. Indeed, in a move away from his beloved New York, the city of Paris itself is a character in the movie from the opening seconds of iconic shots of the sights in both sunshine and rain.The message of this gentle and entertaining romantic comedy is that, instead of fantasising that a previous age or epoch was so much better, we should make the most of here and now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, Woody Allen took on New York City for years, and everyone was shocked when he set his film Match Point in London. Now here is in Paris, the City of Lights, and it looks just as gorgeous as one who has never been there imagines it. And he gives us a story to match.Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams play Gil, a successful Hollywood screenwriter, and his fiancée Inez, an engaged couple who go to Paris with her parents (Mimi Kennedy and Kurt Fuller) before their wedding. Tired of the Hollywood scene Gil is hard at work on his first novel, which is about a man who works in a nostalgia shop. Gil falls in love with Paris and wants to settle there, but Inez has her heart set on Malibu. The time with Inez and her parents soon becomes tedious, in part due to an old professor of Inez's, Paul and his wife, Carol (Michael Sheen and Nina Arianda), whom Gil finds insufferable. Slowly he realizes that Inez and her parents' values are different from his, so he finds himself leaving them to their own activities and going off by himself.One night, he walks home from a restaurant and gets lost. As he's sitting on some steps, an old-fashioned car pulls up and invites him in. He realizes that he's in the company of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, who take him to a party where Cole Porter is playing the piano, and then to a bar, where he meets Ernest Hemingway. Somehow, he is back in Paris of the '20s, though he returns to 2010.The next night, Gil rushes Inez to the spot, but she gets bored and leaves before the clock strikes midnight, at which point, another old car pulls up. Over the various nights, Gil meets Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Alice B. Toklas (who agrees to read his manuscript), Pablo Picasso, Man Ray, Luis Bunuel, Salvador Dali (Adrian Brody), Cole Porter, T. S. Eliot, Paul Gauguin, Toulouse-LaTrec, Degas, sees Josephine Baker perform, and goes to Maxim's. The one who makes the biggest impression is Picasso's lover, Ariadne (Marion Cotillard) with whom he falls in love.Though on the surface a light time-travel film, "Midnight in Paris" tackles some interesting subjects, not the least of which is discovering who you are and what you want and that it doesn't jive with your companion's. More fascinating, though, is the nostalgia aspect, that other eras always seem more exciting, simpler, and better, and that in the end, the wish to return to another time is just an escape from the angst of the present. To his surprise, he finds that Adriana longs for the Belle-Epoque era, feeling that the '20s are the way that Paul would describe the 2000 millennium thus far. He learns an important lesson.What a wonderful film, with each person looking like the character he or she plays -- Bates is a fabulous Gertrude Stein, Brody is a delightful Dali, and Corey Stoll a convincing Hemingway. Tom Hiddleston looks like photos of Fitzgerald. As the somewhat shallow Inez, Rachel McAdams is perfect - a sexy shop till you drop woman who wants the fairy tale. Wilson seems to copy Woody Allen's line readings at times, and he's just right as a confused young man looking for something but unsure that that is. He only knows something is missing.Allen is very prolific, and sometimes he hits, and sometimes he misses -- but as far as I'm concerned, he doesn't miss very often. His writing and direction of "Midnight in Paris" are solid, and he has another winner. Even at his age, he continues literally to broaden his horizons -- next he's going to Rome and Copenhagen. Some gifts, it seems, just keep on giving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>way, way too cute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the good reviews, I was expecting to like this film. Mostly it irritated me with its cuteness and shallowness.For a start, it makes far too much of the beauty of Paris. Yes, the city is pretty, and the opening shots of postcard-like scenes were charming, in a postcard way. But when the film began to make much--and I do mean much--of the idea that the scenery of a city contributes to human happiness in an important way, it began to annoy. Are people happier in Paris and Rome and Vancouver than elsewhere? Really? You mean they're inevitably and quantitatively more miserable in Nepal, Kyoto, a fishing village in Newfoundland? No, in our hearts we know that happiness comes from other things, from love, family, satisfying work, freedom from tragedy (i.e. luck) and, most important of all, that elusive factor, inner contentment. The prettiness of our surroundings offers at most only fleeting moments of delight, all within the context of a much larger experience. Midnight in Paris present a shallow, tourist's appreciation of life in Paris.When Gil, clearly incompatible with his fiancée, wanders over to a little music store, a woman walks out, young, pretty, they look at each other, they're obviously interested, they exchange a few words, they part, and we absolutely know that the movie will end with Gil leaving his fiancée and taking up with the French girl. Clunk. How dull. The central conceit of going back in time to what was in Gil's mind a golden age has a certain charm, but Allen ruins it by hammering it into the ground, shoving onto the stage every damned famous writer and painter he could think of--the grossest kind of name-dropping, celebrity-watching. Oh, oh, look, there's Hemingway! There's Alice B. Toklas! Aha, Gaugin! My goodness, Toulouse-Lautrec! Really, it becomes quite tiresome.The deep thinking of the film makes the point that every era looks back to some previous time which it regards as a golden age, before the vulgarity and ordinariness of the present. It's a nice thought, worth making. Yet it simply substitutes another escapist fantasy, namely, that one location, Paris, is a golden place, where life must be more vivid, more thrilling, in a word, happier. It's a shallow notion in a shallow film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mixed feelings but mainly irritation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of Woody and this is not going to make me one.One of the problems, I think, is that all the characters are cardboard. Owen Wilson plays Woody and shows such great Romantic Enthusiasm that it wore me down after a while! (At least he didn't try to obviously imitate Woody's mannerisms as Kenneth Branagh did in "Celebrity"!) Rachel McAdams plays his "Crass Fiancée" and Michael Sheen plays "The Pedant".Yes, we know Woody loves Paris but this too becomes oppressive in my opinion while becoming a near commercial for the city. And Woody has done the fantasy or time-travel shtick more than once before, most obviously in Zelig, Sleeper, and Purple Rose but these have all been done better by others.And finally, all the celebrities Owen meets are pretty much top of the pops: Cole, Ernest, Gertrude, Alice, Pablo, Luis, Salvador, Scott and Zelda, Man Ray, Josephine, T.S., Toulouse-Lautrec, Gaughuin, Matisse, Degas: they are all here! In short, a very superficial and obvious, if somewhat entertaining, film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen has a perspective that will never be duplicated or imitated properly. Not only is this story classic Woody, but the acting and perspective of the characters is so clearly his vision in this delightful comedy about confronting choices and taking risks. Owen Wilson gives a remarkable performance as Gil, the everyman who has come to the crossroads of his life and is uncertain about the path he has chosen. Rachel McAdams is so good at being the spoiled brat daughter of the well off parents, self absorbed, self aggrandizing, and totally unaware of anything she cannot control or seduce. The transitions from Paris of 2010 to Paris of the 1920's is seamless, without the mystical special effects of so many Hollywood productions these days. Gil is sitting on the stairs when an antique sedan comes by and the party goers call him in. The cast is a wonderful mix of American, French and British actors who all seem so at ease in the roles you would swear you had run into them in the street. Kathy Bates stands out for her performance of Gertrude Stein, the groundbreaking author, patron of the arts, and openly gay woman who influenced so many of the artists of the "Lost Generation". And I would be terribly remiss if I did not commend Corey Stoll in his bold performance as Ernest Hemingway, who was Stein's opposite in so many ways. As romantic comedy goes, this film will become a classic in the hearts of anyone who appreciates a finely woven tale of awakening and redemption in the city of lights. Rated PG-13 for sexual references and smoking, I hardly think the teens will have a problem with this film. Rent it, buy it, and watch it when you need a great story to pick you up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Dreams Meet Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should not have liked this movie. Everything in me screams not to like it, and has prevented me from actually watching it until now - Academy Award nominations notwithstanding. I don't really care very much for Woody Allen's movies. His work too often seems to be a reflection of his own quirks and neuroses, and the result is that I find myself being irritated by him rather than admiring his work. And, to be honest, I don't really care much for Owen Wilson as an actor. I find it hard for some reason to take him seriously. He strikes me as lightweight and flaky, lacking in depth, not altogether present in many of his roles. And yet, in "Midnight In Paris," Allen as director and Wilson as star work wonderfully together. Allen does a grand job of recreating Paris in primarily two (but actually as many as four in the course of the movie) eras. Paris comes across not only as a city of lights, but as a city of dreams. It captivates; it draws. And Wilson fits the story perfectly.He plays Gil Pender, an American screenwriter but really an aspiring novelist. He's visiting Paris with his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents. Gil and Inez don't work together. That's clear from the start. Why they're together is a bit of a mystery. He likes walking through Paris in the rain; she just wants to stay dry - maybe a reflection of the difficult match between a dreamer and someone with no imagination? Her parents don't care for him - they seem to think he's beneath her; so does she to be honest. There's an aristocratic snobbishness about them that Gil doesn't share. He wants to write; he dreams of living in the past, when Paris was a haven for writers and artists of various sorts. When Inez and Gil meet up with Paul &amp; Carol (old friends of Inez, whom Gil admits he's not really taken with) I really felt myself drawn to Gil. He was the target of repeated putdowns by the "pedantic" (that's the word that was very appropriately used) arrogance of Paul, who's a self-proclaimed expert on everything. As Inez is more and more drawn to Paul's snooty intellectualism, Gil is more and more drawn away from her, and begins to wander Paris late at night, when he is suddenly and inexplicably transported into the Paris of the 1920's - his idea of the golden age - where he meets famous writers and artists - Hemingway, Stein, Fitzgerald, Picasso and Dali among others. He's increasingly drawn to this life and this age, and especially to Adriana (Marion Cotillard) and returns night after night.The movie is a nostalgia trip, and yet it's a nostalgia trip that has a purpose. You see, as much as I don't like to admit it, Paul was right when he said, "nostalgia is denial - denial of the painful present... the name for this denial is golden age thinking - the erroneous notion that a different time period is better than the one one's living in - it's a flaw in the romantic imagination of those people who find it difficult to cope with the present." Nostalgia is a form of denial. You really can't escape the present with all its problems, no matter how hard you try. Gil has to come to understand that. His life isn't what he wants it to be; the people around him aren't the people he wants around him. He needs to come to terms with that. One of the great insights he discovers through his growing relationship with Adriana is that while she lives in the 1920's - his golden age - she has a golden age that's in the 1890's. Through that, he finally realizes that he has to live in the present because no matter where he goes in the past, there will always be a golden age to look back to and to yearn for, so unless he can learn to be satisfied with where and when he is, he can never be truly satisfied. The journey of self- discovery is an interesting and enjoyable and thought-provoking one.Allen made one mistake. It was around the detective hired by Inez's father to find out what Gil was doing at night. Without giving it away, the ultimate fate of the detective (who's a very minor character) seemed out of place - an unnecessary and far too deliberate and obvious attempt to draw a laugh out of the viewer; so obvious that it drew no laugh from me. I just wondered why the scene was included. It served no purpose. I'm not entirely sure why Allen included that scene. It weakened the movie, and coming near the end, it stays in the memory of the viewer. Aside from that one scene, though, this was a very good movie. Certainly one of the most enjoyable movies made by Woody Allen that I've ever seen. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen "meets" Bunuel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if it seems like that, this movie is not mainly about a tribute to some artists of 1930s or the praise of the city, Paris, this movie is a criticism of the bourgeoisie, lack of communication, egocentricity and selfishness. And it is about a man who doesn't belong to that "world". Before starting my thoughts on the film, I want to say that I have no idea why a lot of people hate Owen Wilson and they say that they couldn't stand him! I like Owen Wilson! I like him and he was one of my reasons of watching this film, because I am not a Woody Allen fan and I have seen a few of his films so far. Years years ago, when Wilson played in an action movie, Behind Enemy Lines, again, people said he was awful, but it wasn't true (if you ask me) Anyway... Midnight in Paris is one of the most offbeat movies I have ever seen in a good way and surprisingly it reminded me Bunuel films like Le Charme Discret De la Bourgeoisie. I don't know Allen did it intentionally or not but what a coincidence, there is a fictional Luis Bunuel in the film! When I saw A Streetcar Named Desire, like many people, I couldn't understand that Brando was the villain until starting to think about it after the movie. This movie is not the same, but similar. Inez is "the villain" of this movie! She doesn't care about her fiancé, she doesn't give value to him, she "carries him like a bag". She is selfish, egocentric. She doesn't think about pleasing her fiancé, she makes herself happy, always! She cheats Gil, just because she wants to do, just because she wants to have an "adventure". It seems that probably, this will reflect badly on their sexual life when they get marry! She is a spoiled girl by her bourgeois family. She goes shopping with her mother (a reference to shopaholic women?) We see her and her family while doing an activity always. However in a repellent way. The bourgeoisie consists of "enjoying the life all the time, this is what the movie tries to say to us I think. Therefore, this couple is not like the couple in Before Sunrise! While Gil is talking, Inez is always busy with doing something, she doesn't "listen" him, because she doesn't care about him. Paul, a friend of Inez, is an intellectual, may be a pseudo intellectual (I've never figured out the thin line between the two), but it feels like he is a smart Aleck, this is the fact. There is a scene. Gil interprets some paintings and Paul (also Inez) get down! You know, in fight movies, in a neighborhood, there is a weak child who is always beaten by the other boys. Then, by a miracle, he meets a master, the master teaches him to fight and at the end, the child kicks their .ss! That painting scene in Midnight in Paris feels like that for me. Gil does not belong to that world, the world of Inez, the world of Inez's family, the world of bourgeois. At this point, Allen opens a door of "another world" to Gil. Salvation from that life! Even the artists in the past give Gil value, more than his fiancée! Adriana... What a woman! She is a very dominant woman, she is a woman like a woman, but she "listens" Gil, she cares about Gil, she doesn't nag at him or lecture him like a child as his fiancée does! Inez is a scolding girl, she is a shrew, Adriana is a "female". As for the characters in the past, another great success, No overacting, No cartoon-like character and No farcical moment! However, the only flaw, Allen can't conclude the past successfully, he just "leaves" it. Let's talk about the Inez's family. Her mother hates walking in the rain, because she is too self indulgent like other bourgeois people. They always want to do an activity, but always! What they don't think or care about is other people including their daughter's fiancé! When they suppose that the earrings are stolen, they suspect the maid, they despise the maid and the most important, when Gil implies he wants to break up, her reaction is "here is the door!" She doesn't cry, she doesn't try to stop him, she doesn't feel upset, because she doesn't even care about that! Then why? She doesn't want to sadden herself. Thus, Midnight in Paris succeeds in something which Titanic couldn't! And there is another girl, the third girl, she is a saleslady. Gil meets her, she likes walking in the rain (get it?) She is too imaginary to be real and at the same time may be she is too real to be a dream. She is not like Inez as she is not like Adriana. At the end, her and Gil go for a walk. Even if this is a very cliché final, the message behind it is worth saying!</fullReview>

Most would recognize themselves, trying to escape reality and go back to a "golden era".. apart from the notorious and less notorious characters portrayed in the '20s, this movie gives a lot to think about, and delivers many emotions to the passionate watcher. Its a perfect romantic movie, not necessarily a chick flick, ideal Francophiles, truly enjoyable indeed. Watch it over a glass of wine and possibly with a fireplace warming you...

		<shortDescription>A charmer from Woody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On two things Woody Allen's admirers would agree, he is both a master entertainer and a director of considerable technical accomplishment. Most would also agree that his habit of producing one new work each year has led him into the pitfall of unevenness, a fault he shares with the French master, Claude Chabrol. But when it comes to identifying the highs and lows of his over prolific career, the disagreement starts. Is the "Annie Hall", "Manhattan", "Hannah and her Sisters" period really his best? I have personal reservations about these and, at the same time, I am aware that my own favourites are not always shared by others. For me "Love and Death" is a comic masterpiece which manages to sustain a stream of gags without ever becoming stale on repeated viewings. "Radio Days" achieves that sense of nostalgia for a place and time past that was the endearing quality of my favourite Fellini, "Amarcord". "Everyone Says I Love You" is a simply gorgeous musical which takes the passing of a year framework adopted for "Hannah" and improves on it. And what about the slyly wicked "Match Point" with its echoes of Theodore Dreiser's "An American Tragedy" - Woody at his darkest and, dare I say, finest. And then there are those moments particularly in his more recent career that get the critics saying excitedly that Woody is over his self obsessed doldrums and has regained something of his former brilliance. They said it with "Melinda and Melinda" which I am afraid I found one great yawn. And now they are saying it again with "Midnight in Paris" with perhaps rather more justification. This is a quite charming film in the Woody Allen canon, if, to my mind, a minor one. Not that it starts particularly promisingly. In "Manhattan" the wonderful opening shots of New York accompanied by a swirl of Gershwin, somehow conveyed the director's total immersion in his love of a great city because they were so successfully subsumed into the context of the movie. A similar attempt to do the same with Paris with little more than a set of picture postcard shots is rather tame and conventional by comparison. Enter the American visitors with their endless yakking in restaurants, hotels and famous sites and I feared the worst, another one of Woody's conversation pieces going nowhere. But shortly into the film with the stroke of midnight and the sudden appearance of the 1920's car it all changes and we are in that world of fantasy that Woody does rather well. Remember "The Purple Rose of Cairo" and his contribution to "New York Stories"! Here the hero first stumbles into the world of the 20's and then into La Belle Epoque meeting up with an assortment of the great and famous, several of them rather good look-alikes. It's all enjoyable, clever stuff and if not quite one of his peaks, a reassurance that even with just over 40 films behind him, Woody still has the ability on occasions to delight and surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes you want to visit Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will take you out of your neighborhood, town, city, and place you squarely in Paris for an hour and a half. Cheap and easy way to see the world right? During most of the movie, I was really skeptical because the plot seemed so unrealistic and felt almost as if I was tricked into watching it. After all, the trailer gave a completely different picture about what the movie would be about. But by the end, this movie made me reminiscence about my own visit to Paris and to study French again! To truly enjoy it, remember to let go of reality and you will have a wonderful experience.Story (3.0/3.0): This is not the typical chick flick as the trailer may suggest, and you will be frustrated if that is what you are expecting. But take a step back and just enjoy the movie. The plot structure is very unique. There is also great character development for the main character, who realizes an important insight that may be useful in all of our lives. You will learn a bit about the culture, literary, and arts of the 1920's and see much of "touristy Paris" as well.Acting (2.4/3.0): Owen Wilson does a great job playing an awkward and often confused guy. Adrian Brody has a minor role but does a great job playing a caricature that will crack you up. Rachel McAdams was probably thrown in just for the sex appeal toward guys. But the best acting job was done by Marion Coutillard. For those of us who've only seen her in Inception, her acting here is 10x better and captures perfectly her seductiveness and dream-like quality.Cinematography (2.0/2.0): The movie is BEAUTIFULLY made. The color hues add a vintage artistic feel to it. The modern day Paris is very realistic and just as how I had remembered it.Music (0.8/1.0): Typical French music as expected but it fits perfectly.Rewatchability (1.0/1.0): You will leave with theories about what the ending means and will want to rewatch it with this new perspective!Overall score: 9.1/10.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris- Woody &amp; His Philosophy of Life ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen, as always, tries to find the true meaning of life in an upbeat way in this 2011 romantic comedy.Too bad that Allen wasn't younger, he could have easily played the part which was done quite well by Owen Wilson.A young writer and his girlfriend come to parents along with her parents, just before they are married. By a quirk of fate, Wilson is transported back to the 1920s and meets the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Salvadore Dali, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and so many others from that grand period.Everyone is marvelous here in depicting their famous people they are playing.While the '20s was certainly a golden era, the film shows what can happen when one of the people goes back to the 1890s.Reality always wins out and at least by film's end, Wilson realizes where he belongs and with whom he does not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who wouldn't want to relive the glory days of Paris? Though at what cost? Is it because we are unsatisifed with our own current lives that we must seek some sort of escape to go back in time to a time when things were "better".Owne Wilsion goes to Paris with his Fiancé for a vacation with there her parents but when they are there Wilsion is just over excited with all the history and beauties that Paris has to offer. He gets so wrapped into it that one night hes walking the desolate streets of late Paris. He meets some of the most influential, magnificent writers and painters of the roaring 20s. Its something he could only dream of actually come true, but when he keeps visiting the past he starts to question if he really is happy to be in the past or just the fact he gets to escape from his mundane life that he is unsatisfied with. He starts to loose touch with his Fiancé who is played by Rachel McAdams who doesn't really understand the obsession that Wilsion has with Paris and doesn't really want to understand. Wilsion just shrugs it off because its his Fiancé what can really do, its only when he goes through some sort of transition when going back in time to the golden age of Paris. I never really watch movies like this, but it really touched my inner cavalcade of appreciation of what we use to have and what we have now. Yes we can go back and live in our favorite era, but it will never do us no good, because the life we live now will be our real era and we can't do anything about, good or bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a very nice film to enjoy on a Saturday night. If you're watching this movie at home, I would suggest closing the shutters and the lights in order to add to the experience of midnight in Paris. This movie was a pleasure to watch, and I enjoyed a lot about it. I think that overall it was well-made and the picture was very well done, with really beautiful scenery of Paris and Parisian customs and all of that kind of lifestyle. The script was also very nice, except I would recommend adding more emphasis on the moral of the movie, that life is not necessarily better elsewhere. The movie did touch upon that moral when Gil was talking to Adriana near the end of the film. I felt that the ending of the movie could have been completed more thoroughly than it was. However, other than that, the script was quite captivating, and though I expected it to be a little boring, it was not at all! The acting in this movie was gorgeous, especially Owen Wilson's, who really gave light to his character and made the film very enjoyable to watch. Excellent performance! Marion Cotillard was also great in this movie as Adriana. The other actors in this film also played their roles well and all contributed to the greatness of the movie as a whole.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. I would definitely recommend this movie. Good job Woody Allen on a great movie, and same goes to all the stars in this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>midnight in Paris is a fantastic movie about generations upon generations of nostaligic regret, and the contrast with the dismal present, because life itself is unsatisfying! yes its unrealistic and coincidencially romantic at times, but thats the point! its a movie about the movies, and a fabricated era filled with wonder and insight into the past... man... i mean i know the movie takes notions from older movies, like Les Quatre Cents Coups and it's description of France's failing generation, but it does it well and im glad such a good movie has been made in the 21st century with such great inspirations from the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Discreet Charm of Woody Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen has never made a film worthy of enshrinement in the Pantheon. ANNIE HALL? Not quite. MANHATTAN? No. His early comedies? Pretty close. PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO? The closest. However, no discussion of late-20th Century film is complete without mention of his personality, his formidable output, his Bergmanesque preoccupations, and his style. Indeed, maybe he has made so many 'nearly good-enoughs' with such panache and duty that he will last forever. We look at MIDNIGHT IN Paris, another movie that no one else could have made, and the feeling is only strengthened.Allen must have been waiting to shoot the opening montage of this film since he made MANHATTAN. It is a portrait of Paris no painter could have done. Full, gorgeous, serene, textured, candid glimpses of the great city of light. MIDNIGHT is undoubtedly the most visually mature Allen picture. The deep and bold tones illuminate the magic and skin, enough to make you yearn for Rachel McAdams' Inez (Sartre reference anybody?) while she is terrorizing every scene she inhabits as the most unforgiving witch of 2011. MIDNIGHT also makes clear that Allen has matured so much as a writer, always his best skill. It is his most visually expressive script after DECONSTRUCTING HARRY or possibly MATCH POINT. I've often wondered how his writing might illuminate the work of a director other than himself - a Coen or a Scorcese. As the Woody-Hero enters Golden Age Paris, we begin to discern the obligatory fable. But in MIDNIGHT there is something else twisted in from Owen Wilson's performance. The look on his face before submitting to the fantasy is striking; more striking is to what he eventually submits. It's exactly what makes MIDNIGHT the best Allen work since CAIRO. Gil subdues himself to a will other than his own. He relents. This is remarkable in the history of Allen stand-ins. Allen imbues Wilson (a likely puppet) with his own jittery aimlessness, but also commitment and less ego. Wilson takes these revolutionary Allen traits and creates a Woody-Hero that is so fresh and so likable. Something we have never seen before.The cameos inside of Golden Age Paris are magnificent, if fleeting. Adrien Brody's Dali is better than you can imagine and Hemingway is a bright caricature. It is hard to describe the genuine treat of seeing these wonderful heroes of the past in such color. One thing we can always grant Allen is his steadfast ability to employ his fables for a double meaning. Yes, there is joy in MIDNIGHT, joy is one of the new and exciting characteristics. But his pessimism is not so far away. In taking us one layer deeper into the Belle Epoque, we understand his point. It's impossible to be happy. Even our dreams of real happiness are false. We imbue times and figures with an unquestioned brilliance. Allen shows us that these feelings are no better than Paris in the rain. Gil's speech about a city being a work of art creates another poignant conclusion. It is Allen reconciling the Hollywood Hack (non-art) with the novelist (art), to understand that beauty is beauty. A rhinoceros is a rhinoceros.There are flaws. Allen creates so many incredible characters and barely employs them. His haste is his error. In some cases, it ends in crude or abrupt plot developments. MIDNIGHT could have been 20 minutes longer and it would have been a better picture, possibly one for the Pantheon.But Allen has created another work of wit, charm, and poignancy. It doesn't escape his obsessive pessimism, but it does show us a side of him that we have never seen. One not cloaked in hateful sarcasm. One not bleak or humorless. Not so relentless. MIDNIGHT allowed his humor to be real. So maybe we will always remember Woody for his winding career. As there are peaks and valleys, it is safe to say that here we have a marvelous peak and perhaps the highest.91.443</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's a Woody Allen movie I wanted to like...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because I heard such good things about it. I ended up liking the bits of music in the background, the look of Paris itself, and two of its principal actresses--Rachel McAdams and Marion Cotillard, both of whom played their roles to the hilt.But I had trouble with Owen Wilson's habit of "slavishly" portraying Woody Allen as the troubled central character who finds living in the past is giving him the kind of nostalgic glow he craves. It takes the full story to unwind before he finds a girl who likes to walk in the rain alongside him and is also an eager devotee of Cole Porter's romantic music. Wilson's imitation becomes tiresome before the first scene is over and from then on I had a hard time just trying to enjoy the film.Lots of name dropping goes on throughout the writer's story, once Wilson embraces the past at the magic hour of midnight. He meets F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda, Picasso, Gertrude Stein (a bored looking Kathy Bates), a macho Ernest Hemingway and a hilarious Salvador Dali adroitly played by Adrien Brody. There's a hit and miss aspect to the casting of these celebrated characters but they provide the right comic relief.But something seems wrong from the start, mainly due to the wrong casting of Owen Wilson as the protagonist. He seems as nervous and on edge as his mentor (Mr. Allen), but watching him is an uncomfortable experience.The film is slight but amusing, although hardly worthy of a Best Screenplay Oscar.</fullReview>

I guess you know what it's about because you either have seen the trailer or read a summary of the plot, but I fortunately could avoid those things and went in without knowing anything about the movie. And let me tell you, it was great fun.Still not sure about the Oscar nods (while movies like DRIVE only got one nomination), but the movie is entertaining while not really making any sense. Or trying to explain anything. You either accept what happens or you will be left out (or you will feel that way). Very intriguing and maybe even thought provoking, this has a simple message after all. Which is not a bad thing at all</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen revisits the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Owen Wilson incarnates the younger Woody Allen borderline neurotic protagonist and acts with the same intonations of earlier Allen when he was acting. It was so eerie that I kept confusing them or seeing some Allen in Wilson most of the film.The open sequence is a cinematographic homage to Paris that works and gets you right into it. The film is as much a tribute to the city and to all vibrant cities as his earlier Manhanthan was for New York.Then humour, situation and great dialogue and acting starts. The engaged couple interaction between each other and with other couples (friends and parents) is typical great Woody Allen writing. This film is quirky and becomes even quirkier with time, only to work as a whole in the end.Woody's imagination is rampant and his love for previous artist who overshadow the love his protagonist has for his fiancé or vice versa go sometimes into the realm of masturbatory fictional writing and fantasizing, but shine through with the themes, including love, art and the concept of time and of a golden area.My favourite scene which I never tire of seeing is Adrian Brody being brilliant as the genius and eccentric Salvador Dali. He has this satirical version of Dali to perfection (with the quintessential help of Allen as the writer/director) and I could only have asked to see more of him than the brief scene in which he appears and appeal.Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates and especially Marion Coillard also shine as actresses.Thanks again Woody! A moody and worthwhile revelation and mockery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The following are comments about "Midnight In Paris" (2011) and also (at the end of the comments) a brief memory of a time I met Woody Allen personally.... from Tex Allen, SAG Actor.--------------------The "Midnight In Paris" (2011) movie is OK and interesting many ways....movie making is very hard work, and Woody obviously went easy on himself and the actors part of th movie....took a lot of short-cuts....how to make movies at age 76 and not die from overwork, it appears!The main character gets into a time warp and goes back to both the 1920's and the 1890's and talks with celebrities in Paris during those two periods...quite a WHO'S WHO laundry list of famous people...maybe 2 dozen of them.Nice photography of present day Paris, too, which is very clean, clean, clean and so scrubbed is lacks charm in contrast to older movie depictions of Paris when it's charming (AMERICAN IN Paris [1951], etc.).The actors improvise a lot, and Woody's script has about 3 very good short sections with memorable writing, etc.The movie is no classic, but not bad, either. Young Owen Wilson has the lead role, plays the part of a writer with girlfriend problems and job problems...all comic ones...same as Woody when he used to star in his own movies.Documentary part of the DVD I got shows Woody at a press conference in 2011 at Cannes, and his looks very fragile and unhealthy...his skin is very yellow and pasty looking, and one eye looks bad, like a man who had a stroke...and his speech isn't clear at times......but...he keeps on going like old man river.He really is one of the great figures in cinema....like D. W. Griffith, I think. I met him face to face in NYC in 1972 at a place where he played his clarinet several times weekly with the house jazz band...called "Michael's Pub" as I remember. I was living in Manhattan then, selling educational movies....had a jazzy apt. in the easy 60's near the place where Woody played...went to see him one afternoon with a girlfriend who knew about it. He talked about the Mets baseball team.Woody is very important...made 41 films since TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN in 1968...... Woody made that movie in SF CALIF on almost no money!-----------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG-AFTRA movie actor. Visit WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen for more information about Tex Allen.

Owen Wilson is not the right person for the role. He made what would be a nice sophisticated romance movie into a run-in-the-mill romantic comedy. At least romantic comedies are funny... This is not. How can a movie with all the right elements: Great settings, great story, great plot and plot devices, go so wrong? Because the central character is wrong.

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen does it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantastic movie, just as enjoyable as The Purple Rose of Cairo, or any other better movie from him and they always have the following ingredients: they are hilarious, serious, meaningful, intellectual, neurotic, they have great story writing - and they are about two problematic realities of life: relationships and the arrow of time. I watched Midnight In Paris and what can I say? The next day it still makes me happy, typing this, with the soundtrack on the background (Cole Porter, You do something to me). This movie is utterly great entertainment! Woody Allen does it again! This movie has intellectual snobs, materialistic women, right-wing politicians, dreamy writers, time-space mix-ups, all set in Paris. This is a wonderful trip in cultural history about this greatest city of the world, furthermore there is great jazz music (buy the soundtrack!), and, the acting is great. So what more could one want watching this movie? One, to see Paris immediately, second: a guarantee from above that Woody Allen will live to a 100 to make many more movies like this. Thank you again Woody Allen for another knock-out flick with substance! And of course, Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams for being such great protagonists!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a movie that romanticizes Paris?extolling all it's magic and beauty?while belying the theme we always over-romanticize the world outside our realm.It's immensely entertaining and like other Woody Allen films it's not necessarily laugh out loud funny as much as it's quietly smirking to oneself funny. Rachel McAdams sheds her perfect, big-eyed nice girl role to play a vain, arrogant socialite while still being completely believable. Owen Wilson, who has been a screenwriter, gives a nice balance between young-boy-like-wonderment with a scared, always doubtful, realist. The world it creates in 1920's Paris is amazing with beautiful sets, costumes, lighting, cars, and many other nice touches to make us feel like we're there.See this movie because it's overly romantic while still picking fun at itself in the way only Woody Allen can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant plot idea, superb acting, incredible art design - but lacks humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris is a movie that really deserves all awards it could possibly get, including best picture of 2011, and yet, I feel it's a movie that does not quite deserve the Best Screenplay award (unless, of course, the competition is too weak).I don't need to go on about the movie itself, as other reviewers already done so. It is technically perfect, the casting is spot on, and the art direction has an unusually high standard, at least for Woody Allen films.However, I feel this movie could be so much more. Why doesn't Gil research a bit more about Adriana apart from randomly finding a diary? Why doesn't he seem torn apart his fiancé and his love from the past? Why does Paul simply vanishes from the movie at the point he is supposed to be flirting with Gil's fiancé (thus bringing the audience more reason to have him follow Adriana, and his decision not to be much more painful)?It feels like one draft away of a perfect movie - and it feels much of the original emotional punches and the character arcs were left in the cutting room floor. Pity. It is very good, but could have been MUCH better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been a Woody Allen fan particularly but I found this film to be one of the best I've seen in recent years. I am aware that people think some of the references go over the heads of people but I don't think it mattered at all. Likewise, I didn't think it "too guided" (with the introducing by names of the characters). It's a thoroughly engaging story with great understated performances. A light romantic comedy that I couldn't take my eyes off. I watched it again very quickly after the first time. Okay, Owen Wilson might be playing Woody Allen but I'm fine with that. It might be what we need in the world. Oh, and Michael Sheen is excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen turns his fantasy towards Paris.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost always see what is on DVD 'extras' after I see a movie, and in a departure from most Allen films this one has an interesting and useful session with Allen, Wilson, and McAdams before a foreign audience. Allen explains that he wanted to do a Paris movie, and he first settled in on the title "Midnight in Paris" without having any idea what the story would be. Eventually of course "midnight" became a key exposition element of his story. One of my favorite Allen movies is fantasy "The Purple Rose of Cairo" and here he brings another novel, interesting fantasy to tell a very good story about life.The key character is Owen Wilson as Gil. He is a Hollywood hack, a screen writer, but wants to do more with his talent. He is working on his first novel and finds himself visiting Paris with his fiancée (McAdams) and her parents. He is enchanted with the idea of Paris, and also dreams about living in 1920s Paris, in the rain, which he believes would be the nirvana of his existence.If you don't already know this story involves 'time-travel' then I won't say anything else until after the 'spoilers' warning below. I don't usually like Owen Wilson, but in truth he is a very good actor and I believe this is my favorite role of his. And the story has a good moral about accepting the present rather than living your life wishing it were in a different, "more romantic" era.SPOILERS: One evening while walking back to his Paris hotel Gil gets a bit lost and finds himself alone on some steps as the clocks sound midnight. Just then a 1920s-era taxi pulls up and summons him. He goes with them and soon figures out he really had been transported to 1920s Paris. He meets a number of historical figures, like Cole Porter, Ernest Hemmingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and others. He makes this 'trip' several times, always triggered by midnight at the same location. While in the 1920s he meets a girl who longs for the 1890s Paris, a period she thinks would be better. Soon the two of them are summoned by a horse-n-buggy cab and find themselves in 1890s Paris. Was this all a dream? No, back in 2010 Gil buys an old book, written by the girl he met, and in it she recounts their meeting, even with his exact name. Eventually he learns the lesson, to appreciate the time you are in and strive for fulfillment there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You're in love with a fantasy."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Owen Wilson stars as Gil, a burned-out Hollywood script writer, who's visiting Paris with his fiancée. The couple have very different opinions of Paris and of life in general; she hates the city and wants to hurry back to her Beverly Hills life while he adores Paris and wishes he had lived there in the 1920s. One night, at midnight, Gil's fantasy comes true as he is magically transported to the glittering world of Fitzgerald, Hemmingway, Picasso, and Gertrude Stein.If you love Woody Allen, you'll enjoy this movie. Wilson plays the typically introspective, dissatisfied, stammering, good-hearted dreamer that Woody used to play but with much less success. Wilson just doesn't have the power and charisma needed to pull off the role. He's boring and I never cared about him or Rachel McAdams, who plays his fiancée. She's really annoying and unremarkable in every way. Marion Cotillard, on the other hand, is utterly charming as Gil's 1920's love interest and Cathy Bates is fun to watch as Gertrude Stein.The city of Paris never looked lovelier, with nearly every scene saturated in golden light, befitting Gil's fantasy land. The period costumes are lovely and several scenes featuring famous people from the past are enjoyable (although the fun wears off quickly). Writer/director Allen's script is silly, predictable, shallow, and dull. I couldn't relate to any of the characters; it was like visiting a wax museum that's pretty but the mannequins aren't real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i am not a fan of Woody Allen, even less of a fan after his marriage to his adopted daughter, but it seems that Hollywood and the movie-going public can almost forgive anything. And let's face it, he has not made a good movie in years. i know many think Vickie Christina Barcelona was great, but i thought it was awful. Owen Wilson was an odd choice for the lead and his nose distracts me, but i stuck it out and actually enjoyed the film. Owen seemed to be changeling Woody through the whole film. i think Woody wanted to play this role, but realises he isn't a great actor and he is too old now. Perhaps i enjoyed the scenes of Paris more than the film. i love Paris. i had problems with the characters, especially Inez played by Rachel McAdams. i liked the idea of going back in time and living another life, but then it seemed more about him cheating on his girlfriend, which i did not like. If you love Allen or Paris, then i would say watch it, once won't be a complete waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light but lovely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aping the opening of Manhattan, with a number of street-level shots of Paris cut to European traditional jazz sets this film apart - slightly - in Woody Allen's oeuvre. It certainly sits apart from the recentfilms which are a bit aimless. This is funnier and more purposeful. A lot of this is to do with Allen substituting Owen Wilson for himself as the romantic, or rather impetuous writer lead, Gil. Wilson adopts the same charming, untidy stream-of-consciousness approach as his character's- sake, breezing past the pedantry of his peers and the tunnel-visioned Gallophobia of his in-laws-to-be.It also means that we can accept the sci-fi/magic realism of the second and third acts of the film, post midnight time-travelling, without much mental trauma. If I had one criticism of the film its that it pays Wilson too much attention and doesn't quite pay its respects to the capital (specifically the 1920s) as it might. Still it is a lovely, coherent film, wearing its philosophy lightly for charm's sake. It works a treat. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: Midnight In Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"That Paris exists and anyone could choose to live anywhere else in the world will always be a mystery to me "Such a sentiment has never been more true than when expressed in Woody Allen's latest offering. The quality of his more recent films has notably declined from his output of the 70&#x2032;s, but Allen has returned with a wonderful, funny story and solid characters. Owen Wilson is Gil, a Hollywood screenwriter seeking a new career as a literary writer. Tagging along to Paris with his snobby fiancée and her parents, he discovers a decadent and romantic world he has always wanted to be a part of ? literally.Although transporting characters to a previous time is a difficult and often perilous move, the film proves that nearly any idea can materialise nicely in the hands of a talented and knowledgeable director. Similarly, to carry off the trick plot line with ease strong character actors are a must and Allen has managed to secure the cream of the minuscule, modern Hollywood crop. Wilson is well cast and convincing as the bumbling, naive Gil and works well against his haughty fiancée Inez, played by Rachel McAdams. Other star turns include Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein and Marion Cotillard as Adriana, a beautiful ingénue who captures Gil's heart. Corey Stoll is remarkable as the deadpan, yet brilliant Hemingway, and Carla Bruni also pops up in an amusing cameo. Other supporting characters to watch out for are Alison Pill and Tom Hiddleston as Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald and a surprising performance from Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali. Cinematography is key in this film and is one truly spectacular element. The scenes are lit in a semi-gloom that is redolent of 1920&#x2032;s Parisian postcards and artwork. The makeup and wardrobe styling adds a strong feeling of thought and care given to recreation of an extraordinary time and era. Anyone who can succeed in making Paris appear more beautiful than it is in reality has achieved something quite special. Overall, Woody has made a film that it's difficult to fault and that is quite simply the only criticism I have of it!All Rights Reserved © Copyright 2011 Michelle Lacey (Michelle Ní Láitheása). www.madameaddams.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not a bad Woody Allen film, it's not a bad film for people of a certain age with a certain level of education - Woody Allen fans, in other words. If you see MIP in a comfortable cinema with nice company you'll probably enjoy it. It will absorb you if you let it. Owen Wilson does a good job as an aspiring 'serious' writer on a pre-nuptial family vacation in Paris conflicted by his desire to follow the writer's path against his impending marriage to a self-absorbed WASP heiress. I do wonder that Woody wasn't credited as 'Mr. Wilson's voice coach', because once again his leading man appears to have been instructed to do an impression of the director, and it's to Wilson's credit that he makes this work. A simple enough premise - Gil Pender (Wilson) is regularly picked up by a vintage limo at midnight and transported to 1920's Paris where he runs into most of the cultural icons of that time, who help him both with his novel and his love life. The best turn is Adrian Brody as Salvador Daleeeee!, but most of the cameos (Picasso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, etc.) are very convincing. Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein is not so good, she just comes over as a Midwestern community support worker - the character could have stood a lot more edginess and neurosis, considering how important she is in the script. Eventually he falls in love with - sorry, can't remember the name, and that's an illustration of how 2-dimensional the character is - Hemingway/Picasso's girl, and realises he wants to stay in Paris, unlike his fiancée who wants a Malibu beach house. And this is where the ending of the film lets you down, because Gil and - sorry, can't remember the name, and that's an illustration of how 2-dimensional the character is - his fiancée have a fairly tame argument and he walks out of the hotel. That's it. The climax. Luckily he meets up with the extremely cute (and extremely badly acted) girl who runs the nostalgia shop where he's been picking up Cole Porter 78s. Sorry Woody, this is one-o-one scriptwriting. When he and fiancée split, there needs to be more at stake than just mild inconvenience. The supernatural premise is allowed to carry the film, and it's well staged enough to satisfy most of the way, but the story fizzles out. The fact is, the characters are not developed enough for any sort of deeper conflict to arise. The female characters are particularly thinly drawn, especially Carla Bruni (joke). Speaking of bad acting, Carla Bruni as a tour guide does manage to be better than Madonna. Just. Good music, good scenery, a few good gags (the French PI steals the end) and a few wry observations of Americans abroad, MIP will suspend your disbelief and leave you feeling warm inside. If it were Goldilocks' porridge, she'd like the taste and temperature, but think it a little thin.</fullReview>

I think what put me off the most was how annoying all the central characters are. Griping, obnoxious, arguing and just being horrible tourists. Owen Wilson was alright, bumbling along as usual, this time with a bit of a Woody Allen thing going on because that's who he's meant to be right?! This was beautifully filmed though and the love story to Paris is really the best part of the movie. I also enjoyed the storyline, I was into the fantasy of travelling back in time to 1920; intriguing and magical. It was also fun to see some familiar faces playing the likes of Salvador Dali and Earnest Hemingway and it seemed like the actors were having a great time with their roles. 04.14.14</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie would have been a lot better if not for the main character. Didn't particularly like his character, and the actor didn't help. It was really annoying to see how hard they tried to paint his wife as stuck up and bad--we get the message, it's not a happy marriage. The effort was too much to get us to feel bad for him.That aside, the actual scenes of the past were quite well done, and the cinematography was good.-minor spoiler ahead- That doesn't give him an excuse to steal her things and try to get laid with another girl--and then he turns around and gets mad at his wife when he finds she's been having an affair?? He was trying to do the exact same thing?? That sums up the main character pretty handily, I think. Entitled, selfish, hypocritical, and slimy. Quite annoying too. That aside, his writing a book on his experience was extremely cliché and pointless. One of the worst movies I have ever seen, and it's very rare that I dislike a movie this much. If the movie had been without the MC, it would've made maybe 7 or 8 stars in my book. But instead we have to follow this petty, arrogant, self-entitled jerk around as he tries too hard to sound smart and get girls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shallow and silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a very shallow and silly story. A pathetic salad made of famous artists and writers combined with a unimpressive main character. The main idea of the movie - magically getting back in time to meet most noticeable people of the past - is older than the oldest motion picture. It starts as a vacation in Paris of a young couple that is about to marry. He is a writer, she is a shopaholic. These two really do not match each other. Miraculously he starts to get back in time every night and meet most famous writers and artists of the past. Gradually he learns that his relationship is rubbish - something that is clear to everybody from the beginning of the movie.True waste of time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trite. A self absorbed 15 year old boy's fantasy. The cast mercifully distracts from the silly story. Owen Wilson, ( Allen), flits from one nymph to another and walks away with a French Mia Farrow clone. Allens' films mostly amount to little more than elaborate stand up routines peppered with pseudo intellectual name drops. Rachel McAdam's character is so vapid one is mystified how someone so deep, cool and swell as Owen Wilson's character, ( who Allen wishes he could be), could have ever have proposed to her. One is left with the impression that the movie is really Allen's own fantasy about what would happen if he could travel back in time and show some real writers ( like him) his text and yes, in that fantasy they would be impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why did this movie get such praise...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought it was very mediocre approaching boring. Nothing exciting or funny or entertaining even happens. And I certainly didn't think any actor deserved an acting nomination in this. Owen Wilson plays Gil, a writer trying to write his first novel. He's in Paris with his finance and her family and they are seeing the sights. One night at midnight, he gets into this car and some how ends up in the 1920s; this part is never explained. So, he meets some of his favorite writers and artists, like Fitsgerald, Hemmingway, and Picasso. He also meets Picasso's girl,that he likes and this makes him see, he shouldn't marry his finance.And all this magic makes him want to movie to Paris, and he meets a new Parisan girl. The end.FINAL VERDICT: I didn't find much good about this, I don't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This explores similar territory as PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO and ALICE, with a dose of magic realism (or maybe just plain magic) and a look at the unattainability of idealized romanticism. For the most part, the film irritated me. I did like where it ended up, but getting there was not fun. The setup in the first 15 minutes is painful, with everyone sliding into narrow, phony, pre-defined roles. And then we get to the parade of shallow 1920's references. Maybe the point is that Gil's perception of his idols is shallow, but it was still annoying to see Hemingway (and Stein and Picasso and Baker, et cetera et cetera) doing the equivalent of waving his hands around saying "Look at me, I'm Hemingway!". Everything is WAY too on-the-nose, in both the modern time and the past. Owen Wilson is vaguely likable as he naturally is (and thankfully not trying to imitate Allen that much), but his character is frankly a drag. McAdams and Sheen come off like straw men, not real human beings in the slightest (sure, we all know people like them, but it's just too simplistic to reduce them to such easy targets). Moreover, I didn't find very much of it funny or even that charming. The whole thing was unsatisfying and disappointing. I think Woody needs to try something radically different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen, not succumbing to despair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is funny, charming and clever. But perhaps more surprisingly, it doesn't feel like it has to balance that charm with ponderous, grim, philosophy. Light and frivolous, although with an interesting central point, the movie is Woody Allen in a good mood. A friend of mine called the movie superficial, which I disagree with, but it is certainly not Woody Allen trying to be deep, and I think that's great, because for me, the more profound Allen tries to be the more we see the limits of his artistry. But here, he makes a funny movie with a clever premise, good performances, absolutely gorgeous cinematography and some wildly funny moments (the scene with the surrealists is so wonderful).Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just an absolutely lovely film, definitely one of the best I've seen all year. I can picture Woody Allen sitting at a café in Paris staring out into the streets letting his imagination wander freely and write the story for him. I'm an artist so i have a sweet spot for this film and perhaps gave an extra star for that reason, but that aside it's a beautifully shot film that has a good simple story, and believable characters in a fantastic setting. One minus would be Rachel McAdams, who played opposite Owen Wilson, she was too 2-dimesional. She just played uptight and annoyed (which she happens to do pretty well) for the whole movie. I didn't quite understand how the two characters could have ever become engaged. Otherwise the film is pretty stellar. The rest of the cast is mostly brilliant. Owen Wilson is always Owen Wilson so if you are okay with that he does a fine job. As always Marion Cotillard is blissfully good.The film is incredibly sweet and romantic and funny without being corny; i absolutely loved it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intellectual fantasy, Woody Allen style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 3? minutes opening shot, which simply shows us various Paris sceneries with background music playing, not a word is spoken, and none was called for, was a hook of sorts; then Owen Wilson starts talking as the screen credits start rolling by on a black back-canvass and it is all about extolling how great that city is. Having been there on one of my favorite vacations, I immediately wanted to return. What Owen Wilson is uttering, are all the cliché sayings about that city. For a brief moment we might think it is Woody Allan speaking, almost. I'd like to think that Allen, in a first encounter with Wilson, for discussion about the movie, might have said 'I want you to be me', because anyone familiar with Woody Allen's work, can see that is what seems to be going on. Wilson sounds like Allen in any of his earlier work; the tone of voice, the rhythm with the sentences and even the way Wilson looks at or away from other actors with his phony smile and softly aloud sarcastic reflections. In some measure, other reviewers convey that same impression. So Wilson is excellent in his role.The writing is genuine Woody Allen; viewers who don't care much for his style and his take on life, are warned (by this and other reviews) that it is what you'll get. The story is a very simple fantasy of a writer Gil, played by Owen Wilson, engaged to wed Inez, played by Rachel McAdams; during a trip to Paris the couple's mismatch is revealed after only a few scenes and that's when the fantasy begins. Gil encounters a slew of artistic giants of earlier generations as he slips into a dream world at a specific unknown location in Paris at the stroke of Midnight. The imaginary journey will turn off some viewers; it sparked curiosity in some of us. There is an excellent cast of characters played by actors I liked, such as Kurt Fuller, Michael Sheen, Kathy Bates, Marion Cotillard etc.; Carla Bruni, for those who are up on current events and international who's who, will know she is in real life, the wife of Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of the French Republic, even has a supporting role (nice touch Woody). Gil discovers what he is meant to discover, breaks up with Inez and starts a new journey we can only assume will be a better one for him. The movie rates high among viewers and critics alike; I was a little surprised about that but in a good way. I still think one has to like Allen's stuff to enjoy his movies but in this case, I may gladly be wrong. I enjoyed it and wish you all the same pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a firm buff of Woody Allen's films and also unable to catch up with his prolific filmography, I skipped his last two features YOU WILL MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER (2010) and WHATEVER WORKS (2009) after a delightfully absorbing VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA (2008) MIDNIGHT IN Paris has been hyped to be a new pinnacle of Allen's late career (a career peak in the North American box-office too) since its release, maybe even nourish a slight chance for a BEST PICTURE Oscar nomination, which has been long overdue for any Woody's pictures since HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986), but after my viewing, I find it not so rosy on its Oscar path, I presume the sole possible chance is still Allen's strong suit, the screenplay and that will be all!I like the film by and large and I find the back-from-the-future plot is intriguing at first, then after the unorthodox Cinderella-esque midnight wander becomes the the inscrutable linchpin, the arrest deflates bit by bit while an intense concussion of bathos becomes presiding. Clearly the film is a love-letter (maybe a love-postcard) to Paris from Allen (strangely there is no French funds for the film, which is indeed a Spain-USA concoction), maybe I have no such approbation for Paris (a city doesn't tempt me for a must-see visit), so I feel neutrally immune to the cameos from those prominent artists of1920s (the only memorable presence is none other than Corey Stoll's chivalric Hemingway, who manages to exude a few wisdom from his sidelined character, his remark about a true hero's not-afraid-of-death-status is biased but contains Woody Allen's own sullen wit). Basically speaking, there is no single performance is outstanding like Woody's previous works (notable for its notorious hotbed for BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS nominations), but female characters' overpowering poise is always there, my personal penchant leans to Rachel McAdams' stereotypical mean woman caricature, repelling enough so as to that I adore her more, not the character but the acting per se. Marion Cotillard is being squandered drastically, but it will not hurt her charisma; other numerous secondary characters are all nothing but linear. The film proposes a contentious subject matter, a nostalgia addiction of the Golden Age, but in my opinion, why don't we just treasure art itself without encountering the artists (or asking yourself before make the move, "am I sure I can handle a true artist?), but if you are aiming for a sizable discount, it would be a different cup of tea then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MIDNIGHT IN Paris (Woody Allen, 2011) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This easily constitutes Allen's best work since MATCH POINT (2005), also signaling a welcome return to the historical/time-travel themes of ZELIG (1983) and THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO (1985) respectively. Though it appears that Allen is meeting an increasing dearth of actors to work with (his films are usually peppered with top talent), it is admirable how this essentially modest company still manages to sink its teeth into his typically verbose, neurotic and amazingly informed script! By the way, I was surprised to see a plethora of Spanish companies behind this film ? could it be that Allen is no longer a desirable commodity in his own country?! Anyway, here we get Hollywood hack screenwriter Owen Wilson setting his mind on penning The Great American Novel, with Paris (the mecca of the art world in an earlier age) supplying the ideal background to fire up his imagination. However, since he is accompanied by his predictably condescending fiancée' (a rather wasted Rachel McAdams) and her obviously conservative parents, he finds his creativity stifled ? especially after she runs into an old friend (Michael Sheen), whose know-it-all attitude irks Wilson no end. So, he goes away by himself on a midnight stroll, wishing he were back in the 1920s (mind you, I harbored a particular kinship with his predicament ? since I also believe that I was born too late and, consequently, feel out-of-touch with the current times!)?and, lo and behold, an old-fashioned car comes along and whisks him away to rub shoulders with the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter (whose songs are a constant on the soundtrack), Josephine Baker, Gertrude Stein (played by Kathy Bates), Alice B. Toklas, etc.! Here, he also meets and falls for a woman (Marion Cotillard, who typically walks off with the film) that is actually contended by both Picasso and Hemingway. Since he tries to fit in by presenting himself as an author, Hemingway tells him he will refer a draft of his novel to the matriarchal Stein but, as soon as he exits the bohemian establishment, the premises revert to their current state i.e. a laundry! Of course, McAdams does not believe a word he tells her, so she reluctantly agrees to accompany him the next night ? but she quits in contempt before the proverbial 'taxi' arrives, precisely at the stroke of midnight. This time around, Wilson is introduced to Salvador Dali (an impressive and hilarious Adrien Brody, forever re-routing a conversation towards a discussion of rhinoceroses!) and Luis Bunuel: his initial contribution is very understated, as if Allen did not quite know how to use him ? however, in a subsequent scene, we get an inspired moment in which Wilson sneakily suggests to the Surrealist master the germ of an idea that the latter would eventually develop into one of his greatest films, THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962)?but, naturally, he cannot quite grasp the absurd beauty of the situation presented to him so early into the game! While, at first, I was disappointed that Wilson does not walk in and out of the past at random (Allen opting for a Cinderella-type device), Cotillard herself pines for the so-called "Belle Epoque" i.e. the 1890s (even if her own era is known as "L'Age D'Or" ? as it happens, the ironic title of one of Bunuel's most scathing efforts!) and, magically, we go back to the dives haunted by such world-renowned painters as Toulouse-Lautrec, Gaugin and Degas! In the end, even if this is more of a nostalgia trip than a dense time/space meditation a' la the films of Alain Resnais (incidentally, Allen had once decried never having made a truly great film!), we are nevertheless treated to a few choice nuggets of pure mystery: Carla Bruni ? yes, Mrs. Sarkozy herself! ? translating Cotillard's memoirs to Wilson, clearly published long before but where he unaccountably gets mentioned!; and a private detective, appointed by McAdams' father to follow Wilson on his after-hours 'trysts', falling foul of the time-warp himself and turning up ? understandably befuddled ? in the Middle Ages! Even so, the elaborate structure still allows for character growth, since Wilson ultimately attains serenity within his own epoch and, having broken up with McAdams (who admits to an affair with the insufferable Sheen), hooks up romantically with a new partner (a girl he had, time and again, conversed with at a flea-market and with whom he shares a fondness for Cole Porter) in a downpour ? to him, Paris at its most expressive ? at the conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved it! If you like Paris and you like famous authors and artists from the late 1800s and early 1900s, you will love this movie. Paris is beautiful, the unbelievable plot is fluidly believable. Rachel McAdams nails her character and Owen Wilson is perfect. Every time he runs across another famous person, it's like magic - like actually being there in the flesh. However, I do know someone who saw this movie and thought it was boring, mainly because they had no idea who the historical characters were, which frankly would make this hard to understand.

		<fullReview>What? This film is not a goofball comedy with Owen Wilson's whiney voice? OK, the voice is naturally whiney; but, Wilson really is a very good fit for this part.Is there great acting here? Not really - at least not by the major current day characters; but, go back to the turn of the century characters and it's wonderfully acted. Probably a function of more robust writing for the older scenes and a bit of a plodding script for current day.All that negativism behind me, this is really quite an enjoyable film - an interesting premise for a story, generally well written, excellent direction and amazing sets. How could they not be amazing, you say, after all, it is Paris. But, how many of us have seen Paris, let alone at the turn of the century.All in all, Woody Allen has done it again. A warm, successful, somewhat twisted film that is a great way to spend a couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paris, Woody Allen, art and literature: a great movie!"That's what the present is. It's a little unsatisfying because life is unsatisfying" Woody Allen is terrific in developing a deep subject into a light and entertaining romantic comedy. The nostalgia for the past and the hope for a better life and happiness in eras of great excitement like the Roaring Twenties or La Belle Epoque is explored through the fantastic adventure of Gil, whose personality and mentality grows in this past world thanks to the help of his idols: Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Picasso,...Many of us have a favorite artist, painter or writer and we look at them as models. The wish of meeting them and experiencing their life, surrounded by many other famous artists is very common among us: who hasn't dream of living in another time period and being remembered as a great hero? Allen portrays this in a very realistic way, in a certain sense. Gil's experience is so unrealistic that becomes realistic in the movie.Midnight is a special hour, magical in many other films. The hour when nights and dreams approach. When the impossible becomes possible.The plot is original and amazingly set in a magical city like Paris; acting is great and the characters are perfect.I absolutely recommend this film! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't know some of the historic icons that deeply influenced art and literature of our decade like Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, Cole Porter, or Gertrude Stein. . . than it really doesn't matter. . . much. To be honest I have not heard of half the characters in the film, i'm not a literature junkie nor had i read any of their works in class, so it was a bit hard to follow Gil's state of astonishment when he met them. I do however love Woody Allen's films and this film is definitely worth seeing. I'm sure you've read the synopsis and the movie is so much more than that! I won't include spoilers, but a hint: after midnight is when the magic really starts happening. The film transports you to another time, specifically the 1920s in Paris, and it is amazing. I am dying to go to Paris after this movie because you really fall in love with the city. The film showcases the best parts of Paris with great acting from Owen Wilson, Marion Cotillard, and surprisingly Rachel McAdams. (I did not like McAdam's character in this movie but she did it nicely, a more annoying version of Regina from Mean Girls)The actors that played the Fitzgeralds were amazing, Alison Pill and Tom Hiddleston, though i don't know how they really acted but it was a good interpretation. After seeing the characters you really understand Gil's fascination to learn more from them and just hang out with them. This movie has been a great nostalgic learning experience and it's something that I highly recommend to every romantic out there. Cole Porter's " Let's do it, let's fall in love" is now my theme song. Midnight in Paris made me fall in love with old records, inspired me to read the Great Gatsby and I admire Woody Allen even more. It's a definite must watch of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight in ParisUntil now, the most mysterious aspect of midnight in Paris was that it was 3 pm in Los Angeles.Nevertheless, this comedy offers an alternative abnormality associated with the witching hour.When Gil (Owen Wilson), a scriptwriter from LA, vacations in Pairs with his fiancée (Rachel McAdams) and her parents, his longing for a bygone era is sated when he's transported to the 1920s, where his idols F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway edify him on the craft of writing, while Picasso's muse (Marion Cotillard) beguiles him with beauty.Meanwhile, his soon-to-be in-laws hire a private detective to follow Gil on his nightly constitutionals.Conceived by Woody Allan, Midnight in Paris is an amusing and unconventional love letter to The City of Light told by means of a neurotic time-traveller.But as a writer, shouldn't you be travelling forward in time to plagiarize successful work that hasn't been published yet?

		<fullReview>"Paris is most beautiful in the rain" those were the ending words. Paris has always been the land of dreams, beauty saved in its true essence. Walking down the streets, with those dim lights and hearing some old saxophone. This is a heaven on earth I guess. I have never been to Paris, but I believe that it would be so beautiful in its dim lights, and golden saved mentors. You know what we lack today, the originality of past, which we have covered it in modernism, technology and globalization but still the gold and 25year old scotch, with a nice Cuban cigar, sitting somewhere on ally and watching the river flowing. The "oceans of memories" as depicted in "titanic" was same. This old age has got lost somewhere under the sheaths of technology. This film has shown the Paris, to its marvel. The dark streets, the stony pavements, the yellow lamps at night and the above all, Paris in rain, this was so awesome. Apart from the story of the film, I got truly drawn into this era, the music so sweet, the cinematography so superb and the Paris. This really needs a lifetime to explain it.I wish I see Paris soon; I also have a very sweet and a very bitter memory with Paris. The sweet part is, that I wished to see it with my girl, and the bitter part is, she left me and she went there with her husband. I really have no more words to write more.Story wise this film was quite monotonous, this was a light centered film. I really enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming story set in a charming city</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to be a little familiar with the golden age of the "roaring 20's", to be able to appreciate this dream-like movie: when Paris was the centre of a brilliant and explosive cultural environment and people like Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds and many other artistic geniuses strolled around the city in search for inspiration as well as pleasure. For me, it was one of the most charming literary period of all times, that's why I couldn't but enjoy this lively picture, which gets to render the enjoyable and intellectually brilliant atmosphere of those times. Let's admit that the subject and the setting could be enough to make a movie appealing, but Allen reveals once again to be the best director when trying to capture the spirit of a city: in this case, the magic of the "ville lumi?re" really springs out from every day-and night framing, making the viewer feel like being there.There's always the Allen character, Gil, partially neurotic but poetic at the same time, but the characters I liked most are those magically related to that literary past, in particular, Corey Stoll as Hemingway, Marillon Cotillard as Picasso's lover, but above all an extraordinarily convincing Cathy Bates as Gertrude Stein. There's some wisdom in the dialogues, mainly focused on the perpetual human dissatisfaction for the present, and the longing for a more intense and vivid past, and so the contemporary Gil longs for the jazz age, the Jazz age longs for the Belle époque, which in turn longs for the Renaissance.... to the conclusion that the present is the only possibly vivid time, only if we have the courage to live it. As I have already noticed in Allen's latest movie, the director is getting old and seems to be looking for some final comfort, as if, once abandoned the caustic tone of the past, he has turned to a more relaxed and peaceful one. With "Midnight in Paris", the story, and the way it is handled seems to confirm my impression, and the result is a pleasant, enjoyable, lively comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A charming, sweet film, that explores the nature of nostalgia (its glow and its darker shadows), and shows off Paris, both modern day, and in the 1920s, almost as beautifully as Manhattan showed off New York. Laced with wonderful cameo and supporting performances (Adrien Brody, Kathy Bates, Marion Cotillard, Corey Stoll, just to name a few) and gifted by a quirky, lovably sad Owen Wilson as a sort of Eyeore of a struggling writer in the lead. Wilson is probably the best stand in yet for Allen in one of his films, precisely because he's so different from Allen, and doesn't seem to be doing an Allen impersonation. (Even Allen admitted that part of the appeal in casting Wilson was casting someone so far from himself).The 94 minutes of the film flew by, and never lost it's charm. A number of professional critics noted that this was a new tone for Allen, neither laugh out loud comedy, nor serious drama (or, as in his greatest films a combination of the two), but is more of a light drama, with a gentle comic whimsy. I actually think Allen started exploring this interesting new tone with his last film 'You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger' And it does seem to have reinvigorated him. I did have a couple of problems with the film. First, Rachel McAdams as Wilson's fiancé, along with her family, were made too caraciturish, too obviously 'bad' for a film this subtle. McAdams is a brilliant actress, but here she seems pushed into being a symbol of all that's wrong with shallow, materialistic Americans. More problematically, after gently, subtly exploring it's themes for the whole film, Allen suddenly starts laying them on very thick at the end, putting them very literally into the dialogue, almost as if he doesn't trust us to be smart enough to get the point of the whole lovely film he just showed us. But these are minor complaints, and while this may not be one of Allen's great films, it is a very good one, and that makes is special and worth seeking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris is for me, one the best films that Woody Allen has produced in a long time. The crux of the film encapsulates the need to find escape from unhappy situations and for our protagonist writer, the thought of a superficial existence in Hollywood, with wife to be...leads him to escape into a wonderful fantasy. Amazingly, the step from reality into fantasy is not to difficult after the first car ride. As it is easy to join in on the journey - as we meet the talented, the beautiful &amp; charismatic. The production values of this film are overwhelmingly wonderful. Allen's mark as a director seems to be very much on the American family, whilst it would seem the other actors have a freedom to improvise.One for the girlz..move over Heathcliff ..Hemingway is here..lordy ..lordy</fullReview>

Was it (surprisingly) the players that were singing in ESILY, this time he uses the real thing. All the artist pass by in a funny, yet respectful way. Even the mostly irritating Wilson is good as WA. Cotillard and McAdams are fine replacements for Lyonne and Portman.Michael Sheen and Adrian Brody deliver as usual. The photography is firm and relaxed. The end might be a bit superficial and predictable. But then again: This is Paris! And it's in the atmosphere of the movie. I'm looking forward to his next: Rome antic?!......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining and relaxing film about the splendors of Paris in the 1920s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a Woody Allen film, I entered this film with high expectations. The beautiful cinematic beginning set the tone for this movie, with about 3 minutes of beautiful music set to a back drop of the lovely Parisian streets. The start set the tone for the relaxing yet thoroughly engaging film, that enabled us to view he wonders of Paris, that artists were privy to in the 1920s. The casting of Owen Wilson as the main protagonist was wonderful, and he was able to redeem himself for atrocity that was Hall Pass. His relaxed and 'take it as it comes' demeanor set the tone for the movie, and the casting of Rachel McAdams, as the beautiful, yet extremely materialistic and self absorbed wife made Wilson's characters desire to move to Paris understandable.The introduction of the famous artists, that included Hemingway, Picasso, T.S Elliot, and Scott and Zelda Fitzpatrick was remarkably done. It was obvious that, Allen respected the audiences literary knowledge, by not introducing the background to the characters, but instead, slowing including their subtle nuances, which provided many laughs, especially that Picasso's erratic nature.Marion Cottilard was once again brilliant, as the beautiful and enticing mistress of Picasso. The on screen chemistry between Wilson and Cottilard was a redeeming quality throughout.The only negative thing I could say about this movie, is that it seemed to finish with too many stories unanswered. The movie thoroughly deserves its 8.0 rating as it is beautiful directed and written.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Midnight in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to confess I've only picked up on Woody Allen's work faithfully from Match Point onwards, just about the time he was getting out of his New York comfort zone and putting his stories into his European sojourn, except that distributors here didn't quite buy into meeting a tall dark stranger. But no fret since Midnight in Paris captures everything superficially wonderful about the city of lights, in an opening montage that brings us to almost every piece of tourist attraction on offer, before deep diving into one of the best Woody Allen offerings in recent years.It's a romantic comedy of sorts, the kind that Allen excels in creating, and we join the couple Inez (Rachel McAdams) and Gil played by Owen Wilson, the latter whose writer character would have been played by Wooden Allen himself being Woody Allen in a film once upon a time, talky and full of wit. In Paris on the graces of Inez's parents John (Kurt Fuller) and Helen (Mimi Kennedy), what would have been an awesome period of time spent in the romantic city was quickly ruined by the arrival of Inez's friends Paul (Michael Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda), especially since it's so obvious that Inez holds a candle to Paul's intellect, at the expense of almost always putting down Gil, who feels threatened by the presence of another man in her life, one who seem to be able to capture the imagination and attention of his girlfriend.Departing from the group who decided to go dancing, Gil's drunken trek around the streets of Paris at night inexplicably led him to the 20s, where he encounters many literary and artistic greats, such as F Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and Zelda Fitzgerald (Alison Pill), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll) and in multiple midnight strolls waiting for that antiqued car to come pick him up, other personalities which give rise to plenty of casting cameos, such as Josephine Baker (Sonia Rolland), Juan Belmonte (Daniel Lundh), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) whom he had read his draft manuscript for his next novel, Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody), Pablo Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo) and his muse of the moment, the lovely Adriana (Marion Cotillard), with whom Gil forms a strong bond with, and in a way puts him off course from his own girlfriend.It's quite clear that this is a tale about chances, and of people who don't know they are currently unhappy with their love lives, and are seeking an outlet of some sorts for emotional release. It's about people who subconsciously can't stand their present and want to escape from it, and what more than to enter a period of nostalgia, and fantasize about being one amongst our idols and heroes. In this case, cracks between Gil and Inez are quite pronounced, with the mounting tension and suspicion brought on by the presence of Paul, especially when comparisons begin and the crystal clarity in their differences in temperament and character, which if not for Gil's success in his career raking both fame and fortune, would have been doomed from the start, if it ever took off in the first place. Gil enters this zone of bliss to be amongst those he aspires to be one day. And with Adriana, a romantic rendezvous each night proves to be quite a pull factor.Owen Wilson becomes almost like a Woody Allen avatar in the way his mannerisms in the film pick up from the usual characters that Allen plays, while yet possessing enough of the Wilson persona's cheekiness, especially in the final third of the film where he discovers Adriana's journal in the present day, and looked for clues as to how a potential relationship between him and her could have developed. Marion Cottilard of course scores as the damsel who's tired of the kind of treatment from men like Picasso and even Hemingway, and like Paul, epitomizes that similar down and out feeling that creates similar zones into which to escape to, bringing together some fantastic, science fiction like moments in this story that will thrill any writer or avid reader when the ensemble cast take on roles of famous people from the past.Allen's truly back to form here with a story that's brilliantly written, with fine dialogue and structure, and bringing out the best of mimicry from his cast of many, starting from having Owen Wilson talk and walk very much like his persona, if not himself, being the central mouthpiece in this film. And look out for Carla Bruni too in quite a major supporting role as the Museum Guide to whom Gil goes to for a little help with some French translation. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>satisfying romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To fully enjoy "Midnight in Paris" it helps to have some knowledge of the world of arts and letters as it unfolded in Paris during the years between the first and second World Wars. Without such knowledge, the steady stream of verbal references and incarnations of past celebrities may wear you out. Writer-director Woody Allen develops comic momentum by transporting a young writer (Owen Wilson) back in time where he encounters one famous Golden Age figure after another, starting with F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda, then Cole and Linda Porter, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Luis Bunuel, Salvador Dali and others. Sometimes the portrayals hit the bull's eye and at other times fly off to nowhere. For one reason or another Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody, both capable performers, bring nothing fresh or compelling to Stein and Dali, respectively. Michael Sheen is, as usual, outstanding as an egotistical intellectual in the 2010 segments, delivering his lines with an impeccable American accent. It's filled with Allen's wisdom, insight and irony, and of course cascades of conversation, most of it scintillatingly observant, funny, surprising and lively. He has a way of scoring a witticism and then undercutting it before it has a chance to sit there and draw attention to its impressiveness. His insistent puncturing of pretense and falsehood is intact. Allen has set many movies in the past ("The Purple Rose of Cairo," "Zelig," "A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy" to name a few) but here he takes the time travel one step further by going back even further into the past while already there, exploring the human longing for the golden age that never really was. And throughout we are presented with numberless views of Paris at all times of the day and night, rain and shine, all tied up with a beautiful romantic ribbon at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>C'est magnifique!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's best movie in years, happily reminiscent of PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, the most endearing of his collaborations with Mia Farrow. Owen Wilson, standing-in for Allen himself, is klutzy without being self-pitying. Marion Cotillard is totally ravishing as Picasso's latest squeeze - as Wilson observes, she gives a whole new meaning to "art groupie".Kathy Bates was probably chosen to play Gertrude Stein because of her, ahem, physique but she dives into the role with relish. Corey Stoll's Hemingway not only looks a lot like old (or rather, young) Ernie but he is given the movie's best lines: he talks like he writes, short sentences with a lot of "ands" and frequent references to guns, booze, lions and women. Cole Porter mostly sings. Zelda Fitzgerald mostly drinks while Scott frets. There are some good gags at the expense of Michael Sheen's annoying know-it-all art expert in the modern storyline when Wilson comes back with stories from the artists and models themselves. Wilson's airhead fiancée and his future in-laws-from-hell stop just short of caricature in a movie that relies for its existence on finding the balancing spot between parody and affectionate tribute.The transitions from Today to (more than one) Yesterday are achieved without any resort to special effects, the Paris locations and sets are simply "magnifique", the music (lots of accordion) is almost too good. The mood is kept light and the whole film teeters on the brink of being lightweight without ever becoming crass.This would be a great comedy in any era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting exploration of the "Golden Age fallacy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ideas in this movie represent true intellectualism and shows at least a deeper and genuine intellectual understanding by its writer Woody Allen. The film explores the subtle nuances of what Allen calls the "Golden Age fallacy", the fallacy in thinking that living in a past time is somehow better or more romantic than the present one.The movie is highly detailed and overflowing with sharp commentary and insights into many different ideas. Painting, literature, philosophy, "pseudo-intellectualism", pedantry, and many other areas are some of the ideas covered by this movie.The movie is set in Paris and the scenes are filled with richness and overflowing with beauty. The actors portraying different historical artists are a real treat to watch and the overall sophistication of the dialogue and acting when the lead character is transported to the past is truly charming.When the film switches back to the current age, it becomes a tad repulsive, which is probably something Allen intended in order to contrast with the romantic nature of the scenes set in the past. If there is one issue I have with it is that Rachel Mcadams character is a little too extremely obnoxious, to the point where the viewer becomes annoyed with the movie. But this again is probably something Allen intended.Midnight In Paris is a richly detailed, truly intellectual, and beautiful romantic film that is definitely worth the time to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the French Surrealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Human being has a nature that he can't satisfy himself at any condition. When a man think that there's something missing in his world than there's always an unexpected event waiting down for him to change his course of life. MIDNIGHT IN Paris is a simple story of a man named Gil(Owen Wilson) who thought that his Hollywood world is not that quiet exciting and not fulfilling his writer skills as he wanted to write novels. Than he gets the chance to go to Paris with his beautiful girlfriend(Rachel McAdams) and her family for a business trip. He always knew that Paris is the land of LOVE and ART but he felt that when he encountered that place. Beautiful views of streets, rivers, lamps, landmarks etc makes protagonist fall in love with Paris. He decides to stay here forever but not everyone feel good about that. His great love for Paris leads him to some beautiful illusions which in the end makes him realize that this is what he was missing in his life i.e. ART and LOVE.Allen's cinematographers never compromised to show how beautiful Paris is, every single view into the screen is in detailed form and showed with spectacular camera work. Especially the ending scene when Eiffel Tower was lightning beautifully. Whole screenplay is one the best part of the movie. Exciting Story-line helps to meet some of the beautiful characters who keeps us engaged till the end. Dialogues are good and written very well keeping a view of French-France in mind.As expected, all the performers are superb. From leading actor Wilson to supporting actor Adrien Brody all are superb. Special remarks for Marion Cotillard, she is looking so beautiful and stealing every second she is on the screen.First movie of the year which i felt is Technically natural. Filmed in old fashioned style which is refreshingly cool. U have never seen Paris that beautiful in any past Hollywood films. Movie takes place in my year's top 5. With Wonderful direction of the great Woody Allen and comical-adventurous journey of Paris this movie deserves 10/10. Must watch for those who respect and love ART.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>let us go then, you and I, when the evening is spread out against the sky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gil is a jaded screenwriter, materially successful but longing to write "real" literature. He finds himself in Paris because his fiancé Inez is the daughter of a Republican philistine businessman and he happens to be in the town on an M&amp;A venture. When Inez's insufferable friend from college shows up, Gil takes to wandering the streets alone at night. And then magic happens.Gil takes his novel to the luminaries of the Lost Generation and his life is affirmed. "Prufock is my mantra" he declares at one point, and indeed the ennui of Elliot's poem is the barrier he must overcome if he is to break free and live a fulfilling life. Gerturde Stein advises him not to give into despair but to write in a way that provides an antidote to it. That is to be Gil's journey.Literature graduates will get the most fun from all the in-jokes. My favourite was Gil explaining to Man Ray, Dali and Bunuel that he has somehow time-slipped into their era. They see this as a matter of course, but he tells them "That's because you're Surrealists." Gil has been brought there because of a nagging dissatisfaction with the circumstances of his own present. His bride-to-be is sexy but shallow. His career is to serve up consumerist entertainment. The Jazz Age offers so much more, including a romantic alternative. But then those living in the 1920s seem to hanker for a Golden Age of their own...Owen Wilson as Gil is so much the Woody Allen character that his performance borders on impersonation. It works in a good way. The jokes come regularly, the film is modest in its intentions and honest about them. Quite simply, it is charming. This is the film the term "a gem" was invented for.The fun continues when you get home and look up all the in-jokes and characters you weren't too sure about (the audience I saw it with didn't see too clued up on The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock - the pun on that poem's most famous line was met with silence). It is Allen at his whimsical best, and that is always worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that I felt a bit out of my element. I don't know much about European authors/painters/etc! There were a lot of names I didn't recognize. But it made me want to learn about who they were. My partner(from UK) on the other hand wasn't familiar with Fitzgerald so that made me feel a bit better. I loved the cinematography! Paris is such a beautiful city and I feel much like Gil, I could live there &amp; walk in the rain! It was very funny. Very entertaining. My family all loved it ages 16-60! I almost expected to walk out of the theater into the 1920's! :) The theater we saw it in was VERY small. The smallest movie theater I have ever been in, yet it was sold out &amp; absolutely packed.

		<fullReview>Who wouldn't love Paris! Who doesn't love fantasy! And if you are in love with both of them, Midnight in Paris would be the fantasy you would hate to come out of. And i too felt the same, I never wanted to come out of the dream I was in, i was sedated with sensuousness walking along with Owen Wilson through the streets of Paris, meeting eminent artists whom i always loved to meet, and finally getting someone whom i could walk in the rain with, talking about everything which I love about.Woody Allen was never my favorite until i saw "Midnight in Paris". Owen Wilson was cute - I really would like to see more of him in meaty roles like this rather than in silly romcoms, Marion Cotillard was sweet &amp; gorgeous. The casting was too good, that it would be hard to find anyone misplaced. The music and background score did make the movie experience merrier.

		<shortDescription>It Blew Me Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most certainly, "Midnight in Paris" DID blow me away because Woody Allen's a proved genius; Owen Wilson is far better than the kook seen in his other films; the melodies "Si tu vois ma m?re" and "Bistro Fada" were haunting and the entire story line was so unique and mesmerizing, I'll see it again next week. Even though we are close to four months away from Jan.1st, this mid-summer release will win for Mr. Allen either or both the Best Director of the Year and Best Original Screen Play Not Based on a Book. Are you a nostalgiaphile as I am? If so, you'll go ape over this movie--totally bonkers by the way Mr. Allen weaved the past into the present and it happens so unexpectedly, the viewer is taken by storm and held until the end. Its the best picture I've seen thus far in '11 and say it's one of the best, if not the best film Allen's ever done. And let's not forget about "Match Point" either. The film is a pleasantly eerie fantasy adventure into a new-old dimension that's whimsical and far better than clever. An absolute DON'T MISS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Pleasant Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always want to like Woody Allen's films. Unfortunately, a lot of time, I'm disappointed. If I trace back the roots of this disappointment, I find that it is tied to the vague endings that seem to recall the attempts at being 'artistic' that characterized films of the 1970s. Woody Allen became enamored with this approach in his 1979 film, Manhattan. Okay, I admit, life sometimes gives us vague endings, but if you're going to tell a story, then give us the ending to it. It's like having a joke without a punchline, and remember, Woody Allen got his start as a stand-up comedian. Say what you will about Woody Allen, but he is a good story teller.And this is a good story. Yes, of course, you can delve into the problems of time travel, but that's not the point. Why waste your time? True, the characters may have been caricatures, but that's half the fun of it. Because when Woody Allen is at his best, his movies combine humor and truth. The relationships may seem exaggerated at times, but I challenge anyone to find that they don't contain an uncomfortable grain of this truth.Owen Wilson does a credible job and I suspect he could handle more challenging roles than he is usually given. In fact, I had no problem finding any of the characters believable. All in all, it was a very satisfying film to watch.</fullReview>

The movie was lovely! Owen Wilson was excellent in his role as a successful writer struggling to change, and being too passive- or spineless- to do what he needed to do. The family characters are a little one dimensional, but the heart of the movie isn't about them, but rather the amazing place he finds on his walks at midnight. I was totally caught up in the fiction, and the atmosphere was perfect.Still hate Allen, but the movie was amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid enchanting drama that will entertain and make you smile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a movie connoisseur and you want to read the review about camera angles and the brilliance of Woody Allen this won't be the review for you. I have seen two...maybe three Woody Allen films and I have enjoyed them but I have yet to become an Allen fan so to speak. Midnight In Paris is a unique and interesting film that blends dark humour, drama, romance with...time travel...yah no kidding! The film, as far as I am concerned has only one glaring flaw and I'll get to that in a few moments. I went into the film not really knowing what to expect given I had only seen a trailer or two which doesn't show much. I think I felt a connection to the main character, although I'm not a professional writer, I understood some of his eccentricities about writing and inspiration so I think perhaps Allen might have worked some of his own personality into the character. The setting of Paris is of course beautiful and instead of just focusing on the typical Paris you get to see more of the back streets and of course the nightlife. The story moves at a brisk pace, especially for a dramedy never leaving you bored or wondering when things will pick up.I mentioned before that the film had one glaring error and that error is the lead, Owen Wilson. I don't dislike Wilson, he's had some good movies always playing the weird quirky stammering male lead but in this film he just does not fit. He just isn't believable when he's trying to be serious. His stammering and weird talking just botches up the feel of the film. He drags it down when the film could have been a nine or even a ten if a strong male lead had been chosen. The always lovely Rachel McAdams plays the headstrong and perhaps overbearing rich girl that Wilson is engaged to. She becomes more oppressive to Wilson throughout the course of the film. McAdams always has a lot of screen presence but her character is very unlikable by the end of it which is unfortunate. The chemistry between her and Wilson is nearing a joke which helps with their inevitable break up. Amazing character actors Kurt Fuller, and Mimi Kennedy are McAdams' parents and although they don't get a lot of screen time, they are truly terrific. This film lives and breathes the supporting cast. Tom Hiddleston, Corey Stoll, Alison Pill (brilliant! in her role), and of course the incomparable Kathy Bates are part of the stand out supporting characters you should watch for. They just make this film great! There is no doubt Woody Allen knows quirky better than anyone else but I sat in the theatre when it was over and thought...wow he just made a quirky dramedy with a touch of the supernatural and made time travel artsy and isn't that impressive? I thought the ending of the film was a little cut and dry and perhaps a little predictable but it definitely tied up all the loose ends. There is zero doubt in Allen's ability to write interesting characters and draw you into the story. I think the only downfall is that you find yourself wanting to know more, and see more from characters who are only secondary. Anyone wanting a solid drama, something light and breezy but fun to watch and unique you will love Midnight In Paris. As I said before I have only seen a couple of Allen's films but so far I can see why he has had a career spanning decades and is known for his style. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant way of getting connected to the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gil is a writer fascinated by the life style of the intellectuals and artists during the twenties in Paris. During his stay in Paris, with his fiancée and her parents, he seeks for inspiration and try to connect to the spirit of those years. During the nights, instead of going out with his bride, her parents and friends, who don't present any interest to him, he prefers to walk through the streets of Paris. During these walks, he connects to the things which fascinate him. This is the point I want to stress: the way that Woody Allen found to show this connection is brilliant. More precisely, Gil takes a ride with people of the twenties, in a car of the twenties which passes on the street where he is. This ride takes him to the places where important people get together: parties, reunions etc. In these events, he meets Cole Porter, who plays and sings, he talks to the couple Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso, Luis Bunel, Salvador Dali and so on. The interaction with these characters from the twenties helps him find himself. At the end of the film, he annul his engagement with his rich and boring fiancée from his rich bride and boring and decides to stay in Paris, in the company of a girl from Paris, that has the simple style that inspires him.</fullReview>

Aside from a great two hour virtual tour of some of the best the City of Light has to offer, I felt it lacked the charm of Amelie or the memorability of some Allen's other films such as Annie Hall or Play It Again Sam. Midnight In Paris is a light and breezy pop song alongside the repertoire of what Allen's capable of at his best. I enjoyed how the film asked the question, are we ever truly happy?

		<fullReview>I have never been a fan of Woody Allen or his films, BUT Midnight in Paris was so amazing!! Paris is wonderful, the characters are wonderful, the lessons learned are wonderful probably because of their simplicity, and their in your face common sense. The 1920's in Paris was a highlight of that city's history, although Allen presents history in the most delightful way possible. The only point I found jarring was seeing French women wearing blue jeans in public. That was a new one for me, as all the French women I have ever seen, even the ones working in small shops, dress. The blue jeans had to have been some sort of attempt to make the film palatable to Americans. I am going to go see the film a 2nd time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Coach Is Just a Pumpkin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Midnight in Paris" is a time travel fantasy with a taxi as the means of conveyance, like H.G. Wells' time machine or the pumpkin carriage that transports Cinderella to the ball. Gil (Owen Wilson) travels back to 1920's "Lost Generation" Paris where he hobnobs with his arts and letters heroes, and even to "la belle époque" of the 1890's. Me, I'd like to visit the '40's and '50's. There's a few famous folks I'd like to meet. I should have liked "Midnight in Paris", but it, mostly, left me cold, and I wasn't charmed by its many quaint artifices. People I've spoken to who have seen this movie are quite tickled by its whimsical premise. It's a pretty, dreamy soufflé that, unfortunately, sinks and congeals very quickly. I, myself, was quite eager to follow our wide-eyed hero as he tumbled down the rabbit-hole, bumping into the celebrities of the day, the likes of Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Bunuel, Baker, Porter, Picasso, Dali, Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and on and on and on. There were so many celebs that I'm surprised that Woody Allen didn't simply roll out a red carpet.And what a dull, boring, inane lot they all are! They're not characters, or even caricatures ? they're cardboard cut-outs (or cut-ups), and Allen hasn't penned a memorable line of dialogue for any of them. In fact, the screenplay is devoid of any wit, and the characters (all of them) lack any flesh or blood, depth or weight. Shouldn't great artists be just a little bit dangerous, if not in their behaviour, at least in their ideas? In one pointless scene Gil and Adriana (Marion Cotillard, easily the best thing in the film) encounter a suicidal Zelda Fitzgerald by the Seine. Just so that Gil can draw upon historical knowledge and convince her that F. Scott really loves her ("I know. Take my word for it") and offer her a Valium. Suicide? Just a gag.Why must Woody Allen write protagonists who are merely variations of the Woody Allen screen persona? This often bothered me with Owen Wilson's Gil, who I didn't, for a moment, believe was a successful Hollywood screenwriter, hack or no hack. And as for his relationship with the shrew played by Rachel McAdams ? that strained credibility even further. By the way ? I just have to ask ? wouldn't Gil do re-writes on a computer, and what font do you suppose he used in the original manuscript he presents to Gertrude Stein? Just a thought. "Midnight in Paris" is a one-note wonder with a script that is lazy and shallow. It's practically an insult to the great men and women of arts and letters who litter its scenes. Around the time that I saw "Midnight in Paris" I also caught Richard Linklater's dreamy, but alive, "Before Sunrise". Now, there's magic for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely mind-blowing!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having a discussion with a friend about how we both wish we were brought up in the 20's she suggested that I take a look at this film. Being a 16 year old boy, any excuse to watch a film was leaped upon. In doing so, I revealed to myself one of the most amazing and breath-taking pieces of art I have ever witnessed. This film for me defines everything I have ever wished for in life and everything I have ever questioned or been curious about. It's horrendously predictable at times, but in a way that makes you gasp in amazement, as oppose to writing it off for being awful. I honestly think that without this film, my thoughts and boundaries if you will would be so much more limited and engulfed in what I believe is available to me, as this shows you that there is so much more to life, that we will never be able to reach, and we should accept that this is how we are living and must make the best of it, as in the future many people will wish they were us. For that, I thank the director, for creating something truly spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Woody Allen Setup</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If nebbish nerdy males and female partners who are shallow, self-absorbed, and clueless strike your fancy, you obviously enjoy films by Woody Allen. This is so much in the recycled Allen genre that it does not warrant anything other than a nod to great Paris locations and period costumes. Always a fan of period jazz, this film does not disappoint either, but Cole Porter was done a few years ago with Kevin Klein, so "Let's Fall In Love" doesn't have the unexpected flashback. Even the introduction of La Belle Epoque, Maxim's and the Moulin Rouge with Lautrec, Gaugin and Degas, to Piccaso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Dali, Man Ray, and Gertrude Stein is nostalgia light. Allen's retro-vision of the past is still too convenient, too clean, too "golden" to hold attention, or even want to invest a second viewing.Performances of Kathy Bates as third-eye Gertrude Stein and Marion Cotillard are marvelous, but this is more a walking man's tour of the Paris cityscape than a story which hold the interest to the end, and is ultimately formulaic and predictable. Equitable in irritation are the performances of Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams as the mismatched couple whose relationship is brought asunder by the city of romance and lights. Sorry Woody lovers but other films are more intriguing at this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen's ultimate masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really didn't expect that 80 years old Woody after 40+ movies would be able to produce something like this, but he did. Without any question - Midnight In Paris IS the best piece of his entire catalog (and yes I've seen them all). I never even liked Woody's movies that much since they were mostly the same funny/relationship clones (with a few beautiful exceptions like Cassandra's Dream), but with this one he topped himself, everything went right - smart and funny story, beautiful Paris locations, great music, precise actors and magic concept. If you are an artist, or at least you love art and you're a romantic soul you're gonna LOVE this. I'm not surprised by all the awards and by the fact that this became by far his commercially most successful film because it's all so alluring, you can watch this over and over without getting bored. Some of the scenes like the first meeting with Hemmingway, or the dialog with surreal guys are absolutely priceless. Bravo Woody, as Gertrude Stein would say in this movie - If you're gonna keep on making films like this, you will have something of value! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mediocre Trip to the City of Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose if I had seen "Midnight in Paris" back when it first came out, before the awards hype and hyperbolic praise started proclaiming it one of the best movies of the year, I would have thought it was a perfectly fine if unmemorable Woody Allen movie, certainly better than many of his most recent efforts but not nearly as good as some others. But expectations were high after it started appearing on 10-best lists and winning awards, and so instead of enjoying the film for its modest charms, I was left wondering what on earth people saw in this that warrants its rapturous response.I long ago accepted that Woody Allen is going to traffic in tired clichés for the rest of his career. But an artist falling in love with the charms of Paris has to be one of the most tired. There is some fun to be had in waiting to see what famous names Owen Wilson's author character is going to come across next, and I have to imagine that what critics are responding to is the idea of one artist being able to interact directly with those long-dead artists who serve as their muses. So some scenes with characters like Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, the Fitzgeralds, etc. offer some pleasant whimsy. But the real-life part of the screenplay, detailing Wilson's excruciatingly slow realization that he and his horrible fiancée (written as a completely unbelievable caricature and played as a simply despicable human being by Rachel MacAdams) are not meant for one another, takes up far too much time. Not only is this part of the movie tedious, it's badly written, one criticism I usually can't level at Allen's screenplays.Sure, Paris looks lovely, but it surely says something about the movie that the thing I most remember about it is the performance of Alison Pill, a scene stealer as Zelda Fitzgerald but who has exactly three minutes of screen time.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fell asleep half way through. No elegant review or justification. It just sucked. Owen Wilson is a terrible choice as the protagonist. He weasels (yes, Pauly Shore or Spicoli) his way through the film like a surfer high on weed. He adds no debt to the film. If he would be quiet for a while, I might just like it. His incessant talking is annoying and distracting. His character's introversion is another very annoying factor in this film. Why people are fawning over it is just another example of padding the imperfect. Sometimes I think the studio is pumping up films. Jennifer Anniston being named as the sexiest lady for 2011 comes to mind, especially after she just jumped the shark (ie stole somebody else's man.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris Review: "Actually, Paris is the most beautiful in the rain."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ahhh Mr Woody Allen, you either hate his work or love his work. I wouldn't necessarily call myself a big Woody Allen fan but I've seen a lot of his films (2000 and up) and I either really enjoy them or find them a complete waste of time (usually cause of the way it ends), there's hardly ever a middle ground. Match Point?loved it, Scoop?hated it, Cassandra's Dream?hated it, Vicky Cristina Barcelona?loved it...Midnight in Paris?loved it.Midnight in Paris comes stacked with a very impressive cast. I'm surprised with the choice of Owen Wilson as the lead protagonist especially with Allen's recent history of casting, how we say, more alpha male, less goofy type male leads in the likes of Ewan McGregor, Colin Farrel, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Hugh Jackman...you get the picture, Owen Wilson simply doesn't really fit that list. Having said that, I felt Owen Wilson's soft hearted, goofy boyish charm worked really well for the character of Gil. Rest of the cast includes Rachel McAdams, Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy, Michael Sheen, Alison Pill, Tom Hiddleston, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, Léa Seydoux and my very personal favorite, the very beautiful and talented Marion Cotillard. Cotillard plays Adriana, a beautiful women that catches the eye of Gil (as well as many others).The story is quite simple, Gil (Owen Wilson, Hall Pass) and his fiancé, Inez (Rachel McAdams, The Notebook) and her parents are visiting Paris for business. Gil, a writer who feels a little bit uninspired as of late, feels like he needs to live in Paris for a little while to suck in the artsy and romantic culture to become inspired so he can finish his novel but Inez doesn't share the same perspective. I don't want to reveal anymore to the story because I went into this movie reading only the brief synopsis listed on IMDb which basically reveals nothing and I was pleasantly surprised. I will say this though, it was a interesting, different and very simple approach that Woody Allen used to execute his concept for this story and I thought it worked very well and in a very suitable Woody Allen fashion.The only hint I would give is the film involves a lot of discussions involving historical characters such as Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Pablo Picasso, to name a few. Is it important that you know your history for this film? It'll probably be a bonus but it wont distract you from the main story and the message that Woody Allen is trying to convey. At the heart of Midnight in Paris is of course, like all Woody Allen films, a romantic love story but its also about people living in the past, people who find the present boring and unfulfilling, people who crave nostalgia and blame the emptiness of the present simply because they are afraid to face the future. Something I feel that we can all relate to, at least once in our life.Overall I really enjoyed my viewing experience with this film. Paris was perfectly chosen to capture the art, culture and romance to tell this story. The variety of very talented actors and characters kept things very interesting and made me want to learn more and more about each character. I loved the presence that Marion Cotillard's character, Adriana brought to the screen. Her outgoing, contagious charm and flirtatiousness was the total opposite of Inez and it created quite a bi-polar dynamic when you see each of the characters interact with the lead character, giving us a chance to see how Gil reacts to two very different love interests. I'm surprised I'm saying this, but I really enjoyed the chemistry between Gil and Adriana, if you were just to tell me to compare the two actors, I would've never believed it but just goes to show how well the writing was done (I'd love to see another Woody Allen film with Marion Cotillard as the lead but I digress). The dialogue in all their late night walking scenes were really well written and well shot. Midnight in Paris is a solid movie, full of diverse characters, with an interesting concept executed in a simple but enjoyable way that oozes Woody Allen?suffice to say, if you are a fan of the director's work, you will enjoy this film.You can read the full review along with other movie reviews at: http://goo.gl/8KgJN or www.theTVSamurai.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For anyone who has romance in his/ her soul then you want to see this film. The casting is very good and Owen Wilson makes for a very engaging lead character. The scenes after Midnight are a delight and there are stand-out performances, particularly Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali. Paris is made to look like a place you would long to be in, ignoring the horrendous traffic. There are some great one-liners and casual asides - watch out for the riff on Matisse. It is always said that if a film seems to pass quickly, its a hallmark of a good, engrossing film. This one seemed to last for an instant and yet lasted in the memory for hours. Woody has rediscovered his mojo in Paris and the after Midnight club is the best place to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Second Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember leaving the theater the night I saw Annie Hall. In that movie, everything had come together. To me, Woody Allen had done something akin to Bob Beamon's long jump at the Mexico City Summer Olympics: a leap so much further than anyone had ever jumped before that the technique could not be comprehended; the act could only astonish. I gave up hoping Allen would make another movie as good as Annie Hall about 10 years later. That's when he started his homages to other film makers. It got worse. He started his existential preaching phase. To be fair, there were some good movies he would film periodically (e.g. Bullets Over Broadway; Manhattan Murder Mystery; Small Time Crooks). But I'd lost hope he would ever deliver on his talent. But he did. For me, this is a second masterpiece. Midnight in Paris is a comedy, a fantasy, and a love story. A clever plot device allows Owen Wilson's restless Hollywood screenwriter to be transported to the "Lost Generation" of the '20s and later to La Belle Epoche of the 1890s from what he considers the pedestrian "present." The movie includes a Parisian "girl" from the present that Owen Wilson meets that every man in the audience will fall in love with. The performances are uniformly excellent. Special credit to Adrien Brody. I've rated this 9 of 10. But under my "system," no movie can be rated "10" until at least 10 years have passed since my first viewing. (Chinatown rose to "10" only 3 ears ago.) So In 10 years, I will revisit my rating here - I expect leaning very favorably to an upgrade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen on top form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen just gets better. He really seems to have come into his own as a director during his European odyssey. A year ago we were all thrilled by Vicky Christina Barcelona which also got Penelope Cruz a deserved Oscar nod. He is certainly a better director than he is an actor. As an actor he brings a little too much of his hyper self- examination which can become tedious. Midnight in Paris is sweet and lively. It is full of pretentious characters but is an unpretentious film. The message is simple and delivered with consistent light humour. &nbsp; Owen Wilson fits in perfectly, just as he does in Wes Anderson material. &nbsp;Marion Cotillard is suitably beautiful and enigmatic. The rich Americans are pitch-perfect characters. Particularly fun is the agonising cultured intellectual who you just want to throttle, particularly when opining on wine, Monet and Versailles. There is also a great little semi- cameo turn from Carla Bruni. Allen doesn't try to be clever about Paris. All the clichés are there - the sights, the cafés and the romance but the French characters are cast in a favourable light. You really get the sense that he likes the French, even if he doesn't quite understand them.&nbsp;The basic premise of Midnight in Paris will make some wince. The way the starlets of the 20s are forced into the narrative is not all that natural and perhaps contrived. But for me it works and it is a necessary part of the concept. It does rely on the viewer knowing these characters from the 20s and 'getting' the joke about who they are portrayed.I think Woody Allen is one of the great auteurs. He doesn't create grand masterpieces but he does have an absolutely unique and consistent voice. The world would be a poorer place without him. for me the only other directors who are so instantly recognisable for their style are Almodóvar, Bergman and Spike Lee. Thirty seconds into a blind viewing and you can name the director. Roll-on more of the "Woody Allen does Europe" era!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe because it is one of the most recent narrative creating devices, cinema is probably the most powerful we've ever invented. Certainly the one that still flashes in people's minds more easily these days. We know storytelling is probably as old as language, and language in our very peculiar human sense is as old as Humans themselves. Some filmmakers, out of the blue, constantly remind us how still little explored are the narrative power of cinema as a medium. Méli?s, Welles, Kurosawa, Hitchcock, Kar Wai, Park, Tarkovsky and a handful of others, each gave us invaluable break-throughs, new ways to tell things, new forms to feel. But few have questions the limits of narrative as the structured soul of a film as Woody. Many accuse him of repeating himself. Always the same pseudo-intellectual characters, babbling empty people with trifle lives, nothing serious to say or do. Broken marriages, adultery, and so on. That's all true because those are the superficial elements on which Woody builds most of his films. But in everyone of them, he tries something he hasn't tried before, sometimes repeating some other filmmakers experiences, other times trying stuff no one has ever tried before. He misses some chances, he hits a few more, but i know he always tries. And for that reason i'll always want to see his films, made or to be made. Here he makes something that superficially resembles his celebrated Purple Rose of Cairo. But this is quite a different breed. What he tries is a highly complex experience in parallel inter-related worlds. Parallel realities where where (or when!) what happens in one, affects the other. The film begins in a recognizable present, establishes itself on other fantasy level, and finds its resolution in yet another deeper layer. Each layer is nested on the previous one, all of them rooted in Paris, and its clichés for each moment. Same space, same character, different dynamics of it. A solid triangular structure, where the same typical Allen elements find a new place to breath. In the way we find Marion Cotillard, whom we have seen in Inception, a similarly structured film about finding realities buried deep in the previous level, there mapped into dreams, and who knows, maybe here this is all mapped into the dreams of Owen's character. Inception also rooted the whole thing in Paris, one of the most filmed places ever, and one of those whose clichés are more built by films. And there also, Marion was the invented subconscious lover, who's very existence as a character was questionable.By now, its a perfectly assumed and natural thing that every film is in one way or another a blink of eye to the audiences via the reference to other films or to cinema in general. The french new wavers introduced that in film vocabulary as a common practice, so natural that you almost can't live without it today. Woody starts here with a character who Is a film writer trying to move into literature fiction. He goes to Paris, he gives us an initial montage of Paris and its recognizable places, less vigorous but much in the way of the initial sequence in Manhattan. And he places his layers, his "golden ages" in similarly cinematic moments in time. The intellectuals and artist celebrities are there more than anything to color the human landscape, although the joke on Bu?uel's film is great.If you need to find another self-referential "meaning" to all this, than i suppose woody himself observes his new-york high empty class of intellectuals and sees it as he puts Sheen's character here: full of words but ultimately empty, boring, and utterly uninteresting. It's as if he had lived all his life trying to move up (or down) to his personal golden age, he the nostalgic for the new orleans big bands (which he uses in the initial soundtrack). You can go there and explore it like that. I like to contemplate the structure.Among the people i went to see this with, there was some discussion about why the main poster would reference Van Gogh without him even showing up in the film. I would say, maybe in a superficial way, that Van Gogh had similar aspirations to most of his paintings than Woody had for this film: painting what he saw, and layering on it a distorted vision of it, many times tormented, but always rooted in some inexistent world. In doing so he gave us transcendental figurative art (in his case fueled by absinthe and his own madness). Colors were Vincent's narrative tools. Narrative structure itself is Woody's very fabric for his films.My opinion: 3/5 another tile in woody's mosaic. What's next?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Woody has done in a long while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truth be told, after following his career diligently through to the end of the 80s - 1990 is in fact the end of the 80s and Alice was the last I've seen of Woody's work without missing a single one. There were still some very good movies in the 90s but in recent years he seemed to be making a film a year because that's what he does. The last two I've seen though technically flawless lost the special soul and personality that was his trademark. Whatever Works of two years ago was nice and had a great Allen feel to it (it was an old script after all) but the plot was forced at many moments and never more so than at the end which gave the whole experience a bad after taste.Well I've heard this one was different, and after great deliberation decided to give Woody another shot. I wasn't disappointed, it is as the title said the best I've seen of him for a very long while. In fact the only flaw I did find in the movie was Owen Wilson whom I do like in many of his roles but I must say -despite looking almost like Woody without the glasses it felt like he was busy doing a Woody imitation and not playing the struggling writer he should have been. Every one else was perfect. The plot flowed seamlessly the cinematography was amazing and all the other actors were super. Even Carla Bruni played her tiny role perfectly (which wasn't as small as I thought it would be) thing is her real role is another Woody trick to make sure we always remember this is a movie. Just like Rembrandt made sure we could see his brush strokes, Woody makes sure we'd never forget none of it is real - it's all his movie and his vision. Altogether it's a real nice clever movie to watch, not a masterpiece but not a waste of time or a disappointment by any stretch.</fullReview>

Hiding in the dark of night on a round Paris stoop when the bells ring Midnight; an antique car (identified as a Peugot) pulls up out of a dark winding street and pulls you in and takes you back in time to the Golden Age of 1920's Paris. And then, what happens... it's just too delicious to go into here, except to say that anyone with a passing interest in art, and writing in particular, will just eat this up and savor it.

Paris decor of the film is shown through the eyes of a foreign fan of the city - which is not at all disturbing in case you are a foreign fan of the city; there was only one place I did not recognise (the flea market where Gil found the Cole Porter record).

		<shortDescription>A Straightforward, Modern Day Fairy Tale from Woody!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris is a decidedly simple story of fantasy and romance in Paris. When the clock chimes midnight in Paris, a writer with writer's block, witnesses the city turn into 1920's Paris right before his eyes, meeting F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, and many other prominent artists from the era. Owen Wilson plays writer Gil Pender with charm and wit; the whole movie is filled with the same amount of charm and wit, as Gil, tired of writing Hollywood movies, wants to be a real writer, while his fiancé, played by Rachel McAdams, is about as opposite of a girl from Gil as any guy could imagine dating. What Gil finds when he travels back in time isn't just the key to unlocking his own writer's block, but potentially true love when he meets flapper, Adriana, played by Marion Cotillard. The charm of the story really lies in the segments taking place in the past, and most of the good humor comes in the modern day scenes when Gil tries to cover up where he is going each night. While no explanation is given as to how or why this time travel works, the charm overpowers the questions as to how and why (though these questions never leave the back of the mind either). As it is, without the occasional interlude into unnecessary politics, Woody Allen has written and directed an old fashioned fairy tale bridging modern day with that of the past, and what one can learn about their own time and appreciation of it through nostalgia. Like the romantics, it is straightforward. Is it too straightforward? Sometimes, but not enough to keep Midnight in Paris from being entertaining.I give Midnight in Paris an 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, what's a once brilliant but now soggy and complacent director to do when the only people crazy enough to lend him money anymore are European financiers who insist on one dimensional, flattering, sycophantic depictions of their capital cities ? The answer to this question can be most clearly appreciated in the over-hyped, lazily scripted 'Midnight in Paris'. It is an indictment of the quality of Allen's output over the past 20 years that this film is garnering such positive reviews, but also speaks to the desire of many to see this former great of American filmmaking fire up his old magic. The central conceit of this movie is whimsical enough but quickly evaporates as it becomes apparent the excruciatingly contrived dialog and poorly written characters are only getting worse. Owen Wilson acquits himself well, but can't really rise above such weak material. It begs the question - why do A-list actors willfully submit themselves to appearing in Allen's increasingly lazy movies for far less money they could otherwise earn for their time ? There is no cachet in appearing in a Woody Allen film anymore. People should stop indulging him. Audiences would be best served re-visiting his work pre-1992.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been a Woody Allen fan but let's face it his decade-long European sabbatical has hardly produced anything remotely memorable until now. The switch in genre from those uninspiring melodramas to romantic fantasy works perfectly. It can be no coincidence that Owen Wilson was chosen to play the leading man for a part that Allen clearly wrote with himself in mind. Without ever consciously mimicking Allen Wilson manages to put across that same angst and self-doubt in an amusing and totally charming performance. Indeed it is difficult to think of another actor attempting it without resorting to impersonation. Marion Cotillard lit up the screen as usual. Has that woman ever appeared in a bad film? The photography was also worthy of comment. Paris was made to look the centre of the universe and even in pouring rain it looked completely irresistible.Woody Allen should receive the freedom of the city for his contribution to French tourism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am glad Woody Allen didn't also act in it. Something about this guy and the way he talks, doesn't gel well with me. As for the movie, it feels 100% Woody Allen, too Woody Allen actually. My criticism is that, the way the actors moved, posed, talked and even the camera pans, all felt like something I've seen time and time again. Call it his signature but I got bored in the end.The script was brilliant though, I really liked the concept. Am not a big Paris fan but I can't deny that it has a nice setting for making movies. London (my city) in comparison feels grim and low quality.I hated the blonde actress (Rachel McAdams). She was terrible (especially when she was stamping in and out of hotel rooms). I was scared about having Owen Wilson in a Woddy Allen comedy but he was great choice. No wonder the script had to be re-written to fit him, haha.On a BBC Radio4 programme, Woody Allen asked "Why do People not go see his movies?" (as in, his previous movies). My answer is that he should either Direct or Write. Given his age and experience, I would lean on the writing side. What I want to see from ageing actors or directors is their take on the life that they've lived, boxed into a neat movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course, this is typical Woody Allen soul searching slop and it is the first of his films I have watched (all the way through) since Annie Hall.What made me watch this one then? The imagery! You MUST watch this film from the very beginning to appreciate the wonderful images of Paris in the opening credits. It has made me want to go to Paris, camera in hand; and go and find the Paris that Allen shows there.Otherwise, Owen Wilson does well even though is character is a bit of a burbler and the concept of going back in time is a bit twee.Duncan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moveable feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who have enjoyed the summary-lined Hemingway's mesmerizing work will find particular pleasure in this latest Woody Allen work which, although failing to bring home a trophy for him from Cannes, was received favourably generally, even from some one-time Allen fans who have long since turned sceptical. To loyal hard-core Allen fans, however, Woody is always Woody: loved, enjoyed and appreciated.The story line progresses along two parallel worlds. In day time, protagonist American screen writer Gil (Owen Wilson) is spending a working holiday in Paris with his materialistic and shallow girlfriend Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her wealthy parents. He is undertaking an endeavour to write a novel about his favourite corner in time and space: Paris in the 20s. At night, he is magically transported precisely there by a mysterious horse-drawn carriage arriving at midnight at a certain spot in town. Through a wormhole or whatever, he arrived in the distinguished company the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, T.S. Eliot,.?.. with Stein actually critiquing his manuscript, bestowing valuable advices.The magnificent cast include some of the best in today's movie world. Even non Allen fans probably know that if he doesn't appear in his own movie, he'll have a proxy character (e.g. Larry David in "Whatever works") ? an elderly, nerdy intellectual. In this movie, Wilson is surprisingly convincing as a young version of this proxy character, replacing his customary comedy persona with disarming sincerity and simplicity. An unfamiliar blond McAdams deserves credit in taking up her not particularly endearing role and making it work. Another well-played unlikable character is Michael Sheen's Paul, a "pedant" pseudo intellectual who keeps Inez occupied with ballroom adventures while Gil seeks his midnight escapade.Gil's illustrious company during these escapades is portrayed by actors in a wide range of familiarity to the audience. Most impressive is Kathy Bates performance as Stein which prompted one celebrity critic to suggest a close resemblance to Hemingway's portrayal in "A moveable feast". Tom Hiddleston, whose "Loki" is considered by many to be the best performance in "Thor", is a living Scott Fitzgerald. Sparkling Alison Pill as wife Zelda is nothing less than show-stealing, similarly Adrien Brody's cameo appearance as Salvador Dali. All the other performances of the aforementioned literary and artistic icons are uniformly solid. Some comments to the effects that these characters being one-dimension completely miss the point. That is by design and in no way whatsoever reflect deficiency on Allen's part.The brightest star in the entire movie has to be Marion Cotillard, playing Adriana, Picasso's distancing wife, Hemingway's object of passion and Gil's newly found love interest. Ever since her well-deserved Oscar in 2007, Coitllard has been well sought after by Hollywood, including prestigious project "Inception". She has always been heartbreakingly beautiful, but "Midnight in Paris" is where she has reached the pinnacle of irresistible bewitching charm. And in this movie, she bears an uncanny resemblance to Jacqueline Bisset (English, with French mother, probably best known in Hollywood for "Airport" (1970), and internationally in Truffaut's "Night for day" (1973)). There are two other lovely French-speaking actresses, not big roles. But impressive: Italian musician Carla Bruni cum First Lady of France as a museum tour guide and Lea Seydoux and Gabrielle, Gil's real-world new found love interest. What these two delightful actresses have in common with Coitllard, in addition to visual beauty, is the equally captivating beauty of English spoken by a French-speaking woman. On this, one would immediately think of Julie Delpy in "Before Sunrise/Sunset".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you love Paris, the film is worth it for the opening montage alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I've caught most of Woody's last few films on NetFlix (I think the last one I saw in the theater was Match Point), I wanted to make sure to see Midnight in Paris on the big screen for the full effect. I was not disappointed -- I had tears streaming down my cheeks within the first two minutes, feeling as if I'd been transported to beautiful Paris for a couple of hours.I think this is a fine film, and it was certainly entertaining -- with a core message that I can understand and relate to. When you've seen most of Woody's films over the years, you immediately recognize the character "types" reappearing in slightly different situations with other actors in the rolls. That's a double-edged sword in that there's something familiar about the ebb and flow of his films, but it can also be somewhat trite and annoying. Fortunately, that didn't seem to bother me as much in this film because the historical characters helped to draw some attention away from the more formulaic ones, and really added a lot of spice. I don't think this is one of Woody's top five films, but it's certainly the best (and only) 2011 summer release I'm planning on seeing . . . it's slim pickings in the theater these days for people with a brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dream ride in a classic French automobile, a success for Woody and company</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gil (Owen Wilson) is a self-described "hack" screenwriter, successful, but longing for something else. His beautiful fiancée, Inez (Rachel McAdams) thinks their future life in Malibu will be just great. On a trip to Paris, with Inez' parents, Gil is entranced by the great city and the venues where the "lost generation" of Americans traversed in the 1920's. Smitten, the writer wants to relocate there at once. Neither Inez or her parents are pleased. Things get touchier when Inez runs into an pedantic professor (Michael Sheen) and his wife and decides to needle Gil into hanging out as a foursome for a few. Finally, Gil has had all he can temporarily stand and leaves the party to walk home. As the clock tolls twelve, a classic Peugeot pulls up at the curb and the occupants invite Gil to their vehicle. He does. Soon, the car arrives at a party, only in a different era, with women dressed as flappers. To his astonishment, Gil meets Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda, Ernest Hemingway, and other transplanted Yankees. How can this be? Gil, learning quickly, becomes one of "them", as he states he is a writer with a novel on the verge of publication. But, in the morning, he is back in modern times and still faces his problems with Inez and so forth. Their relationship is no better, prompting Gil to return, at midnight, to the same spot and wait for the elegant automobile to take him back to his dreamy new companions. Only now, there are others. He meets Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), who insists on reading his book. Also appearing is a beautiful model, Adriana (Marion Cotillard) who has been posing for Picasso, among other activities. Next comes T.S. Eliot, Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody, amazing), and various other writers, artists, and, brand new, film makers. Will Gil ever want to return to 2010? This is a lovely film with a fantastic premise, a great cast, and a beautiful setting. No, in my view, its not Allen's funniest, I prefer Curse of the Jade Scorpion or Mighty Aphrodite for more genuine laughs. But, that's not to say that Woody hasn't delivered another fine flick into his already overflowing arsenal of admirable achievements. His genius will shine through the ages. Wilson does a very noteworthy job as the film's conflicted star while McAdams, Sheen, Bates, Carla Bruni and all of the lesser cast members are well-chosen, too. Two thespians deserve special praise. Cotillard continues to light up the screen with her beauty, wit, and sensitivity. Such a change from Inception, here, but no less worthy! Then, Brody, with very little screen time, manages to knock everyone's socks off as the eccentric Dali, what a great and vastly comedic turn! Naturally, Paris is lovely, as the opening montage shows well and great costumes, an intelligent script and a careful direction complete Allen's opus. Wouldn't it be fun to see the film at midnight, so get the gang together for an all-nighter of fun and philosophical discussion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not the greatest Woody Allen fan in the world, yet I must say with his latest "Midnight in Paris" it's offbeat, funny and strange enough to prove life can be interesting and misleading. It's showcase of wanting to dream and the wish for a change can lead to an illusion to prove that your current fate wasn't meant to be! Also a nice eye candy treat is the work and performance from the sexy Rachel McAdams(one of the big screens most enjoyable pleasures to watch). As with typical Allen he keeps it offbeat and funny, he proves that life, love and relationships are complex, and most of all fate is unexpected and life can start anew.Set in the capital of France the to be married young couple Gil(Owen Wilson)and Inez(in a sexy performance by the hot and cute Rachel McAdams)have came along with Inez's parents to adventure the city and take the French culture. And one by one the arts and buildings, museums, galleries, and fine wine eateries are a delight. Yet as Inez aside from being a hot and sexy lady enjoys the material side of France, her love Gil an author falls in love with the setting he wants to live in France! He doesn't want the California rich sun life that Inez does.So one night while strolling the city Gil has an illusion he's taken back to 1920's France! It's with this strange meeting and with many more trips back in time he sees France is more and more meant for him and the love thing with Inez just wasn't meant to be. Overall a film of escapism and it proves dreams and illusions can wake you up to your present world showing that past history can lead you to a new setting and a chance to a new start of life and possible love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had "Midnight in Paris" been written/directed by a first-time film maker, it might be considered an above average effort, or at least a pleasant diversion. But as Woody Allen has such a large body of work this film comes off as typical Woody Allen fare,slow, clichéd, and rife with light (and I'm talking' light!) humor.All of Mr.Allen's prejudices are exposed once again:His disdain for California and Hollywood, though he is quite happy to take advantage of their financial backing and distribution network; his attitude that all Americans are rubes and stupid, except of course for New York City Jews, and Manhattan gentiles; Oh how much he wishes America was like France, and their "sophistication"; they might even accept a grown man marrying his adopted daughter!In the mean time, Mr.Allen has written a tired old movie, with a comparatively new actor (Owen Wilson) pretending to be Woody himself.Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality Cinema, Fun Movie, But A Few Things Missing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its Woody Allen shooting a movie about the struggles of 'the artist' in Paris. It can't be bad, and it isn't bad. But just how good is the film? My answer: pretty good, but far from great.Allen fixates upon the city as the muse of artists both past and present. His opening shots of Paris set the stage for the ongoing love affair his protagonist Gill (Owen Wilson) has with the city and the city's rich history as fertile ground for artistic endeavor. Owen as Gill, succeeds in playing a struggling writer who is trying to escape his success as a Hollywood actor in cookie-cutter movies. He waxes poetic to his fiancée, Inez (Rachel McAdams) about his desire to leave Pasadena and relocate to Paris permanently. This is where Allen creates the initial tension for our protagonist. Gill wants to walk the streets that Fitzgerald and Hemingway and Picasso walked. He wants to be a real artist, and he is confronted with this growing realization while trying to plan a life with Inez, who is the rich, soulless American caricature of Hollywood emptiness.On his midnight walks, Wilson delves into the Paris of the 1920s and with each evening he is pushed away from the reality of a life with Inez toward a life of Parisian wistful inspiration. Allen juggles some difficult plot devices that are wholly unbelievable but nonetheless enjoyable. To say that the 20s "come to life" for Wilson would be both physically and psychologically accurate. All the while, his fiancée and her Republican parents and snooty friends question his actions, spurn his artistic flightiness and serve to establish the materialistic sadness that blinds people from the sights that Gill cherishes, the beauty and inspiration of Paris that can't be discovered in the Museum but, instead, must be sought out on its streets, preferably in the rain. The theme of the present day artist yearning for the past glory periods of art whether it be the 1920s or 1890s is force fed to the viewer. Allen builds this theme up and slowly questions it as the movie drifts onward, but in delivering a verbal and concise conclusion on the issue, I felt he left little to the audiences imagination. Additionally, the conflict we want from an Allen movie, the inner turmoil, the multiple plot line craziness, the sexual and sensual aspects, all of these cinematic fingerprints that identify an Allen movie are largely washed out in this film. There is a growing sense of flow to the film that allows the viewer to know which way the wind is blowing and how things will conclude, and when they finally do, it makes for a nice story of art winning the day, but it lacks the whirlwind emotions so frequently associated with a Woody Allen movie. For literature fans, for Allen fans, and for general movie fans, its worth a viewing, but its not a mind blowing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of us who like to idealize, this film is for you! You may not be surrounded by beautiful women or the greatest geniuses in your generation like lucky Gil, nor be rich and engaged to nice lady. Nevermind, some of us always think beauty/ perfection/ "meaning" lies elsewhere. Gil idealizes the past, our thing may be different, but the "mental process" is always the same. As Gil realizes not very quickly: we always find the present, whatever present, a bit dull, whereas the romanticized version of reality we choose is lacking all rough edges, dreary routine, limits to our ambitions. "Maybe people in the Renaissance would have liked to live in the age of a Khan :)". As GeneralUrsus (US) writes on IMDb: "(perhaps) we are never truly content in whatever station we reside". Maybe our narcissism tricks us into believing that "if things were/ had been different, if we took this or that turn in life, etc.", THEN, we'd be happy. Gil isn't in love with dull Inez, who doesn't love nor even respect him, neither do her parents (at all), and probably even Inez in turn is holding high hopes for his pedantic friend who likes to be the only one talking.Owen Wilson was a surprise for me. I really thought he was a concession for marketing reasons but no, in a way it's a wise cast decision: a tanned Californian blonde may be as out of place in intellectual's France of the 20's to make him a true foreigner, so his being "out of tune" with reality may be honest after all. He is a good actor, making us empathize with his bewilderment, curiosity and insecurities about his work. McAdams is not as beautiful as we've seen her before, maybe it's she being tanned, dyed and with high heels, it was surprising to me.Just one quibble: maybe too "didactic" and stereotyped views of our famous authors, like Hemingway wanting to challenge everybody all the time, Dali looks like suffering from OCD with rhinoceros, etc. Or they addressing each other by surnames. But I am sure Woody is right: we are not all knowledgeable in the names of 1920's artists, let alone XIX century painters, etc. John and Helen are also stereotyped Republican dumb arrogant ultra rich Americans. We probably won't get to know anybody so rich in our lifetimes, but anyway, I feel they deserve a bit more "fairness" than what they get. But well, given this is Art, I found Helen's quip: "What's cheap is cheap" perfect for the "insatiable mother-in-law", in that she's almost universal :). Hemingway is particularly well cast, as familiar face Kathy Bates as Stein. I found Brody as Dali as somewhat distracting me from the real character, but that's probably me. Léa Seydoux and Marion Cotillard vie for our hearts of romantic movie goers, it's hard to choose, Gil says it right when looking at beautiful working women at Pigalle: "I'm afraid I like them all :)". Adriana is probably more of an alluring tragic character, you can feel sadness by the way she looks. My favourite character is Gad Elmaleh's private detective. A well known actor in France, from "La doblure" among others, here it's a clueless detective (!), a bit like all of us in this film, and maybe in life too. Paul is the funny to hate rival, a cautionary tale for all of us who think that trying to be intelligent and "know about many things" will make us interesting while it only transforms us into bores that even a tourist's guide will remember with a frown :). I'd have liked Carla a bit more of screen time, but her goddess charm adds light to any project she participates into. I hope she'll keep on acting :)! I could go on and on about this film but what I want to highlight is that while it's an ode to the past, nostalgia, and unfulfilled dreams, it also cries in a beautiful way: "Seize the present!" and "Choose the best from what's available" for it's the only thing that's real, the only thing that we'll ever have. The Woody Allen reader has a funny quote about steaks that says it better than we could ever do, in an American "matter-of-fact" way that is refreshing.Enjoy this movie, you just won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just don't get how anyone can really like Woody Allen pictures. They are almost ALL universally Booooring!!! And while I like the romantic concept of this movie, the only thing romantic in this movie is Paris. Which is spectacular... But that's all this movie has going for it. The concept of this script is interesting, but the characters come off dull, weak and boorish. And I like Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, and Marion Cotillard, whom I fell in love with in Ridley Scott's "The Good Year". But not in this movie. Only Woody Allen could direct Owen Wilson and turn him into a weak pathetic version of himself..in other words...he turned Owen into Woody Allen.BTW, I just noticed that Marion Cotillard doesn't appear prominently in the IMDb credits of either movie and yet she is prominent in this movie(maybe the only actor who stands out) or the "The Good Year" where she plays the female lead. Is is it because she is French? Curious....hmmmmmmm.I've never met a man with any testosterone that liked Woody Allen, I'm thrilled that I haven't had to go to a movie with him in it for a long time...something I've had to do for girlfriends and wives....whom he seems to have universal appeal. Go figure. If you like Woody Allen movies, you might like this movie....but if you don't...I'm pretty confident you won't like this movie either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before sharing my reservations, let me note:1) Others in the theatre seemed to be enjoying this movie before I walked out 2) I've enjoyed some of Woody Allen's recent movies (Vicki Christina Barcelona, Whatever Works), so I think I had pretty fair expectations.I was looking forward to this movie based on all the reviews I read. One of them noted that Owen Wilson was a surprisingly excellent choice as the Woody Allen "character"/mouthpiece.After the seductive opening of scenes of Paris (think of the valentine to NYC at the beginning of Manhattan), I found it incredibly jarring to hear what were basically the words and thoughts of a New York Jewish intellectual coming out of a lanky Texan (a problem which was not the case with Larry David in the same role in "Whatever Works").I tried to work with it when I ran into my second big problem with the movie - the fiancé. As written, the character is cartoonishly unappealing - I found it impossible to buy that these two people had gone on a second date, never mind gotten engaged. The problem really seemed to be with the writing - not with Rachel McAdams portrayal.When I walked out at the 30 minute mark, the fantasy aspects of the story had kicked in and I should note that most of the new characters seemed very well cast and acted. But the acceptance of fantasy requires the suspension of disbelief and the movie had squandered plausability for me at that point on these first two problems, I couldn't stick around for the ride.YMMV, and maybe if I had stuck it out it would have worked its magic on me. But since my assessment of Owen Wilson flies in the face of reviews I've read (and a few comments I've read here), I just wanted to voice a contrarian view to be considered by those thinking of checking this movie out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Owen Wilson is a flustered Hollywood scriptwriter/wannabe novelist on a trip to Paris with his agitated fiancée (with clichéd right wing parents and clichéd left wing pseudo-intellectual friends). Troubled by perpetual indifference, he ventures alone into the night and is too-easily taken back to the 1930s. There he meets the likes of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter, and the every-artist den mother, Gertrude Stein. Hemingway speaks like a robot reciting Hemingway, while Fitzgerald flaunts his drunkenly troubled, airhead wife, Zelda. Picasso's in love with a fickle beauty while Owen Wilson, displaying his usual surfer deadpan, as a person thrust into another era acts as if nothing's going on ? and that's the problem.Woody Allen treats time travel like walking to a corner store, making Paris, the inspiration for a film spanning two (actually three) time periods, feel commonplace; while the actors portraying the famous inhabitants seem like dullards at a costume party. Although one conversation ? as Wilson and his love interest (Picasso's ex) discuss the importance of nostalgia ? does effectively engage the theme of seeking another era for inspiration. So perhaps Woody Allen can transport himself back to the seventies and eighties ? he might be able to relearn the art of movie/magic, something he hasn't effectively concocted for many years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We borrowed the DVD of Paris at Midnight from the library. My hubby thought it was such schmaltz he left the room about 15 minutes after the start of the film (he thought the first 3 minutes of shots of Paris were an art's students presentation that went on for way too long). I didn't think much of it either- I would have loved it when I was studying for my BA in English. It's a film for sophomores studying English or Art. The actors playing the famous writers, painters, and surrealists were nice to look at though. Hemingway was much too repetitive.Paris is a wonderful city but I never thought of it as the most romantic city in the world or the best place for writers and artists to live. Allen did nothing interesting with the premise. I loved the idea of Zelda Fitzgerald taking a Valium. But the present didn't corrupt the past. None of the characters came to visit the present either. Hard to believe this movie is from the same man who wrote "The Kugelmass Episode". It was great when Emma Bovery went shopping in the New York of the 1980s. What would Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda, Hemingway and Dali think of 2015? Well, Gertrude Stein would be thrilled to bits by the recent Supreme Court ruling. Do yourself a favor: after seeing the movie look up the paintings, films, and novels mentioned by the characters, both in the 1920s and 1890s sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film on TV and at first did not know that it was from Woody Allen. I think I figured it out after about ten minutes. I started wondering if it were a Woody movie just by the unique concept of the film, but I became convinced it was Woody's work when a piece of period music came swimming into the film.Midnight In Paris reminded me of several of Woody's movies, including Annie Hall (a love of Paris taking the place of a love of New York), The Purple Rose of Cairo, and maybe a touch of Radio Days and Hannah and Her Sisters. I initially was not thrilled with Owen Wilson playing the lead, but he grew on me a bit as the movie moved along. Still, I probably would have cast someone else.I thought it was an excellent film. It delivered some yuks while at the same time provided several philosophical thoughts to chew on. For a younger audience the pace of the movie might have been a bit too leisurely, but it did not bother me. The film was only 94 minutes and besides, I wasn't in a hurry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Midnight in Paris" Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris- ***1/2 (out of 4): Though I have always prided Woody Allen on sheer wit and philosophical insight, I pride him here for not only the previous areas, but also the originality of his screenplay. What we have here is a commentary on nostalgia, set in the gorgeous city of Paris, taking us between modern day Paris and the city in the 1920s, when artists and writers such as Salvador Dali, Ernest Hemingway, and Gertrude Stein populated the city. The Allen wit is there of course, but the true value of this film is watching Wilson interacting with these famous icons of the past and learning more about the present in the process. It really makes you feel good and think better after you walk out of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Much Other Than "Cute"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: Woody Allen's famously witty and neurotic tendencies are made more human and approachable by Owen Wilson, whose Gil is a very familiar character to the ones he's played in the past and strikes me as a good stepping stone into the world of Allen. I really appreciate the fact that this movie is a statement on this year's Academy Awards, where only one nominee for best picture is firmly grounded in the present. Allen really couldn't have picked a better year to make this into an Academy-worthy film, as its overarching theme serves to incredulously point out the irony of its inclusion in the nominees this year in particular.Cons: As much as I can appreciate most of Gil's personality, I just can't relate to his unabashed love of the city of Paris. Since I've never been there, I will admit that this might have to do with my deep-seated reactionary attitude toward all things French. But honestly, what's so great about every street, building, sign, and cobblestone in that city? Also, pretty much every character in this movie not named Gil could stand to receive a hearty punch in the face. I probably wouldn't have fared very well in the 1920s, listening to speech patterns like that all the time. Speaking of the 1920s, I felt like I could have stood to know a bit more about that generation of writers, musicians, and artists to really appreciate a good deal of the portrayals and references littered throughout the movie. Although if Hemingway reads like he spoke in this, I'm glad I haven't read his books after all.Overall: I won't say I disliked watching the movie, and there were a number of moments that made me actually laugh out loud (something I'm not typically wont to do alone in a dark room). However, I spent most of the movie wondering if it would arrive at an eventual point and whether I would care. Ultimately it did wind up with a theme that I believe ought to be quite strenuously stressed with some people, but it wasn't enough to make me think of it as anything other than a "cute" film that really only garners a best picture mention due to this particular year's crop of nominees. After some wrestling with an eight rating, I eventually settled on a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most nostalgic and elegant movie i have ever seen. the sets and locations of fantastic Paris are perfect. It is especially made with feel good factor which is the most crucial thing. Everything is just excellent ,Owen Wilson is so charming and sweet,his best performance so far,and the supportive cast did very good. Marion Cotillard looks so glamorous and lovely. Really liked those funny scenes with legends especially with Salvador Dali. My younger brother suggested me to read a short story "The Third Level", by Jack Finney,before watching the movie. Both are extremely related. i really loved the concept of time traveling to 1920's 1890's and so on. Must say the best screenplay of the year and movie too. Woody Allen,you are just great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to this take on time travel, Doctor Who is the most believable thing ever made. Why does the car from the past take the same road every night? And why do the people in it pick Gil to accompany them? And why, most of all, does Gil accept so readily? I mean, who would get into a strange car in some dark road in Paris in the middle of the night and drink whatever the people in it offered? "Where are you taking me?", Gil asks, sipping his wine (?). If the answer had been: "Oh, we're drugging you right now and then we'll kill you and harvest your organs", Gil would have deserved a Darwin award.Gil accepts the fact that he has just traveled back in time 100 years and that now all the literary greats of the time want to be his friends (and listen to him talk about all his problems at length) after about 5 minutes. Has he never heard of concepts like reenactment and cosplay? I find it pretty plausible that in a big town like Paris there might be enough people interested in these things to form a proper club that meets every night in a kind of a tavern. The fact that as soon as he leaves the bar the first night he finds himself in front of a laundromat instead doesn't convince me either: his fiancée had previously hinted at his tendency to get lost.No, sorry, to me this film is the story of a man who by sheer luck escapes brutal murder and is then messed with by a couple of very good reenactors. But it helps him find his way, so I guess the morale of the story is that even incredibly naive people get lucky sometimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lazy and simplistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've enjoyed some of Allen's recent films, as he works his way round Europe, gently and sometimes not so gently lampooning Americans and their unattractive habits and mores. Vicky Christina Barcelona was the high point of this series, subtle and beguiling and beautifully observed. By contrast, Midnight in Paris is a heavy-handed disappointment. It starts badly, with a pointless sequence of shots of the city, improves when we meet our hero, his shrewish fiancée and her appalling parents and then utterly fails to deliver on its very cute premise. The script is unfinished and never gets beyond its saccharine sweetness to tackle the philosophical and metaphysical questions that the premise poses. There were moments to be enjoyed in the casting and sometimes the action but the clumsy writing cut them short almost every time. It says a lot about a film when even Marion Cotillard fails to inject any real depth into her character. Lazy and simplistic, as are the critics and audiences that praised it so highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review from writer/photographer who has seen this movie 4 times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen almost all of Woody Allen's movies and like many of his fans have been disappointed with his body of work since Mighty Aphrodite, except for Vicky Christina Barcelona. I ignored the hype about this movie and decided not to watch it in theaters. But the best picture Oscar nod got my attention. So, when it became available on demand I thought it was time I watched. Since on demand allows 24hr rentals, I end up watching this movie 4 times. Twice in the first night and twice the next day. Why? Because the first viewing really touched me.The movie on its first viewing casts a certain old school Woody Allen spell, where you think to yourself "he's finally back." But the charm is quickly diminished by every consecutive viewing and sadly soon becomes forgettable.I still have memories from watching his Interiors ('78) for the first time in late 90's early 2000's. There are scenes from Hanna and Her Sisters ('86), Annie Hall ('77), Radio Days ('87) that I will never forget. If any of these movies run on TCM or premium channels, I would certainly stop and watch until the end. It doesn't matter how many time I have seen them before.But once the impact of the first viewing faded away, Midnight in Paris also fades away from memory. I think the main problem is Owen Wilson. Although this is probably the best performance he has done to date he is simply not worth repeated viewings. He does a pretty good job of channeling Woody however, but he lacks Woody's screen presence.The ensemble however is simply brilliant and so is the art direction and the cinematography. Adrien Brody's Dali is a scene stealer.Actually when I started writing this I intended it to be mostly a review of the cinematography by the fellow Iranian Darius Khondji. He is no doubt a master cinematographer with quite an impressive track record. The work as a whole is quite flawless and intentionally subtle, except for the lighting in one set that really bugged me all 4 times that I saw it--the Gil and Inez hotel room. The room is filmed way too yellow with a very harsh look. All the lights are turned up, even the bathroom while no one is using it. There are no effective shadows. It's lit like a TV set. I could only imagine what Robert Richardson would have done to the particular set. The glass-doors on the closets are frosted (look terrible), assuming a treatment done just for the camera as not to reflect the set lighting. Thankfully their hotel room is shown only 3 or 4 times for very short periods as most of the scenes are shot outdoors.The postcard shots of Paris are drop dead gorgeous, so is the scene at Monet's gallery. The night shots however are magic and I think it's one of the key reasons for this movie's success.If you are a Woody Allen fan and have given up on him and stopped watching his movies, do yourself a big favor and watch this gorgeous film. The first viewing will simply blow you away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The charm of romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's "Midnight in Paris" is a sweet and charming examination of romance?not only romance of the heart but also romance for the past. Owen Wilson plays Gil, a hack Hollywood screenwriter who longs to write serious literature. He and his fiancée, played by Rachel McAdams, are visiting Paris to spend some time with her parents before they get married. Gil obviously adores Paris?as does Allen, who shoots it as lovingly as he shoots his own beloved Manhattan?and wonders whether he and his fiancée should move there permanently. As he escapes his insufferable soon-to-be in-laws, Gil stumbles upon the Paris of the past he has romanticized so thoroughly and encounters F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, and a host of other literary and artistic figures. He falls for the lovely Adriana, played by Marion Cotillard, and he is ultimately forced to reconcile his romances with his reality. Allen's script is, as we have come to expect, witty and insightful and intelligent, and the film itself will win you over with its charm and its honesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More proof that Woody Allen is secretly European</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world must be ending. It has to be. There is no other explanation. All the signs of the apocalypse are there. I actually thoroughly enjoyed a Woody Allen movie. I know, it's absolutely crazy, but nonetheless true. While most of your die-hard Allen fans will point out the superiority of Annie Hall, Manhattan, and probably to a lesser extent Match Point, I consider Midnight in Paris to be among his best if not his best film. The writing was fluid without becoming condescending or exaggerated, the acting is superb, the cinematography nearly flawless, the editing was quite sharp and best of all it was just a fun and unique trip through a city the medium of film has explored so many times.Midnight in Paris follows a struggling writer Gil (Owen Wilson) as he accompanies his fiancée (Rachel McAdams) and her family on a vacation to Paris. Falling in love with the city far more than everyone else in the party, the writer discovers that on a certain point in time in a certain area, he inexplicably is transported into his favorite time period and meets his favorite artists and influential individuals that shape his taste in literature, art, and music. The deeper he dwells into the 1920s, the further distance he feels from his life in the modern time. Watching this movie is like being part of a great inside joke; as you'll get much more of a kick out of this plot if you know most of the artistic geniuses that the main character runs into.Woody Allen's script here is nowhere near as deep, complex, or as thought-provoking as some of his works from 70s and 80s, but still works like a charm because of the creativity involved. Allen creates a dreamlike world that almost resembles artistic nirvana as we see our protagonist embed himself into the universe of 1920s Paris, which has a very different look, texture, and feel to the modern-day image of the romantic city. It's a lot of fun to see him bounce back and forth through time and realize how different he acts, reacts, and behaves depending on where (and when) he is.Owen Wilson is definitely a major player in the quality of this movie. He plays his role with such glee, such happiness and respect towards the subject matter involved that you can't help but feel sorry for him as he slugs his way through 2000s Paris with his disenchanted group. The rest of the cast also contribute greatly, ranging from Marion Cotillard as the beautiful and mysterious Adriana to Corey Stoll as the charismatic and unique Ernest Hemmingway. Rachel McAdams plays a role very different to her usual fare by being the mean-spirited and ignorant antagonist that is slowly sucking the life out of Gil. Love or hate Allen, he's usually good at casting the right cast, and Midnight in Paris is definitely no different. Keep an eye on the First Lady of France having some screen time in the flick.What makes this movie special is that you can't really dislike it or hate it. There is this everlasting charm and bubbly personality brewing in the film that makes it impossible for you to dwell on any of its potential setbacks. From start to finish it was a quirky and engaging adult fairy tale. This is a very fantasy-heavy film that never explains the why or the how, it just places you in the passenger seat and takes you on a wild entertaining ride.Bottom Line: Midnight in Paris is probably my new favorite Woody Allen film as he crafts a very lighthearted and fun story that puts a twist on the usual film about a vacation to Paris. The acting was wonderful, the writing was better than Allen's usual material (especially recently), and the overall production value from cinematography to art and costume design was above and beyond your typical low-budget movie. This film never goes over-the-top, never dwells into muttered and cluttered talk, and gives you a side of Paris you aren't used to seeing. One of the funniest and most unique films of 2011, you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgia ain't what it used to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amusing tale about a time traveller in 1920s Paris, wrapped up in an irritating framing device about a group of obnoxious modern-day Americans staying in the city. Allen is fond of magical plots and, as in The Purple Rose of Cairo, his most successful venture in this genre, he does not waste time on explaining how the magic works. His protagonist, Gil, just has to sit on some steps in Monmartre when the clock strikes midnight and he is transported back to his golden age. The audience has an amusing time recognising the famous denizens of 1920s Monmartre before they identify themselves and there are a few good jokes. The one I liked best is Gil suggesting the plot of The Exterminating Angel to a bemused Louis Bunuel. Interestingly, Allen also referenced the Bunuel film in The Purple Rose of Cairo where the on-screen characters sit around in evening dress, unable to leave. The stand-out cameos in this section of the film are Adrian Brody as a rhinoceros-obsessed Salvador Dalí and Kathy Bates as an unfeasibly accommodating Gertrude Stein. But I did miss Henry Miller and Ana?s Nin.In the framing device Gil is staying in Paris with his airhead fiancée, her Tea Party Republican parents and two pretentious friends. This part of the film could usefully have been left on the cutting-room floor. Even more irritating is that it is shot in the style of a travelogue, rather like Vicky Cristina Barcelona. We see interminable shots of Parisian tourist attractions accompanied by mind-numbing, imitation Django Reinhardt music. I have to declare an interest here: I used to work in Paris and I am immune to its so-called charms. One of the characters says: "That Paris exists and anyone could choose to live anywhere else in the world will always be a mystery to me". One of the most irritating things that I found about Paris was that most of my Parisian colleagues would have agreed with that sentiment.It is amazing how even the most brilliant actors, when playing the lead in Allen's films, adopt his mannerisms, vocal tics and persona. Owen Wood is Gil and is by no means a brilliant actor but he produces the most accurate imitation of Woody Allen that I have yet seen on the screen. And I don't mean that in a nice way. Marion Cotillard is Adriana, his love interest from the 1920s. Her Golden Age is the Belle Epoque but when they go back there and meet Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin and Degas they are told that, no, the Golden Age is the Renaissance. Allen is making a small, but valid point here: that everyone hankers after an earlier period when everything was wonderful but, for the vast majority of people, now is the best of possible times. Eventually Gil comes to accept this, not least because he cannot envisage a world without painkillers and antibiotics. I tend to agree: in the 1920's I would not have been able to beam down this film from a satellite and watch it in the comfort of my own home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Woody-esque</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie Review: "Midnight in Paris" ? A very quaint and uncomplicated romantic comedy featuring Owen Wilson as Gil Pender, a successful American screen writer, visiting Paris with his fiancée and her parents. Gil has an infatuation with Paris, specifically Paris of the 1920s; and would prefer nothing more than to give up his Hollywood lifestyle to settle down in Paris and finish his novel. After a night out on the town with his fiancée and her friends, Gil excuses himself to head back to the hotel. However, due to a poor sense of direction and excess alcohol indulgence, Gil (lost) finds himself on the steps of a church as the clock chimes midnight. As he stares at the streets in search of a taxi, a late model car comes to his rescue. The passengers in the car talk Gil into coming to a party with them. It's at this party where Gil comes to the realization that he's been whisked into Paris circa 1920, and he's now face to face with the likes of Cole Porter, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Salvador Dali, and many, many others? Night after night, he continues to return to the steps, and the antique vehicle always appears at the stroke of midnight. As he continues to enjoy basking in the past, he soon realizes that the people of the 20s long for an earlier time of their past as well. It's this awareness that returns him to the present for good. Directed by Woody Allen, it very Woody-esque?. Beautifully filmed, Paris makes a wonderful backdrop for this film! Perfectly cast, Owen Wilson plays his role flawlessly. I was actually drawn into the story, and (like Gil) found Paris 1920 way more interesting than present day Paris. Though I am not a huge fan of Woody Allen, I really enjoyed this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'MIDNIGHT IN Paris': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Woody Allen's most critically acclaimed film in 6 years and his most financially successful movie ever (before adjusting for inflation). It's received 4 Academy Award nominations including 'Best Picture', 'Best Director', 'Best Original Screenplay' and 'Art Direction' but will be lucky to win one (most likely screenplay). The film is a fantasy comedy and for those who really like Allen it's sure to please, others could be lucky to find a little enjoyment.The film reunites Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams for the first time since 2005's 'WEDDING CRASHERS'. They play a couple (Gil and Inez) who are vacationing with Inez's rich parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) on their business trip in Paris. Gil is a popular screenwriter who's attempting to write his first novel but is suffering some severe writer's block. Gil has always been in love with Paris, especially it of yesteryear (specifically the 1920's), so he's hoping to find some much needed inspiration there. Inez thanks he's a dreamer and should go back to writing screenplays. One night while traveling the streets of Paris alone he finds something magical and possibly the inspiration he was looking for.I've never been a big Woody Allen fan so I don't usually seek his films out. I watched this film because of it's financial and critical success and found it slightly better than Allen's other work but still nothing too special. It is funny and witty in places, Wilson is great in the lead and he and the film are charming (in places) but for me that's about all the film had to offer. Like I said if you're an Allen fan though I'm sure you'll eat this s--- up. Everyone else will find it mildly amusing at best.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SILVr6aykQ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris (Quick Review) - 4 Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Midnight in Paris" is a charming little movie that takes us through the most substantial days in the life of Gil (Owen Wilson), an American in Paris. If you are suddenly reminded of the 1951 Gene Kelly musical, then I commend you. The heroes of both movies are struggling artists who hunger for an inspiration the size of a city. That the capital of France is universally regarded as a stimulant of our mind's creativity offers no mystery. Elegant by day and dashing by night, Paris is a city of history and architecture, of fashion and romance, of music and dancing, of wine and art. Gracefully photographed by director Woody Allen and cinematographer Darius Khondji, the movie might just prevent arguments between newlyweds who can't agree on their honeymoon destination.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/midnight-Paris/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody in top form again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of Mr Allen, But must admit that some of his recent offerings have not been his best and wondered when we would see that form and distinctive style he his known and loved for again, if ever. I have often loved his least praised films like Small Time Crooks and Hollywood Ending, which in my opinion were his best work in the last 10 years. But this one is just so enchanting - a true valentine to Paris, making the city another character and definitely boosting tourism to the city (I cannot wait to go!). I liked almost everything about this film, the casting was excellent (loved Marion Cotillard the most and I thought everyone was great), the music was typical of a Woody film, the photography ravishing, mood depiction charming and the thing that makes all of his films sizzle - the dialog - so witty and funny, the scene where they report that the detective went missing was hysterical and the other scene where Inez wants to report her earrings missing, while her dad is being treated by doctor and Gil freaks out, is classic Woody Allen - It is such a treat to see such an inventive comedy for adults, with a touch of fantasy and nostalgia and yet leaves us with the universal question:- Are we ever satisfied with time or era we live in? and our desire to always long for the good old days, as if those days could never be right now. I highly recommend this and thank Woody for continuing to still delight us. I am rooting for a Best picture nomination at the Oscars for this and a best screenplay award. It has been a long time since I had tears of joy running down my face when I was watching a movie, this one did it for sure. Woody is in top form again - Bravo!</fullReview>

Gil is engaged to Inez a beautiful woman who thinks he is living in the past and dreaming and wishing, honestly i felt she really didn't appreciate his imagination she enjoyed Paul's point of views an all knowing prick i call him.at the stroke of midnight Gil would be in a certain place to get picked up by a beautiful car from the 20's and just whisked away enthralled in the 20's era, parties,wine,conversation, he meets a woman and is in awe of her. in the end i gave it a six because while the story and conversation was so/so what carried it was the beautiful city Paris, i enjoyed the characters and everything but i was more in awe with the city than the characters and the story, the city is a ten of course,i think people should watch the film for its beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EVERYTHING CHANGES AFTER THE MIDNIGHT, especially in Paris ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During their trip to Paris, Gil and his fiancée, Inez are passing through a crisis. They find out some faults in each other, which prevent them from spending this visit in the city of love in a romantic way. As a result, the couple use the charms of Paris separately and then discover that they have very different expectations and needs.In brand-new Woody Allen's romantic comedy, Midnight in Paris, the main character, unfulfilled writer Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) literally finds his place in the twenties. He is time traveling to his favorite epoch, where he meets new companion. Honest to the bone and impulsive Hemingway, Fitzgerald devoted to his crazy wife, Picasso's muse ? Adrianna (Marion Cotillard), who of course turns Gil's head, and warmhearted Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) ? his own reviewer, become an inspiration to his novel. Every midnight Pender abandons Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her sophisticated friends, so as to escape into the world of his dreams.While accompanying Gil in his night trips through the streets of Paris, the spectators can truly feel the atmosphere of the city with all senses. For instance, we admire the view of beautifully illuminated alleys and obviously breathtaking Eiffel Tower. Our ears are coddled with the French music of the 1920s. We can even smell the perfumes of elegant ladies, who enjoyed themselves at the same party as Gil did, or taste "the diamond whiskey sour" drunk by Hemingway in one of the bars.Once again Woody Allen says about love from another point of view. He notes that true love is when we are accepted as we are and have support in fulfillment of our dreams. The main idea of the movie is to show that pretending to be someone else and cheating ourselves won't make us happy. The key is being yourself and waiting for the person who will share our interests.I really recommend Midnight in Paris to anyone, who would appreciate an intense plot filled with a pinch of romance and also a little bit of adventure, which takes place in the romantic capital of Europe. I was delighted by the idea of putting such a beautiful message in a comedy with the elements of fantasy. What's more, for those who are fond of 1920s, the brand-new Allen's movie is a great opportunity to observe the profiles of the then artists, who were, in my opinion, perfectly played. By the way, applause for Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a nice film. But. I would say highly overrated. When you notice at this film database that films like 'Manhattan' and 'Annie Hall' only get a few points more than this one, things are a little out of balance. I take these films (Manhattan, Annie Hall) as the standard for Woody Allen because they are his very best. I would personally give these films a 10 rating because it has all Allen can give, in terms of originality, Personal handwriting, Craftmanship, etc). Compared to these great films 'Midnight in Paris' only gets a 6 from me, perhaps even a 5. It's a nice film, but I'll not remember it soon after now, while I will always remember his best films. Also in the 80's he made a few nice ones, although not as good as before mentioned films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight In Paris is a shamelessly romantic love letter to Paris, to its streets, its artistic magnetism, its famous inhabitants... This movie deserves to be seen with Paris, Je T'Aime - well, maybe as the hors-d'oeuvres.The transition from today to yesterday was Brilliantly Sublime - taking advantage the facades of Paris which haven't changed in centuries - and without any formal cue to the audience. I was just as surprisedly invited into the past as Gil was, without special effects or tromp-d'?il; I was at a loss to say if it was real or just theatrics, like slipping into a dream. I love how Gil tried to show Inez like a little kid who swears he saw fairies in the back yard.Great opening montage of Paris. The city of lights is certainly at it best in the summer. My favorite part is Montmartre - it just feels more parisian than any other quarter.After a while it does get overloaded with cameos. At the same time I felt like there were too many famous people (the mistake of Funny People), and then that I wasn't getting enough of each. I wanted to see more Man Ray and Hemmingway! Why wasn't there a full scene with T. S. Elliot? Art hors-d'oeuvres indeed!I was really pleased to see Gad Elmaleh - he's a brilliant french stand-up - and I think he would have made a much better Dalí.This was obviously a chance to make a personal dream of Woody Allen's come true - and I'm so glad he did. I loved the escapades into the 20s and even the 1890s. I wish, like Gil, that I could have stayed there. Gil's harsh present was jilting to cut back to - Rachel McAdams again plays a spoiled bitch to perfection. I'll say this - I would love to get into a magic taxi to a time without Owen Wilson. He was out of his depth and forgettable in his performance, which, by contrast, made the 20s scenes and personalities stand out even more.If you have a nostalgic wanderlust or feel like you were born too late, this is a great vehicle to escape to brighter times. But the morale is clear - the grass is always greener in another time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, really liked it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gotta admit that I am compelled to rate this picture very positively. My wife had seen it and really liked it (I hadn't). Then we ran into Woody Allen in NYC (I profess pompously) and I told him it was brilliant and he thanked me, so I have to stand behind this... It's brilliant. Owen Wilson (Gil) fills in admirably for Woody in the role of the slightly befuddled nebbish who falls in love at the drop of a coquettish smile by an ephemeral waif of a girl. The story is exceptionally likable and so are the players. What I liked best were the characterisations of the historical figures. Kathy Bates was a perfect Stein, Brody was as good a Dali as one could be, Corey Stoll a robust Hemingway, etc.But, a couple of little things did bother me.One was that Adriana's written memoir of their making love, read by Gil in the present, didn't actually occur. Also, what happened to his book? If Stein and Hemingway both liked it, why wasn't it published? Another is that it wrapped up too quickly with Gil leaving his fiancée and hooking up with another girl in a wink of an eye and not trying to revisit the past again. I would.Other than that, it is brilliant. I was prescient, I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Borning and Not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Woody Allen movies sometimes and thought Take the Money and Run hilarious. This movie is not nearly as funny. In fact it isn't funny so much as confusing. I had no idea who the people were that Owen Wilson was meeting were except maybe for Hemingway, who was a writer and who wrote The Old Man and the Sea, among other books. I don't know a lot about painting and I guess some of these people were painters. It was strange that so many Americans were just driving around Paris in the middle of the night for no reason. Why were they in Paris anyway? Never explained. I couldn't figure out why Owen Wilson would get in a car full of these people, although he seemed to know them all for another unexplained reason. That was pretty unbelievable. He just happened to recognize all of them but I never heard of them if their famous. It didn't make sense and I guess the time travel thing was all in his head. Owen Wilson is pretty funny in most movies, like Night at the Museum and Marley and Me but he just was boring in this movie. I think a lot of that has to do with Woody Allen. He didn't give his actors anything funny to say or do. He just expects us all to know who these people are and if we don't he tries to make us feel dumb. Well, like I said, I don't follow painting and so I didn't get a lot of the jokes because of that. I laughed twice during the whole movie which isn't good. I go to movies a lot and am a pretty big film buff but this just went way over my head and most people won't understand as much as I did unless they are college teachers or trivia experts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gil (Wilson) accompanies his girl friend Inez (McAdams) and her parents to Paris, France. All want to see everything, taste wine everywhere and go here and there except Gil, who is writing a novel. He wants to recapture the essence of Paris of the 1920s by going for walks and is picked up by a 1920s Peugeot taxi and is greeted by F. Scott Fitzgerald and another time by t.s. eliot. Through them Gil is introduced to Hemingway, Monet, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, Picasso, Djuna Barnes, and Alice B. Toklas. How good is that?]Woody Allen would probably have starred in this but he felt a younger man who had a whining voice like his was needed and Owen Wilson was perfect. And, he was right.This is the most creative movie I have seen since Forest Gump and Inkheart.The movie starts with some very beautiful scenes of Paris: parks, gardens, the Arch, the Eiffel tower, street scenes with and without it raining. Allen took his time with this and we are all grateful for it. Very nice.As we get into the story we are not sure how Gil transfers into the past. We see the taxi and Gil gets in and then he is in the 1920s. At first we think he may have been dreaming,or like Alice who found a rabbit hole, and, well we really don' t know the answer to that one. That's Woody Allen's secret. But, there Gil is hob-nobbing with all the great writers and painters of the time. Funny that they never mention the different clothes he wears. At some point he does say he is from the year 2010, and that doesn't seem to elicit any real emotion from anyone as they accept it. He does give Zelda Fitzgerald a valium to keep her calm to not commit suicide; and again the valium is questioned but accepted.The only good funny line I found in here was when Hemmingway asks Gil if he hunts. Gil replies, "only for bargains." But, it is Adrianna (Cotillard) who realizes she is in the 1920s but prefers the 1890s where she and Gil are now in the Moulin Rouge and she introduces Gil to Toulouse-Lautrec, Matisse, and Gauguin. Is it that we find the past more exciting to live in than our present and is it that we don't appreciate what we have in our present? Or are we too quick to forget about the past? Am glad Gil didn't meet any real philosophers as I would really be lost. (Indeed)I want to tell you about the detective Eniz's father (Fuller) hired to follow Gil as he felt Gill was up to more than walking the streets of Paris for inspiration for his novel. I want to tell you but I cannot. You have to see that for yourself. HA ! Yes, it is a funny moment. Can't say more. This is excellent, quite engaging and very creative. Allen's tribute to the arts and to Paris, France. (9/10) Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No Language: No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-written script and outstanding acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I have been a fan of Woody Allen for many years and that his works in many way reflects the how we aspire to live. With beautiful settings in the early 1920's and late 1800's, the movie gives a cinematic taste what would a night-out be like (dancing, spirited dialogues, and perhaps an emphasis on creating of era-changing artworks). The message is clear: disliking the present leads to nostalgia; Allen did mention earlier in the movie " nostalgia is the denial of painful present". But how far- back can one go to find his/her "perfect" place/time to live life. Audience may be faced with choosing the story to be taking the short-cut (not braving to tackle present's challenges) or go along with a worry-free lifestyle that fame and fortune are not priorities.Arts and not science, religion, nor even philosophy can provide some help as we "all fear death and question our place in the universe"; perhaps arts can salvage us from our own "despair and emptiness".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnifique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the past forty years, Woody Allen has produced, on average, one film a year. Various films have faded into obscurity, but nevertheless a great deal of his work has remained. Strangely, this last decade has seen a return to form. Allen himself admitted he has been working on the quantity theory, that 'If I keep making films... every once in a while I'll get lucky and one will come out, and that's exactly what happens'. And it certainly has happened with this.Midnight in Paris is the largest grossing Allen film to date. Continuing with his recent love and exploration of Europe, we are this time invited to the French capital, and witness not only the present day Paris but also a much rosier tinted version; the artistic boom of the 1920s. This light hearted Rom-Com laced with great one-liners centres around the main protagonist Gil (a thinly disguised Allen) who has a great admiration for the renowned city which has captured many hearts over the years. Played perfectly by Owen Wilson, Gil is a warm, idealistic dreamer and successful screenwriter who yearns for completing his first novel.Visiting France with his rather shallow, materialistic fiancée, he takes comfort not only in the beautiful Paris twilight but also some of the greatest artists to have made an impact on the 20th century. Excellently casted we are treated to the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Picasso, Salvador Dali and an intense, show-stopping Hemingway, obsessed with the beauty of truth, bravery and courage.The film may have been so successful for a number of reasons. Owen Wilson has stated he believes the film's magnetism is down to the title. Others will be wooed by the beautiful cinematography. Personally, I believe the concept of being able to jump into a golden age is something everybody has dreamt about at some point in their lives. Whether it's the 1920s or the Belle Époque, we all harbour a belief that the past was a warmer, happier and more pleasurable time to live.Superbly scored with permeating guitar strings and haunting clarinet, it captures both the Parisian vibe and the dreamer's heart, allowing the viewer to drift away to a glitzier time. Who cares if 'nostalgia is denial'. I defy anybody to view this film and not be somewhat charmed by the charismatic City of Light. As Gil knowingly states: 'the truth is, we're all in love with a fantasy'.I'm certainly in love with this film and it is without doubt one of Allen's most entrancing movies yet. Let's hope Europe continues to inspire him in the near future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love outflanks Nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a movie both frivolous and serious ? a profound fantasy. You might say a typical Woody Allen movie, but this one is one of his better attempts at serio-romantic comedy. Gil (Owen Wilson) is a Woody Allen avatar as he explores two themes, nostalgia and the meaning of love. Gil, a Hollywood screen writer who hankers to be a novelist is engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdam) but when they go to Paris with her parents Gil starts having doubts, fuelled by contact with various famous literary figures of Paris in the 20's who magically appear to Gil as he walks the streets after midnight. F Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda (Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) and numerous others all put in an appearance, most of them surprisingly ready to help Gil with his novel and his love life.Obviously you have to suspend your disbelief here ? but the portrayals of these figures by various actors, though uneven, mostly ring true. Gil may well have been dreaming but he finds that the "golden age" of Paris in the twenties is not necessarily better than today ? "nostalgia ain't what it used to be", and that love is what conquers death.Owen Wilson fits the Woody character like a glove, though Woody is not really a Hollywood hack writer. He is complemented by Marion Cotillard as Adriana, his guide through the twenties, from whom he learns about love.There is a lot of fun along the way, and some minor characters to keep us entertained such as Paul (Michael Sheen) a know-all friend of the couple and a celebrity museum guide (Carla Bruni ? President Sarkozy's spouse). Paris is also a character, photogenic, and presented in strong light for the day bits and warm yellow tones after dark. The film will certainly not discourage tourism there, at least at the deluxe end of the market ? the hotels are 5 star and limos are everywhere. The scripts sparkles - Woody seeks to entertain as well as philosophise - and here he succeeds at both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's so nice to see Owen Wilson back in his comfort zone. This is a good Woody Allen movie and Woody seems to have found a new muse in Owen. His speeches are much as you would expect Woody to speak if he were to take the role himself. Owen plays a fiancé experiencing Paris while his future family seem to just want to get out of there. Owen's character seems more interested in writing a book and becoming a Bohemian. It is these ideals that are explored and explored well......but with a twist that is quite new. The movie also showed that it is still possible to be good adult entertainment without smut, sex, profanity or violence. Recommended ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paris of Dreams and Reality...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a great fan of Woody Allen. That being said, I recognize that his filmmaking is irregular. Some films are very satisfying, will others seem like simple cinematic exercises ("Small Time Crooks", has a scene almost literally copied from an early 1960's movie with Marcello Mastroianni).If for some people Allen seems a bit too bland, movies like "Match Point" show that he has a surprising and almost nasty streak.I first started reading of this film while it was still in the final phases of production. Then was very surprised by the great reception it had in this years Cannes film festival. So I really, really wanted to see it: on the one hand, I love Paris, and also (mostly) love Allen's films, so it seemed promising.My first screening was on a flight from Madrid to Santiago a couple of months ago. Even on the tiny plane screen, I loved the atmosphere, Owen Wilson's acting and the whole premise of the film.As soon as I got home, we went with my wife and *really* enjoyed the film on the widescreen.Why?Because this film is mostly about an atmosphere and feelings. The idea of perfection, the idea of the artist and the reality that perfection can't truly be achieved...And Paris is that: a city of ideas, atmosphere and feelings. A city that has been a Mecca for artists for over 200 years. A city to walk around in and discover the most amazing places (and people).For Woody Allen, a complete New Yorker, the idea of Paris (and Europe) is certainly that: an ideal.That being said, the acting's great. Minor members of the cast really stand out (the detective with the distinctly "Bogart", film noir air) and the major members shine.It's great to see Owen Wilson in the role of Allen's alter-ego. Very vulnerable.And the actor's that portray the artist in the 20's and 30's are incredible: Luis Bu?uel, Salvador Dalí, Pablo Picasso, Gertrude Stein and so many others...So if you're a fan of Woody Allen, and of Paris, don't miss this film.And if you're *not* a Woody Allen fan, also try to see it, because it'll show you aspects of humanity that shouldn't be filmed.I guess the only people who shouldn't see the movie are those that actively dislike *both* Woody Allen *and* Paris.And certainly there aren't many of those...</fullReview>

After meeting Inez's new friends who he doesn't like he decides to take a walk. When the bell strikes midnight his life is changed. I need to begin by saying that I am not a Woody Allen fan. I have like "Match Point" and "Whatever Works" but that's about it. This is, in my opinion his best movie. While not as funny as "Whatever Works" this one is very enjoyable and is not a typical Woody Allen movie. The time travel aspect in this is very interesting and is used very well and not in a cheesy fashion at all. If I was more into literature I think parts would have been more interesting, but I really enjoyed this movie. Overall, a very light-hearted and enjoyable comedy that is one of, if not the best Woody Allen movie I have ever seen.

		<shortDescription>The golden age might be right now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film is a strange medium. No matter how hard it tries to pretend to be part of our present or conform with our sense of time ? at the end of the day, film is always a thing of the past. Whatever we see on the screen has already happened and is gone. The filmic presence is a pretended one, it is the presence of what is no longer there. A similar thing happens with time: Time on film is a very fluid thing. It can slow down and speed up, jump back and forth, be linear or run in circles. And sometimes it even defies all our attempts at grasping it, becoming an ever-changing floating entity that is never what it seems. Yet the physical presence of the moving images gives that elusive thing, time, a presence no other art can claim. Time is a toy for film to play with. In this sense (and in many others), Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris is a film about time in film, or rather about time, exploring it in a way only film can.Gil Pender is a man of the past. Not that he has the best behind him but for everything he does his inspiration lies in the past. He dreams of a golden age which for him were the 1920, especially the Paris of the 1920. The contrast between this dreamer and the world of the here and now is clear right from the start. The lost glance, the wide eyes, the constant sense of him not really being there ? Owen Wilson does not need much, a glance here, a delayed movement there, to convey the sense of someone fallen out of time. He the hectic yet meandering totally Allenesque style of speaking, those words constantly chasing themselves, with an almost trancelike perception, an elliptic interaction with the world. This "real world"is chiefly represented by his fiancé played almost painfully ordinarily by Rachel McAdams. The mundane, the pseudo- intellectual, the snobistic and utilitarian is overdone a little, yet she still serves as a good foil to Wilson's denial of what is widely regarded as real.Yet it is the real and unreal, the present and the past which come to unravel, swap places and becoming all part of a larger reality which is that of film. Suddenly Gil who dreams of his personal golden age, finds himself in the middle of it. When he gets lost in Paris and midnight strikes he gets a lift from a party in an old 1920s cars and suddenly he is right in that period. He meets Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Josephine Baker, Man Ray, Picasso, Cole Porter, has his novel read by Gertrud Stein, his relationship analysed by Hemingway and suggests film ideas to Bunuel. And, of course he falls in love. With Picasso's lover who used to be with Modigliani and Braque and , finding out that Gil is engaged, runs off with Hemingway to Africa. Marion Cotillard plays her with fragile purity for she is a dreamer, too. Her golden age is the Paris of the belle époque and when they end up there, she decides to stay.Gil, however, returns and Allen allows him (and us) a hint he might have found a soul mate right in the present. For despite all the nostalgia, it's here we must live, as Woody Allen well knows. But nonetheless, the past, the real as well as the imagined, can be as much a part of our present as dreams can roll into our reality. Maybe, our lives can be a little fuller if we allow them to be a little more than film and accept that time can be more than one thing, past and present, linear and circular, constant and ever-changing. A fairy tale that only Allen can get away with and a film about the power of the imagination and the possibility that our golden age might be just now. If only we could see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am temporarily in a situation where it Is difficult to see a film. Building the conditions to watch one properly are rare, so when you can build such a space, what film do you build it around?As with meal long deferred, most of the digestion is in the anticipation.As it happened, choices were limited, but we were lucky because in retrospective wisdom, I would have chosen this.Woody is all about yearning; knowing the worth of the true center and the anxious stuttering around it. The device is that he poses himself just at the extreme of where we are so as to reward both the truth of the vision and relative resolve of our quest. As usual, the narrative is folded: a 'Hollywood hack' intent on making something more genuine. We know ? we watchers ? that the man is emotionally rooted in Manhattan and has largely defined it for us cinematically. Sinatra can only sing about it, but he invented the antidote city: Las Vegas.Also, we know that Woody is filming in other world cities to escape his creative constraints. Some camera and processing technology is new as well. (And because we are up on the Hollywood component of the Marshall plan, we know that Hollywood invested in making Paris (and Rome) romantically attractive.)Storywise, we have our pilgrim encounter great artists, or at least artists, writers and filmmakers who have found an essential place in our narrative of what art is. The names alone ? without any exposure to the art itself ? carry weight. Cinematically, there is nothing more substantial than those personalities of the past who have penetrated our souls and established a ground. Nothing, that is, except the quest for love and how the gravity of the one gives fragrance to the other. A girlfriend who doesn't get this has an affair with a pedant who maintains the protections against this truth ? a bit too obviously: there are two obviously constructed scenes with this guy about confusing wives and deep, deep sexually-connected muses.When entering his films, you make allowances: that there will be reduction of the noir hero to self-effacing almost paralyzed observer. This time it isn't Woody himself, but we have to struggle a bit to get over how Owen is like and unlike the character we know Woody wrote. And as usual, the focus is on the women. Not the women themselves, but how they appear and know it. And how they use that appearance to drive energy through (alas) creative men.(How different the world would be if Yoko, Oja, and the Alices, including the one featured here had been effective in their art. I eagerly dive into the woman-driven notion of creative energy but where are the female Woodies? Miranda July? Where are the women filmmakers who can film their lovers to effect?)Anyway, Woody allows us to have fun encountering the names, putting bodies in front of them and amusing us with the simple lesson of their ordinariness. Fortunately for me, this filmmaker is predictable enough ? and the women herein performing in such familiar ways ? that the taste of the meal is a delicious before as after. I'm ready for a film that changes my life, but not today.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that spoke to moi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words fail me to describe what a joyous, extravagant, and unbelievably beautiful experience Midnight in Paris gave me. Not only did it immerse me inside its world of fantasy, whimsicality, and gentleness, but it gave me a strong superficial aspect I believe only myself, aspiring journalists, and veteran journalists will be able to extract from it. It's a close to home work of ravishing art.Owen Wilson is the Woody Allen character here. In almost every Woody Allen film, the main male character connects in some way with Allen himself. This time we supposedly see the romantic version of Woody who is shy, naive, and unassuming in his destiny to "make things click." Wilson plays Gil, a self-proclaimed "hack" Hollywood screenwriter who has been working on a novel his fiancée Inez (McAdams) has dubbed "a romantic daydream." They are visiting Paris with Inez's parents, and Gil is desperately seeking motivation to finish his novel at the same time bask in the glory of his favorite city in the world.One night, Gil takes a walk and as soon as the clock strikes midnight he becomes ultimately transported into his nostalgic fantasy, 1920's Paris. The transportation isn't the cartoony skit we would've thought. It happens instantaneously, without any clear change except for the setting and the characters. He meets many of his idols including F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.After having one night of incredible, indescribable circumstances, Gil takes another midnight walk the next day to be transported back to the 20's. Over time, he falls in love with the lovely Adrianna (Cotillard), who is dating Pablo Picasso. Adrianna is everything Inez isn't. Tolerable, easygoing, and supportive of his work. Inez seems to preoccupied after running into an old College flame shortly in their trip.Being an aspiring journalist, Midnight in Paris spoke to me using words that would be void of meaning if came from an actual person. Here's a man that escapes reality by visiting a time period he was never able to experience, talking to his idols he never got to know personally. I would love to go to the eighties and nineties and see my personal idols like Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Gene Siskel, Kevin Smith, and John Waters in action during their heyday.But I digress. Inez's College flame pokes fun at Gil's unconditional love for nostalgia calling it "denial." Nostalgia isn't denial to me. It's more of a period appreciation complimented with a wish for it to return and a subtle pessimism because one may think great, landmark things won't be able to be achieved in the present. We all know that is untrue, but look at the eighties and all the political and pop culture accomplishments and tell me they're inferior to those of today. I suppose if we're talking the technological field they are, but it was more simplistic and more basic. Everything is so difficult now almost everywhere you look.This brings me to my next point. The film works as a form of escapism for literary writers. Think of it this way; Gil is in love with the period of the twenties in Paris and the idols that came out of it. He probably dreamt up his own fantasies with Hemingway and others before meeting them in person. When he finds them in real life, it's his own way of writer escapism. Some writers take more unhealthy practices such as drinking and drug use, but Gil frolics with Ernest and F. Scott. Maybe Woody Allen does in his dreams as well. Who wouldn't want to hear their idols' thoughts on their work in present day? As for the film itself, the art direction and acting, especially from Wilson, is effervescent, welcomed, and extraordinary. The opening sequence, which clocks in at almost four and a half minutes, features beautiful music and a slideshow of footage from Paris. It doesn't feel like a postcard as much as it does a scenic foreshadowing to the events we are about to be blessed with. Owen Wilson has also proved that when given the proper script and character he can be a marvelous and compelling character actor.I fell in love with Midnight in Paris early on for its excellent commentary on modernism vs. nostalgia factors. I became even more sold when the film decided to become close to home for me when discussing writing styles and escapism. Woody Allen has proved himself worthy of the title "cinema genius" with this after a string of films critics and audiences found mediocre to fair. Here, it is the direct opposite. Critics were overjoyed and most audiences were astounded. Some people need to just step out in the rain once in a while. Midnight in Paris is the film that makes you.Starring: Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, Carla Bruni, and Michael Sheen. Directed by: Woody Allen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic idea lazily brought to screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me clear this out right off the bat: I am a big-time Woody Allen fan. His 60s and 70s comedies are classics for the ages and his slightly more serious reflections on love and relationship (Annie Hall, Manhattan, etc) are seminal works. With Midnight in Paris, Allen comes back in shape and it's about time as he did hit a couple of road bumps in the last decade or so (or didn't hit it off, so to speak, with reviewers and audience alike). MIP starts ? la Manhattan with long, steady shots of Paris by day and night accompanied by appropriate music. The idea is brilliant: a nostalgic and disgruntled writer, Gil (Owen) accidentally travels in time to the exact time period he is longing for, 1920s Paris. There he meets all his literary gods and goddesses and thinks himself in paradise, especially when compared to his present (2010) life of engagement to an incompatible woman (McAdams), frustrated ambitions, etc. He meets his destiny with Adriana (Cotillard) who herself longs for La Belle Époque, 1900s Paris. The epiphany comes when Gil alone realizes that the grass is always greener from afar, etc, and other fortune cookies pseudo-truism. Breaking the engagement and moving to Paris, he meets his truer destiny with Gabrielle (Seydoux) and all is well. The problem with MIP is that the script is merely brought to life and image as it appears that the auteur did not know what to do with it, or how to extract some juice off Gil's travels. Allen does not travel himself beyond postcard Paris and Psychology for Dummies blurbs. The beginning of the movie is so promising (long uncut takes of Gil and his fiancée, languorous pans to follow the protagonists). MIP goes on with eery college filmmaking of shot/counter-shot of stale dialogues where top talent actors seem to be wasted: they do not appear to improvise so much as they read from a cue card. By the end females are clueless to what happened to them and Gil asserts his independence. OK, vintage Allen. Is MIP a failure? Yes, partially at least. And fully overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Nostalgic Woody Allen Charmer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard the lead character of "Midnight in Paris" talk, I thought it was Woody Allen talking. But when I looked at the screen, I saw Owen Wilson! I do not know if Owen was purposely doing it, but he was channeling Woody Allen perfectly in intonation and diction. Maybe it was the characteristic style Woody Allen wrote his script, I don't know but it was so uncanny and this added to my enjoyment of this film."Midnight in Paris" is about a movie scriptwriter and struggling novelist Gil (Owen Wilson) who was trapped in a stifling relationship with his snooty fiancée Inez (Rachel Mc Adams). This becomes more evident during their supposedly romantic vacation in Paris, when Inez spending more time with her snobbish parents and her "pseudo- intellectual pedantic" male friend Paul (Michael Sheen). To escape, Gil takes a midnight walk in the side streets of Paris, and was magically transported to the 1920s where he encounters his literary heroes like Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates). He also meets and falls in love with Pablo Picasso's muse Adriana (Marion Cotillard). How Gil faces and resolves this unusual situation is the unique premise of this delightful little Woody Allen masterpiece."Midnight in Paris" is a very charming movie. It is about yearning for something much better than what you have now. It had me from the get- go, very interesting right away. The initial five minutes of beautiful Parisian scenes and music will put you in the proper mood right away and never let you go. People who loves literature and the arts will certainly share Gil's excitement and fascination about actually meeting these authors in the flesh. Cameos by Dali (a funny turn by Adrien Brody), Fitzgerald, Bunuel, Matisse, and even Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas and Gauguin further add to the nostalgia. I have some quibbles only about Gil finding Adriana's book, but that is minor. Only Woody Allen can make an off-the-wall movie like this and get away with it! A definite must-watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweetly sentimental movie with an excellent cast and script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's script is an impressive one. One that he clearly took his time with. Midnight in Paris features an impressive cast of characters, an array of interesting sub plots, and a very sweet sense of nostalgia. The sequences of the roaring 20's after midnight are magical stuff set up with care by Allen. They balance sentimentality, comedy, romance, and drama on perfect keel. The movie places us under an irresistible spell, and the whole thing just flies by, never getting boring.The way that Allen also writes his characters is wonderful stuff, and his incredible ensemble cast (Including Owen Wilson, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Corey Stoll, Michael Sheen, and especially Alison Pill... the list goes on) bring out the most of their characters with total conviction. In particular, Adrien Brody has a hilarious cameo as a rhinoceros obsessed Salvador Dali.The backdrop of Paris only heightens the movie's charm. Allen begins the film with a lovely, but somewhat draggy, four minute montage of the city, but I can't deny that it's a nice way to establish ambiance. Allen chooses fascinating aesthetic styles to further enhance the movie's nostalgic effect. The element that truly brings this out is Darius Khondji's cinematography, which Allen wanted to have a very wide range of warm colors to give a very flattering light. The color spectrum is gorgeous, no less than such a city as Paris deserves.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorites of 2011 so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, how about I start this review in a classic way, by promoting the film. Ladies and gentleman this is a movie directed and written by none other than Woody Allen. Just to give you a short resume of his, he has won an Academy Award for Best Director for Annie Hall and has earned another 5 nominations for Best Director. He has won 2 Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay for the movies Annie Hall and Hannah and Her Sisters. He has been nominated another 12 times for this award. He also has a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, also for Annie Hall. I think you can figure out a conclusion from all I just mentioned in this paragraph.Now to get into the film. This is a beautiful romantic comedy, and probably the best I've seen all year. Owen Wilson gave one of his best performances ever, but I still do not consider it Oscar material. Michael Sheen as Paul Bates probably gave his best performance of the year. But, to be honest, all of the actors that worked on this project were great in their roles. Also I thought the script was great, beautiful and is probably going to gain Woody Allen his 15th Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. For me, it is the best screenplay of the year so far.OK, now I usually don't say this but Owen Wilson does not deserve Rachel McAdams(talking about the characters). He deserves better than that broad. Just wanted to mention this.One of the things I really liked was Adrien Brody's cameo appearance. What, his name is written alongside the other main characters of the film?! NOPE. His screen time was exactly 3 minutes and 25 seconds. But I have to say, he was one of my favourite things about this film. I just laughed the whole time he was on screen.To sum up this is a great film and surely one of the best of 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Love Poem to Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris My experience of this film is of a beautifully presented love poem to Paris, lovely, delightful, introduced at its outset through sensitive cinema portraits of the City accompanied by Sidney Bechet's affectionate call and response duet, gently carrying us along, saying, 'Abide with me, Gentle Viewer - This is a love story'. I understand that the story-teller's art may emphasize Plot, Character, or Setting, in any combination of related qualities, with blend and emphasis varying throughout the work. While there is sufficient plot in this narrative to carry the armchair viewer along, I'm thinking that the story line in our film serves mainly as a supporting vehicle, providing a milieu lending meaning to the essential spirit of the piece: the author's delight in Paris, his desire to share his sense of wonder in the art, culture, history, the spirit of the city and its people. Plot and Character are minimal interests here; this is a work celebrating its Setting, the Social and Cultural Environment of the City of Paris. As an artist's purpose is through their craft to stimulate in the viewer, listener or reader an experience sympathetic with their own, our author and director was thoroughly successful with me; I come from this experience now, in love with Paris. I am eager to share this film with friends. Thank you, Mr. Allen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magic of Mr.Cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen aka Mr.Cinema proves his supremacy yet again in his recent critical &amp; commercial smash 'Midnight in Paris'. Allen, LIKE ALWAYS, delivers a magical film, that takes imagination &amp; passion to a new level. I sometimes wonder, minus Allen, would've Cinema ever explored it's actual beauty?'Midnight in Paris' centers on a small group of Americans visiting the French capital for business and pleasure. The protagonist, a screenwriter, is forced to confront the shortcomings of his relationship with his fiancée and their divergent goals due to his magical experiences in the city beginning each night at midnight.'Midnight in Paris' explores themes of nostalgia and modernism. Allen this time takes us to a joyride he believes will be akin to a roller-coaster ride, and o boy, it turns out to be just that. 'Midnight in Paris' is one of his Greatest Films to date, because it's a magical story, that is so well-told. Allen brings in characters he likes to watch, and presents them the way they should be. He justifies them beautifully via dialogue &amp; executes their journey with great imagination. Allen is in top-form!Performance-Wise: Owen Wilson makes a wonderful protagonist &amp; he delivers one of his best performances in here. Rachel McAdams has NEVER been so good before. Marion Cotillard is a delight to watch, as always. Michael Sheen is appropriate. Carla Bruni is charming. Kathy Bates leaves a mark. Adrien Brody appears in a very brief role. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Midnight in Paris' is Allen Cinema at it's very best! Now, We're Talking Cinema!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Midnight in Paris" is different from the most recent Allen's stories, such as "Match Point" (telling about class), or "Vicky Cristina Barcelona&#x200b;" (as celebratory about being hit by a European city). It is a well crafted fable about romance and the pleasures had when idealizing another artist's era. "Midnight in Paris" is truly charming and intelligent. The pseudo-cultured and provincial are perfectly rendered by Inez and her parents John and Helen. Actors Kurt Fuller&#x200b; and Mimi Kennedy&#x200b; deliver excellent performances, as well as Inez's friend Paul (Michael Sheen&#x200b;). The filming location (Paris, first time in Allen's movie) gets to represent very effectively the magnificent stroll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There could be different reasons why this movie made me cry - the first reason- the collaboration between my favorite movie director and my favorite actress ( Marion Cotillard ). The second reason - that I am completely in love with Paris and magical 90 minutes in it are all I could ask for right now. The third reason - as a writer, I really felt Owen's character close. The fourth reason - every.single.quote from this movie. Woody Allen is more than a director - he's an artist, lover, Parisian, etc. The fifth reason - the plot was absolutely perfect. Beautiful. Extraordinary. I could go on, you know... So, one of these could be the reason why this movie made my cry, but I guess the truth is that the symbiosis between all of the reasons makes this movie the best 2011' film in my personal chart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistic dreaming at it's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard of this movie a few times, and always told myself I'd watch it eventually. Oddly enough, I ended up seeing it on an airplane to Costa Rica. I didn't know the actual premise, but as it revealed itself, I was engrossed immediately.Gil (Owen Wilson) is tired of writing meaningless Hollywood screenplays and wants to move to France to pursue his idealistic dream of self and literary discovery. His soon-to-be wife (Rachel McAdams) does not share the same sentiment. But they are in Paris for the time, so Gil attempts to create a sliver of his fantasy by walking the streets of Paris in search of inspiration. He ends up at a street corner at Midnight in Paris, where he gets a ride in a classic 1920's Model-T esque car to a party of intellectuals. Famous intellectuals of the 1920's, namely F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein.I'm a huge fan of this literary era (1920's), so of course I am going to enjoy it. But it is so much more than some kind of time travel movie. The idea that a generation that lived before us was "the time to be living" is felt by every generation, which is revealed in the film wonderfully by Gil's new love interest from his journey, Adriana (played by the always excellent Marion Cotillard). One can relate to that idea, even if they aren't fans of the artistic culture post WWI. It is a very artistic film, and all the acting is top notch in my opinion (by far my favorite Owen Wilson performance, even if he is similar to the characters he's played before, and the portrayal of Hemingway was everything that I could have expected). My favorite Woody Allen film to date, and that is a bold statement. I recommend it to anyone, but if you have a true appreciation for that period, you will love it as mush as I do without a doubt in my mind.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Love Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to disagree that Woody Allen's last few films have lacked luster but that's not a word that could be applied to this valentine to the City of Light. It's taken its own sweet time to reach these shores and having now seen it I feel it has been slightly over-hyped by both critics and acquaintances who saw it several months ago in the US. Even so there is lots to enjoy here not least the opening montage which is truly breathtaking as shot after shot of the Paris everyone knows from postcards fill the screen then, subtly, these segue into another series, the same Paris but one which you'd only really know if you've been there and wandered off the tourist trails. The plot, such as it is, wastes no time in attempting an explanation for time travel we just accept - and in most cases are happy to do so - that it is possible, wish-fulfilment is one way of looking at it - so that in effect we get two Parees for the price of one (four, if you count brief excursions to La Belle Epoque and even further back). It helps if you know or have heard of half the characters but even if you haven't it won't really impair the pleasure in this ultimate feelgood entry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Woody Allen's latest, you meet this Hollywood script writer visiting Paris with his girlfriend and her vulgar conservative parents. None of them really like the town, but the script writer keeps his nostalgic dream about the city in the 20s.And suddenly, by midnight, he is invited to the world of his dreams, there he meets Hemingway, Cole Porter, T S Eliot, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, just for a start. He also meets this girl, who instead of the 20s she's a part of, dreams of "La Belle Epoque".So what is nostalgia? A pleasant way of refusing to accept your own time and in the long run, your own life? That's the question which is put here. As always in Allen's films, in an entertaining way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is movie making at it's best! Woody Allen has made a big comeback, as far as I am concerned. I realize that some people may be unhappy with this film because there is no automatic weapon fire, no ridiculous chase scenes, very little CGI. It probably will be boring for those who enjoy that sort of thing. There are no explicit sex scenes though plenty of interesting adult situations. The scenery and music is absolutely fabulous. I didn't want to blink an eye for fear I would miss some of the most gorgeous scenes that Paris has to offer. The photography was great! Owen Wilson is absolutely fantastic, believable, and lovable. The best acting I've ever seen him do. For those who enjoy real life situations, and intelligent dialog and music, this is a movie not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've just seen his last movies you'll find Woody Allen completely unrecognisable. Midnight in Paris comes out old style. Gil (Owen Wilson) is a Californian trying to write a novel. Engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), both travel to Paris, where they visit around with a couple, Paul (Michael Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda) that Gil finds to be the most annoying, whilst Inez is completely fascinated about Paul. One night, near midnight, Gil refuses to go dancing so he decides to walk home. During his route he gets lost and sits down, the bells rings midnight and an antique car passes by. Out of there gets a man visibly drunk asking him to join him and his friends. Gil is taken to a bar where he meets personalities such as Hemingway (Corey Stoll) or F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddlestone) among others like Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo) and his mistress Adriana (Marion Cotillard), who becomes relevant to the story. To summarise, Gil travelled in time, to his beloved 1920's, changing his life completely. Obviously this feature provided many hilarious scenes, despite its huge silliness. Wilson made a very good role. Gil does not only find inspiration in the 20's for his novel, he discovers that our need (by us I mean we in the 21st century) or habit to say and think that the old times were the times, this generation is lost and the human kind his done, isn't ours, but we actually share it with all the generations since our great great parents and their great parents. I think this particular point is where this movie wins. It sure is a very stupid argument, almost childish but with Woody Allen this things end up working surprisingly well. At first it seems not to fit in the story but in the end it comes out positively. And finally I come to watch Woody Allen make a movie where you can actually understand its characters relationships. Not Woody's best for sure, but weightless, interesting and amusing. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and brilliant are just a couple words to describe this Woody Allen cinematic treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen is really one of those film guys that you either leave or take, hate or like. And, Midnight in Paris follows that exact same proposed formula. Here's a romantic-comedy that questions love and belonging with a bit of fantasy involved.Both written and directed by Woody Allen, this is a film that really engages his ideas and thoughts. We see some political talk, some romantic babble, and philosophical reasoning for belonging.I haven't seen much of any Woody Allen films (which will change!) so it's hard for me to do a comparison. But, I have seen selected clips, heard about the guy, and kind of familiar with his work. With that being said, I'm sure that Owen Wilson will remind viewers of Wood Allen to some sort of degree; I'm unsure how extreme it truly is.The comedy aspect of this film truly comes from the character development and interactions of Owen Wilson's character, Gil. Wilson fans and even those non-Wilson fans alike should enjoy. I hope. Perhaps the only problem I had with this film was the question of how Owen Wilson's character, Gil, travels in time. At first it seems to be a hallucination. But, if that's the only problem you have, just ignore it and take it for what it is.This feature is an English major's dream, especially those concentrating on American Lit.Although successful, Hollywood hack writer Gil (Owen Wilson) is on a vacation with his lovely fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy). Before we see them, a wonderful opening montage scene of Paris, France is shown to the audience. It was quite pleasant right after the opening credits. It really set the tone for the movie. Beautiful scenery and music. We then hear Gil's voice accentuating the praise for Paris by quoting something regarding how the 1920s and the rain really bring up it's beauty. Inez is not pleased.Side note: Gil kind of reminded me of a more reserved Hank Moody (David Duchovny) from Showtime's Californication.We see from the very start of the film that Inez and Gil seem to be deeply in love, but perhaps Gil loves something else entirely: Paris. Inez plans on living the American Dream in Malibu, California with hopes that Gil will continue to be a successful Hollywood screenwriter. Gil disapproves of this and dreams of settling down in Paris to write his books.****This is where the spoilers may start, so continue at your own risk.***Gil and Inez go out to a wine tasting with Inez's friends, Paul (Michael Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda). To Gil's dismay and Inez's pleasure, Paul invites them to go dancing for the evening. While Inez accepts, Gil denies, and the two split off for the rest of the night. It's obvious that Gil is frustrated by Paul's inaccurate knowledge of Paris. Gil decides to head back to the hotel, but eventually finds himself lost in an alley. Then, an old looking vehicle of some kind pulls up and insists that he joins them. He then meets those that he deems to be idols like, Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Joesphine Barker (Sonia Rolland), F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston), Zelda Fitzgerald (Alison Pill), and later on Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Pablo Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo), and Picasso's mistress Adriana (Marion Cotillard)(more on her later). You can see why an American Lit enthusiast would be overly joyous. All the aforementioned actors did a great job, with the chief mention going to Bate's portrayal of Stein. You'll see many other '1920ers' in the film too and perhaps even some famous individuals from an even earlier time.Then one night, with such exuberant excitement and by the reluctance of his fiancé, Gil urges her to join him the next time he goes "back in time" in the alley. Gil has told Inez that he has been inspired by late night walks around Paris. Inez leaves before the bells strike midnight and Inez's frustration is fueled even further. Her conservative parents are also annoyed by Gil.Gil continues to ride the old '20s vehicle every night and finds his current novel is well liked during that time. It treats him like a drug. Perhaps Gil found love in someone other than his fiancé and Paris. Adriana and Gil have an ongoing conversation throughout the film about how each of them wishes to live in a "simpler time." Being the 1920s for Gil and the late-1800s for Adriana. They come to the conclusion that nobody will ever be able to live in a time before their own. At this point in the movie I could sympathize with the main message of Woody Allen, since I too would want to have grown up in the 1980s or possibly 1990s. A time when jobs were flourishing and the radio was acceptable and when people didn't text during a personal oral conversation. I really enjoyed this message of mystery brings enlightenment by Allen. At the end of the film we see Gil walk off with a street market vendor he met earlier, Gabrielle (Léa Seydoux). They walk off in the rain and seem to spark a relationship.Woody Allen did an all-around phenomenal job with this film. I'm glad to see that he's still got it.I highly recommend you take your significant other to go and see it. Have an open-mind and enjoy some great cinema.9/10 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting lost with the Lost Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris is one of Woody Allen's better efforts over the past decade which for the most part has been repetitive and erratic. There are some bumpy moments and Allen sometimes allow his conceit to become a little too precious and stretched but Owen Wilson as his scruffy alter ego does a commendable job of playing guide to the ride to the past and Allen does a good job of disguising the outcome late into the film.Gil (Owen Wilson) is a Malibu screenwriter visiting Paris on a freebie with his fiancé's parents. Totally caught up in the past he pines for the romance of The Lost Generation and a desire to stay in the City of Lights and get caught in rain storms but squeeze Inez wants him back in sunny California churning out garbage for studios. One night, a bit tipsy, he takes a walk and gets lost. Attempting to get his bearings the clock strikes twelve and a vintage automobile pulls up with partying occupants who lure him in and back to Twenties Paris where he is introduced to the cream of the art world. He converses with the Fitgeralds, Hemingway, Picasso, Gertrude Stein among others as well as becoming infatuated with Pablo's mistress. Back in the Twenty-First Century things are becoming more abrasive with Inez and family. Gil now ponders whether he should return and remain in the previous century.Things move slowly in Midnight as Allen declares his total love for the City of Lights with a ponderous travelogue opening before going voice over into the credits to establish almost immediately the strain between Gil and Inez. Tagging along with another couple Inez keeps up her demeaning ways ad nausea until we are rescued by time travel with Gil and the Montparnesse crowd but the novelty begins to thin, that is until Gil hangs out with the Surrealists (Luis Bunuel, Man Ray and a terrific cameo turn by Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali) and the pace and humor begin to finally pick-up as Gil attempts to straighten his backbone. Allen name drops to no end with his legendary characters. Making some esoteric comic inferences such as explaining the plot of The Exterminating Angel to a confused Bunuel that may not resonate with the audience at large but one doesn't need to be up on his 20th century art and literature to find a decent amount of humor in Midnight.Owen Wilson is one of the best protagonist fits for Allen in some time but problems persist for his female characters with all three romantic interests ( Rachel McAdams, Marian Cotillard Nina Arianda) somewhat cliché and underdeveloped. Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy as the parents do a fine job of allowing Allen to get in his jabs about conservative, ugly Americans while Corey Stoll as Papa Hemingway does a wonderfully stoic take on his macho ethos. Carla Bruni, wife of French President Sarkozy appears as a translator which is probably not a bad method of getting a country's cooperation to allow you to shoot a Keatonesque slap stick scene in Versailles Hall of Mirrors. Allen has done time and space travel before. He's done it better ( Zelig, The Purple Rose of Cairo) funnier (Sleeper) and worse (Scoop) but in today's era of devalued cinema Midnight in Paris offers decent respite from the frat house moronic humor and computer generated cuddly creatures monopolizing screens at the multiplex and perhaps reinforcing our understanding of why Gil wants out of these times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ONE LINE REVIEW : Light romantic comedy as told by the master. RATING : Wait for the Instant Download (Ratings: "See it in the theater", "Wait for the Instant Download", "Don't Bother")NO SPOILERS"Midnight in Paris" finds Gil (Owen Wilson), a successful screenwriter and script doctor, on vacation in Paris with his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents (Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy). Gil is taken with the city and contemplates living there and finishing his novel. (He imagines that he was born in the wrong time and should have been in Paris when the great writers lived and worked there.) Opposed to Paris, his fiancé wants to live in Malibu while Gil works in Hollywood. Gil likes to take long walks in Paris. During one of his walks he is picked up by an antique motor car that whisks him back to the 1920's where he meets his idols and a fetching young woman, Adriana (Marion Cotillard).This is a Nice Little Picture. Owen Wilson is basically playing Woody Allen, talking out loud what goes on in Allen's head, I presume. The jokes are mild (fair and balanced jabs at Republicans and retorts about Democrats). The characters are cartoonish, even stereotypical. And it is all very charming. Gil meets F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda (the adorable Alison Pill), Picasso, Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Ernest Hemmingway, and many other colorful characters. They all give Gil advice on what it is to be an artist.About the only thing I actually hated was Allen's explanation of the point of the film. We get a close up of Gil's face as he reasons it all out for us. I think most people who watch this film will be able to do the reckoning that is necessary to appreciate the message. My good friend Martin Bennett taught me the phrase "on the nose" ? which is used when a writer has a character express their emotions for the audience. I hesitate (twice) to judge Woody Allen (who puts out a film about once a year), but I really think he should have let us take the message home ourselves, rather than dishing it out in stark terms.I liked this film, and I recommend it as a home viewing because it is classic Woody Allen. He plays here with time travel and gives no explanation of how it works ? it is just the magic of Paris. And that is fine with me, and I think it will be fine with you as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something very surprising about Woody Allen films is that you never even know when they're released......let alone even know he's directing them. The past three Woody Allen movies i have seen have all been great, and it strikes me as odd to see that his movies are not highly publicized. I mean, the guy has been directing movies for almost 30 years now. You would figure that his movies would be everywhere.Once again, Woody Allen has impressed the hell out of me. He does such an amazing job of taking something so simplistic, and making it beautiful and extraordinary. The main character Gil, played by Owen Wilson (who i normally hate, but actually liked in this movie), is a struggling writer who walks the streets of Paris at night, and is somehow thrown back in time each night and has chance encounters with some of the most notable artist and writers of that time period. I know it may sound somewhat bazaar, but Allen sells it in the most entertaining fashion.Confronting Dali, Hemmingway, Picaso, Scott Fitzgerald, T.S. Elliot.....these are all people who appreciate the arts dream of conversing with. Allen knows this, and creates this romantic yet humorous cloud around each of these chance encounters. If you have any appreciation for the arts or fine literature, you will love the set-up of this movie.As far as acting, it's pretty damn good. I know earlier i said how i normally hate Owen Wilson but i loved him this picture. But the real bread winner in this movie is Marion Cotillard. In the past, Woody has always done a fine job of making his lead female 'oh so' very seductive and erotic. The writing for her character is there......but Marion took it and did something truly incredible with it. Every frame she was in made my mouth fall flat to the floor. The way she spoke and the way she evoked emotion with her eyes......it was almost too much for me to handle. Im my opinion, she is the front runner for best actress so far this year.Bottom Line.....it was a very enjoyable piece of work. One of the best i have seen so far this year. Since this movie wasn't heavily publicized, it felt like discovering a little gem that not everyone knows about, and it makes it a little more fun. And in the long run, i think that's why Woody doesn't go for the main stream theater.....he goes for the romance of watching a movie. And this movie definitely proves that point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A broken down one trick pony that should have been taken out the back and shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Annie Hall 40 years ago, Woody Allen constructs a scene in which he and Dianne Keaton are standing in line for a movie listening to an obnoxious idiot in front of them discussing media guru Marshall Mcluhan. Woody's character can't resist himself and confronts the idiot trying to put him right on Mcluhan's view. The argument escalates. Woody settles the argument by dragging Mcluhan into the scene from off camera and having Mcluhan finish the argument and put the idiot in his place. Woody steps up to the camera and says, "boy, if life were only like this." It's one of the most memorable scenes in the film.Fortunately, in Annie Hall, the film moves on from that one trick, amusing and entertaining through it was.In Midnight in Paris, a variation of the trick is resurrected, the trick is performed, but the movie doesn't move on once the trick is over.20 minutes or so into the film, Owen Wilson's character, Gil, is out for a midnight stroll and eventually finds himself meeting F. Scott Fitzgerald in a club. Yes, amusing and an interesting premise. But ... that's it. That's pretty much the entire film. Owen going for midnight strolls in Paris and meeting famous characters from the 1920s and other eras. The Fitzgeralds, Hemingway, Picasso, Dali, and on and on an on ad infinitum. If they were famous and in Paris back in the 1920s, you'll find them recreated in this film. But that's it. Sure, they inevitably help a little in resolving his feelings about his fiancé. And Gertrude Stein makes a few useful suggestions as to how Gil can improve his novel. But the entire film is a one-trick pony thats done its single trick long before the first 30 minutes are up and then spends the next hour just repeating the trick. I spent the next hour wondering what the point of the final hour actually was. The whole thing could have been done in a 30 minute episode of the Twilight Zone and saved us a very painful evening. My wife gave up and read a book after 45 minutes. I should have done the same and saved myself the agony of watching the final 10 minutes. Without giving away the plot, let's just say the ending deteriorates into the kind of story line with the love interest that I would have expected one of my 10 year old students to have come up with.What a stinker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "old" Woody was better than the "new" Woody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MIP has some delightful moments but for the most part it's a disappointment in several ways. Woody Allen's earlier films, notably Love and Death (his best) were truly funny. He blended Marx Brothers slapstick with some genuine wit and gag humor and biting satire.Now we have the "new" Woody, somewhat pretentious in his gray days, trying to mine old territory -- angst, neuroses, etc. -- but failing by not being very funny. Comedy is what reveals the human soul but here in MIP we merely get character sketches that may look good on paper but do not translate well to celluloid. Speaking of which, the camera Woody used to shoot this movie was terrible, producing artificial colors and failing to capture the charm of Paris, though he tried hard in the opening sequence. Soft pastel, less vivid imagery would have worked so much better.Further, Woody badly misses the mark by pining for a "Golden Age" that was mediocre at best. Hemingway, Fitzgerald, et. al. were all second-raters (even Hemingway wrote bad Hemingway and is parodied to this day, which denotes his second-tier status). The 1920's may have been the gilded age in terms of wealth but when it comes to art, Woody was off by at least 30 years and might have found more inspiration from the Victorian Era and 19th Century when the true greats of literature and the other arts -- i.e., Dickens, Hardy, Eliot, Beethoven, Verdi, Goethe to name but a few -- stood well above anyone who lived and worked in the 20th Century.As for the lead, Owen Wilson is all wrong for the part, but it's not his fault. Woody reworked the script to flesh out Wilson's character and therein lies in the problem. In his earlier films, Woody played the protagonist as financially struggling, angst- and guilt-ridden, a neurotic nebbish who knows that 2+2=4 but nonetheless worries about it constantly. Here, Wilson is rich, has rich would-be relatives and therefore has no money or status concerns. He's just a romantic, WASPish, hardly sympathetic or interesting, and he does not invite empathy. We don't really care about him like we did with Woody's earlier main characters who tried to come to grips with "the meaning of life." As for the other characters, they come off more like caricatures rather than real people. Hemingway is played strictly as parody (perhaps there is no other way to play him), and the Fitzgeralds were neither interesting nor likable. Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) is largely wasted.Woody won an Oscar for a screenplay that was occasionally witty and clever but wit and cleverness are not enough. What was needed was more whimsy, drollery and belly laughs. MIP instead pokes you in the ribs now and then but not enough to elicit more than a smile now and then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Awful Stuck In The Head Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Midnight in Paris unbelievable, unappealing, and unapproachable. Woody Allen's imprint is all over this movie, but his fantasy theme failed to carry over onto the movie screen. The dialogue and scenes were dissociated from any emotional connection and became more of visual and auditory reading of Woody Allen's own mental musings. He failed to capture the intense flavor and rhythm of Paris, insisting on his scripted words. He had Gil (performed by Owen Wilson) becoming a one-dimensional, monotone character who remains in an oblivious state throughout the movie. Add to Gil's unappealing character, an even more obnoxious fiancé who can't even be made to appear sexually seductive even needed. How can these two characters be together in the first place? This relationship is a mere a plot device, adding to the absurdity of the movie. Later Gil meets Adrianna played by Marion Cotillard's (the most important relationship) whose wonderful and delightful character watches helplessly with fewer script lines as Owen Wilson's character remains blank to the different surroundings that he takes in so nonchalantly at odds with the circumstances. If only Wooden Allen had made Marion Cotillard the primary character, then perhaps her performance or character itself might have been able to carry the movie sufficiently to make it bearable to watch. As it is, Gil unintentionally becomes a parody of the comedic Jerry Lewis or Don Knott's idiot character appearing as witless lout who cannot possibly be this amazing, creative writer.By a small stretch of the imagination, it seems like the characters in Midnight in Paris are, at times, just following Woody Allen's direction in a stylistic, deliberate way that don't reflect any authentic performance, many appearing as robotic on the screen. If only Gil had been inebriated or Woody Allen had incorporated Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone (1959-1964, television series), the movie might have been more approachable as a fantasy. The needed suspension of belief required in a fantasy is made even more difficult with Kathy Bate's character being like Kathy Bates. Even in her beginning scene seems as if she was reading her lines off a cue card or teleprompter. Midnight in Paris is scattered throughout with dialogue with so much lofty intellectual mumbo-jumbo as if being spoken from a script ? or lifted from the old live radio theater which doesn't really transfer well onto film. There are the sudden shifts from modern-day Paris to the past and back against without any of mysterious, mesmerizing blending of eeriness. Over a quarter century earlier, director Fred Haines successfully created a more haunting, subtle, mystically surrealistic movie adaptation of Herman Hesse's Steppenwolf (1974).Woody Allen introduces extras like the zombie walking man pushing a hand-cart that only heightens the wooden feeling of and detachment of the movie. There's an irrelevant dog extra scene, an unnecessary stealing from the wife's jewelry case scene. There's the inclusion of the underdeveloped private investigator scenes that only serve Woody Allen's need to arrive at a more surprisingly common place American ending. Such devices are more the stuff of Peter Seller's slapstick comedy The Pink Panther (1963) instead of Woody Allen's more sophisticated romantic comedy New York-style. He then misses such opportunities of tapping into the magical appearance of a horse carriage. When it only takes an extra with brief scenes as a shop girl to carry the aliveness of the entire scene, her brief realness and easy flowing portrayal only serves to emphasize how lost and empty most of the main characters have become, especially Gil. Woody Allen's script only offers tantalizing glimpses of a multitude of famous people from the past, but they only seem to be inserted as cute cameos. The whole movie ends up to be drops of tid-bit fragments ? of what psychologists would define as "loosening of associations" often associated with manic patients (Trzepacz and Baker, 1993). In a way, this movie is reminiscent of the award winning California Suite (1978) written by Neil Simon that didn't connect well with the audience or of the adapted screenplay movies Noises Off (1992) or Chorus Line (1985) neither of which transferred well to the movie screen.In some ways, Woody Allen's script is stuck in the past that is both predictable and not as spontaneously charming as it should be. Woody Allen continues passing up opportunity after opportunity to create a more gripping, raw, and compelling relational, morally intriguing movie. Instead he offers up only an odd and confusing choice between Gil's fiancé and Andrianna where there is really no suspense nor build up. Much more compelling and engaging movies are the more thought provoking Anthony Hopkins' Slipstream (2007), the more daring stark play-as-a-movie Dogville (2004), or more recent complex sci fi action romance Inception (2010). A better time travel movie that retains its charm is Kate &amp; Leopold (2001) or the less well known Time After Time (1979) or The Lake House (2006) each of these movies having more appeal possessing captivating adventure and energy. Midnight in Paris instead is distance, jumping through haphazard scenes, underdeveloped plots, and character much like an unfinished jig saw puzzle that still leaves hundreds of individual or grouped pieces scattered about making the movie a disaster. Instead I would check out Time Bandits (1981), Pleasantville (1998), The Time Traveler's Wife (2009), Somewhere in Time (1980), Back to the Future (1985) or Peggy Sue Got Married (1986). Even the animated Caroline (2009) or Spirited Away (2001) offers similar but more involved, enchanting fantasies or a movie with the same foreign flavor and love essence, A Man and A Woman (1966) quietly dazzles and enriches with an intimately involving relationship.</fullReview>

The only plus is there are really pretty actresses, but even that's not enough to justify this waste of good film.An old premise, magically living in another time. See "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" . No character development. Big star cameos that add nothing except to impress you with the drawing power of Woody Allen's name. Allen is long past his prime. The music is bad and too loud, did I say the actresses are very pretty. Watch TV ,read a book or go for a walk just don't watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Allen outing, his best after Matchpoint.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"That's what the present is. It's a little unsatisfying because life is unsatisfying.": GilMovie opens with a loving &amp; surreal montage of Paris with honeyed Saxophone playing in the background and bam! You are lost. Woody Allen's Midnight In Paris is mystical, risible, wistful and nervously romantic movie which makes you fall in love with Paris. This is Woody Allen at its best, finally giving life to his nostalgic reflection and mesmerizing us with the romanticism of characters.Gil, our Protagonist here (very aptly played by Owen Wilson) is a dissatisfied Hollywood screenwriter and a failed novelist from Beverly Hills. He's accompanying his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents in Paris for a holiday. Gil is actually a laid-back materialization of Allen's persona. He is fervently in love with everything pertaining to Paris. He has always been nostalgic &amp; moony also. Gil regards era of 1920s in Paris as a golden period of History and strongly desires to have lived in that era when all the prominent artists, writers &amp; musicians of the world donned the streets &amp; clubs of Paris. Gil after years of perpetual dissatisfaction as a no-substance Hollywood screenwriter is also trying to pen a novel.As per his usual, Mr Allen provides us with a very diverse and occupying mix of supporting cast. Inez is an all-about shopping for priceless chairs girl, who is completely gaga over a pedantic know-it-all professor "Paul", who starts his every sentence with a conceited "If I'm not mistaken" remark. And as if that isn't enough, Gil has to endure his uptight soon to be in-laws also. One evening at midnight, disheartened by his humdrum life, Gil decides to bail on Inez to walk alone. What unravels next is a magical experience you wouldn't have even dreamt of. Revealing anything more than this will be a cruel act of depriving you of the pleasures of elegant surprises. But I still can't stop myself from spilling out "some" beans namely Fitzgerald, Hemingway &amp; Picasso.Coming to the technical aspects of the movie, everything from direction to soundtrack was first-rate with Classic Allen written all over it. Cinematography was awesome; it was not just an expression when I wrote that movie is going to make you fall in love with Paris. No complaints for the casting and acting department also, you couldn't have selected a better cast ensemble than this. Marion Cotillard was lovely as a confused French beauty &amp; Owen Wilson was at his hilarious best as Gil.In the end, Midnight In Paris is a lyrically crafted fable about romance, nostalgia and pleasures which leaves you feeling rhapsodic.http://flickyfriday.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/midnight-in-paris-2011/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just What the Doctor Ordered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked every single little thing about Midnight in Paris. Woody Allen, one of the most astonishingly prolific writer-directors in American film history, after a consecutive string of anxiety-induced dramas about the cruel indifference of life, he has finally given release to a well-deserved and surprising reflection. Believe me, reflection is the right word. Without compromising his signature melancholy longing, Woody has woven an utterly breezy, life-affirming and still personal and hilarious comedy, populated by a charming and sometimes joyfully surprising cast who look to be enjoying themselves, and the buzz is infectious. In a now rare ecstatic mood, he daydreams about youth and the excitement a young writer urgently wants to preserve before it becomes smothered in the dehumanizing daily grind, takes that stress and calmly, confidently drifts into a world he romanticizes with such warm, savory atmosphere and a true master's storytelling economy, and coming to a perfectly aimed close, where the story should and must end, and with tidy reconciliation it does, and boy, do we hate coming back to reality when the lights go up.As per his usual, Woody provides one more couple at the apex of marriage and finds conflict in that universal clash between security and passion. Hollywood screenwriter Gil and fiancée Inez have accompanied her parents to Paris and the excursion shows up their differences in a most prickly manner. She's all about shopping for priceless chairs while he wants to take midnight saunters in the rain. Indeed, he loves Paris so much he wants to move there, an idea she rejects like he's nuts. Meanwhile, she grows impressed by an conceited, know-it-all professor, who precludes every pontification with "if I'm not mistaken," the satire being that his enlightenments are usually untrue. One evening at midnight, dismayed by the seeming trajectory of his life, Gil bails on her to walk alone. As he sits down to pull himself together, an antique car drives up.Revealing any more would be a cruel deprivation of your pleasure taken by the amazing grace of the film's fluid, elegant surprises. The crisp pace, firm cutting and old-fashioned invisible style leave you longing for more as the movie whooshes by in 94 minutes of enchanting pleasure, what they always meant when they used to say "movie magic." The indomitable soundtrack includes some of Cole Porter's most remarkable songs. The smart period and present-day chic wardrobe and sumptuously arranged interiors are also entitled to year-end awards acknowledgment. Woody, who claims indifference to his work so frankly, clearly takes delicate care of the filming of his stories.Characters in his 42nd film, aside from but not exclusive of Gil himself, have a sole crucial attribute which really provides the actors scope to have loads of fun with their roles. The ensemble is enormously exuberant in their typecast character parts. Cotillard is the right choice for the charming pixie-like spirit who distills and unravels Gil's passion, but McAdams has the high-maintenance modern young American woman down pat. She is the ideal distillation of how most of Europe views us, and brings real emotions to Inez that inspire our genuine reactions. No surprise. Woody's invariably above marginalizing female roles.Surprise is in the welcome familiar faces we stumble upon throughout. Adrien Brody's priceless take on a certain Spanish cultural icon, for instance, is delectably memorable. But it's a gem in a convention of gems. Wilson is Woody's best-ever casting of someone else to personify his customary self-doubting and hung-up character. Expressing obsessive sentiment with witty jousting and the ubiquitous dread of death are consistent with the deep-rooted Allen opus. You surprisingly don't wish he were a young Woody instead as he injects lots of wide-eyed ingenuousness along with just the right dash of the director's classic nebbish.Wilson makes Gil so genuine, so keen, about his hero worship of the experiences he's mysteriously introduced to. He can't believe them, the refreshing humility and worldly genius of them. Essentially, he's leading with his nose here. Both it and his performance are engagingly bent, as is commented on subtly in the most brilliant in-joke manner in Brody's scene. That's it. Starting now, no more spoilers of any kind. This is hard for me, but necessary. The trailers don't spoil it, but now the reviews are everywhere and audiences have flocked to it. But by jove I'm doing my part to preserve it for whatever it's worth.I think of aged burgundy or antique clocks in regard to the spirit of this hilarious and exciting little film. It begins with a montage of postcard-worthy tableaux of the City of Lights in the sunlight, in the rain, and then in the sunlight again. It's a musing, a reverie, clearly. But what gives it such an ebullient sense of wonder is its eternal central theme. The story, in its clear-cut but understated way, proposes that no matter what period we're in, we take its value for granted. So we reflect and see superior days gone by. And yesteryear, naturally, is a discriminatory daydream. Allen's profound esteem for the film's deliciously romantic universe doesn't stop him from giving it an old comic pro's joshing as well. It all works self-assuredly and sublimely on its own conditions.One would think some moviegoers might be baffled by this annual release from the filmmaker, just as they deeply are by one out of your average three Woody Allen films, since cultural literacy is hardly ever brought to the movies anymore, to say the least. And yet, it's success in theatres is wonderful. Perhaps in an economy like this, just as screwball romantic comedies were celebrated in the Depression, this is the pure ideal for what the movies need more of right now. So many moviegoers take Allen for granted, though Midnight in Paris has and will captivate even the most worn-out old-hand moviegoers. There's nothing not to love about it. Either you relate to it or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a big Woody Allen fan I haven't missed any of his releases of the past 10 years, however I must admit that some of his recent works have failed to impress me.It is a completely different story with this one - mesmerizing and magic, inspiring and inspirational, sad and happy, charming and breathtaking - it is all of those and more. My only regret is that I have waited so long since its release to watch it! Owen Wilson is absolutely brilliant in the role and Adrian Broody as Salvador Dali deserves a special mention.Mr Allen, that deserves a major round of applause. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody's Wild Strawberries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen can utilize his satire to be original, his romantic comedy to stimulate, and his drama to make a point. Midnight in Paris is shaped by his vision of a Bergman style drama. His obsession with Bergman extends to his movies where he cracks jokes about his love for the Swedes. In Bananas (1971), Woody Allen becomes President of San Marcos and declares that the official language be Swedish. This is no doubt an homage to Ingmar Bergman, a writer/director who has more influence on Woody Allen's film career than anyone. This style is formed around tortured characters who live out their internal struggle by reliving past and fictional memories. When I saw that Rachel McAdams hair is blonde in Midnight in Paris, I thought, with a smirk on my face, "Ingrid Thulin."Woody Allen's 41st movie is Midnight in Paris (2011). It's aroma is of The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985) mixed with hints of Deconstructing Harry (1997). The Purple Rose of Cairo comparison comes from the want of a character to be in another time. This template usually starts by defining two realities, which we will separate into the crushing reality of existence and the illusions. The crushing reality comes in contact with the illusions, be it the allure of stars of film characters in classic cinema (The Purple Rose of Cairo) or the nostalgia of 1920's Paris in the rain and the artists and writers of the Jazz Age (Midnight in Paris). The characters are faced with a decision to reject or accept the illusions, the driving catalyst which propels the story forward.The illusions are fantasy, this fiction life where wish fulfillment is the norm. The main characters struggle with illusions of romance, no doubt delusions. With these delusions, Woody Allen gives a nod to such Bergman films as Through a Glass Darkly (1961) and Cries and Whispers (1972).The Deconstructing Harry comparison is the storyline of the writer who has fictional characters to haunt him. Harry Block remembers scenes from his book as well as his past. In Midnight in Paris, it is a fantasy for a different life which draws Gil to the streets of Paris. In Bergman's Wild Strawberries (1957), Dr. Isak Borg is visited by a flood of illusions on his way to receive an honorary degree. Bergman beautifully displays the hidden places in Borg's mind. Woody Allen shows us his own version of Wild Strawberries, as the visit to Paris takes us into the fantasies of Gil's mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but still an arm's length from great(ness)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many copycatting like ingredients tossed into the scenarios and storyline, mixed up and dissolved into this Woody Allen's movie: "Cinderella" the cartoon, "Somewhere in Time", "Time Traveler's Wife", and so many other Sci-fi and romantic movies and novels. The 12 o'clock midnight charm is definitely from Cinderella, the big antique car is like the chariot from a pumpkin; meeting a dream woman and becoming so obsessed is just like what the male met his fatal female in "somewhere in Time", the only thing turns out better is the guy in Midnight in Paris didn't become a tragic character in the end but a happy one instead.I often questioned the overly exaggeration of making Paris the most romantic city in the world. Seems everything in Paris is exquisite and sublime. This is obviously a scam manipulated by the international tourism and the French. A city actually is no different from other cities in any country, people live in it shitting, crapping, eating, fornicating, urinating, sneezing, coughing....as any other city dwellers doing daily. What's the big deal? Walking in the rain falling in Paris is more romantic than falling in other cities? Maybe just a little better than the rain that falls in China, less acid and pollution? The movie also would only resonant to those who know a little bit of French and American literature, some basic common knowledge of the art world, about Picasso, Dali, Manet. Without knowing these fundamental French/American Literature For The Dummies and Art History 101, I really doubt those majority video gamers would give a rat arse about this movie. And I am quite sure that this movie is only for the people who still read and not even the kind who really read on Kindle.With all things considered and said, I have to say signing Owen Wilson up to do this character was 50/50 good and bad at the same time. The way he talks, the way he spit out the dialog is not quite likable, as his mouth and lips often twisted in a weird way, and exactly sounds like what his fiancée's father said: "There's part of his brain missing". He doesn't look convincing and believable as a writer and sometimes a bit immature, childish and lukewarm. There are many characters played by other actors and actresses are very convincing, but the character played by him, unfortunately, nobody but Owen Wilson, with a funny nose and mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen has been a bland filmmaker for a while now, so much so that it might seem impossible that he could be capable of making a film as good as his earlier hits were. He may never do that, though he's returning to form somewhat in Midnight in Paris. Somewhat, in his newest film's resemblance to the "Allen formula" of delving into the intricacies of personal relationships, but differently in its ultimate transcending of humanism in favor of personal commentary on certain novelists and filmmakers he admires.This aspect of Midnight in Paris is its most appealing feature for the knowledgeable viewer and presents many opportunities for meta-textual analysis between the various historical figures contemporary Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) visits and the movements they've helped inspire. Perhaps from this vista one could see the completed film as an admonition on Allen's part that his next good film will be distinctly modern and stylistically dissimilar from earlier works.What I've described actually composes the bulk of the film in the literal and figurative sense of that word. Pender's personal life gets a lot of running time and its banality is severe. His fiancée Inez (Rachael McAdams) is underwritten as an "ugly American" movie villain who could exist to satisfy Allen's mostly-European audience's stereotypes or as a convenient cliché. After he experiences magical nights with Gertrude Stein, the Fitzgeralds, and Luis Bu?uel, he returns to segments where he (we) has to be reminded how uninspiring the modern world is. Allen would like you to see some of these parts as a critique of modern fetishization of dead intellectuals and their works, which it could be if more meaningful content was provided other than an obtuse tour guide who spouts inane trivia. This results in the viewer's half-appreciation for the film, remembering its intriguing core while disregarding its exterior vapidity. None of the good earlier works Allen directed were so internally polarizing.Pender begins falling in love with one of the historical characters he meets, which ironically happens because she is attracted to his vulnerability in being in a new time. He even manages to find her diary in the modern era and tries to woo her, which fails when he realizes she idealizes (and visits) an earlier period. The fantasy comes to an end. They can never be "together," since their fetishes are distinct despite their similar foundation. In fact, the whole movie plays on fetishization as its thesis. It opens with a montage of many shots of Paris, including its less glamorous locations. Inez and her family are too interested in shopping around town and walking guided tours. Even Gil is allured by the intellectual culture rather than a genuine interest in experiencing the city as it is. Midnight in Paris, as can be seen from Allen's decision to show more of the city than his characters care to see, is a movie about how the city is conceived by people who either aren't French or don't live there. It's shown from an American vantage point, perfectly ending with Pender deciding to leave his fiancée and meeting a charming Frenchwoman. Owen Wilson was therefore a great choice for the title role, with the na?ve optimism so characteristic of his people and represented in the screenplay.Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moment of pure joy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was about to write in the summary the following qualification for this magical movie: 'intellectual orgasm' but I was afraid of both words. The word 'intellectual' might scare some people away when it simply means that watching this film is a dessert for the brain and a visual orgy (Paris of today, Paris of yesterday) and the word 'orgasm' would scare the other people away because of its sexual connotation. However, the qualification refers here (once again) to the brain. We share the same astonishment as Wilson's character as he meets Legends of the Arts and we just go along the ride with an exhilarating feeling. You can feel that Allen has a deep knowledge and passion for both these luminaries and Paris and we are happy to share it with him. He also make us think about the respective values of one's fulfillment through materialism or spiritual (through literary inspiration). And that's probably why he is more popular in Europe and particularly in France than in the US...And I have to say that Marion Cotillard is once again a treat to watch and for me she might be one day compared to the best actress in the world: Meryl Streep! In this movie, she is literally the incarnation of the City of Light.I got out of the theater very thankful to Woody Allen for producing such an inspired and funny intellectual and visual treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen Finds Another Purple Rose in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's 2011 contribution to cinema has been heralded as a return to form by many critics, and for a few shining moments at the outset, it looks like it might just as well be that way. Through a lovely montage of Parisian images by cinematographer Darius Khondji, Allen evokes the city's unabashed romanticism set to Sidney Bechet's nocturnally soulful saxophone on his composition "Si Tu Vois Ma Mere" much the same way the filmmaker captured the cosmopolitan energy of Manhattan set to Gershwin's grandiose "Rhapsody in Blue" in his 1979 masterwork. The camera finally lands on the lead characters as they visit Claude Monet's picture-perfect gardens at Giverny. From there, Allen treads familiar territory following the adventures of Gil Pender, Allen's alter-ego, a successful but unfulfilled Hollywood screenwriter on a trip to Paris with his fiancée Inez along with her wealthy, xenophobic parents who are funding the trip with typical bourgeoisie disdain.Longing to join the literary ranks of his heroes F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, Gil, we discover, is working on his first novel much to Inez's chagrin. Enamored with the way Paris was during the 1920's, Gil soon finds himself in an alternate universe after midnight where he is rubbing elbows over martinis at jazz clubs with not only Fitzgerald and Hemingway but also influential figures like Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter, and Salvador Dali. By the light of day, however, he faces the mundane reality of Inez and her family, who are completely indifferent to his flights of fancy. Matters get worse when Gil and Inez bump into Paul, an old college crush of hers, who has since become the type of intolerable pedant Allen skewered so well in the movie theater scene in "Annie Hall". Gil ? as he toggles between present-day Paris and his idealized vision of the city's past - will likely remind Allen's fans of the shenanigans that occurred in "The Purple Rose of Cairo" down to the introduction of an out-of-sync love interest, this time a beautiful clothing designer named Adriana, who was Modigliani's mistress and has now become Picasso's embattled lover. Allen obviously enjoys regaling in Jazz Age-era Paris and presumes his viewers will have more than a passing familiarity with the period.Thankfully, I just saw the Steins Collect at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, so I received a primer on some of these seminal figures. You can tell Allen is less interested in the contemporary scenes, which are not as arresting with these characters coming across more like stereotypes despite a game cast. As the hapless Gil, Owen Wilson is a bit improbable as a writer with high literary aspirations, but his sincerity in the role helps win us over. Back in "Mean Girls" mode, Rachel McAdams isn't given that much to do as Inez except to express constant frustration. Usually playing sincere historical figures like Tony Blair and David Frost, Michael Sheen has a field day as the entirely unlikeable Paul. There's a predictably no-nonsense turn by Kathy Bates as Stein and an over-the-top one by Adrian Brody as Dali. As Scott and Zelda, Tom Hiddleston (the malevolent Loki in "Thor") and especially Alison Pill play their archetypes quite well, but among the real-life figures, Corey Stoll stands out as the pugnacious Hemingway. As Adriana, Marion Cotillard makes the most of her fantasy figure role. All in all, this is solid work from Allen but still a fair distance from his most accomplished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's to Golden Age Syndrome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris is the best movie of the year so far and one of Woody Allen's greatest films ever. It is in league with Manhattan and Hannah and Her Sisters. The original screenplay should be a lock for an Oscar nomination and I cannot recommend this film any more highly.Early on, an annoying character makes the observation that a glaring Romantic flaw is Golden Age syndrome. They always look to the past, usually to a specific decade, and define it as the greatest and most interesting time to be alive. It is never the present. For Owen Wilson, Midnight in Paris's nostalgic Woody Allen character, the Golden Age was 1920's Paris. F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, et al., sat around drinking, smoking, and debating literature, art, and music. Wilson's 2010 present involves hack Hollywood screen writing, suspicious prospective in-laws, and mundane hassle. Salvador Dali, T.S. Eliot, and Pablo Picasso must never have had to wash the dishes or take out the trash. However, Golden Age syndrome is in the eye of the beholder. What if 1920's Paris was your present? You would not define it as your Golden Age, but most likely look back to the 1890s and the Belle Époque. That era must have had greater thinkers such as Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin, and Degas. Those gentlemen were probably yearning for the Renaissance. This manner of thinking strikes me as immensely intriguing. Granted, this film requires a certain amount of knowledge beforehand to enjoy it. The Ernest Hemingway scenes are easy to digest, but if you are not familiar with Luis Bunuel, you will most likely miss out on the scene which made me laugh the loudest. At the end, I wanted to pack up, travel to Paris, find a corner café, and order a bottle of red wine to ready myself for an upcoming conversational challenge. I am happy Woody Allen chose to return to a European setting. His two most recent entries in that category, Vicki Christina Barcelona and Match Point are superior to his familiar New York sets. Even You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger is better than Whatever Works and Scoop. Take the time to find this film and enjoy it. Afterwards, you will probably run into like-minded folk in used book stores ferreting out A Moveable Feast and the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elusive Perfection: Enchanting, Likable Inspiration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Elusive Perfection: Enchanting, Likable Inspiration" Woody Allen directs a mish mash of great actors and actresses in "Midnight in Paris" bringing them together to create a story about a man's enchantment in Paris. The best Woody Allen movie made in years is much more majestic than his previous work and feels much more lighthearted than his typical films. Shadows of the charm of "Annie Hall's" success are present, as Owen Wilson ("Hall Pass") becomes a star once again. Wilson's happy-go-lucky attitude combined with his early artsy roots of "Bottle Rocket" make his interpretation of a successful, laidback Hollywood writer Gil the most likable character of the year. Gil is in love with the city of Paris and wishes and is infatuated with life in an earlier time period (the 1920s). Consequently, when Gil and his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams, "Sherlock Holmes") travel to Paris with Inez's parents, he becomes lost in the city as he struggles to finish writing his first novel. Gil is searching for inspiration stumbling upon a routine of walking through Paris after midnight. Inez does not support his ambitions and instead goes out with her old stereotypical snobbish French cultured friend Paul Bates (Michael Sheen, "Tron: Legacy") and his wife Carol (Nina Arianda, "Win Win"). None of this really matters though as the golden art of cinema is revealed with Gil's story as he meets various characters played by Adrian Brody ("Predators"), Marion Coltiard ("Inception"), Tom Hiddleston ("Thor"), Alison Phil ("Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World), and Kathy Bates ("The Blindside") in the illusion of his night pursuits.Owen Wilson has one of the year's best performances creating one of the most likable characters to ever be on the silver screen. Owen Wilson's personality was perfect for the role, however, his success is ascribed by his ability to delve deeper into his character creating a subtle Oscar worthy performance. The rest of the cast speaks for itself with a handful of contemporary A-list stars guided by an articulate original screenplay of believable imagination. Lastly, praise for the city of Paris is well deserved because without the city where would the movie be? Woody Allen makes one cliché mistake with the development of Rachel McAdam's character Inez. McAdams has a solid performance; the problem is that Inez is portrayed as a complete selfish bitch throughout the film's entirety. Therefore, this brings up questions about why Gil and Inez are together in the first place.An elusive rom-com about a man's discovery of inner harmony allowing him to find someone that understands him. Magic in the modern day setting has never been more humorous, convincing, or perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris (2011) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another small and charming romantic comedy from the always-reliable Woody Allen that's becoming harder to find in a sea of overblown, overlong, special effects bonanzas. It's a story of a young modern-day American writer named Gil (Owen Wilson), spending time in France with his fiancé (Rachel McAdams) and her parents, who is disenchanted with life in the 21st Century and longs for the better things of the past. His girl and prospective in-laws don't understand and are downright dismissive of him. One night Gil gets the unexpected thrill of his life when he boards a magical cab which time warps him back into the glorious 1920's where he becomes elated at meeting many of his idols all conveniently in the same place at the same time (Cole Porter, Pablo Picasso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Salvador Dali, Gertrude Stein). Owen Wilson is pretty good at playing what basically comes down to Woody Allen himself (I could easily see Allen in the part, but he's almost 80 these days so he has young actors doing his nebbish schtick for him). This is a cute enough movie that's worth seeing at least one time. Woody has tapped into similar romantic territory before, so it's not really very new for his regular fans. I can't say I agree with his unoriginal moral of the tale though: that in the long run, "the good old days" are supposedly a fantasy, and we will ultimately find out that the past was no great shakes either. (I'd beg to differ there, Woody.) **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Not so many years ago, Woody Allen was thought of as the quintessential New York City filmmaker (along with Martin Scorcese). He understood that and even poked fun at himself in his most popular film Annie Hall. At age 75, Mr. Allen remains an incredibly prolific filmmaker cranking out a new script and film every year. With his recent work, he has ventured outside of NYC and into England, Spain and now France. Clearly these new locales have re-energized his creativity.The script for Midnight in Paris is some of his best writing in years, and he explores our love of nostalgia without sacrificing the customary relationship struggles. While I hold steadfast to my rule of providing no spoilers, a quick glance at the character names gives you all the clues you need to put the basic idea in place.Owen Wilson plays Gil, a financially successful Hollywood screenwriter who longs to be a serious novelist in the vein of his literary heroes from 1920's Paris. Gil goes on vacation to Paris with his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy). Of course the parents don't like Gil and it doesn't take long (maybe one scene) for us to figure out that Gil and Inez are misfits as a couple.In an attempt to escape the yammering of Inez's know-it-all friend played by Michael Sheen, Gil goes wandering the nighttime streets of Paris. What happens next is either science-fiction or the culmination of Gil's dreams. The bell tolls midnight and Gil is whisked away via a classic Peugeot to the world of literary giants he so worships.Half the fun as a viewer in this one is staying alert to pick up the clues to the references: Zelda and F Scott Fitzgerald, Josephine Baker, Juan Belmonte, Alice B Toklas, Djuna Barnes, TS Eliot, Matisse, Leo Stein, Toulouse-Lautrec, Gaugin, Degas, Cole Porter and Picasso. Kathy Bates spikes the film with her lively turn as Gertrude Stein. Corey Stoll makes a ferociously direct Ernest Hemingway. Adrien Brody offers up a slightly off-center Salvador Dali - good for a laugh.This movie plays kind of like an all-star game. A chance to see all the names and players that you have heard about ... all under one roof. For film lovers, there is a great little exchange between Owen Wilson's character and Luis Bunuel. Woody has created a 90 minute tribute to all of us (like Gil) who have yearned to work with and live among the artistic giants. I would love to see Mr. Allen's notes as he put this idea together. We can only imagine what didn't make the film! Despite all the fun of inside jokes, the romantic idea of nostalgia and wishing for a better time is discussed and analyzed. Mr. Allen tells us that EVERYONE, no matter their era, has a romantic vision of some previous time which they believe would better suit their style and creative force. The story is balanced by having Gil's novel based in a nostalgia store, and he ends up meeting an intriguing young lady (Lea Seydoux) at a Paris store that sells old records and books.As always, Mr. Allen has beautiful music accompanying his words and scenes. This time we are also treated to some breathtaking images of Paris, the Seine, and wonderful works of art (Rodin, Picasso, etc). Of course casting Carla Bruni, wife to the President of France (Nicolas Sarkozy) might have entitled him to film in settings we don't often see in movies. One gets the impression that this one was quite a bit of fun for Woody to assemble. If you enjoy art or literary history, you too will find this to be one jolly easter egg hunt!</fullReview>

Though Owen Wilson (not as bad as he could've been) and Rachel McAdams (lovely but terrible as usual) are miscast, Marion Cotillard is perfect again as a dreamy muse for a writer who wishes he was living in the 1920's.Though beautifully photographed and with a great soundtrack, this isn't as strong an entry as 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona', but should please Woody Allen fans and anyone who has dreamed of going back in time to more romantic and inspiring days - and nights.Check out full reviews at theschleicherspin.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not the funniest Woody Allen movie ever, that's for sure. But it's still kind of amazing that a director who's been around for so long can still put together a second-rate comedy that is better than most directors'best work. And the point of the film is interesting as well, especially coming for an older director who should be washed up and retired by now, that one can't go backward to a time when things were supposedly better...as the dough nuts holes who lead the Tea Party seem to think. Even though from a mathematical standpoint time doesn't have a direction, in reality time does have a direction. We can argue that time is going forward to the future or around in circles. But there's no need to revisit the past between the past is never really gone, it continue to exist along with the present and the future. And although Owen Wilson does a good job with the lead character, Corey Stoll does a great job as Hemingway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another cutie from Woody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody has a way of making romantic comedies so attractive in person and in location that you always want to be there too. I would bet that tourism to Paris increases this summer due to this film. And, Paris never looked lovelier, as the first 3 minutes of the film was a running postcard of still-shots of Paris' greatest and most beautiful sights. Just an inspired leadoff for a film full of great shots.The idea was that the Woody character, this time the well-rumpled Owen Wilson as Gil, a frustrated novelist and Hollywood screenwriter, was half of an engaged couple who, along with his fiancé Inez' elitist parents, visit Paris. For many good reasons, he opts out of doing the sights with her parents and ends up going walking alone at midnight. He, as in a fantasy, meets a strange classic limo that stops, people inside beckon for him to get in, which he does, and he is instantly transported back to the Paris of the 20's, the era in which he always longed to live. He does this same midnight escapade again and again, and in time he wondrously meets all of the famous Paris artists of that day. These fantastic adventures determined the course of the story, which also included Michael Sheen as an arrogant, pedantic college professor friend of his fiancé that Woody, I mean Owen as Gil, detested. His fiancé? Far from it, as you will see. And, Adrien Brody was hilarious as Salvador Dali, as in "Dali!!!" and "Rhinocerous!" That part was priceless.Gil as Woody(let's just use Woody OK?)met a couple of gorgeous women interested in a romance with him, one of them being the terminally cute Marion Cotillard(Adriana)on his visits to the 20's, and a sweet antique dealer in the present time. After finally resolving his life's troubles caused by his fiancé and by his many trips to his fantasy 20's world, Woody ended up as he should have with the right partner and the right life's direction, and apparently is still in Paris living happily ever after. Ah, if it all could be so grand and ending just as it should, as it always does in Woody's fantasies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravissimo, Monsieur Woody!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been eagerly anticipating Midnight in Paris ever since it came out. The concept seemed interesting, the cast on paper were great and I loved a lot of Woody Allen's early work(Annie Hall, Manhattan and Crimes and Misdemeanours come to mind). And I wasn't let down at all.To me Midnight in Paris is Allen's most sustained and most enjoyable movie in about 15 years. I personally would've loved for it to have been a tad longer, however with that there is much to like about Midnight in Paris.Starting off so promisingly with a gorgeous opening montage, one of my personal favourite beginnings to a Woody Allen movie actually, Midnight in Paris with its striking locations/scenery, beautiful colours and skilled cinematography is a very well made movie.Also, its soundtrack has a nostalgic and appropriately romantic feel to it. And the story is always interesting, it is splendidly dotty in its construction which ensures it is never overly-comic or overly-serious, but what made the story interesting for me were the literary and painterly references, it helps to know some of them but even those I didn't know were done in an informative rather than heavy-handed way.The characters like with many other Allen movies are examples of those you are not sure whether you would like, but learn to by the end. Owen Wilson's character is particularly true to this. Allen's direction is always assured, but aside from the opening montage and the references Midnight in Paris's remarkable selling point was the script, the comedy is savvy, the romantic elements are yearning and the questions asked are done in an affectionate manner.I don't have much to criticise the acting either. Owen Wilson in the central role was unexpected casting for me, but it was unexpected casting that paid off for he is delightful here. Rachel McAdams is suitably shrewish and Marion Cotillard is alluring and intelligent. Michael Sheen and Kathy Bates are rock-solid as usual.Overall, a wonderful movie. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and charming at times, but clichéd-riddled and predictable Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I get a kick out of reading the reviews before, but mainly after I see a movie. Especially when I am "against the grain" with a poor review vs. the masses.How this movie could score a perfect "10" by some is beyond me, but to each his own. It is mostly entertaining, at times charming, and has a couple of great characters ( Corey Stall as Hemingway and Adrien Brody as Dali ). The Paris backdrop is beautiful and the time-travel concept is always fun. But the plot is rather simplistic and the main characters are riddled with clichéd lines and all too common roles.For starters, Gil and Inez had no business being a couple in the first place, let alone being engaged. And her parents characters could not have been more predictable and over-done. Absolutely no effort to make them interesting. And as one reviewer wrote, I also picked out the girl Gil would end up with, from the moment she appeared on the screen.The movie is not bad. I would give it 6.5/10, but it is not up to "Match Point" or "Vicky Cristina Barcelona". It just wasn't worth the theatre price. Thank goodness we had dinner just before the show and saved on popcorn and soda!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is Romantic Paris?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever wonder what "Romantic Paris" is all about? The latest Woody creation showcases this hyped notion literally through a montage of photograph-like camera shots of various streets. The blatant depiction of the romanticized Paris does not get too tacky because Woody satirizes the great romantic played by Owen Wilson and the romantic in all of us; the American who wants to live in Paris, walk in the rain and write. Wisely making Paris as the setting is perfect for the American audience who at times regard Paris as the ultimate city of romance. Climaxing with a wonderful message to this romantic protagonist, we once again get Woody's amusing, societal effacing commentary.This is a fantastical film where the protagonist gets transported to Paris in the 1920 after midnight. He gets to briefly meet some of the great artists and writers who get to comment on him as a writer, an artist, a man, and a lover. This did get a bit cheesy but it was also a bit of fun. It is fun to see the modern man interacting with legendary people from the past but these characters from the past were mere characterizations of the great artists. Perhaps it was the intention to make these artists of the past how we envision them, containing the proper imagined eccentricities and that was OK since the modern man goes back and fantasizes about it as how he imagines them similar to how we imagine them. The charactertures and therefore not real people plagued all the characters of this film even the ones of the present. It was also not very believable that the protagonist and the fiancée ever got to the level of being on the verge of marriage since they were at such odds with each other and had such conflicting souls. Even though the characters weren't great this is another gem of Woody's witticisms, philosophies, and scenes of natural urban beauty. It is the perfect depiction of Romantic nostalgic Paris in the rain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With some films in you, you should probably now by now how to handle Woody Allen, what is or isn't worth your time; the visual imagination, beautiful or borrowed; the snarky wit, acerbic or whinging; the nervous tics and anxieties, relatable or complacent.I happen to not be attuned at all with him, and have only moderately enjoyed a few films a long time ago. He looks up to Bergman, I am an Antonioni person. So I will always resolve in favor of cessation, concentrated mind, detached perception, and the idea that the content of the mind does not matter one bit - which both him and Bergman anxiously probed about - so long as we get to understand the mechanisms that give rise to it and give rise to images with an eye on an awareness that liberates from them and opens up horizons.Here we have one such film about internal mind, and in a form that appeals to me; the look from inside the mirror, in an effort to give us actual in-sight of the mind weaving stories.For this to work, we need to be able to make concessions. We also need to be nostalgic for the golden afterglow to warm us. We need to be willing to be transported to where not everything makes sense. We need to give in a little to the fantasy as though it was our own.So for most of the film we get to wander around a dreamy 1920's Paris all in an effort to apprehend the circumstances that would provide inspiration and strength to overcome insecurities back in the waking world. Back where an airheaded blonde wife waits for us to have dinner in the fancy restaurant, the disapproving parents, the suave sexual antagonist; a cast of shrill stereotypes out of a Woody Allen film.The lesson that we fish inside the fantasy is the expected, the only one that can be valuable. It is a dangerous chimera to indulge the mind; now matters, there was never any other world, any world more beautiful.But it does remain on the whole a film where the fantasy is a superficial romp, with the important realization merely tucked at the end of a good time. As it turns out, there was nothing in the bottoms of this mind that is a shadow from the surface, or a particularly deep encounter, beyond of course getting to meet the woman of one's dreams. How poignant it would have been for example, if the anxieties above were recast inside the fantasy in forms that we know from movies? What Lynch has done so ingeniusly. There is none of that here, just the love letter already stamped.In the middle of so much art and so many encounters with the people who made it, the greatest art however remains this city of lights. It is truly a cinematic jewel, and Woody's virtual wandering is the best thing next to living in it.If the premise here appeals to you, I recommend that you seek out films by the filmmakers who inherited surrealism as the means to re-invent cinema. The journey from that short with the sliced eye from the period referenced here that Bunuel did with Dali to Welles who parodied that stuff at the time but used that eye to slice narrative, to how Raoul Ruiz transfigured Welles. Start with Ruiz, who recently passed away. Woody's film is breezy but decorative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to write a review of this without giving away some secrets.Gil (Owen Wilson) is a successful, young Hollywood screen writer but he yearns to be a respected author and is writing (&amp; rewriting) a novel. He's engaged to Inez (McAdams), the daughter of wealthy California parents who bring Inez and Gil along on their business trip to Paris. Gil is fascinated to see the bistros frequented by Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, Picasso, etc., while Inez is more interested in shopping for items for the home they'll soon make back in California. She wants Gil to just stick with his so-far successful and lucrative career rather than aspire to greater literary worth; Gil seriously proposes they live in Paris awhile (hoping its ambiance will improve his writing?) but Inez will visit only as a tourist.Late one night, after several drinks, they go their separate ways for the evening--Inez off with mutual friends, Gil walking back to their hotel. As the clock strikes 12, a '20s Peugot taxicab careens to a stop beside Gil; it contains Scott &amp; Zelda Fitzgerald and they invite Gil to hop in and party with them and their friends. Gil does so, and on following midnights he continues to meet and socialize with them and their friends: the writers, artists, and famous denizens of that 1920s/30s Paris "golden age" era: Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) &amp; Toklas, Hemingway, Picasso, "Tom" (T.S.) Eliot, Josephine Baker, Luis Bunuel, Cole Porter, Dali, etc., all of whom vanish each dawn.IMO, Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams were each excellent in their roles discovering their different values.Hearing earlier reviews of this film, I was a little leery of seeing it fearing I'd miss too much since I wasn't deeply familiar with the writings of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, etc. Not a problem; a rough understanding of those two adds a lot of enjoyment. Knowing something of famous artists &amp; cultural figures of that period adds more.I'm sure Woody enjoyed tinkering with time travel a great deal. He did NOT have Eliot say he'd been 'walking on a beach with his trousers rolled' (famous lines from Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock") but he sprinkled similar, more clever things, such as having Gil suggest to Luis Bunuel, the film director, the unique plot of one of Bunuel's later, famous movies ("Exterminating Angel").Gil's not the only time traveler--a friend in that '20s era to whom Gil's become quite attracted prefers the earlier "La Belle Epoch" and, in the visit to that period he makes with her, he (&amp; we) get a glimpse of Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas, Gauguin, and Paris night life that delivers the film's message to both Gil and us.This may be a 6/10 for some who like Woody Allen movies but are unacquainted with the prominent cultural icons of that period. But for most of those somewhat familiar with them, it'll be much higher.Not a GREAT film but a VERY delightful, tasty confection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh take on the done-to-death themes of love, Paris, and time-travel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a romantic comedy. Romantic comedies are incredibly stupid, and this was actually quite intelligent. I didn't know the plot of this movie coming in, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the time travel theme was not overtly gimmicky, with humor not entirely derived from the awkwardness of people from two different eras coming together. The stupefied utterances of "What? We're where? You're WHO?" were kept to a minimum from the protagonist, thankfully, and not seen at all from the historical characters. Since the movie does not focus on a fish out of water aspect, the time travel serves as a literal picture of the pursuit of "the golden age" that people nostalgically view various eras throughout history. Put into the eye of Gil's romantic view of Paris, we are given generous, gorgeous views of the city both past and present, with a great amount of detail put into sets that are seen for no more than a few minutes. The historical figures are amusing, providing some excellent one- liners, the more you know about the time period, the better. Owen Wilson could pull off the naive character well, Rachel McAdams was nearly too perfect as the annoying one, and Marion Cotillard of course, was very French.Overall, the movie might have been a tad formulaic, and the characters bit flat. This movie is light, visually stimulating and enjoyable, yet it presents its material with enough depth to make us think about humanity's desperate longing for a past that never was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris (2011) **** (out of 4)A writer (Owen Wilson) and his fiancé (Rachel McAdams) travel to Paris where his walk through the streets after midnight will eventually change his life. After deciding to walk alone, the writer eventually gets picked up and travels back to Paris in the 1920s and comes face to face with such famous personalities as Ernest Hemingway, Zelda and Scott Fitgerald, Cole Porter, Salvador Dali, Pablo Picasso and Luis Bunuel among others. After these fantasy meetings the writer begins to rethink his position in life and what he wants for his future. MIDNIGHT IN Paris isn't a masterpiece as there are quite a few flaws and it's certainly not higher level Woody Allen but there's no denying that it's one of the most magical, charming and fun movies he's ever made. The film really is a mixture of MANHATTAN and PLAY IT AGAIN SAM, which certainly isn't a bad thing. Those who have seen MANHATTAN will remember that the film started off with clips of the city and the same thing happens here as the movie opens with various lovely shots of Paris. The fantasy angle of the film is something we've seen from Allen in movies like PLAY IT AGAIN SAM and even EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU had a great fantasy sequence at the end. You can't help but think Allen must have had a field day writing the screenplay and I think the results really show on the screen because there's just a certain charm and joy that bleeds in every scene and I honestly don't remember a single second where I didn't have a big smile on my face. In an early scene we get a dialogue bit where the characters talk about Wilson's character being in love with the past and how he thinks the "golden age" was back in the 20s. I'm sure Allen fantasizes about this as well and this comes across in the screenplay because when the fantasy aspect kicks in and Wilson starts meeting all these famous people you can't help but fall in love with the scenery, the words and of course the streets of Paris. People have been talking this up as a romantic comedy and in many ways it is but at the same time you have to admire the way Allen works the reality and the fantasy and you can't help but think that he was saying that quite often the fantasy is much better than any reality you can put yourself in.Since Allen started taking major gaps in between his acting, there have been quite a few people try and fill his shoes and the results are always very hit and miss. Wilson perfectly nails this character because you can believe that naive nature of the guy but he's also relaxed enough to where you can get into the story and follow it. The screenplay bleeds with joy about meeting these famous people but Wilson really sells it and that astonished look he gets on his face when he meets these people helps sell the stories. Wilson is so great in the role that you can't help but wish he and Allen would do more films. McAdams is as charming as ever and plays that "Allen female" just fine. Adrien Brody is terrific as Salvador and Kathy Bates gets a good part as Gertrude Stein. As great as everyone is, it's Mario Cotillard who steals the film as Adriana, a mistress to Modigliani and Picasso and the one who really strikes it up with Wilson's character. Cotillard is so beautiful and her natural charm just leap off the screen and you can't help but fall in love with her as she's certainly one of the greatest characters in any recent Allen film. The chemistry between her and Wilson is terrific and she really does look and feel like someone from this era.I'm sure many people won't understand all the characters and I'm sure many people might watch MIDNIGHT IN Paris and be confused at who these famous faces are. Let's be real, in today's world not everyone is going to know these famous names and they're going to miss many jokes. There's even a terrific and hilarious bit about Bunuel's THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL that is going to be missed by some viewers but if you know the film then it's going to be a classic example of writing and comic timing. MIDNIGHT IN Paris clearly isn't meant to be taking overly serious since, after all, we're dealing with a man living out a fantasy in the 1920s Paris but Allen gives so much detail to his characters that you can't help but fall in love with them and the city. It's clearly a love letter to not only Paris but these wild characters who Allen wanted to have some fun with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen plugs along decade after decade, stolidly churning out films. Every once in a while, he catches lightning in a bottle. This film is beautiful to look at, beautifully paced, beautifully acted, and pure pleasure from beginning to end. The lead dresses like Woody, although he has a physicality that makes his attraction to women more plausible. Is it just me, or does he sound like Jimmy Stewart? The women are absolutely gorgeous; Woody has not lost his knack for bathing women in a transcendent light. The bad guys(a pompous professor, the fiancée and her parents) are brutally sketched with perfect telling details. And best of all is Paris itself, looking at least as beautiful and magical as the New York of Allen's classic films of generations past. It is a movie about nostalgia, idealism, and those of us who feel out of place in our own time, and it is nearly perfect.</fullReview>

Interesting music sound track with a typical Woody Allen score combined with Cole Porter songs.It is written with heart and humor. It's one of those if you could have dinner with anyone in history who would you choose? Maybe these are the good old days?

		<shortDescription>"Why don't we make a Jewish movie set in Paris with Christian characters?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starting with Owen Wilson's twitchy ongoing imitation of Woody Allen himself as Gil, every situation involving his grabby neurotic fiancée Inez (a perfect JAP if there ever was one), and her supposedly WASPY Tea Party parents (who come off more like a suspicious Scarsdale dentist and his shrewish Haddassah wife) MIDNIGHT IN Paris is an amusing ethnic exercise primarily because Woody Allen doesn't know that's what he has written.It would be nice if Wilson's "blastoff into the past" didn't include constant ahistorical errors like "Hemingway" interrupting spouts of unintentionally parodic passages of Hemingway prose to discuss rhino hunting and bullfighting years before he had any exposure to either, and decamping to Kilimanjaro with Wilson's love interest (Marie Cotilard), years before he had ever been to Africa and while he was still living happily with first wife Hadley whose trust fund checks were barely keeping them alive.But what the hell. Watching Wilson/Woody Allen's constant bug-eyed "Gee whizzes" as each celeb from the past (Fitzgerald, Dali, etc.) went into their star turn was unintentionally hilarious... rather like a reprise of the beginning of the guided tour of Jurassic Park, but the one truly touching sequence when Wilson/Woody somehow caught the right carriage to take a Marie Cotillard to her dream "golden age" to Maxim's and the Moulin Rouge of the Belle epoque made it all almost worth it.Worth an Academy Award for the blurry postcard color of daytime Paris and the ability to pull the Woody Allen claque together behind a far inferior movie to the marvelous VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA... .THis is a lousy movie, but given the ethnic makeup of Hollywood, it is over-praised and at least Woody made some money this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weaker Woody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight in Paris looks and feels great. But there's not enough substance under that haze of nostalgic charm.The premise is up there with Woody's best: a frustrated writer pines for the glory days of between-the-wars Paris. Then he (inexplicably) time-travels, and has a chance to learn about writing, and life, from the likes of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald.Unfortunately, those tips are really not very interesting. In fact, after about the halfway point, they seem to dwindle away, as our hero gets more caught up in the practicalities of time-travel, and the romantic entanglements. The ending, when it arrives, is a let-down - an ancient sci-fi cliché, that pays off on none of the film's early promise. (I felt like I'd time traveled back to the 1960s and met Rod Serling.)Owen Wilson, one of the most annoying screen personalities of all time, turns in a mercifully subdued, un-mannered performance, for once. The rest of the cast is even better, and it's fun to see Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali, or Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein. But these celebrity cameos are too rushed; we never really get any insight into these admittedly fascinating historical personalities.Midnight in Paris does have a wonderfully romantic look and feel, but its true potential is never achieved. It's a pleasant, but unfulfilling way to spend 90 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enchanting but empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no denying Woody Allen's skills as a film maker; after all, the man has won 4 Oscars and been nominated for a further 23. In regard to this, Midnight in Paris does not disappoint, but I cannot help but wonder, is the Academy Award recognition it gained a result of Meryl Streep syndrome (who gets a nomination pretty much every year simply because it is her) rather than the material itself being of worth. Personally, I have to vote for the former.While Midnight in Paris is indeed visually beautiful with its extensive shots of the city itself, it cannot be helped but to notice that putting so much reliance on the French capital seems to take us away from the actual plot. The rose tinted glasses that American's look through when thinking of Paris is undeniably epitomised throughout this movie as Paris is held up as a beacon of dripping romance - even the brothels seems to have an unwavering charm about them. There is also a certain intellectual expectation of the viewer that this film requires. If names like Gertrude Stein, Francis Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway mean little to you then a lot of awe factor that this movie carries is likely to fly over your head, leaving you somewhat more confused than interested. There is an undeniable interesting attempt to include various intellectuals of the 'Lost Generation' in jazz age Paris. Yet I would argue that perhaps there is a slight air of arrogance in the little explanation of who these characters are, to those who may not have read the Great Gatsby and be familiar with the tumultuous love affair between writer Scott and his lover Zelda. See what I mean?Despite this, the intrigue of the mystical city is enough to make anyone fall in love with it. While a bit clichéd and romanticised in places, it is, after all a romance film, so we are to expect these kind of stereotypes. It doesn't pretend to present to us a gritty realism of the cobbled streets of Paris, but a beautiful enchanting one, that is enough to make us all fall in love with the French city. I mean think about, I doubt walking around in the rain would fare as being quite so alluring in real life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A likable, if snobbish, romantic comedy from Mr Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) takes a stroll in Paris after midnight strange things happen and these strange things help him to revamp his life. It is another romance typical of Mr Allen which could have been a whole lot better had we not been treated to such a predictable array of opinion as to what Paris must have been like many years ago.As it is, and at face value, the story is helped by an almost good outing by Mr Wilson because whilst never convincing it seemed fitting that such a foppish twenty first century misfit should be so greeted by such predictable characters from earlier times. However it all seems a very complex way of getting to the point of what romance definitely isn't through seeing Mr Allen's idea of what it is. However with such an array of talent making up the support what is there not to like about the portrayal of such an average script? I have given it six because, as a romantic comedy, it has some sharp dialogue at times, but it is very uneven and this brings you down to earth with a bang much too frequently for it to be described as a good film. Worth a rental but not much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title speaks for itself. Midnight in Paris (2011) discovers Paris through a man's troubles, not the other way around.The plot is original and the message around the theme of "nostalgia" is delivered clearly. Nevertheless, it is disappointing that the movie itself isn't particularly exciting - no mystery or suspense, no moments of intensity, and no obvious comedy. Thankfully, the beautiful setting and gorgeous music make up for the shortcomings. (Even as I am writing this review, I am listening to the soundtrack.)I think most people watch for the visual and auditory appeal; the movie isn't a head-scratcher or a shock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In one way - a very meaningful way - Midnight in Paris is a major triumph. While some films Allen filmed in Europe in recent years - like Match Point and Vicky Christina Barcelona - felt like beautiful, loving homages to other directors, Midnight in Paris is all Woody Allen. In fact, it's the most personal and introspective work he'd turned out since, probably, Deconstructing Harry. The real Allen feel is all here - not the whimsical sarcasm of Hollywood Ending or Whatever Works, but more the feel of classics like Manhattan and Annie Hall. That in itself is reason enough for fans to run out and watch it.That's not to say that the film is perfect, though, and to put in in the same class as masterpieces like Manhattan would be a mistake. The fact that it's nominated for an Oscar may give the wrong impression - Midnight in Paris isn't one of Allen's best films, nor is it one of the best films of the year. The biggest flaw of Midnight in Paris is its painful predictability - Allen really tries far too hard to explain to the viewers what he's trying to say, to the extent that the film's Aesop is spoken twice, once in the beginning and again near the end, and none of the subtlety of the films he created in the 70's and 80's in there. It's more easily comparable to crowd-pleasers like The Purple Rose of Cairo - which maybe the reason it did so well. Midnight in Paris makes every attempt to be liked, and it is - by both viewers and critics - but it fails in creating a timeless classic.There's a lot to like about Midnight in Paris though - obviously the beautiful shots of Paris (including an opening montage that may echo the one in Manhattan, though it's much less effective), and a never-ending series of brilliant performances in small roles - most notable of which is the very brief appearance of Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali. Those small roles unfortunately overshadow the more prominent roles of actors like Rachel McAdams, Kurt Fuller and Michael Sheen, whose characters are gray and unlikable in comparison - but then, that's part of the point. I was also underwhelmed by the lead himself, though, which is a shame - Owen Wilson does a decent job, but in comparison with his strong performances for Wes Anderson, his character here is so obviously an avatar for Allen himself that I couldn't believe a single word coming out of his mouth.Midnight in Paris is beautiful, whimsical and very entertaining; it also attempts to be deep and personal, but those elements unfortunately are nearly lost by the lack of subtlety. But it's still a great film, especially for Allen fans but not only for them, one that sits squarely with the B-list of Allen's semi-classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the past couple of decades, I've lost track of Woody Allen. Back in the 70s when I was in high school and college, a new Woody Allen movie was a cultural event. These days, they show up regularly like buses, and, like buses, they frequently go by without me even noticing them. (It doesn't help that I no longer live in a major movie market town.) Every once in a while I'll check to see what he's done lately, and rent a title; usually this results in mild to severe disappointment.But what a charmer "Midnight in Paris" is. I love Paris, and obviously Woody does too; the camera lingers on one beautiful sight after another. I thought for a while that this film was going to end up like "Brigadoon," with a modern character willingly trapped in the past by love. But Woody gives the plot a fresh twist, with a lesson to be learned, especially by creative types. The cameos by the great writers and artists of the past are wonderful, and the "modern times" plot involving a doomed relationship is also handled well. The period music is also enjoyable, but Woody: why did you have to play that same guitar tune over and over? I almost lost my mind, but I was enjoying the rest of the movie too much to care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basically a fun little movie to have a great time with.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to fall in love with this movie. It's simple, likable, charming. Basically it's a great movie to watch to forget about all your sorrows for a moment and be taken by the movie its settings and different time periods and characters along the way.I won't say that it was one of my favorite movies of the year, it's being a bit too simple with its story but there is also very little to not like about the movie. The only thing I did not like the movie for was for the things it didn't do. But can you really hold such a thing against a movie, that still does work out for what it is.The movie just would had been more perfect for me if it was a little bit more entertaining. I feel that it could had done more with its characters and certain story developments. The movie now, to me, feels as if its holding back at times and had even more potential in it. Perhaps this all could had been fixed if the movie was being just a tad bit longer. It's only 90 minutes short but I just don't see any reason for this movie to be that short really. With 30 more minutes it could had wrapped up certain story lines more properly and might had shown a bit more of certain characters as well, who were now hardly in it at all.But like I said, it still does the things that it does well. What I like about it is that things just happen in this movie, without a clear logical explanation to it all. And why should it really. It's far more magical actually when a movie does not explain anything to you at all and it's easier to get taken in by it, without any unnecessary distractions.It's also being really a love letter, not just to Paris but to a time period that is long gone already. A golden age, of parties, no worries and many different, creative talents, mingling in with each other. So many well known artist and writers pass through in this movie. This is were most of the movie its fun and magic comes from, in my opinion. It of course also helps that they are getting portrayed by some great actors, such as Tom Hiddleston, Corey Stoll, Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody. But also Owen Wilson is really great and likable, as the movie its main character. Yes, it's still being a comedy but less off a comedy than you would normally expect from a Owen Wilson movie. It shows that he is also perfectly capable of playing some more serious and demanding type of roles. Other great actors in this movie are Marion Cotillard, Rachel McAdams and Michael Sheen, among many others of course.And yes, obviously it also helps that this is being a movie that got directed and written by Woody Allen. Throughout the years he has always maintained his own style and most of his movies could be recognized just by its writing or even just by its dialog alone already. This movie also has some great, trademark, Woody Allen dialog and characters in it, as well as his typical and more subtle sense of humor, that is all being very welcome in this movie.And of course the settings are just great. It's not very hard to get some beautiful images from Paris of course but this movie also does a great job at capturing its atmosphere, of both the past and present.Simply a great, little, subtle movie to watch and have some fun with.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was almost convinced that it would be just another Woody Allen's weird movie, but gladly i proved myself wrong. It's a beautiful and inspiring story about an engaged couple and their own -different- expectations that are being exposed during a trip to Paris, France. Gil (Owen Wilson) seems to be drawn by the beauty of this city and needs more time to enjoy the experience while trying to finish his novel. Inez (Rachel McAdams) doesn't share the same enthusiasm. Between their opposing viewpoints and quarrels Gil experiences a personal faerie tale, through epochs where art was flourishing.The location itself takes you back in time. Most of the scenes where shot at night where the Paris atmosphere is magical and nostalgic. It slowly takes you back to the Roaring Twenties, the Golden Age -and beyond- introducing you to some very interesting characters. In this film i found the supporting actors performances far more interesting than those of the protagonists. Very talented Marion Cottilard, Tom Hiddleston, Alison Pill and, of course the lovely Kathy Bates and Michael Sheen.Judging by the eras, you ought to expect a beautiful music compilation, from 1890s Jacques Offenbach to 1920s Ben Bernies orchestra and Nat Star. I'd give kudos to Mr. Allen for this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Easily the second best film behind Drive for me. Woody Allen seems to have taken pieces from 'Purple Rose' and 'Bullets of Broadway' to create one of his greatest efforts (although I have yet to see Annie Hall). The writing is great and as of now I hope for Allen to win best screenplay. 'Midnight' follows the Woody-Allen-esque character Gil Pender and his fiancé's family on their trip to Paris. Right away we can see Pender is a person who enjoys the very romantic things in life and is in no way materialistic. Late one night he is brought into the world of the 1920's which he dreams about day in and day out. Soon, to his surprise and sheer joy, Gil ends up meeting all the famous authors and painters of the time. Allen cleverly brings everything together in the end and provides plenty of laughs along the way. The one thing that truly hit home with me is that a majority of people wish to live in the past or aspire to live in a time that has been long gone. We dream about it being better than the present because we are bored in the time period we're in, but as Gil says, "That's what the present is. It's a little unsatisfying because life is unsatisfying." This movie already sticks with me because I don't think I 've ever connected with a main character more than Gil Pender.</fullReview>

When this film was over I was unable to get up from my seat, I was left that weak by the nostalgic enormousness of this project.This man is incredible, what seems to be a comedy (a light comedy) succeeds in giving us the chance to reflect deeply into our most profound sentiments and confront them with those of his characters on the screen, and with them, getting deeper and deeper into trying to get some meaning from this crazy event we call life.The idea of mixing different (parallel) historical times presents an excellent opportunity to develop Allen's ideas about life, love, wishes, the levity of human relations, the unexpected encounters that will change our destinies in a jiffy... What an extraordinary philosopher this man is!!!The plot and the successes in it show us how true is that aphorism: "The grass is always greener on the other side". And as long as that is kept on a fantasy plane everything is alright, but once --maybe by magic-- we get to that fabulous other side and spend a little time there, it will painfully show us that the whole thing was nothing but a mirage. Everyday living seems to us pale and shallow, years later we look at that present (now past) with different eyes, nostalgia sets in and the shallow, commonplace past becomes now a paradisaical dreamy golden place.I think it was Thorton Wilder that once said: "When I die I want to go to Vogue" (the fashion magazine so popular in his time), in my case I definitely say: "When I die, I want to go into a Woody Allen picture". That will make me very happy indeed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen, who directed "Manhattan" and "Vicky Cristina Barcelona" depict towns with such a unique talent they would always transcend their setting status and feel as real and lively as characters. And considering his enduring love for Paris, the most beautiful and artistically influential town in the world, I guess cinema was begging for an Allen film set in Paris, and 2011 was the year it was finally done. With the talent I mentioned about characterizing towns, there was no doubt the movie would immediately make us fall in love with Paris, so the challenge was elsewhere, the movie had to maintain all the charm and wit used from Allen's incredible streak of Oscar-nominated scripts. "Midnight in Paris" needed to surprise, to bring out some unexpected elements, and on that level, I'm glad the marketing campaign labeled the film simply as a 'romantic comedy' failing to reveal what it was about in such a misleading way I'm sure it was deliberate, because I was not only surprised, but gladly too.The movie starts with a predictable tribute to Paris, a series of postcards showing the most notorious places of the capital, Champs-Elysees, Sacré Coeur, Notre Dame, the Triumph Arc, Paris on a sunny day, Paris under the rain, Paris by night 'naturellement', and the opening to conclude with the most defining monument of Paris, the Eiffel Tower. It was a nice introduction, conducted by a jazzy music, Woody Allen knows how to marry the right music with the right place as he did with George Gershwin's rhapsodies in his "Manhattan", as if a love story should combine musical and geographical elements in love between each other. "Midnight in Paris" started like I would have expected, and I sincerely hoped it would be less touristic or less 'Paris for Dummies'.Maybe I'm biased because I spent 8 years of my youth in Paris, and never felt like a tourist in there. I've always loved the charm of the unknown little streets, the pleasure to get lost and walk to discover some unexpected little treasures, avoiding buses, subways and traffic jams and simply walking at night on a bridge or a pedestrian street. I know Paris, and I know it's a town we love even more when we don't 'play the tourist'. Sure there are great places to visit, and I can't recommend enough to visit the Louvre or Montmartre, but don't ever take Paris for granted just because you saw the most iconic monuments. There's more to discover in Paris, and more to discover in you through Paris' eyes. So, I'm biased but not that I challenged Woody to surprise me about Paris but showing me something better than a human version of "The AristoCats".So ? "Midnight in Paris" starts with a conflict, Gil (Owen Wilson) is a screenwriter and wannabe writer who tells Inez his fiancée (Rachel McAdams), how in love he is with Paris, and she admits failing to see the appeal of the town, especially the overrated fascination for rainy Paris. She's a no-nonsense woman, who loves dances and nightclubs; he's nostalgic of the inter-war period Paris. Well, when a romantic comedy starts with a couple you wonder how they ever decided to marry. But from a director who made more than 40 films, it's less to create some stereotypical situations than a feeling of discomfort through the character of Gil, so blinded by his fascination that his personality can't emerge.The movie echoes the beginning of one of his Woody Allen's most endearing classics "The Purple Rose of Cairo" featuring Mia Farrow as Cecilia, a timid character who could only express herself through her love for movies until her life changed when a movie character came off the screen and discovered with her the real world. In "Midnight in Paris", Gil also makes an extraordinary discovery, every night at midnight, a mysterious car embarks him to a fantastic ride in the 20's Paris, when it was an intellectual laboratory of creativity and revolutionary concepts that enriched the fields of culture, arts, science and entertainment, welcoming such influential artists as Salvador Dali, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Pablo Picasso, when Art was something to experience, to live, not to be just pompously'described'.In this journey, we discover the nostalgic side of Paris when it was synonym of jazz, surrealism, cubism, artistic revolution, fashion, fun, France, the World! Gil discusses literature, art, women, life with a scene-stealing Hemingway (Corey Stole), he explains his condition to the non-impressed surrealist Dali (Adrian Brody) and has the privilege to have his manuscript read by Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates). The movie doesn't avoid the love triangle, since he falls in love with Picasso and Modigiliani's mistress, the beautiful Adriana (Marion Cotillard). Adriana is interesting and intriguing as she also feels nostalgic toward Paris from the past, the Belle Epoque, the Paris of Gauguin, Moulin Rouge and Toulouse Lautrec. And Allen, with his unique talent, would surprise in one extraordinary twist showing that Paris would never lose its nostalgic appeal.There were countless possibilities, the film could have explored the existential Paris, and featured Sartre, Boris Vian, Edith Piaf and Nat King Cole. Paris' charm is eternal although something might have been lost by the devastating effect of modernity, when an old and fashion café in the 20's becomes a lavatory in the 2010's. The 2010's aspect of the film isn't the highlight of the film anyway with its gallery of characters written more as plot devices: the irritating fiancée, the Parisian soul mate, making the 20's artist looking more authentic and I cared less about French-audience-pleasing Carla Bruni or Gad El Maleh's cameos. Paris stole the show!The charm of the film relied on the depiction of the magical charm of Paris and as an artist myself, this vision reconciled me with the town and made me wonder if I would go living there again. Pourquoi pas?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only Allen films I have seen are actually only from this decade... crazy I know. But I'm a fan of him. Midnight in Paris is a very charming film. Sure, it's a little obvious at times, and its message is as well. But it's sort of a 'fairy tale' in a way. The cast is all superb, although Owen Wilson hits the wrong notes at times, and maybe a better actor would have made the performance more special. Rachel McAdams is freakin hot in here! She's never looked better, and I find it refreshing just how easily she can make a character either likable or unlikable in different films. She slips into that mode so easily. Her character is, again, a bit too obvious and not incredibly written, but she is great. Marion Cotillard is yet again in another supporting role, and she shines. I am still waiting for the day that she gets another Oscar.Overall, I liked it enough, a very good film although it's never as intriguing as it could have been, or as his other films I have seen, Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (and while the former was a better film all around, the reason the latter is ahead of this one is only because of Cruz in her Oscar-winning performance)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It begins with still shots of beloved city with which no art, no matter how great, can be compared. In this surreal fantasy it seems Woody Allen has traveled back to his golden age, the 70s. When he gave the world the likes of Annie hall and Manhattan. It keeps hooked with typical quirky characters and unusual observations and conversations. We meet people from the golden age. witness an affair in the Paris of 20s. Settings of the movie can not be critiqued. The cinematography only enhances, if it's possible, the beauty of sets. Wilson does the character as woody Allen would do it. He keep putting his hands in the pocket, walks funny, delivers quirky dialogs. This movie itself is Woody Allen, conversations about fear of death, empty existence, hopeless love and Paris - all have for so long characterized him and his early movies. So glad to see he finally made a movie in our time as great as the ones he used to make. A thing that he leaves with us in this film - "We all fear death and question our place in universe. The artist's job is not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superficial hallucination of a film with heavy stereotyping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's 'Midnight in Paris' ? a superficial hallucination of a film I have to say I am getting tired of the hype surrounding Woody Allen's films. As much as I love his early work, particularly the witty script and analytical psychology of 'Annie Hall' and 'Manhattan' (the definitive part of his film career, one might say), his recent films have all left me cold. Take Allen's new film, 'Midnight in Paris' with Owen Wilson that I saw recently at glorious Phoenix Cinema (@phoenixcinema) last week. This film was, to me a poor effort for many reasons. First and foremost I thought the story was altogether one-dimensional, overly sentimental and nostalgic and rather predictable for Allen. We follow Owen Wilson as a successful film screenwriter who wants to get back to literary 'roots', so to speak, and realise his dream of writing fiction for a living. On a suffocating trip to Paris with his overbearing fiancé (with whom he has seemingly nothing in common apart from his lust for her body and her lust for his money) and his equally oppressive in-laws, he escapes into the Parisian night to re-walk the paths of the great European writers before him for inspiration against his writer's block. From the start of the film, he is painted obtusely to be a writer with a classic continual idolisation of the past, in this case 1920s Paris: the ambiance, music, art, literature etc. We gather all this information in about twenty minutes. I think even on writing this you can work out that in the end he will (a) realise his fiancé is not right for him, (b) un-block his writer's block ,(c) stop living in the past. And all this unsurprisingly takes place. At a push we may guess that he probably come to replace his fiancé with someone new who he has more in common with, perhaps someone in Paris? Yes, this happens too.How all of this happens in the film is unusual, a surprise to be sure. Each midnight, Wilson's character is transported in time to 1920s where he meets all manners of artists, musicians, patrons and writers. They all mill around the story as it progresses ? F. Scott Fitzgerald, Salvador Dali, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, John Steinbeck, Edgar Degas, Toulouse Lautrec etc. The story appears to wind around these character cameos, most of the time superficially delineating them (Dali sees 'rhinos' in everything, Steinbeck relates everything to the stark realities of war etc.), each sycophantic appearance getting a self-congratulatory chuckle from the audience. Through meeting these artists and writers, getting his book appraised by Stein, and meeting someone in the 1920s who idolises the late 1800s, Wilson's character accomplishes everything in the above paragraph. The irony is Allen shows a writer realising he shouldn't live in the nostalgia of the past by creating a film that well and truly depends on nostalgia of the past. Allen delights in the costumes, the music, the scenery and backdrops, the cars and of course the cameos, all executed with precision and a directorial eye for detail, yet in their use these attributes amount to nothing more than a sentimental, stereotypical view of Paris: the city of love and romance where esoteric artists and writers walk the streets, entertain in indulgent parties and ponder and drink to oblivion in quaint, basic bars. Mythical Paris, where everyone is beautiful, liberal-minded and fascinating in personality, conversation and talent. While Allen idealises Paris we are supposed to be interested in a writer learning not to idealise Paris. It is utterly ridiculous. Lovely to behold, but a hallucination. Marginalised in Allen's 1920s Paris is the poverty, racism and prostitution of the day. One might argue that there was no need for these serious issues to be handled but I would say that there was so little to this flimsy film that it could have done with some depth somewhere along the way.Indeed this is not the first time that we have seen this of the veteran director, Woody Allen. To some extent what irritated me about 'Match Point' (2005), was his cultural stereotyping of London's inhabitants ? cold characters with a grey sensibility and a great deal of reservation accompanying. As if someone on the Deathstar has removed their costume and acted the same in a London character drama. In addition it was a poor film with little of the real tension it claimed. 'Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona' (2008) showed Allen on directorial holiday in Spain. Again, we saw classic stereotypes: Javier Bardem as the passionate, charismatic, cultured Spaniard with heavy soulful eyes in touch with all deep matters of the heart, able to awaken such passions in the holidaymakers from the US. Penelope Cruz as the free-thinking, dynamic, past lover of Bardem's character, also led by the heart and her turbulent bipolar emotions. I remember my Spanish assistant being irritated with the stereotyping, that Bardem and Cruz should lower themselves to these roles and that Allen, a favourite director of hers, should in turn create such a superficial film. At the time, it didn't bother me so much. It was when I saw 'Whatever Works' in 2009 that I realised that this director is best in New York, or at least in the USA. He is at home there and he creates intelligent films, his best works, there in that city we all know he knows so well. 'Whatever Works' wasn't perfect, it also suffered like 'Midnight in Paris' from an anticlimactic ending. Still it was a much better film and made the recent piece a silly bubble by comparison.Jana Manuelpillai http://thouartsgood.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>at first I can say that the idea of the poster is really great , you can feel the movie even by seeing its poster. I liked the way this movie pictured Paris , as a city to fall in love , as a city that you won't like to leave ! as you watch the movie you will say : wow can I see this beautiful and amazing city once ( of course if you haven't been there before , like me ). but somehow I wanted it to seem more real , not the story , the acts. I somehow think that Owen Wilson wasn't the best chance to act this role although I believe he really did it great. I don't know maybe I'm wrong but I expected them to be more surprised in some parts or even see happiness in their faces.I was going to forget to mention the exceptional music which really makes you feel that you're not in this world .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At least not as bad as most recent outings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much of the praise for this mismatched collection of freshman art history inspired stories emanates from critics' desire for Woody Allen to finally get his groove back after a twenty year string of unwatchable films. Allen pulls out the elements of past glories but they serves them at a discount given his reduced stature. Paris stock footage replaces filming in Manhattan, Owen Wilson does a California hippie version of the quick-witted New York neurotic character and the antagonists are one-dimensional stock Tea Party baddies. The think premise involves bringing past painters (Picasso) and writers (Hemingway) to life but giving them little of interest to say to nebbish-y Gil the main character who travels backward in time to meet them. Only Adrien Brody entertains by playing Salvador Dali as a frustratingly over-the-top lunatic ? perhaps Brody has far better comedic chops than we all suspected. The arc of the story follows a path predictable from the outset and only the ghosts of great lines from Allen films of the 70's and 80's serve to break up what feels like twice the 94 minute run-time. In short, wait another probably eight months for the next Allen theatric attempt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found myself reliving chapter 14 of Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. If you've read that chapter in that book, then you have in a sense seen this movie. I'd love to pick Woody Allen's brains about that, because that book was written in the 30's. Find it on youtube then go see the movie you'll see what I mean.I couldn't imagine someone would enjoy this movie the way I did unless they've read some Hemmingway, Fitzgerald, and Gertrude Stein, unless you knew about her relationship with Picasso, even if you've only read A Moveable Feast, the movie would make a lot more sense, but my date hadn't read a single book by any of those authors and when I asked him at the end, he said he liked it. Which tells me it stands on it's own, I still honestly couldn't imagine.I liked some performances more than others but Owen Wilson nailed it. Marion Cotillard makes everything seem effortless, and Adrian Brody was fantastic, Forgive me, I see it from an actor's perspective. I gave it a 7 because of Fitzgerald &amp; Hemmingway, CASTING?????? See the movie and you'll understand question marks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched the movie not 3 hours ago. Now that it's over all I have to say is that the movie was... AMAZING!!!!! Brilliant in fact!!!! I was skeptical at first...I wasn't sure what the movie was about or whether other people thought it was worth a watch. But when he had his first trip into the past... I was hooked!!! The movie overall was stellar... I love the way the film incorporated all the amazing writers and painters of that time. What really got me was how the clothes and the setting and the the atmosphere stayed to true to the '20's and the style of the times. I costumes really got me and made me believe that film was actually and truly taking me back to the 20's in France. The reason I wouldn't give it a 10 out of 10 is because of the transition between the old times and the new. The transition between the new and the old was obvious and smooth with the use of the car, but the other way was to blunt and strange. He would finish the night then just flip right back to normal by having him be in his room and up and talking. To me it seemed blunt and strange and not as smooth a transition and the other way. But overall, the movie was awesome, and I'll be really surprised if the film isn't nominated for any awards at all. Good Job to all the awesome actors. When I saw Owen Wilson, I wasn't sure he'd be able to preform his part quite well (judging by the first few minutes or so), but as the film went on the developed the character nicely and did a good job. The ending was indeed strange, but it makes sense. The ending I would have chosen would have made no sense but it would have made me feel like the film was actually coming to an end. When this one ended I didn't feel the completeness that one should when watching a film. But in this case it was satisfactory, and cheesy (which was appropriate)!!! Love the film though, even though I might be biased just because I speak french!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Vapid Snooze-fest with only mildly interesting characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Disclaimer*** Even in Woody Allen's more interesting movies, I still find him vapid as a writer &amp; director, so if you're a fan then this review won't interest you......SO....This movie walks, talks &amp; acts like "To Rome with Love" with the exception that it is in Paris and not Rome. {Both are written AND directed by Woody Allen btw... }The cinematography of the city (comparable with "to Rome with Love") was very beautiful &amp; among the actors chosen, many were talented.....but a boring story wrought with ridiculous Woody-Allen-isms is all you are really left with in the end. The film opens with a 3 + minute montage of Paris with absolutely nothing else going on, which gives a huge hint to the lackluster content to follow. The performances worth mentioning are Salvatore Dali (Adrien Brody) who is amusing &amp; didn't have nearly enough screen time, Adrianna (Cotillard) who is a convincingly sexy french woman, &amp; perhaps Hemmingways character. Owen Wilson is pretty much the same-old, same old. Although, Wilson didn't have much of a chance to "shine" as a lead in a romantic movie simply because, every Woody Allen flick is exactly like every other Woody Allen flick... dabbled with meaningless political remarks &amp; torturing the audience with awkwardness &amp; dull sarcasm. I somewhat agree with the reviewer that said they were "insufferably shallow characters" but I don't think it's the actors fault at all. Woody's ideas aren't really all that magical, so the actors &amp; gorgeous city couldn't turn the film into much unfortunately. The only high ratings given to this flick were presumably Woody Allen fans or perhaps those captivated by the overall idea of re- visiting the Parisian streets in the 1920's. I am a romantic as much as the next person (if not more so) but this movie is just dull as a doorknob; mostly plot-wise with its vapid portrayal of a few love triangles that we've all seen before. Overall the pseudo- intellectualism (one of Woody's favorite words to put in scripts lately) is rubbed in the viewers face quite a bit. Overall, it's pointless morally as you can guess the boring moral based in nostalgia 20 mins into the movie, but I'd still take the time to compliment the cinematographer, the soundtrack creators (although Not Original Scores) &amp; a few of the actors. A shame it had to be written by Allen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Gil was in the past, he made a big enough impact on Adriana to make it into a passage of her book that he eventually reads when he returns to the present. This is a tiny ripple that slightly changed the present. Now imagine the 21st century car the detective brings into the 1920's as he follows Gil. When the car is discovered, (obviously hard to miss in comparison to other cars) that technology would have been revolutionary at that time period and drastically changing the present when Gil returns. If you're going to include the butterfly effect of Gil and Adriana, it's pretty hard to leave out the immense effect the detective would have caused. Pretty big plot hole, but overall it was entertaining. This was a good movie that could have been great if it didn't take the shortcuts that it did.</fullReview>

The high points of this film are the beautiful shooting of Paris, the excellent cameos from many of the literary greats of the 20th century in post war Paris and an apposite sound track. People will always be dissatisfied somewhat in their daily lives. One of the mistakes people make though is romanticizing what they remember of their past through nostalgia, thus creating an unattainable ideal which makes their present even worse. What allen is saying in this movie is that we have to live with the present and make it our personal golden age. Nothing earth shattering but a nice sentiment none the less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Woody's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Midnight in Paris" has one fault that simply could not be fixed. The lead character, Gil, is Woody Allen as we've seen him in decades past. But he's inhabiting Owen Wilson's body, and Wilson has neither the voice nor the mannerisms to fill Woody's part. Otherwise, the film has everything you could ask of a Woody film. That includes one of Woody's preoccupations: in this case Paris in the 1920s. There's fine acting, including Carla Bruni in a brief but important appearance as a museum guide. There's brilliant satire. The scene between Gil and Hemingway simply nails Hemingway to the cross of contemporary criticism. The scenes involving Gertrude Stein and Picasso are equally on target. And in delicious irony, the beautiful young woman (Marion Cotillard) Gil takes up with in 1920's Paris joins him in a detour to La Belle Epoch and wants to remain there because she's so unexcited by the 1920s Paris that Gil idolizes. Numerous famous names from the past have their turn on the screen in lovely vignettes, and the Paris landscape is displayed in enough photos to fill a tourist's album many times over. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a romantic comedy set in Paris about a family that goes there because of business, and two young people who are engaged to be married in the fall have experiences there that change their lives. It's about a young man's great love for a city, Paris, and the illusion people have that a life different from theirs would be much better. It stars Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Carla Bruni, among others.Starring Owen Wilson, Marion Cotillard, Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, Carla Bruni , Adrien Brody , Michael Sheen , Corey Stoll , Mimi Kennedy , Tom Hiddleston , Kurt Fuller , Alison Pill , Nina Arianda , Léa Seydoux , Adrien de Van , Gad Elmaleh.Directed by Woody Allen with an endlist list of movies he directed, one of the best directors ever.great, i finally got a chance to see one of my most awaited movies of the year. one of the best reviewed movie of this year and i must say that Woody Allen is back. though i loved Vicky, Christina, Barcelona and i don't remember about Match Point but overall these 10 to 15 years were not very good for him but this movie is a great turning point for him. also this movie was such a different and refreshing experience, one of the nicest experience i had in a while. you just don't get to see movies like this nowadays very often.this movie opens with the shots of the different parts of the most beautiful city in the world Paris, different time of the day and while raining. i mean i was literally stunned for a Paris lover like me. it is like Woody is giving tribute to the city he showed Paris so beautifully some shots were really good. so great cinematography this movie had.Art direction was good. costumes were great. excellent editing. Dialogues could have been better considering Woody's movies has the best dialogues but still overall it works good. Good direction he did his best. Screenplay was good i think better than many of his latest offerings. story was fresh and interesting to watch. good technical and written work overall. i won't call it the Woody's best even though i haven't seen much of his movies but i am his big fan.this story is about Owen Wilson as Gil and Rachel McAdams as Inez they are soon to be married they come to Paris just for visiting their parents as they have business there. Inez is a very annoying and frustrating character. Gil on the other hand is in love with Paris and want's to settle there. he loves every detail of it. walking through the streets, loving the beauty of Paris in rains and at night unlike most of the other modern souls. he is coping with his writing and his life while he is walking he gets lost and reach a place where as soon as clock strucks midnight, he time travels and reaches the 20's Paris while meeting and interacting with some of the greatest writers and artists of that time.though the surprising thing of time travel fantasy was spoiled way before i saw this movie but still it was superb actually watching it. anyways the acting performances, Owen Wilson did good which is shocking as even he in the first place was an odd choice for a Woody Allen movie but he pulled it off quite well. nice performance and was well enough in his character and likable too. Rachel McAdams was superbly annoying and just average. Marion Cotillard was really stunning and good and actually someone that might come in your fantasy dream. Kathy Bates was nice and so were other actors like Carla Bruni, Adrien Brody and Michael Sheen. this movie doesn't have the kind of performances that will get Oscar attention considering his track record of giving supporting actresses and actors some Oscar swag. screenplay is worth getting nomination along with the costumes, art and cinematography while i am also opting for Editing. and wait a minute i almost forgot to say it had a good score too.well this is a very sweet, charming and light hearted Woody rom com that has bit of fantasy touch to it. while it may not have a lough out loud comedy but this is how his movies are but still the underlying light hearted moments are enough to bring smile on your faces. it was such an excellent movie that kept growing on me and it left me feeling so good while still i am thinking about it. this dream like feel to it was great. one of the best and my favorite movie od the year. i loved it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent and highly enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director and screenwriter Woody Allen's most recent filmography was quite irregular, because on the one hand, he made the very interesting movies Cassandra's Dream and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, and on the other hand, he also made the tedious films Whatever Works and You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger. So, I did not know what to exactly expect before watching Midnight in Paris. Would it be a forgettable scale in Allen's ride through Europe? Or would it be a delicious look to Paris through an inspired filmmaker's eyes? I am very glad to say that the answer is the second one, because Midnight in Paris is an intelligent, very satisfactory and hugely entertaining tribute to the cultural roots from 20th century.The story from Midnight in Paris is not particularly complicated or ambitious, but it did not need that in order to keep me very interested in its historical travel, whose purpose is not only making a tribute to Allen's cultural heroes, but also making valid reflections about universal subjects on which the contemporary civilization is based, as well as the belief that "past times were better". And the fact that those fascinating ideas exist into an entertaining and very funny screenplay shows Allen's big talent as a screenwriter. Sure, Midnight in Paris might not have the intellectual density from Crimes and Misdemeanors, or the emotional impact from Hanna and Her Sisters; but that does not avoid it from being an excellent movie on its own merits.Owen Wilson is absolutely perfect in the leading role. His reactions to the unusual events he lives (and the titanic figures he meets) have the exact tone to share the surprise with the spectator, and at the same time, he accepts everything with the necessary aplomb and credibility to avoid more questions than the necessary. In fact, big part of the comedy resides on those reactions; as an example, I can mention the commentary he makes the first time he finds an old car which takes him to the '20s. "Is that a Peugeot? A friend of mine collects them in Beverly Hills". Well, written is not funny; it would be better for you to watch the movie in order to appreciate how Wilson's performance increments the humor, drama and sensation of amazement from the screenplay. Rachel McAdams, Michael Sheen and Kurt Fuller are equally good on their respective performances as capricious girlfriend, pretentious erudite and father-in-law; however, their characters tend to be antagonistic figures, so they are not as likable as the main character.I think it was a great idea to use unknown actors to interpret various of the historical figures which inhabit the 20th century, because that does not contaminate our expectations of "meeting" them. The actors who stand out in those roles are Corey Stoll, Tom Hiddleston and Adrien de Van. The only famous actors who interpret historical figures are Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody, and they also bring solid performances.The best thing if all in Midnight in Paris is that, despite its deep cultural vein, it never feels pretentious nor inaccessible. Those who know the works of the characters portrayed in here (even though if it is VERY superficially, like in my case) might enjoy it a bit more for understanding the references and premonitions about future events (for example, the relationship between F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda). But I think that even those without any interest in that historical period will not have any problem enjoying this film. In conclusion, despite a few minor fails from the screenplay, I liked Midnight in Paris very much, and I recommend it very enthusiastically, not only because it has definitely become into one of my favorite films from Allen's filmography, but also because on its own, it is a very entertaining, perfectly directed and brilliantly written movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody's Back!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually had the rare pleasure of seeing Midnight in Paris last night without reviews, trailers , or peoples comments...what a treat! I knew minutes into the film that Woody Allen was back and in rare form, the jazzy intro music, the polaroid like filtering of the film and the intellectual small talk all reminded me of the smell of "momma's" cooking before you even saw the food...intoxicating. Midnight in Paris is a revelation, a revelation in the transformation of Owen Wilson into Woody's avatar, but this new Woody has overcome his good old neurosis and parleyed it into a charming innocence last seen in Tom Hanks in "Big". I was grinning from ear to ear as Wilson's character Gil began to nervously babble "a la Woody" when caught in an awkward moment...did Woody micro manage this scene or did Wilson just nail it? Even the transitions to the 1920's were seamless, believable if not down right natural...I'm tempted next time I'm in Paris to hang around at that very spot at midnight and hope to catch a ride with the revelers. I think this movie was therapy for Woody, he questioned himself many times through out the film but unlike his past movies, this time he knows the answer and made sure the audience knew as well. My only small critique of the film is that Rachel McAdams broke out from the girl next door mold and really wet my appetite as the impatient and bland brat, but I was left wanting more...no fault of hers due to the limited amount of screen time she got, I'll always wonder if there were more scenes of her that were edited out and might show up in a future DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen writes and directs a wonderful magical entertaining film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is about Gil(Owen Wilson) who lives in Hollywood, and hopes to a great novelist one day. Gil and and his fiancée(Rachel McAdams) are vacationing in Paris, and Gil starts to see the amusement of living there, and wonders what life in Paris in the 1920's must have have been like? Until one night he gets that wish, while strolling through Paris, A car from the 20's picks him up, and is brought into the past, and meets famous like Cole Porter and Ernest Hemmingway, but how will this all play when he gets back to present? Woody Allens best film to date, what I heard on how he gets such a large cast of actors, he never puts demands on them, he lets them do there characters has they see fit. Owen Wilson was good here, making up for the forgetful Hall Pass. Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, Marion Cottilard, and Alison Pill. Woody Allen gives a great view of Paris, he tries to make audience feel like your really there, please check this humorous, magical out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a very enjoyable and whimsical little film that will delight all ages. My wife and I had no idea it was a Woody Alen movie until the credits at the beginning came on the screen and we had not seen a film by Woody Allen since probably the 1980's but it was very nice and funny and romantic and creative. All of the actors did a great job and I don't want to give a way anything but there is a very interesting turn of events during the film that makes it such a great film. Everyone in the theater was laughing along and my wife and I liked it very much. Will recommend to all our friends and all the people reading this review because it will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet delight of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, I usually never care that much for movies nowadays. Most of them have the same formula, especially romance movies. But this one has caught my eye.The movie "Midnight in Paris" is about a writer who's suffering from the terrible disease that all writers catch-writer's block, and he's also engaged to a snotty rich girl. The two of them are going to Paris on their honeymoon, but right away you notice that no one seems to care about the writer's feelings, including his fiancée.This makes him a very interesting character. So, one night, he happens to take a walk at midnight, and finds an old carriage where these people are all speaking French. Did I mention that he wishes he were back in the '20's, and it happens? He meets lots of interesting people, all played by very talented and realistic actors.Ernest Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald, and Picasso all make appearances in this (played by actors , of course) and as the movie takes its course, the writer realizes that the past isn't all it is cracked up to be, and that it has its ups and downs.This is a treat of a film that everyone should see. A movie that is intelligent, thoughtful, and sweet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, Paree! Ah, Woody Allen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is highly recommended.There are those who live in the past, those who celebrate life in the present, and those who look to the future for happiness. Director and screenwriter Woody Allen poses many questions in his sophisticated romantic comedy, Midnight in Paris : Do we romanticize the past to make our present and future seem bleak and remote? Can we ever appreciate the present and view it with the same glorious rose-colored glasses of the past? Does our sense of reality become impaired with what was, what is, and what will be? Can we ever learn to accept the time and place in which we live? Interesting musings persist in this amusing and clever film.Filling in for Allen and giving a fairly accurate impression of the comedic actor down to his halted speech patterns and sardonic demeanor is Owen Wilson as Gil, an American writer and tourist inspired with the Parisian way of life and nostalgic for the Golden Age of yore. He and his shrewish fiancée, Inez ( well acted by Rachel McAdams ), are there meeting her well-to-do conservative parents on holiday. This engaged couple really are opposites from the start: she prefers socializing, hobnobbing, and parties; he enjoys the arts, solitude, and introspective moments. At an elite party, Inez meets a pompous college professor ( a note perfect Michael Sheen ) with whom she becomes infatuated while Gil becomes alienated and exasperated by the whole social jet set. That evening, around midnight, Gil walks the rain soaked streets of the City of Lights and becomes lost. He stumbles across some partygoers who magically transport him back in time to the twenties, his favorite idealized time era, where he later meets his romantic muse, Adriana, mistress to Picasso, Modigliani, and his personal guide to the better life. Adriana is perfectly cast by the charming and lovely Marion Cotillard who brings such grace and enchantment to her pivotal role.Once touched by the romance of a bygone era, Gil eagerly goes it alone whenever the witching hour approaches, in hopes of mingling with the likes of literary celebrities and artists of the past: F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stall as the writer gets to deliver some of the script's best lines), Salvador Dali, Gertrude Stein, etc. There is much name dropping and celebrity stereotyping as Gil timehops to the past which gets to be a bit of a monotonous plot device; yet it gives the film its intellectual and aesthetic appeal and emphasizes Allen's unique spin, ironic wit, and sparkling dialogue.Just as the director's earlier masterpiece Manhattan was his cinematic love letter to New York City, Midnight in Paris becomes one of his best films in years, It is his personal rendezvous with one of Europe's most romantic of destinations and Allen shows the city in all its glorious splendor. Yes, the city and his dreams successfully seduce Gil in this delightful flight of fancy ( or fantasy, in this case ) and Allen has thoroughly bewitched his audience with his magical modern day fairy tale of love and romance.

		<fullReview>I just loved this movie. The premise was truly interesting and kept me wanting to see more and more. The characters were likable except for the fiancé and parents, but were selected appropriately for the roles. You must enjoy the wordiness of Mr. Allen and the tongue-in-cheek comedy. Pure magic from beginning to end. What a pleasure to see a good movie. You are taken by surprise and taken back in time to a happy and giddy time when people laughed and danced. I have been a Woody Allen fan for a long time and especially liked Vicki Christina Barcelona, so I knew I would like this as well.

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen gives fans a true dose of nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nostalgia. Now that's a word not uncommon around a Woody Allen picture. His films have always oozed of it, and now that his filmmaking legacy spans more than 40 years, to some people, an Allen film equates to it. "Midnight in Paris" falls under both categories. Remarkably, only Woody has been able to riff on the same themes, characters, ideas, etc. for decades and manage to still churn out thoughtful, funny and heartwarming pictures (when making a comedy, of course, not one of his tragedies). Perhaps "Midnight in Paris" derives its warranted praise and acclaim merely for freshly emulating Allen's beloved past work. Call him a cheater if you like for simply whipping up a new modern context for the same shtick, but "Midnight in Paris" could charm a tweed jacket and thick-rimmed spectacles onto almost anyone.A breezy summer romance, "Midnight in Paris" hearkens back to Allen's work in the early-to- mid '80s with films such as "Stardust Memories" and "The Purple Rose of Cairo." His trademark "intellectual" dialogue functions in the capacity of what purpose it serves rather than a need to understand what it means, and with exception of main character Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), all the supporting cast members are role players in this fairy tale of sorts rather than complex multi-subplot characters.Gil Pender is your typical Allen-would've-played-him-had-this-been-30-years-ago protagonist, a screenwriter manufacturing soulless Hollywood material who hopes that his planned novel will benefit inspirationally from a city that has moved so many great artists before him ? Paris. He travels with his fiancée, Inez (Rachel McAdams), who yearns to learn from Paris the more practical way and criticizes Gil's lack of sociability. While Inez spends her days learning Paris from uber-intellectual Paul (Michael Sheen), a caricature of Allen's most pretentious characters, Gil takes to the streets at night for an intangible inspiration. What he finds in Paris after midnight changes everything, including an alluring young French woman named Adriana (Marion Cotillard).The only character other than Gil to receive any attention is the city herself. Paris takes on this amorphous identity as defined by the characters who perceive it. For Gil, Paris is magic, and as such that's what it becomes for the viewer. As we later come to learn, a city's ability to cradle the history of its impermanent people and absorb their stories is what constructs its aura. This geographical timelessness evokes the emotions of those who seek inspiration from something greater than themselves.Without diving into the details of Gil's late-night adventures, Gil does learn something that challenges his desire to cling to nostalgia. The challenge of any great writer or artist is to capture and express the uncomfortable, troubling and intangible void that is the present. To keep things simple in making this point, the other characters serve to magnify Gil's journey to enlightenment. Even, Inez, who we expect more from considering McAdams' ability to turn fluff into substance, becomes a deplorable and one-sided character quite rapidly. But despite Inez being written so harshly, she does help convey the fairy tale feel of the film, which Allen clearly aimed for and struck the bullseye.There's definitely a sense that Allen purposefully sidestepped any serious drama or consequences for Gil's actions or those of anyone in the film, frankly. Knowing Allen's capability to add an a powerful gravity to relationship conflict, it's surprising he chooses to exercise none of it when the film could've been better for it or at least his ideas more resonant. Instead, he chooses to let the story float about as this postcard from Paris, one signed with love and addressed to his fans, those who've pined to recapture the Woody of old. Yet with impeccable self-awareness as usual, the great filmmaker adds a postscript in the form of a thematic reminder that dwelling in the past constitutes nothing but an escape unless we use it to understand and empower our present. That, of course, is what Woody's done with "Midnight in Paris."~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whimsical trip through nostalgia-land.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a whimsical fantasy that succeeds as a movie. The main character, admirably played by Owen Wilson, is on a quest for something that is a mirage, but to him is real. The movie deals with escapism and its pitfalls. Yes, it can be fun to let our imagination take us to all the beautiful places we crave to go to for happiness, but ultimately we're stuck in the present which sooner or later comes back to bite us. Nevertheless, the world of make believe can seem so real that once you're there, you never want to leave and that is the start of madness. This movie takes the audience to the brink of madness. The main character is so open to suggestion and so desperate to be appreciated and understood that he wants to flee present, which makes this movie so appealing. For who doesn't think about wanting to escape to a better place? Who doesn't daydream? The rest of the cast is excellent. As for the cinematography, the opening shots of Paris are superb. Rarely has an urban setting been more magnificently presented in a movie and for those who like Paris, this movie will be a delight to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm giving it a generous 1. Haven't seen a truly good Woody Allen movie since Husband and Wives. Matchpoint was good until the final third of the movie when it went completely off the rails. This time at least the movie goes off the rails right at the beginning so I didn't have to waste so much time before turning it off. As other reviewers have said what is about the main character in an Allen film that compels them to act like Woody Allen. Is his personality that forceful? Why couldn't Owen Wilson just be Owen Wilson . He's a funny guy . But Owen Wilson pretending to be Woody Allen pretending to be some hack asking a pretend Hemingway to show a pretend G.Stein his work. Wow that was when I called it quits. Speaking of calling it quits that's what Woody Allen should do. He's become a sandwich maker rather than a film-maker putting out the same peanut butter and jam crap year after year after year. Pathetic.</fullReview>

As it is, Mr. Wilson played so many ridiculous parts that I can't persuade myself that he can act. Everything else about the movie was magical and special, but the miss casting of the male lead ruined the enjoyment for me. I would have given it a 1 if it weren't for Marion Cotillard who was an absolute pleasure to watch. The utter grace with which that woman acts just leaves me speechless every time.

		<fullReview>The trailer for Midnight In Paris is so deceiving, I saw the trailer and thought oh great another film about Paris, the city everyone but me seems to love, but the when I sat down to watch it I was so pleasantly surprised at just how different this movie is to what you would expect.Firstly I have to say that the story of a man traveling to another era after midnight is terribly clever, it took me a second to realize that the main character has actually time traveled and hasn't just run into people who are dressed in 20's attire for the evening. It's even different to the usual Woody Allen material, it's highly original in every way imaginable.The cast in this movie is exceptional, I'm not usually an Owen Wilson fan but I found him wonderfully likable, he is so at home in this type of film, it's nice to see him in an intelligent comedy and not a cheap silly one. The entire supporting cast are wonderful, Rachel McAdams playing against character is great at making you dislike her character almost instantly, the same can be said for Michael Sheen, the 2 supporting cast members who were the best were Alison Pill as Zelda Fitzgerald, she's hilarious and just plain fantastic, Marion Cotillard is lovely and sweet as well, all of them are great, they all get a great scene, another worth mentioning is Adrian Brody as Dali, another hilarious encounter. Woody Allen sure knows how to write fir all his characters, no one is left unmemorable.It's kinda hard not to like this movie, I loved it in every way, I hope you will too. The best Woody Allen film since Match Point. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps Woody's Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this wonderful film in the perfect place, Montparnasse in Paris. It was showing at the Lucernaire at 53 rue Notre Dame des Champs, that cosy and quaint cineplex with its own café and theatres. Afterwards, my wife and I strolled up to the Dome and sat on the pavement (as it was summer), looking across at the Rotonde and sipping vermouth cassis, the favourite drink of the old Montparnassians of the 1920s. Then we walked back past the apartment of Gertrude Stein on rue de Fleurus, and Hemingway's last Paris apartment on Rue Ferou, as well as Man Ray's studio in the same little street (though they did not live there at the same time). All three of these people appear in the film. Kathy Bates is sensational as Gertie, and sits beneath her own portrait by Picasso, in a salon just like in the old photos of it. The film is full of cultural in jokes which those unfamiliar with the period will not get, and period details. For instance, Hemingway says he likes Picasso's work 'but he is no Miro'. Woody must have studied Hemingway's A MOVEABLE FEAST very closely and knew that the only major painting Hemingway was able to afford in Paris was 'The Farm' by Joan Miro, the painter whom he admired above all others. At one point the lead actor Owen Wilson is told he has just been dancing with Djuna Barnes, and he wisecracks 'No wonder she wanted to lead.' Only those aware of who Djuna Barnes was and of her inclinations would get the joke. The story features a young American, played brilliantly by Owen Wilson, who takes the place of Woody, who is now too old to play his own lead character, who visits Paris in modern times. He is accompanied by the fiancée from hell, played hellishly by Rachel McAdams with such fervour that one wants to strangle her as well as her horrible parents. Wilson is a writer and a dreamer who begins to go on late walks around Paris, with which he becomes infatuated. He goes to a certain magic place where at the stroke of midnight (hence the film's title), an old car drives up and he is urged to get in. This car transports him back into the golden age of the Montparnasse Era. He meets Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Josephine Baker, and many of the other leading cultural figures who were there at the time. As my wife said, 'it is a ridiculous idea but it works because it comes from the heart'. Rarely has Woody risked any filmic device quite so hazardous as this. The fact that he successfully pulls off this outrageous idea is a testament to his skill as a filmmaker. He both wrote and directed this film, which clearly means a great deal to him. (He also must have played the clarinet in that wonderful jazz at the beginning and end of the film soundtrack, though he modestly kept his name off the credits.) My wife and I thought we recognised the magic place where the car picked Owen Wilson up every night, so the next evening we strolled over there to confirm our suspicions, and we were correct. It is the charming little street called rue de la Montagne Saint Genevieve, in the 5th arrondissement, near the Pantheon, and on the right (which you cannot make out in the film) is my favourite little classical music CD shop, La Dame Blanche. The steps on which Owen Wilson sits are those of the side entrance to the Church of Saint Genevieve, which in the middle ages was the Church of Saint Stephen but changed its name. No magic car appeared to pick us up, but then we were there before midnight and hence too early for it. The only one of the 1920s characters in the film whom I ever met personally was Salvador Dali, and I would say that Adrien Brody captures him and his outrageous mannerisms to perfection, even though I only knew Dali four decades later. Corey Stoll does a superb job as Hemingway, Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill are excellent as Scott and Zelda, Yves-Antoine Spoto looks exactly like Matisse, Marcial Di Fonzo Bo looks and behaves eerily like Picasso, and so on. But the whole film is suffused with the warm glow and delicious charm of the incomparable Marion Cotillard, who plays the fictitious character 'Adriana', with whom Owen Wilson falls in love. And one can understand why he cannot resist her! The other woman in his life is the delightful Parisian beauty Léa Seydoux, another in the seemingly endless stream of cinematic talent of the Seydoux family, which is responsible for such a large proportion of what happens in the French film business. Is there simply no end to them? They just keep coming, generation after generation, like the Gallimards in publishing. This film has profound messages for us, presented as usual in comedic form, but behind all the jokes we sense a very serious Woody this time who is really trying to communicate essential things to us. Owen and Cotillard magically go back to the turn of the century, the Belle Époque, and meet Degas, Gauguin, and an uncannily convincing Toulouse-Lautrec (Vincent Menjou Cortes). Cotillard decides to stay behind, as to her this is her 'golden age', just as the 1920s is Owen's. They discover that Degas and Gauguin believe the Renaissance was a golden age, and they wish to go back to it. The message is that everyone imagines a different golden age depending on when they live, but we must learn to make the best of our own. The film is funny, heart-warming, deeply satisfying, and a wonderful evocation of the dreams we all have of seeking for fulfillment, whether in the past, or in the present. This may be the finest film that Woody Allen has ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris - brilliance in movie making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, Woody Allen finally found a Bogart in him . :) It's been a while since I posted something for having not found a worthy work of art and also because of my belief that worthiness is subjective and immeasurable. Midnight is Paris is not just a movie, it is a dream. As a movie, it exceeds expectations and as a dream, it (contrastingly) looks real. In 1979, Woody Allen wrote "The Kugelmass episodes" in the New Yorker, wherein the protagonist escapes into the past, whilst striving to attain sanity in the present. Although similar in thought, Midnight in Paris is much more than just a fantasy. It is brilliance in movie making. At this point in time, one can most assuredly say that Woody Allen has matched the likes of Fellini and shifted the epicenter of perfectionism towards the West. I shall not attempt to tell the story, but articulate myself on the subject given the fact that no one is ever going to read this.The movie is about the protagonist's journey into his fantasy, thus paving the way for realizing a sane, fulfilling life in his present.Owen Wilson is a complete surprise. One can see a young, vibrant Woody Allen in him. Even his style of delivery has been matched to that of Allen. The character is absolutely fantastic. Having to express notions like cognitive dissonance, disbelief, paranoia and a need to escape the realms of the present, Owen Wilson delivers. He is believable and aptly cast. Marion Cotillard, as always, is perfect as Adriana, Picasso's lover, who has married the likes of Braque and Modigliani, and may (or may not) fall in love with Owen Wilson's character, Gil.As his character grows and escapes into the delusions of fantasy, suspension of disbelief kicks in. This is probably one of the greatest examples of how 'suspension of disbelief' can effectively be used to convey ideas that are simple (contrast to complex notions like Science fiction), in scenarios that are amusing and far-fletched. The only concern about the movie is Kathy Bates playing the role of Gertrude Stein. That, to me was the moment I suspended believing in disbelief. Probably because of her huge body of work, but it is arguable that she was miscast.If you aren't aware of the Fitzgeralds, Alice B. Toklas, Ernest Hemmingway, Gertrude Stein, Dali, Cole Porter, the movie is still amusing and inspiring in a way. Some of the dialogues are absolutely brilliant. It is irresistible to quote some lines from the movie.Ernest Hemingway: All men fear death. It's a natural fear that consumes us all. We fear death because we feel that we haven't loved well enough or loved at all, which ultimately are one and the same. However, when you make love with a truly great woman, one that deserves the utmost respect in this world and one that makes you feel truly powerful, that fear of death completely disappears. Because when you are sharing your body and heart with a great woman the world fades away. You two are the only ones in the entire universe. You conquer what most lesser men have never conquered before, you have conquered a great woman's heart, the most vulnerable thing she can offer to another. Death no longer lingers in the mind. Fear no longer clouds your heart. Only passion for living, and for loving, become your sole reality. This is no easy task for it takes insurmountable courage. But remember this, for that moment when you are making love with a woman of true greatness you will feel immortal. (Courtesy of IMDb) Ernest Hemingway: No subject is terrible if the story is true, if the prose is clean and honest, and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure.(Courtesy of IMDb) And the most brilliant of them all, reserved for Gertrude Stein from Allen, We all fear death and question our place in the Universe. The artist's job is not to succumb to despair but to provide an antidote for the emptiness of existence. (I typed it) Woody Allen is probably the best American writer in the past decade. He has elevated, once again, the benchmark of perfection. The writing is simple, unlike his other works which makes it more compelling to watch. The subtle humor that comes along with every single character, the typical Allen mannerisms and above it all, Paris, makes it a movie-goer's dream- a great one at that.Rating : 9.5 on 10 .This review has not been corrected for grammatical errors or popular opinion.Visit http://upenreviews.blogspot.com/2011/08/midnight-in-paris-review.html for more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thanks to Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As others wrote before me, this is one of the best Allen movies. Although it never explains how Pender manages to get back to "normal" Paris (something which only occurred to me several days after seeing the film), it raises again the usual Allen topics, fans or haters will not be disappointed. What struck me is the fact that this film has the same love for Paris as some illustrious predecessors. "Funny face" (Astaire/Hepburn) and "An American in Paris" spring to mind. Allen's version of Paris is possibly too "postcard-ish", but this is cinema and optimistic cinema anyway. Great thanks must be awarded to Allen for wonderfully advertising Paris as a vacation resort and also for his use of a great cast of French supporting actors who might get this way more visibility in the USA (I don't include Cotillard and Bruni in that bunch - but for quite different reasons)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Midnight magical feast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would encourage every cinema lover to take a stroll and walk into Woody Allen's latest gem "Midnight in Paris". Woody's 7,204th film (OK OK maybe he has not helmed that many) is an elegant nostalgic film that mentally transports you to another time &amp; place; and isn't that what movies are primarily supposed to do! It's also an admirable love letter to the "city of lights" which will illuminate Paris to those who love Pari and even to those who have marked the city off their "favorites" map. Even if you're an "anti-Pari", how could you not want to visit Paris after a viewing of "Midnight"! So before it gets to midnight, let me not prolong this review any more and cut to the narrative chase. Owen Wilson stars as Gil, a disillusioned but successful Hollywood screenwriter working on a nostalgic novel, and who also longs to live in Paris. Californian Gil and his girlfriend Inez visit Paris on a leisure trip, and also occasionally meet with fellow Paris travelers John &amp; Helen; who happen to be Inez's parents. Inez is a looker of a girlfriend for Gil but does not encompass the literary free-spirit and nostalgic demeanor that he possesses. She is also a domineering complainer who does not respect Gil's artistic passions. Gil is into the past, most notably the Golden Age of the 1920's including many of the artistic &amp; literary legends that came out of that period. While in Paris, Gil is uninterested in spending time with Inez and her judgmental parents. To make matters worse, Gil also despises Paul, who is a supercilious American friend of Inez who also happens to run into Gil &amp; Inez in Paris travels. Consequently, Gil decides to take solo walking strolls of Paris; and what he ends up encountering is beyond a "blast from the past" in the streets of Paris. To detail Gil's "media noche" Paris encounters would be an exercise of futility, because it does require a "see it for yourself" experience. I will however provide a Midnight clue: if you are a literary and art aficionado of the Golden Age, you are going to definitely think those scenes struck gold. There were hardly any hysterics in "Midnight Paris", and I am glad that there wasn't because that would have taken away from the film's magical magnitude. Woody Allen masterfully scribes &amp; directs "Midnight in Paris" with lively ingenuity and sheer stylishness. Woody might be a little "French fried" by showcasing Paris a bit too often, but it actually plays well within the film's premise and narrative; and last I checked, the movie is called "Midnight in Paris". Owen Wilson has never been better, he is deserving of a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his captivating performance as Gil. Yes, I said it; Owen Wilson and Oscar did play out in the same sentence. Rachel McAdams was terrific as the superficial Inez. Michael Sheen delivered yet another exceptional performance here with his portrayal of Paul; remind me why Sheen has never been nominated for an Oscar? This is the Sheen that is winning with his acting! But the scene-stealer of "Midnight in Paris" is Adrien Brody who only appears for five minutes in the movie, but I guarantee you will have a "Dali" good time watching it. Johanna Debas and Darius Khondji should be shoo-ins for a Best Cinematography Oscar nomination for their picture-Paris-perfect cinematic photography of "Midnight in Paris". To be France I mean frank with you, this is the best movie I have seen so far in 2011. So go and catch a midnight show, a matinée, or any scheduled theatrical showing of "Midnight in Paris". You will have a golden time! ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen does it again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Woody Allen has written and directed another hit film that is funny and nostalgic and socially meaningful. Indeed, "Midnight in Paris" is so enticing that it outshines even some of his most recent hits. Owen Wilson is a prince of a character as Gil, the present day writer who is carried back to the years of the great impressionists and interacts with them as easily as if he were transported by a time machine. This is a romantic comedy that will entertain you while it also brings to question relationships and the meaning of life: common themes in Allen's works. None of his fans should miss this masterpiece. Don't let it slip by unless you are home bound and wish to pick up the DVD or Blu Ray at a later date. One may find that Vickie Christina Barcelona was funnier, but this cinema is both clever and deep in meaning. It is a top film of Woody Allen's and a first class film of quality and intellect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Is Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when I used to say: "Even a bad Woody Allen movie is better than most films." And I think I have seen them all - liking some films better than the critics. His recent films have been less and less interesting as he has produced scripts which recycled really old jokes of his own. Many themes come back again and again without new insight and without being very funny with the retelling. There were the familiar characters in different bodies and tired, stale material. Woody was becoming the writer/director who was once great.Midnight in Paris is the old Woody with fresh material. Owen Wilson looks the fresh-faced American he is. Gone are the elderly male coupled with the too-young young female leads. Wilson plays a successful Hollywood writer going through a career crisis. He wants so much to be an important writer of fiction - not a Hollywood hack. He adores the vision of Paris in the twenties, the "Moveable Feast" years. His bride- to-be, played by Rachel McAdams, wants a successful man who will provide a nice life. Her parents are in Paris and she wants a life like theirs. The Wilson character is a restatement of the Fitzgerald dilemma: easy money for lousy scripts versus time-consuming exhaustive effort to create important fiction.There are some hilarious lines when the four get together. It was worth watching the film for those scenes alone.There is an "Alice in Wonderland" plot twist which takes Wilson's character down the rabbit hole and back into the Paris he yearns to experience. Suddenly he is hobnobbing with the Fitzgeralds, drinking with Hemingway, flirting with Picasso's mistress and meeting the Who's Who of the Lost Generation. Gertrude Stein reads his novels and suggests changes. He is living his dream at night. He returns to the present during the day.Maybe I liked the film so much because I would like to take that ride back into time. There is a trite lesson about the fallacy of thinking that any age is a Golden Age. There are some predictable resolutions to the story, but, all in all, it is a fun film. Woody has gotten his chops back. The material is fresher, more interesting and better than he has produced in a long, long while. We have seen many films which display a love of the City of Paris. Woody adores Paris and shows us why we should love it too. It's not a hard sell. Paris is every bit as lovely as described, but he takes us to an even better place.</fullReview>

And, did we really see Owen Wilson look at his lines during one of the scenes?The story line. Is there one? Dr. Seuss is much more interesting. The movie should have been titled:Cliché's, Stereotypes, American-bashing, and Left-wing BabblingNot one memorable scene. Not one memorable line.

		<shortDescription>Well, you have to watch it. Once.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because it is a Woody Allen movie, we have to watch it.But this one, hmmm, even though I was charmed by it throughout, it was the sort of charm described by Evelyn Waugh in Brideshead.It begins with postcard/chocolate box pics of Paris that go on and on, and which we could do without.And there's a rankle throughout. We see how Owen's character goes back in time, but we don't see how he gets back, and the difference between the 20s and late nineteenth century is just not marked enough.And the biggest rankle is what does he do for money? It's bad enough suspending our disbelief when someone with long hair, an almost-beard an no tie is allowed into some of the best places in Paris of long ago. and nobody comments on his appearance. This guy should try being admitted into the Ritz in London even at breakfast time in 2011.But no money? Couldn't there have been a plot device whereby he takes something valuable back to sell? There was a TV sitcom from Britain some years ago where the character walks through into wartime London which did the whole time travel thing much better, and this film reminds me of the series.Also, Owen's character starts doing the whiney Woody Allen voice late in the film. We know Woody can't do these old bloke with a young woman roles any more but that's no reason to continue the whine when it's not Woody.And what was the purpose of the old folks, the would-be in-laws? They did not serve the plot at all, apart from when Owen needs to escape from the hotel room.And having Carla Bruni in with a speaking part is also a distraction as we are constantly reminded that, since she is the wife of the French president, Allen might have had better access to Parisian locations because of it.Can't say I'll be viewing this DVD again.</fullReview>

Namely, James Joyce, and note that ALL other writers living in Paris at that time acknowledged Joyce as THE leading writer of that generation.The main actor (character's name is Gil) was like a youthful carbon copy of Woody Allen himself. It was fluff, flimsy and barely humorous. Good acting by the American girl-friend. Also good cameo role by Michael Sheen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodnight Sweetheart in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever wondered what would happen if Woody Allen did his own version of British Sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart? Well if that's the case the closest we'll ever get to see it is in this film in which a Hollywood screenwriter turned aspiring novelist travels back in time in Paris, meeting his idols along the way and falling in love with a woman from the past.This was the first Woody Allen I'd seen so all the talk of this being a return to form meant nothing to me but for the most part it was enjoyable. It's a little slow paced and the ending rushed but the cast are all stellar names and Owen Wilson as the lead plays bewildered very well.An odd film to place as it's not really laugh out funny but equally not overly serious but nevertheless it's a decent film to seek out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor color grading, poor casting, and a flawed slow moving story but if you like Paris see it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very beginning there is an imbalance to the overall color of the film. Perhaps this is to give the film a dated look but it was not done correctly. The colors in many of the opening shots are over-saturated. Occasionally one shot will have very nice color in contrast to the rest. The technical term for this production role is color grading and I would say they left it to an intern.The story is painfully flawed and Owen Wilson is miscast in the lead role. Michael Sheen on the other hand is very believable and funny. It can be pleasing to enjoy the scenes in Paris, some of the historic characters and events can capture the imagination but over all it doesn't work and isn't a solid film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Schuman has nailed it.There is hardly anything he has left to say about this movie, during which my wife actually went to sleep. In spite of the almost universally laudatory reviews it has received, I found it disappointingly shallow. The famous characters of 20s Paris are caricatures, particularly Hemingway, and mostly are an insult to the audience's intelligence. It's like attending an elementary school class of Who was Who in the literary and artistic Paris of the time. Owen Wilson's performance, channeling Woody Allen, is often embarrassingly naive and the character's final decision undermines the film's ostensible message which anyway is a cliché. Paris is pretty, Marion Cotillard and Adrian Brody are good, but apart from that forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Midnight in Paris won an Oscar and most of the critics' hearts, it is a tedious mountain of clichés, which could only be a testament to Hollywood's marketing success. Allen's age is showing itself; the plot is slow-paced and dull. The film opens with the everlasting cinematography of Darius Khondji, which reminded of Allen's film back in 1979: Manhattan. After that, we see Owen Wilson starring as Gil, personating Allen; a foolishly naive and utterly lost writer, engaged to a spoiled shrew; Inez (Rachel McAdams). Gil is a fan-boy, who is obsessed with Paris in its glorious times and the celebrities living in that era, possibly due to living amongst intolerably arrogant people. Later on, Gil miraculously finds himself in that golden age, where you can't even drink a beer without bumping into Hemingway. He meets several reputable writers and artists, thanks to meaningless hospitality of the people of those times. Instead of using this lifetime opportunity for inspiration and success, he chooses partying and womanizing in the clumsiest way. What we get is a straightforward Hollywood flicker about an American man, hanging out with Americans in Paris.The characterization is another disappointment. Each individual is one- dimensional, and therefore overemphasized. They immediately split into two groups; good or evil. The relationships between characters are also baloney. Gil's engagement is absurd; when he tries to find something common between them, the only thing he can think of is Indian food. Moreover, the celebrities that Gil meets seem to jump out of Wikipedia; jabbering cheesy quotes, and nothing more. Allen's choice of not showing anything related to these talented people's creativity, influence or hard work is an absolute shame. All these elements are probably supposed to be ironic and humorous, but they rather make the film shallow and cartoony. From the technical aspect, Midnight in Paris tries to justify its fame. Except the nostalgic-colored tint used everywhere in the film, the shooting is gratifying. The transitions are fairly well. The photography is pleasant with alluring scenes of Paris. Music is the greatest factor of the film, which makes it bearable. However, these are definitely insufficient to defeat the lackluster atmosphere of the film. Allen wastes time by showing unnecessarily long scenes; he seems to have a hard time even in a 94 minute film. Midnight in Paris is about a juvenile man, who cannot cope with 21st century's dominant personas, whose only passion is walking in the rain. Even for fans of Allen, there are better alternatives. If you want to see a true Parisian film with genuine love and wit, watch Amélie instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Master of Story and Dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of Woody Allen since I saw Annie Hall. I love his use of dialogue, satire, and indie style. Actor Owen Wilson surprised me the most. He is usually type casted into arrogant womanizing male lead roles. In Woody Allen's film he plays a dreamer, a romantic and plays it quite well. Rachel Mcadams steps out of her comfort zone by playing his materialistic soon to be bride. They are complete opposites. While Mcdams character is concerned with living a charmed life in Malibu, Wilson's character is an idealist. He is nostalgic of the past and has a romanticized vision of Paris. He is so nostalgic he really has no interest in his present reality and wishes to live amongst the great writers and artists of the roaring 1920s. Woody Allen manages to create a fantasy world without the use of special effects. Woody Allen is about story; great writing with a sharp wit. Anyone who enjoys classic American literature or Woody Allen's humor will enjoy this cinematic treasure. I would love to see this again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paris, Magic, and Woody Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen has put out a movie a year since the early 70's. Sometimes the critics love it, sometimes they're indifferent. Regardless, Allen's movies are always entertaining and elegant. His latest film, Midnight in Paris, is no exception. With a highly original plot, great acting, and masterful direction, this is one of the best movies of the year, and one of Allen's greatest accomplishments.The great comedian would have loved to cast himself as Gil, the American screenwriter spending time in Paris, but instead he puts Owen Wilson in the role, who essentially plays a Woody Allen-type character. Gil's fiancée, Inez, has very little in common with him. They disagree on almost everything, and Rachel McAdams gives a nice flair of bitchiness to the character. Their discord is heightened when Paul, an old friend of hers, shows up. He spews out knowledge that may or may not be right, and only Gil (along with the audience) see him for the shmuck he really is. So at night Gil walks the streets of his beloved Paris, and at the stroke of midnight, he is transported to 1920's Paris, meeting his literary and artistic heroes. And that's just the first plot twist.The characters in this film are all classic Allen. Gil is neurotic, unhappy, and a defeatist. His fiancée is unsympathetic, and her parents are materialistic snobs. But the "modern day" parts pale in comparison to the colorful characters Gil meets after midnight. Adrien Brody, Corey Stoll, Kathy Bates, and the majestic Marion Cotillard all portray quirky, bizarre, and excellent caricatures of 1920's authors and artists. There is a shot in the film that exemplifies the feeling of time travel in a Woody Allen movie. Wilson sits in a 20's bar listening to swing music with an unbelieving and almost disturbed look on his face. But slowly he gets into the music, and all care of how he got there vanishes.This is certainly one of Allen's most original ventures, ranking with his 80's masterpieces like Zelig and The Purple Rose of Cairo. He directs Midnight in Paris with a poetic hand, filling his film with dim, smoky bars, rainy city streets, and steamy romance. His script is heavily laced with obscure references, but fear not; the movie is still gut-bustlingly funny even if you've never heard of Salvador Dali.This reviewer would encourage you to see any Woody Allen movie, but this one in particular is a knockout. Perhaps because it combines such classic Allen characters and puts them in a new, original, and inspired environment. The only complaint one could make is that the movie is over much too soon.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a song of love for the city of magics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no better way to see this wonderful film of Woody Allen than in an art cinema on the Rive Gauche, then go out and just wonder through the streets of the city. Some miracle will happen, even if it may not be identical to the one happening to the hero in the movie. Miracles are not supposed to be identical any way, are they? Gil, the hero of the movie is a script-writer at Hollywood, successful enough not to care about being in love with the wrong girl, successful enough not to care to walk away from her and her corporate magnate daddy when he realizes what we all know from the first scene - she is not up to him, to his artistic and human aspirations, to his dreams to become a real writer and maybe live in Paris like Scott Fitzgerald and Hemingway did in the golden 20s and 30s of the previous century. So when magic happens and a classic Citroen picks him at midnight to meet his idols and Picasso, and Dali (Adrien Brody) and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) and the lovely Adriana (Marion Cotillard), un-famous muse to Picasso and Modigliani and interest of love for the 21st century Gil and maybe for other 19th century artists nobody is too astonished. We are not because Woody Allen tells the story with the fluidity of the feelings and sentiments rather than caring for any rational or mechanical explanation, and the hero is not because his idols behave exactly as they are described in text books. Is our representation of the past more a collection of clichés than a true representation of what really was? This is one of the more serious questions triggered by the film only after the viewers quit the screening theater. Is everybody more or less unhappy with his own present and seeking the refuge in a Golden Age which looked close proves not to be as shining as from the perspective of history, certainly not for those who live it as present?The charm of the movie and its omnipresent element of continuity is provided by the presence of the city for which 'Midnight in Paris' is a love declaration. The film starts with a series of postcard or touristic shots in the city, just to fill them with content and flavor. In Allen's view in this film Paris is the kingdom beyond the mirror. The didactic message may be as obvious as ever in Allen's films and is even enhanced by the off-screen voice which sounds like Allen's whoever is the actor that plays the story teller - Allen himself or somebody else. For Paris lovers this is the song that they always wanted to hear. The rest are in danger to become Paris lovers after seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Escaping the present</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lately it looks like I am only watching one movie a year in the movie theatre and that is the one Woody Allen puts out. Especially the American movie industry seems to be determined to produce only movies I am not interested in. I have never been a big fan of Paris, so I did not see the movie for the city unlike the movie Vicky, Christina Barcelona, which I mainly went to see because of Barcelona. But I have always loved period films and like everybody else I dream about having been born at a different time and place, ignoring of course the problems of times passed.Midnight in Paris transports you back in time to show you only the positive side: the greatest artists, the most beautiful women in wonderful clothes, delightful music and joie de vivre in a beautiful city. So sit back and enjoy the ride. This is what movies are supposed to do. Transport you to another time and place and let you forget the present for the time of the movie. Plus you do not forget the movie immediately because the thought behind it stays with you.Bravo, Woody Allen. And this must be one of the most beautiful movie posters.</fullReview>

SLEEPERS dealt with a man who was cryogenically frozen in the 1970's, only to reawaken a hundred years later in a quasi-dystopian future that's equal parts George Orwell and Groucho Marx. Whereas, in A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S SEX COMEDY, Woody dealt with a group of Victorian-era couples who were torn between how they felt about their attraction to each other's spouses in the physical world versus what might happen to them, in the next world, if they acted on those feelings.Now, he deals with a guy who feels literally born out of his time. What the pedantic Ray calls "Golden Age thinking." One of the few things he spouts off about that I agree with (and, probably, so did the rest of my fellow movie-goers, who were mostly over 60!).Gil Pender idolizes the Paris of the post-World War I "Lost Generation." But, Adriana--the model/costume designer he gradually falls for in that period--idolizes the "Beautiful Epoch" of the 1890's. And, in trying to hang on to her, when they inadvertently visit the latter era, he has a brilliant realization. Nostalgia, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder!What each of us regard as the "Good Old Days" weren't entirely good at the time. And, the times we live in now aren't entirely bad. Although, the trick to having a life-long relationship, in these modern times, is finding someone who shares those feelings. Someone not addicted to just the here-and-now (like Inez and her parents). Yet, someone who can also revere the past without naively worshipping it!Gil is lucky in the end. He finds his soul mate. Of course, he had Woody Allen (who, I believe, also provided most of the background clarinet music in this film) helping him from behind the scenes! The rest of us have to manage, more or less, on our own.Don't let that stop you from enjoying this little gem, however. Especially, if it can provide you some much needed laughs of the old-fashioned (= non-raunchy) kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen's Most Entertaining Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's latest film might be his most entertaining and rewarding ever. Midnight in Paris is hardly new material for Allen. Many people have long accused him of recycling old ideas. At the same time, Allen's newest creation touches on familiar ground but still seems refreshing all the same.Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is a successful Hollywood screenwriter spending some free time with his fiancée Inez (Rachal McAdams) in the French capital. They too are a classic mismatched couple familiar to Allen fans. Gil an aspiring novelist hopes the inspiration of Paris will help him complete his first novel. Inez on the other hand is content spending time shopping and dancing with a 'pedantic' old flame named Paul played by Michael Sheen.Gil believes that he is wasting his talent at screen writing and dreams up a story revolving around a nostalgic shop. He is particularly fascinated with Paris in the 1920s when it was home to many great artists, poets, writers and even filmmakers of that time. Michael Sheen's character Paul refers to it as 'golden age thinking,' that your personality is best suited in a specific time frame of the past.The film explores the idea that many people think that their lives would be easier or more fruitful if they had been born at another time. But in reality the people of any so called golden age likely long for a different time frame. It is mostly found in people with a deep intellectual curiosity. Perhaps the idea is erroneous like Paul says. But Woody Allen's film seems to say,'So what?' Perhaps it is not the allure of Paris in the 1920s that is so engrossing Allen. Perhaps it is the bleak pessimism of the present that is so troubling to Allen. Gil's materialistic fiancée, her right wing Republican parents and the pretentious pseudo-intellectual played by Martin Sheen are clearly archetypes of people in his own time.Midnight in Paris is typical of many Allen films. There are bad romances. There are true romances that could never be fulfilled. This film is not as multi-layered as Annie Hall and Manhattan, widely held to be his best work. But you will not care.You will not really care to know why exactly he is picked up at the same corner of Paris by a classic Peugeot every night at midnight either. Midnight in Paris might just be the most entertaining Allen film ever. It is as mesmerizing and full of charm as the people he meets in his adventures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody at his peak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Midnight in Paris" is the best Woody Allen film I know, by several miles. The night before seeing it I happened to see another of Woody's films, "Deconstructing Harry," and the proximity was convenient for telling the difference. "Midnight in Paris" is based on an act of imagination, with Allen's quirky humor placed at the service of it. "Deconstructing Harry," like pretty much everything else Allen has made, is a long string of one-liners inspired by Woody's self-regarding. It seems that Woody has finally learned to take himself out of the frame and to create a structure that gives something of value to the viewer. Is it a great film? Let's see how it plays in the memory. I knew I was hooked when I felt the wonder experienced by Owen Wilson's character. That moment breathes authentically; and Woody's persona is nowhere near. The film has its share of flaws but many more beauties. I especially respect the film for ending at precisely the place it should. How many of today's films or fictions can make that claim, or would bother to?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Woody Allen's best. An ostensibly simple tale of an engaged American couple (Owen Wilson and Rachel McMadams) holidaying in Paris with her parents. Of course, they are unsuited. Of course, Wilson's character is a writer. He would like nothing better than to retreat into another world, another time, and maybe to live in Paris. Cinderella-like, at the stroke of twelve each night he finds what he is looking for in an imaginative, Spielberg-esque way. This is a clever allegory into the essence of dissatisfaction, and Allen does not hesitate to name-drop (and character-drop) in the most delightful way throughout the film. Michael Sheen is good as the professor you love to hate, the know-it-all to whom Owen's fiancée appears very much in thrall. One of Owen Wilson's best performances in any film, this shows his softer more human side. And watch out for a superb cameo appearance by Adrien Brody...the word 'rhinoceros' will never sound the same ever again. Simply outstanding. I didn't actually want the film to end. Nine stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's charm is here in full effect. Watching Owen Wilson walking down the beautiful streets of Paris and transport back in time is very "Allen-esque." Owen Wilson plays Gil, who is soon to be married. He wants to stay in Paris, but his fiancé, Inez, doesn't which causes Gil to wander the streets at midnight, where he is taken to the 1920's, where he always wanted to live. It is a simple plot, with a simple, and can I say cute, message. Owen Wilson is on the top of his game here, and he contributes to the funny moments of the movie. The rest of the cast was fine, playing the roles to predictable. The characters that Gil are introduced to us are each unique, and interesting. Especially Brody's cameo, which was done very well.The best part apart this movie is the cinematography. Every shot is beautiful and Woody picks some perfect locations, and there are a lot of famous landmarks. A lot of the shots contain a lit up Eiffel Tower.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading other reviews/opinions ~ I must add mine as well. When I saw the trailer (via computer &amp; IMDb) I KNEW I had to see this film. the lines outside the theatre were around the block. We were next in line for the following show . . yeah, that popular. My 1st impression of it had me oohing and aahing, and laughing as well with the rest of the audience. I love "time-travel", love Paris, love Woody Allen, so naturally, this movie swept me away. My original thought of "why Owen Wilson"? was quickly quelled when I realized he's the perfect Southern Calif. man from 2011. He played it to the hilt! It gave all the other actors a special patina of another era. And Woody wrapped it up nicely, even if we suspected this might occur. I want to see it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up front I gotta say I'm not a fan of either Woody Allen or Owen Wilson, but after all this time, he finally found something to say, and Wilson does a good job as Allen's proxy, using his mannerisms without being as obnoxious about them.It's hard to imagine anyone but a hard core action anarchist not liking this movie. I won't talk about the story. I went in cold (I'd even forgotten Allen had directed it), and it's the best way to view it IMNTBHO.Suffice it to say that it's a love story set in Paris which involves Paris, and it's not for nothing that he filmed "Manhattan[" in B&amp;W while this is in color. The cinematography, comedic lines, dialog and the message were exhilarating as was the casting for every role. My only nit, a biggie for me, was the music; it was absolutely appropriate but I'm not a Cole Porter fan who was the featured.Some will probably accuse the subject matter of being a little trite, but what overall plot hasn't been done before. There are people who don't realize that the secret's in the sauce, that only it can elevate the best steak from just juicy and tender to a masterpiece.I even love the poster, even though they didn't show "Starry Night" in the film or go inside the Louvre (that I noticed--I mean, as long as they did all the other stuff...?). It would have been nice to feature Marion Cotillard in it instead of Wilson but what the hell you gonna do--the plot hinges on him.Magnificent (only half a step short of a masterpiece) 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one knows the American character like Allen, no one manages to bring it on screen like him either. This film is his best, there are way too many layers to bring everything here because there are several stories going on and the audience can pick and choose which one they will follow. They can be the American tourists in Paris "getting some art" and shopping and consequently follow the little love story Allen has utilized to tell his bigger story ? that of Western thought and the role of literature in Western civilization. Sad that one has to add glitter to a film to convey a more meaningful story ? but in this case his managed it well in that it doesn't take over the story. Nostalgia is one of the central themes of the movie as something that Allen has been consumed with always but now he manages to peal the onion more academically by bringing in authorities in the field who he identifies with from Hemingway (who he trivializes a little with his American bravado) to Gertrude Stein ? all of whom give their 2 cents on nostalgia, life, art and existence in the terms that Allen has been obsessing throughout his career. Why would anyone give this film less than maximum points is beyond me, not because Allen is the greatest living American thinker but because no other film, at least in the last few years, has managed to capture what 21st century humans have become in the context of time?neurotic, anxious and superficial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a Woody Allen fan doesn't make me the most objective of reviewers, but after seeing this I have to admit it: Woody Allen has done it again! Contrary to his most recent films (and mind you I thought Vicky Christina Barcelona was really mediocre) Midnight in Paris leaves you with the most pleasant flavour of bittersweet nostalgia that makes your heart beat at a faster pace. With an incredible plot vehicle, remarkable acting and a marvellous scenery, the film is bound to entertain, with the real sense of the word. The humour is a bit difficult to catch for anyone who skipped his Art and Modern History classes, yet it manages to provoke laughter even if you don't take all the jokes. Owen Wilson is great as the "Woody" character, Marion Cotillard is extraordinary as always, and the rest of the cast ensemble is also in great shape. I loved Adrian Brody's scene, while I also enjoyed very much Kathy Bates, who is an incredible character actor. The idea behind the film is very clever, reminiscent of the Purple Rose of Cairo but taking it to a whole new level, and also quite thought-provocative. All in all a great film certainly not one to miss!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely belongs among Woody's Best and also the best of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen does what very few filmmakers can do. He makes you fall in love with the characters. All of his movies have been character driven films and they all have a certain flare about them that separates his films from everyone else and in Midnight in Paris it really shows. The films stars just like all of his other films a huge cast of talented actors. Owen Wilson, Rachael Mcadams, Marion Cotillard, Kurt Filler, Alison Pill, and Tom Hiddleston. They all shine in this film and even when some of the actors have small roles they leave a lasting impression.If you love Paris you will differently love this love letter to the wonderful city. Woody Allen continues to prove why he is considered one of the best filmmakers around with this movie. Also Owen Wilson plays a fantastic Woody Allen and gives the best performance of his career. Alison Pill is wonderful with the southern accent and really shines in her role as does Tom Hiddleston. Also There's the always great Rachael Mcadams who's as talented as beautiful. Woody Allen shot Paris quite wonderfully and makes want to live in Paris in the 20's in the rain. The script which was written in the mid 2000's and Woody Allen tried to get this film made but it was to expensive so he had time to work on this script and it really shows because like some of his recent movies like Cassendra's Dream it probably would have been better with a little more work on the script and here is prime example why.If this film does not get any accolades by the end of the year it would quite shocking. Especially for the acting which everyone deserves recognition. With its great acting and its wonderful writing and directing this defiantly is one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody's personality, and his films, have a powerful ability to irritate. This one, although casting as bland a set of actors as one can assemble, strikes out into territory where Allen simply hasn't a clue, leading to yet another example of Allen's misguided belief that one can "figure out" love. Allen's view of love is so ridiculously inane that it can only lead to what we have here - an inanely stupid romantic comedy. The jokes are second grade material, as usual, and the supposedly non-comedic part is just plain gooey trash, which tries unsuccessfully to avoid the goo by promoting his brainless "lesson" about life. Allen doesn't live life - he spends all his time trying to understand what it is. Ditto for love. So far, few have ever been so unsuccessful at doing so. I expect another dozen films from this serial filmmaker before he finally either goes totally senile, or passes away. Either would be welcomed news for theatergoers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is good to a see a comedy not designed for cognitively impaired twenty-year olds. You don't have to be drunk or stoned to enjoy this film. It has a cute plot gimmick, one that would be appreciated by The Onion fans (I am one) Wilson plays the Woody Allen character very well, all the other performances are fine, except Carla Bruni, who looks like she has stumbled into the movie by mistake. Once in the scene, she seems to be searching for a quick escape route.The problem with this film is that those of us who followed the Allen brand since it's inception know that better films were made with similar plot lines: a fantasy character (or more) intervene in a character's life and change it.(Play It Again Sam, The Purple Rose of Cairo) However, in this movie there are numerous characters of the 1920s, all cartoons with with little joke lines. Gertrude Stein is a butch, curt lady and Hemingway pontificates, each is on screen for a couple of minutes, then goodbye. None of these "characters" actually interact in any meaningful way with Wilson, the protagonist. Then it is all wrapped up in a facile platitude and a happy ending.It could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Losing the Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is little in this film that is watchable, unless one would entertain the idea of seeing a pseudo-nostalgic travelogue, pellmell concoction laid on as a haphazard tapestry of lifeless blasts from the past. It is not that those splendid greats are of no import nowadays; it is the author who makes them seem so.The script should never have been approved, since it ought to have failed the crucial question of, Does it have legs? It has none, squatting flat on its belly, with no lift-off in sight. The writing is so bad it could have come from a teenager eager to emulate his living hero, the Great Woody. But that is the problem with heroes: as long as they are alive, they can fail. In this instance, badly indeed.Anyone aspiring to be a film director should disqualify himself just by casting, or accepting the casting of, Wilson. The sudden flight of bullets is less deadly than this made-for-TV actor. However, in this instance and fluffily coiffed, he is not as deadly as the script, and obviously follows the guidance of his puppet master. He plays Woody capably enough, which makes the experience even more nauseating. If such alter ego business was revolting with Branagh in yesteryear, here we hit the bottom all right.Yet it is not an unmitigated disaster, and there are some bright spots. Like the legs of Rachel McAdams; or, the bum of Rachel McAdams; or, the tits of Rachel McAdams, I would be delighted to say - but I cannot. As it happens, they are not much in sight. Still, McAdams shines through, and if we went for a targeted edit of shots showing her, there would suddenly be full five minutes of eminently watchable production. Instead, the author gives us another ninety, of no interest at all.It would be too harsh to claim that He lost the plot, though; in this particular case, there simply was no plot to start with. Rest in peace, Mr Konigsberg!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We felt like driving to the airport to get a flight to Paris after seeing this gorgeous, funny and poignant film. For Woody Allen fans there are numerous characters, scenes and lines that relate to his body of work. However, he puts them together with a fresh approach, and Owen Wilson is surprisingly perfect as the conflicted first time novelist.In fact, ALL the cast are just spot-on perfect in their roles, and the sets and costumes are fantastic. It's doubtful that a 'small' movie like this will get Academy consideration, but it should at least for the costumes and set design. The main plot line dictates a LOT of demands on these crafts.I urge you to see this movie on the big screen to drink in the full body of Woody Allen's vision.</fullReview>

Owen Wilson was just great, and who would have thought that. The cast was uniformly superb and the issues of life were so very compelling. The theory of the movie was that we are all unhappy with being in the present and wish we could return to a "perfect" era. Thus does Wilson LOVE Paris and Paris at Midnight which leads to some wonderful escapades,This is a master at work, and in the full prime of his talent. This will be a classic.

		<shortDescription>Midnight in Paris....... Reinvigorating Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's 2011 flick 'Midnight in Paris' is a average watch. A highly entertaining first hr works on its advantage all the way, but a dull and dry second spoils the fun completely. I enjoyed the film, because it had 3 hot babes in its kitty. Watch this flick if you've got nothing to do.Woody Allen Productions has hardly done much good work in the last few years. Whatever Works (which i didn't think was particularly brilliant, but we'll discuss that in its own review) was the only successful film from the so-called powerhouse production company. Personally, I rather enjoyed Broadway Danny Rose, but I can understand why it was hard to digest by most audiences.Whether it's the timing, the cast, the story, the screenplay, or even the music, Woody Allen scores in all.Midnight in Paris is a romantic comedy about a regular guy who's been around with many women, finally falling in love, but getting rejected, and then going on a journey to redeem himself. Warm, funny at times and definitely interesting.With the exception of Adrien Brody, who emerges as a rather wooden actor, the performances were all good. The winner here is definitely Owen Wilson as Gil, who carries a charismatic glow with him in every frame that leaves you with not much else to look at. He's got a very likable quality about him and I can only see him flourish with his future ventures. Lea Seydoux does a good job as the french girl next door, and Kathy Bates's role has been written out rather meaty as well (excuse the pun).Fresh locations can be a bore if they are out of context, or can be forgotten if they are used as mere background, but Midnight in Paris uses its locations to the fullest. Add to that some good music, where every song fits in, and you have a successful music album.I give this movie a much more than just "safe-to-watch" recommendation. Highly enjoyable. Great direction, good screenplay and high production values. Woody Allen has finally managed to crack out of the mold of mundane.</fullReview>
