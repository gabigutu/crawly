		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was great, and I hope it comes out on DVD real soon. Beatty became Reed in more than one sense--not only did he act the part, but he directed the movie in a way reminiscent of the kind of "new journalistic" style that Reed and his fellow MASSES writers pioneered, mixing the drama with interviews of people who knew JR, Louise, etc.The film also sort of puts forward the question, "What if, instead of running back to Russia (to die of kidney failure and mistreatment by the CP), Jack Reed had stayed in this country to build the CP? Would it have turned out to become Stalinist?" According to Howe and Coser, who wrote a good book on THE AMERICAN COMMUNIST PARTY, much like Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht in Germany, Reed was the ONLY leader who was independent, who had some real backbone.The best part of the movie is when Emma Goldmann, played by Maureen Stapleton, tells Jack that "it doesn't work" (i.e. statist, bureaucratic socialism that the Bolsheviks were instituting as a grossly mistaken response to the economic crisis and Allied invasion of Russia after the Revolution). And then his rebellion against the lying propaganda of Zinoviev. Kind of hits me right now that Jerzy Kosinski should play Zinoviev--didn't he commit suicide when he was exposed as a plagiarist? Where is the line between art and reality, politics and life?Of course I loved the romantic reality between Beatty, Bryant, and Nicholson (Reed, Bryant, and Eugene O'Neill). And the cynicism that Reed expresses about the Democrats and Wilson is certainly apropos today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reds, a succinct, controversial title totally typical of a major directorial outing by Warren Beatty. We always knew that Beatty was on the left, but a film glamourising a known Communist who defected to the USSR and is buried within the Kremlin. How the studios let him make it is a mystery to me, but I suppose that the name Warren Beatty was enough.The film is long, and not for the light-hearted. It covers the broad canvas of early 20th Century American socialism. Concentrating first on Reeds efforts to form an American Socialist party, before moving to Russia; Beatty plays Jack Reed, the playboy writer, journalist and socialist. He opposes the war after initially supporting Wilson at the Democratic convention. After the Russian Revolution he becomes enamoured with the newly founded Soviet Union, as does his wife and sparring partner Louise Bryant, marvellously played by Diane Keaton who is excellent as the proto-feminist Bryant. Self-assured and very sexy, and her tragic love triangle between her, Reed and Jack Nicholson's character is brilliant. A number of other actors also crop up, including Paul Sorvino and M. Emmet Walsh.One of the most important films of its generation, and every movie fan should make this compulsory viewing. Any aspiring left-wing intellectual should also make this compulsory viewing - there were Communists and Socialists in America, and one of them is even buried in the Kremlin. The USSR may be reviled these days, but you cannot deny the hope and utopianism that swept the world in those first few years after the 1917 Revolution. Beatty brings all this marvellously to the screen in Reds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Monumental Achievement in Epic Film-Making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Reds" is a 200-minute epic masterpiece which deals with left-wing American journalist John Reed (Warren Beatty in an Oscar-nominated performance) and his coverage of the Russian Revolution of the 1910s. Beatty's passion is what carries this ambitious film, which could have easily been a multi-million dollar disaster. His Oscar-winning direction, screenplay, and overall performance carry the film as far as it can possibly go. The top-flight performances by Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson (both Oscar-nominated), and Maureen Stapleton (Oscar-winning) all add great depth to the performance. Paul Sorvino, Edward Herrmann, and Gene Hackman also make lasting impressions in supporting roles. Overall a great achievement all the way around. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warren Beatty's Reds follows only Gone With The Wind in my list of favourite films. This movie is both a love story, and a documentary. It educates the viewer not just on John Reed and his comrades, but on WWI era society in general.This brilliant script, (which, like the writings of Jack Reed expresses his political feelings with the same poetic eloquence as his love poems to his wife Louise), is interspersed with commentary from Jack's contemporaries, who tell the history from their own unique perspectives. As the truth of what was going on in that community is such an illusive thing, the only way to tell this story accurately was to show the often completely opposite view points of what was going on as told by the people for whom this history is a first hand memory.The acting in Reds is breath taking. Every member of this, extremely large, cast committed fully to their characters. One feels a true connection to even those characters who lurked in the background with only occasional lines. The most notable performances were by Beatty himself, (who's embodiment of Jack Reed was incredible), Diane Keaton, (who portrayed all the facets of Louise's personality with stunning realism), Jack Nickelson, (who delivers O'Neil's quick witted dialogue with an almost frightening cynicism), and Maureen Stapelton, (who conveyed an amazing strength as Emma Goldman). While these actors were the most prominently featured, all the actors delivered noteworthy performances as far as I'm concerned.The political history covered in this movie is nothing if not vast. This is proof of Beatty's most impressive knowledge of history. This is a film I would recommend be shown in schools, as one the most in depth study of American communism on screen to date.Reds is truly an inspiration, and should be seen by every actor, director, writer, liberal, film maker, history buff &amp; movie lover! You will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great companion piece to 1965's 'Doctor Zhivago'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Beatty's 'Reds' is a terrific film that is not only great story telling in the conventional Hollywood way but also has an original style of narration told in many ways from the point of view of witnesses to the real story who lived during the days the film is centred around.The film is especially significant to view since the iron curtain in Russia has come down and 'Reds' is a movie that never looks dated and stresses the fact that morals at the early part of the 20th century were about the same as they are now. It's just that no one discussed it back then and it emphasizes that times change but people don't.With top notch performances from the entire cast, it is one of the few films to be nominated for an Oscar in all four acting categories and was victorious in the Best Supporting Actress category for Maureen Stapleton although the film's best performance comes from Diane Keaton who should have won her second Oscar.To date, Beatty is the only film maker to be Oscar nominated for Best Director, Actor, Screenwriter and Producer twice for the same film. The other time was for 1978's 'Heaven Can Wait'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Forget..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.I am old enough to have lived through (probably) three different Americas. These are radically different worlds. It isn't just the mood, styles or state of the economy; its the adoption of a whole cosmology. Religions change under our feet. Family, love, belonging. These things are malleable yet largely beyond our control and we forget what "things were like." Memory always is constructed in terms of the present world. Always.So projects like this are necessary. We cannot know who we are unless we remind ourselves who we were.The ordinary fold here is a romance, folded into grand political actions. Here they are a bit more cerebral than usual, but never getting past the notion of simple justice.The more unusual and complex fold is that we see a story based on real events and people. Interspersed with that story are interviews of people who were personally involved in the story. These are remarkable, the way they are captured and the way they are edited to overlap with and annotate the story. But much more engaging is that these are enticing people, many with minds and phases that invite us into their faces ? made warmer and more open by Beatty's camera. I compare this to the "Up" serious and the contrast is astonishing. True, here we want to be informed about the lives of others, and the "Up" goals pretend that the people randomly selected decades ago are remotely worth knowing.But these folks are. We want more, simply based on their implicit invitation, and we carry ourselves into the narrative more forcefully, sort of like the characters do. This is folding doing its job and doing it well. They remember. I remember, and therefore am.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An engrossing film about John Reed's love affair with Louise Bryant and his struggles in the midst of the Russian Revolution. There are great performances from Beatty, Keaton, Nicholson (excellent as Eugene O'Neill) and Stapelton in her Oscar winning performance as Emma Goldman. Beatty's precision and timing in the use of his camera in this picture is a superb achievement. There is a touch of David Lean in director Beatty in this film. The color, the editing, the sound. All of those important filmic elements are at play here in great form. Beatty won the Best Director Oscar, but lost the Best Picture award to Chariots of Fire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warren Beatty makes himself the only director to get Oscar nominations in Best Producer (picture), director, actor and writer twice (Heaven Can Wait is the other one), and he won his only Oscar (besides his honorary Thalberg award in 2000) for direction here. And it is well deserved. Mainly because this is the best film about communism and other political issues ever made. Here, Beatty portrays journalist and idealist John Reed to maximum potential. He also comes of great with Diane Keaton as his love. Long, yet immensly entertaining and interesting, which was one of the few political films (besides maybe South Park) that got me thinking about communism. By the way, this film also won best conematography (Vittoro Storatto) and Best Supporting Actress (Maureen Stapleton as Emma Goldman), though I think it should've also won Oscars for Nicholson and Beatty. One of the better films (top 20) of the decade. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How this was nominated for anything completely escapes me. This movie signifies everything wrong with the 70's style of movie making- letting the director (who happens to be the lead actor) do pretty much anything he wants- scenes that ramble on and on in an effort to be "realistic- trying to cram way too much into an already overlong film.At no point in the film did I feel like the characters were not "acting". Every set piece felt like another staged scene forced upon my already dulled and bored senses. Good old Jack does his best, but he wasn't in the movie long enough to save it from disaster. Way to similar in style and result to "Heaven's Gate".Maybe I got my expectations up from all the positive reviews I've read over the years. They were wrong, though. One more thing- didn't one of those Russian leaders look and sound just like Eugene Levy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All those Oscar nominations? And three wins? You have to be kidding! I'll grant that the cast is a good one, headed up by Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton, with a smaller part for Jack Nicholson, supported by lesser known but very talented actors like Maureen Stapleton, Paul Sorvino, Dolph Sweet and Ian Wolfe among others, but even a good cast can't turn a complete snoozer into an Academy Award winner, so I'm just left wondering what happened with this one.Essentially the movie tells the story of left-wing American journalist Jack Reed (Beatty), whose journey to Russia in 1917 to report on the Revolution there made him a committed Communist. Frankly, the first half of the movie is filled with far too much of two things: i) interviews with the "talking heads" - identified in the credits as "witnesses" who I guess had known Reed and his love interest Louise Bryant (Keaton), and ii) interminable portrayals of the tempestuous relationship between the two. The title of the movie suggests that the focus of the movie is on the leftist movement, but at times this comes close to being little more than a typical Hollywood romance. The second half of the movie, set mostly in Russia, finally downplays those two problems. There's a depiction of the battle for recognition from the Comintern (Communist International) by two competing U.S. Communist Parties, and we see Reed drafted as a propagandist by the Bolshevik authorities in Moscow.The movie seems to avoid taking a hard position either for or against communism. Its weaknesses and failures are clearly pointed out, although overall I'd say the "feel" of the movie was favourable to the reds. Frankly, though, my real reaction to this film was to be bored almost to tears virtually from the first moment, when began several minutes of the talking heads - well - talking. The movie really lost me then, and it never managed to get me back - not even close. My gut tells me I can't do anything but a 1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Reds"- A Love Story told inside period politics at the height of the Russian Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bolshevik leader V.I. Lenin once wrote, "The capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them."Lenin's quote came to mind when I was watching one of the most spellbinding movies to come along in years,and not since David Lean's brilliant 1965 epic classic "Doctor Zhivago" hasn't been a movie in recent memory that has come close. That motion picture is "Reds",released in 1981 by Paramount Pictures. The film was Warren Beatty's peeve project which he served not only as it star,but also the co-writer and direction. Director Warren Beatty's epic love story about American writers John Reed and Louise Bryant,set amid of the turbulence of American politics in the 1910's World War I and the Russian revolution that set this movie into plain focus. The movie itself is astounding to behold and is a tragic love story between the writers John Reed(Warren Beatty),and Louise Bryant(Diane Keaton). But it creatively used artsy,radical Greenwich Village in the 1910's-and such as real-life characters as playwright Eugene O'Neill(Jack Nicholson),and anarchist activist Emma Goldman(Maureen Stapleton)-as well as the drama of the Russian Revolution and the subsequent civil war as the principal landscapes in which their relationship plays out.Director Beatty also made creative use of on-camera "testimony" by the likes of novelists Henry Miller and Rebecca West,Republican politician Hamilton Fish,comic George Jessel and civil libertarian Roger Baldwin. These senior citizens recall,with varying degrees of historical accuracy,Reed,Bryant and the times in which they lived. "Reds" shows convincingly that many of the contemporary issues in politics and culture have their antecendents in the first debates of the 20th century. Debates over birth control and abortion,marriage and commitment,public life versus private life,revolution versus reform are given full expression from varying viewpoints throughout the lengthy film(which runs over three hours). To Beatty's credit,his film captures the excitement the Bolshevik revolution stirred,both inside and outside Russia while revealing how the Bolshevik leadership quickly began to suppressing dissent within the revolutionary ranks on the way to becoming a dictatorship with a country that is in constant turmoil. Beatty's efforts certainly paid off artistically,bringing him prestige to him and Paramount making "Reds" a huge box office success for the studio when it premiered in theatres around Christmas of 1981."Reds" became one of the top highest grossing pictures of that year,and it paid off in high standards too. "Reds",which received 12 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture,lost an upset to Hugh Hudson's "Chariots Of Fire" in the Best Picture category. However it won three Oscars for Best Director(Warren Beatty),Best Supporting Actress(Maureen Stapleton),and Best Cimematopgraphy(Vittorio Storaro). Eventually,"Reds" made more than $40 million at the domestic box office,and once international figures were added in,it became one of the top grossing films of the 1980's. A feat Warren Beatty is still proud of to this day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked out of this movie when it first came out. It was boring, pretentious, and preachy when it came out and, on a reviewing, it was still the same.A synopsis of the plot: The two main characters, Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton, first have a loud preachy argument, they then have makeup sex, then something important in history happens. Repeat as needed until more than three hours pass.One of the ten best films? Really? Are Porkys I, II and III also in the top ten?This film is loaded with self absorbed, angry, yelling characters. No cast managed to portray as many unlikeable characters this effectively until the advent of the Sopranos. At least in the Sopranos case it was a conscious decision.</fullReview>

If you like it, good; it isn't a bad film, but a bit of an idea of European history will help you.If you you fall into the latter category loathe it because you think it's a bad film not because of the stupid bigotry shown in some of the other reviews here which seem to be so hung up on the USA and Mom and apple pie that they see "Commies" in even thinking about the event of the early 20th century!After seeing it it made me interested enough to find out about John Reed. You might not like what he thought, you might not like Warren Beatty and what he thinks but for heaven's sake don't rubbish this film simply because it's about a political system you may not like, or have been indoctrinated not to like!It's not brilliant but neither is it a "love poem to communism".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warren Beatty's "masterpiece" competes with Raging Bull as the most overrated drama of the 1980s. Critics and Hollywood could not be more effusive in their praise for this staggeringly long epic documenting the life of leftist journalist John Reed and his tempestuous romance with feminist Louise Bryant leading up to the October Revolution.The politics of the piece are murky at best. Beatty compiled a talented cast and certainly took on material that should have been incredibly interesting. Unfortunately, in his hands, it simply never comes to life. The film cannot seem to figure out whether it is a political piece, a biography or a sweeping romance, and thus fails at all three. Despite the life he led, Reed as played by Beatty is bland and uninvolving. We have no emotional attachment to anything he does and every shot seems determined to depict Beatty as some sort of icon. This must be an affect of Beatty the director as he did this to some extent years later in his rendition of Dick Tracy. Beatty's performance could conceivably have been contributed by a mannequin without much adjustment. Bryant emerges as a more interesting character, but so many of the scenes come off a phony or staged that it becomes impossible to invest too much interest in anyone.Without a doubt Diane Keaton outacts Beatty. Her Louise Bryant has what should be an amazing passage where she traverses her way across Russia in order to join Reed, but the sequence is directed by Beatty as almost a cliff notes adventure - we get merely the highlights. Perhaps that is just as well because Beatty's film is long-winded enough and seems to have very little to actually say. It's position on Communism is vague and it really gives no compelling reason why the characters populating this landscape are so enamored of it, other than a handful of unconvincing postulations. None of them seem especially passionate about it - but the film is not particularly passionate about Reed or his romance with Bryant either. It is a beautifully photographed mammoth production that seems just there - a sort of earlier day version of The English Patient.Other than Keaton, Jack Nicholson is good in a rare non-nutball role as Eugene O'Neill. The film won a number of Oscars - including a puzzling one for Beatty's direction. This is indeed fatuous as the film drones on forever, as if Beatty feels that every single frame of film he shot was indispensible. Did no one edit this movie? Beatty recreates a Woody Allen specialty of interspersing the "action" with testimonials from real-life people who knew Reed and Bryant. Unfortunately, very few of these witnesses have anything of worth to contribute about either character. One old lady rambles on forever about Bryant having borrowed her coat and never giving it back. Did anyone really think these anecdotes were especially revealing that they had to be included in a film already bloated in its running time and self-importance? The other puzzling Oscar comes from Maureen Stapleton's Best Supporting Actress turn as anarchist Emma Goldman. I have nothing against Stapleton as an actress, but this selection is indefensible. We learn absolutely nothing about Goldman. Stapleton has three very brief scenes in the whole film: one where she disagrees with Keaton at a table that lasts maybe a moment, another where she stands next to Beatty at a demonstration and utters maybe one line, and her last moment where she exchanges maybe three lines with Keaton after her excursion across Russia. None of these three moments have any big emotions to play, we really have no idea who this Emma Goldman is and if one blinked or went to the restroom at the wrong moments, you would not even be aware that Stapleton was in the film. And she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this? Really? Really!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I last saw this more than 15 years ago. When I resurrected it for evidence that it's actually good (after reading a superlative review of it on another site) I wasn't surprised by what I saw. It's exactly what I recall. A series of so many cute scenes that a viewers teeth begin to hurt. For the life of me I'll never understand what a pretty-boy like Beatty saw in the life of Reed, that drove him for a decade to research and write this movie. It's bewildering ? and the answer is not on screen. What I will say for Beatty is that he had a lot of courage to push, and produce a bio of Jack Reed, and get it made in Hollywood. No one would attempt this in today's economic and political climate. And no one would anticipate that 20 years after Splendor in the Grass he'd even be interested in anything this ambitious and political. The effort is respectable even if the achievement is complete mediocrity. Regardless of any viewers politics, being in Russia in 1917 must have been an extremely exciting environment.Having said that... Beatty proceeds through this as if he's to be congratulated for being a pretty boy who discovered intellectual life. But he's a dabbler, and his looks are his curse - he always falls back on superficiality/cuteness; his own, puppies, the writing, the manufactured plot points. His keen directors insight boils down to "I'll be cute here, I'll say something cute here, You be cute here, We'll cut away to something cute, then I'll burn dinner, then we'll cut to the dog, then I'll bump my head on the chandelier?" One constantly yearns to view an adult, which makes Emma Goldman's (Maureen Staleton) small bits a welcome break. Reds may be better than the aimless Dr. Zhivago. But as with Frida, I'm not really sure who the audience is, for a terminally cute version of the Jack Reed story.REDS is formless. Beatty takes an entire revolution and makes it the backdrop to a Harlequin romance. It's three hours of indistinguishable bickering between Keaton and Beatty, interrupted occasionally by communist adversaries bickering. Cue the next frozen shot of Diane Keaton, looking red-eyed and phlegmatic. All Warren seems to want to tell us is that Reed was a swell guy and got laid a lot, like him.He time-travels back to Russia with his 1980s hair and his late 20th century "very sensitive man of the 80s" thing in place. Reed has already been feminized to an absurd degree, when Beatty goes over the top and puts him in an apron, cooking Louise a birthday dinner. Well if you can imagine, he burns everything, and my goodness, it's some real hilarity... yeah, maybe if this was 1950. This is like making a sci-fi movie in 1930 and insisting that the aliens do the Charleston. It's so overconventionalized that I've always assumed about 80 percent of it is made up to give Beatty regular star moments. The witnesses are an interesting idea, but their only purpose is to make a very superficial movie feel a little weightier.Keaton in 'confident' mode is about as believable as Bette Davis doing 'demure.' Reed was a forceful figure, but Beatty can't get out of 'false modesty' mode. And his false modesty is a tiresome thing. Beatty just cannot act. It's just a catalog of his tics again. He can't cry, like he couldn't in Shampoo. And if I have to watch him do that midsentence acknowledgment/bullsh1t smile to someone offscreen one more time, I'll give him a revolution. On top of that, Beatty's looks are starting to go, and to salve his ego the make-up team is struggling to make him look like himself at twenty, not to look his age.REDS is the kind of movie that a viewer who doesn't want to have to defend his praise prefers. I mean clearly, look at the screen! It must be important, right? Characters have been to 4 countries already. Politics are being discussed. Things are exploding. Money has been spent. People look angry, etc. But it's just the kind of ambitious, technically respectable 'production' that it's unfashionable for critics to pan.It's unfortunate that people rate this low because it's about "a Commie." Communism failed after the movie, and it's failing in the movie's finale. So it's either about a historical person, or it's about an idealist. The real problem is that it's an annoying, amateurish movie about an idealist. Other complaints are about the length. There's no excuse for that. Read your DVD box when you rent a movie.This review is written by someone who's seen it enough to be very tired of it's wall-to-wall, shallow schmaltz. So if you haven't seen it, you probably should. Judge for yourself. I find it to be a consumable throwaway. It has no depth, despite efforts to convince you otherwise. In the end you know a little about Jack Reed and you've felt some very manufactured feelings. I seriously doubt I could find more than a couple minutes of merit in this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a movie that invariably tells me if the person is one I will enjoy associating with: Titanic. If he loves it, no way. When I saw TCM was showing Reds I read the IMDb reviews and was surprised to see that most either thought it was the best film ever made or the worst. Now, I've liked Beatty ever since his Dobie Gillis days but had never seen Reds. So I marked it as a must.It isn't that the film is bad, it's not just very good. The characters were unappealing little people who spent their little lives in fruitless attempts for meaningfulness. And they did it sooooo boringly. The acting was not up to par for the major players. The cinematography is ho-hum. I did like the interviews very much except for the film-school formula of always having the person in one third of the screen. Frankly, I would have enjoyed a film of just the interviews with some archival footage of events thrown in. Now I can't speak for the whole film because, frankly, after 90 minutes I was so bored I turned it off but there seemed to be no drama or excitement to it.It seems to me that the "best film ever" folks were influenced by the politics rather than the film itself. And the "worst" folks also. It's sort of like claiming The Fountainhead was the best film ever if you're a libertarian. But what the film meant to me is that I wouldn't care to associate with those who thought the relationships portrayed were in any way appealing or worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a big disappointment.

Playing such an important role as she was it really ruined the film. I sometimes thought she was wearing a mask, no expression at all in her face - no matter what her character was going through. It was really a shame, considering the good actors surrounding her. But, as I said, because of her central position in the story, it made the movie unbearable.The screenplay also could have been better by focusing more on the political aspects, but that is a matter of taste, I guess.The title of the movie was also rather unfortunate - "the Reds"? Honestly, who picked the title, Senator McCarthy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there are certain things in life that, when engaging yourself in them, you can actually feel years of your life being peeled off of your soul. this movie is one of those things. this movie is long, boring, dull, and succeeds in leaving the viewer with absolutely no understanding of the storyline. i find Reds to be an insult to humanity, art, and the general wellbeing of the human population. this movie is a danger to people everywhere, as one could easily weaponize it and use it as a torture device. this movie is bad, bad, BAD. the director should be forced to watch Reds every day of his life, and then have "I DIRECTED REDS" tattooed across his forehead. i tend to like movies, but this one was just god awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misunderstood, overrated but still very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps it's inevitable that "Reds" became a kind of Rorschach test when it first appeared. Liberals, meaning almost all of Hollywood, could still feel a twinge of nostalgia for those heady Bolshie days, while conservatives recoiled at any attempt to humanize Americans who even Woodrow Wilson considered traitors. But it's over 30 years later, and the Jack Reeds and Emma Goldmans seem almost quaint today. So too do the Warren Beattys and Diane Keatons, and the limousine liberalism they embody. Viewed at this distance, "Reds" is neither a masterpiece nor a piece of agitprop, just a very long, very good but rather flawed movie. And in fact it's surprisingly frank about who Reed was, and what the Bolsheviks were. In a late scene between Reed and Goldman, the latter is utterly disgusted with what the Reds have become, complaining that they are just as fascistic as the crew they replaced, and the people are just as bad off because "nothing works!" Reed is not listening. Revolutions take time, and they need a little terror to keep those pesky counterrevolutionaries in line.In the end, however, this is a love story. Does it work? That depends how hard you think about it. Louise is always chasing after Jack, hating herself for it, leaving him, going back to him, rinse repeat. It gets a bit repetitive. The final scene makes no sense to me at all, even though it's been telegraphed for the preceding 2 1/2 hours. Luckily the chemistry between Beatty and Keaton holds it together.Thank god for the testimonials, a surprisingly effective device which served to dispense with a lot of exposition. Otherwise this would've been a 6-hour movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re-Creating History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Beatty's Reds is a wonderful directional achievement .. I felt it was so realistic like if Beatty was re-creating history like reading historical book where the writer gives you a glimpse or an insight to history like if he re-wrote it . The cast is amazing; Diane Keaton played a complicated role in a beautiful way. Warren Beatty is more than amazing in the leading role. Jack Nicholson is awesome in a supporting role .. Paul Sorvino was good .. especially when he speaks the Russian accent.The movie is a little bit boring and lengthy but it is worthy of watching. The only thing that I didn't like in the movie was the scene which supposed to mean that it was shot somewhere in the Arab world which was terrible because some speak in Urdu and the place supposed to be in Egypt but they speak in a Moroccan accent .. probably most of the non-Arabs won't notice that but it bothers me .. because they spent much money on the movie and they could avoid such problems by hiring some Arab consulter.It is probably the best American movie about communism and the communist movement in the USA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A maverick magnum opus with a political theme -- rare in American movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Beatty's magnum opus Reds was presented as a revival film official selection of the New York Film Festival 2006 to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of its original appearance.Reds's greatest virtue may be that it's grand, without being pompous, film-making. It's a film that takes some pride in being big and turbulent and unruly. It's important, but it's not tidy. It's in part certainly very much about ideology, but it avoids sharp, well-honed edges or large hard-etched "points." John Reed (played by the film's impresario, its sole producer, director, co-author, and star, Warren Beatty) was a man who happened to be able to write a first-hand account of the Bolshevik revolution, a long-time bestseller called Ten Days That Shook the World. At that time early in the twentieth century in America Reed arguably was a central figure, if only in the sense that during his time in Greenwich Village he managed to be (as he wanted to be) consistently at the center of things American political and cultural ? when he wasn't in Russia (which was pretty central then too). Roger Ebert thinks the movie "never succeeds in convincing us that the feuds between the American socialist parties were much more than personality conflict and ego-bruisings" (that may depend on how hard we need to be convinced to begin with), but we do care about Reds (Ebert thinks) as "a traditional Hollywood romantic epic, a love story written on the canvas of history, as they used to say in the ads?it is the thinking man's Doctor Zhivago, told from the other side, of course." What about the choice of Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton as the lovers? Initially that may seem an odd and chemistry-poor decision. (I'm not sure I overcome that impression.) But arguably the film takes long enough with each of its main characters to make them into rounded people, complex enough to be attractive to others and to each other. Beatty uses the romance to hold the story together, and in doing so, he follows a conventional enough scheme. Reds stands out from other American mainstream products ? and for all its maverick central force, it remains that ? in its attempt to deal seriously with complex socio-political events during a turbulent period, and to approach them in an open-minded way. Beatty weaves other significant characters into the fabric of his drama, notably the leftist activist Emma Goldman (Maureen Stapleton, who got the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) and the radical editor Max Eastman (Edward Herrmann), who are members of the same political-intellectual salon into which he brings Louise, as is the playwright Eugene O'Neill (Jack Nicholson).Beatty's filmic recreation of John Reed is good in not being too serious or too idealized: in having a silly side Beatty's Reed perhaps has something of himself. Reed's lover Louise Bryant (Keaton), though originally a bourgeois lady from Portland, is similarly rounded; she's led by her relationship to Reed to develop other facets and strengths, and further enlarged as a personality through the way the film depicts her long affair with the alcoholic O'Neill, played by a toned-down but emotionally potent Nicholson. His discontent and negative energy are disturbing. Personalities anchor the film; but in some of the political debates and adventures one loses track and forgets why Reed is somewhere in Russia. He is at the center of things. But why he is where he is otherwise at certain moments is uncertain. In its ambition to keep juggling the many balls of major personalities and major political currents and historical events, Reds loses some of its narrative clarity and momentum over time. Complex political and historical currents are tracked, but the emotional trajectory loses its momentum. Nonetheless the film develops sweep in its length of three and a quarter hours. One walks out convinced that the material was complex enough to be worthy of such length, even if Beatty and his co-writer Trevor Griffiths could not whip it all into shape.Whether it's all worth it on the stage of international cinema or not, this is a film of historical interest as a great independent project, begun logically in the Seventies, but completed right in the middle of Hollywood by an American intelligent and engaged enough to be star, director, writer, and producer, to raise $35 million to do it, and to make more or less the movie he wanted to make ? right in the middle, so to speak, of a wave of conservatism and yuppiedom, in the early Eighties, when people were thinking about making money and making it, when Ronald Reagon was President of the United States. What more appropriate time to reexamine this achievement than in the middle of the second term of George Bush II? No doubt Beatty took on this story because he was interested in a time in America when it was rife with left-wing politics. But he is realistic, and he made a Hollywood movie, with big stars and romance. And that's what it is and remains. But one can't imagine anybody else making it, and that's what makes it worth revisiting. Warren Beatty is an admirable maverick in the clone-heavy world of Southern California media-moguldom. He's a real person. And this is his great performance as a person and as an artist. I first saw it with a group of real communists. "We're "reds," they said as we walked out. The theater staff looked impressed. I was bowled over by their pride. Not everyone watches this film as a "traditional Hollywood romantic epic." It would never have been made if that were all it was. Its grandeur and ambition are still moving and it must not be forgotten. For a more pungent treatment of a political and social theme starring Beatty, consider Hal Ashby's 1975 Shampoo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A competently directed historical piece, the film improves as it progresses and the concentration shifts from the romance at hand to politics, yet it still is not what I would call a very engaging experience. It has a large array of characters, and many of them are not fully developed; the ones that are felt a bit bland to me, and I could not find many sparks between Keaton and Beatty's characters. There are also quite a few subplots, which makes the whole film rather hard to grasp, since so many things are going on, and so few seem properly explained. Perhaps though I am being a bit harsh on the film. The quality of acting is quite reasonable, and so is the technical side of the production. The film has some good ideas and some good elements, and perhaps it is worth seeing for those, but I would be cautious as to whether one can sit through over three hours of it in one go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly long and boring tale of Communist sympathizers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This takes the prize for me as surely one of the most boring movies of all time. Though it's many years since I have seen it, its extreme length and astonishing tedium have remained fresh in my mind for decades. Back in the early 1980's, I went to the theatre fully expecting to be impressed by the movie. It is based on the true life story of an American journalist, Jack Reed, who travels to Russia to cover the October Revolution of 1917, accompanied by his adoring feminist lover, Louise Bryant. She is a writer who previously has left her husband for Reed after becoming mesmerized by him at one of his lectures. The pair hope to lead a similar revolution back in the U.S. Reed founded the American Communist Party and was in fact eventually buried at the Kremlin wall.The acting is not the cause of my distaste for the movie as competent stars, Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton, play the lead roles. Other cast members include Maureen Stapleton, Gene Hackman, and Jack Nicholson as famous playwright Eugene O'Neill, who forms a third party in the love triangle with Reed &amp; Bryant. (Reed becomes too wrapped up in his cause, so Bryant leaves him to live with O'Neill for awhile.) As far as I'm concerned, there's too much dull depiction of the bohemian lifestyle of this Greenwich Village intelligentsia, most of whom never put in an honest day's work in their lives. Much better to focus on the REAL workers in both countries, Russia &amp; the States. The characters are neither sympathetic nor even very interesting, the radical feminist Bryant, who initially feels trapped in her respectable married life, unlikely to elicit much concern from me. As for her romance with Reed, it's about as dull as dishwater.I'm no Communist but have no extreme political ideologies that would turn me off the story. Perhaps a two hour documentary on Communist &amp; Socialist American ideologies in the early 20th Century might have been informative. There are some real life interviews included, best to have kept it all a realistic documentary. However, here they over glamorize the misguided Reed's character, and he's certainly no hero as I see it. As far as Warren Beatty is concerned, it does seem a little ironic (as another also noted) that a wealthy actor is making a movie idealizing a Communist sympathizer. At least the film does eventually imply that the Russian people were duped by Lenin's promises of Communism, and Emma Goldman (Stapleton's character) even suggests that the system cannot work in practice.Given the drama of the Bolshevik Revolution, this film promised to be totally engaging, but in fact as another reviewer commented and strange as it would appear, this comes across as a movie where nothing ever happens...though you keep hoping it might. It's an epic of nothingness. As I see it, this film is best described as approximately four hours too long. Surely it was at least four hours; it seemed twenty. If you want romance &amp; the Russian Revolution, watch that genuine classic, Doctor Zhivago, a true epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a Message (or two) in There... Somewhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd be willing to push out my little stack of chips on a bet that Warren Beatty understood the concept of "cause addiction" back in '81. Like addictions to sex, gambling, work, the Internet and exercise, it's an obsession with a particular form of activity because one appraises that activity as highly valuable. One's appraisals are driven by one's core beliefs, values and convictions, and the emotions those beliefs, values and convictions promote. In John Reed's (actual) case, a rich young man for whom survival was not really an issue hooked up with a lot of post-Enlightenment, mid-19th-century, German philosophy and became "idealistic" and morally "utopian." But being a product of the either-or, all-or-nothing, mental paradigms of his day, Reed lost whatever sense of objectivity he might have picked up. And got stuck in that place a lot of people get stuck when lose sense of two basic truths: There's no free lunch, and everything comes at a price.Many during the final decade of the "Evil Empire" of monolithic anti-capitalism didn't care for "Reds" much. Any film that made as much noise as that one did about "American oil companies trying to get to the fields near Baku" (imagine that) was bound to inspire the discomfort of certain parties. 1981 was not 2010, and Beatty's neither-all-good-nor-all-bad, post-modern take on Reed and his "cause" pretty much flew right over the heads of many viewers. And that's why it's hard for me to see "Reds" as being in the same league with films like "Network" or "Charlie Wilson's War." As was the case with "Lawrence of Arabia," Beatty's got a film full of informative messages here, but in trying to cram them all into this "epic," many of them get lost. Revolutions may gain their energy from idealism, but they tend to accomplish their ends at the point of a gun. And people given to using guns may have ideas =other= than the idealistic ones. France in the 1790s. Cuba in the 1950s and '60s. The Confederacy in the 1850s and '60s. China in the late '40s. Germany in the 1920s and '30s. Russia in the 1910s. The Russian culture had been given to extreme authoritarianism for centuries before the labor movement there began to gain traction in the late 1800s. Much as was the case in the American labor movement a bit later on, idealism was fed to the workers by those who wished to enlist them for their own purposes. The authoritarian leaders of the movement acted little differently than the authoritarian leaders of the Czar's government. "Here's to the new boss; same as the old boss." Beatty misses none of this in "Reds." But I'm not sure that many viewers were able to get that in the midst of all the dramatizing. Oh, well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Commie propaganda film explains why so many useful idiots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why watch this chunk of celluloid trash? Because it will help you to understand why so many otherwise intelligent people still fall for the false religion of looting and genocide known as socialism/communism.The 'interviews' with 'survivors' - a polite way of describing decrepit 20s anarchists - who gas off about the virtues of communism is enlightening and chilling. These mindwashed dupes tell you communism is peachy keen but for some strange reason don't mention firing squads, brainwashing, gulags, hanging people on meathooks in the basement of Lubyanka Prison, the Holodmor Famine in the Ukraine, contaminated drinking water, filth, corruption, beatings, true environmental disasters, and other routine features of communist third world toilets.Ask anyone in Cuba, North Korea, or communist china - that's right I said it, 'communist china' - about the lovely paradise of the workers. Take a look at these interviewees: old before their time, raspy cigarette voices, lousy teeth, chicken skin: don't you want to be a commie just like them? Yeah. Can't wait.They're just bright enough to be dangerous and all they can do when not throwing bombs is lie, lie, lie, and thrust their dirty fists in the air in worship of marx, lenin, stalin and other human garbage who would repay their moronic loyalty with death.You like stereotypes? Then you gonna love Reds. It has more stereotypes than a Chernobyl junkyard dog has three headed fleas: anti-communists are either stupid and toothless or 'rich, white' arrogant toffs. The communist rats are all lovely, wonderful, smart people who are always partying and enjoying life.Which doesn't explain why they croak of easily avoidable fatal illnesses at unusually young ages.To understand diseases, medical researchers must examine chunks of wino vomit, fly eggs, body lice, open lesions, necrotic tissue, decomposed bodies, and similar dumbfounding, unsavory artifacts.Thus is the case with Reds, a film which was clearly hastily cobbled in reaction to the election of President Reagan, who gave Americans the best eight years they'd enjoyed in years, and since for that matter.The Left is a pack of sore losers and horrible, vindictive winners. This is an anti-Reagan film which slyly attempts to sell communism to anyone stupid enough to buy it.Within a decade of this film's release, the soviet union collapsed of its own weight.Study this as you would a crime scene or a bacterial strain in a Petri Dish: to prevent future outbreaks of the genocidal disease of communism.Paul Vincent ZecchinoManasoviet Key, Florida17 July, 2013</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reds Is an Anti-Communist Love Story -- Part I</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a tremendous movie that people of all political stripes should see. Until I saw this movie, Warren Beatty has always come across to me as your basic Hollywood liberal -- elitist without reason and in possession of values at war with those of most of his countrymen. And given the subject matter of this biopic, I fully expected it to be a glorification of Reed's life. It's anything but, though Reed is the movie's protagonist.What it is, by contrast, is primarily the love story between Reed and Bryant. Given the leftist ideas of free love, which the movie also explores, the very notion of a love story is anathema to the supposed political beliefs of the Bolsheviks and those in the American and European left. The notion of love and self-sacrifice were denigrated by the left as bourgeois concepts. Hammering my point home, O'Neill at one point even accuses Bryant of cynically pretending to be about free love to win a marriage proposal from Reed. Within the context of the movie, that's probably unfair. Bryant thought she was about free love until she met Reed. Reed thought he was about free love until he met Bryant and until Bryant gave herself to O'Neill.What the moviegoer should conclude from all of this is is that the left-wing notion of free love is empirically unsustainable and bankrupt as an idea. At the end of the movie, just before Reed dies (or just before Bryant learns Reed dies), she drops a cup she was taking to get him some water, as he lay on his death bed. A small boy picks the cup up and hands it to Bryant. The boy, perhaps 4 years old, returns to his seat, smiling at Bryant. Earlier in the movie, when Reed was diagnosed with kidney disease, he asked his doctor if that would affect his ability to have children (the answer was "no"). The closing scene with the boy is meant to call that to mind. In other words, after all of his trials, Bryant sees the child, and the moviegoer gets the message -- Reed and Bryant have effectively wasted their lives. They've wasted their lives (more Reed than Bryant) striving for their beliefs, which in the end turn out to have been painfully naive. What they missed were multiple years in which they could have been together in bourgeois happiness. (The movie repeatedly shows Reed and Bryant's happiest moments as being precisely those where they were together, in America, living a middle class or lower middle class life -- making dinner, playing with their dog, or making love.) And what they missed because of Reed's misplaced revolutionary fervor was the opportunity to have children and raise a family together. In short, they missed the basic point of life, and only realized it too late.As an aside, I didn't expect this from Beatty, one of Hollywood's most notorious womanizers. But I think what it shows is that he was a romantic at heart all along. And given that he's still married to Annette Benning, after lots of profound public expressions of love -- which at the time I discounted as so much Hollywood showboating -- I think Beatty just found the one he was searching for. The right has its lotharios, like the left, and it's easy to understand a handsome man with a strong libido chasing so many skirts. The point is that eventually Beatty did settle down. I think the denunciations of his by many of his former lovers is because they wanted to be "the one," but only late in his life did Ms. Benning get his heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong, with a worthless romance padding it out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Reds" is hopelessly overlong, but still a decent movie. The first half - all one hour and forty five minutes of it - is mostly just there to set up an unbelievable and uninteresting love story. Keaton is dowdy and unappealing and we get no sense of why Beatty's John Reed would have fallen for her.Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill, perhaps, because he's also played as no great catch. He doesn't add much to the movie though, apart from the thrill of saying "there's Jack Nicholson!" while you're waiting for the first half of the movie to end. Gene Hackman is also in there, not adding a whole lot either.The movie really gets going in the second half, which saved it for me. Perhaps it was the fact that the love story is moved aside for political intrigue in Russia, and we get a sense of John Reed as a man swept up in the current of history, used for purposes aside from his intent and not really understanding his role. This is where the movie becomes gripping.Throughout the movie there are interjections from real people who presumably knew the real John Reed. These are generally more interesting than the movie itself and suggest a documentary approach would have been more fulfilling. At times the cuts from these scenes back to the action is jarring, which seems to detract from the dignity of the speaker, as though Beatty had to use all the footage of these speakers he had available to him, and had to stick it in somewhere, even if it didn't fit.Overall, the love story is too stagy for the weight of the material and should have been excised. It leaves you with a lot to wade through if you want to get to the interesting parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warren Beatty's biographical saga about Jack Reed (1887-1920), a radical USA journalist, a fervent advocate of IWW (Industrial Workers of the World), and the author of TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD, running over 3 hours. REDS, scored 12 Oscar nominations (with 3 wins) and finally won Beatty an Oscar for BEST DIRECTOR among a combined 14 nominations throughout his eminent career so far (as actor, director, screen-writer and producer), undeniably can be reckoned as his most enterprising and taxing project, and is also notorious for its behind-the-scene stories such as Beatty's extravagant conceit in the director's chair and his off-screen romance with co-star Keaton (which ended right before the extended shooting days).Political elements aside, REDS quintessentially is an ode to the undying love between Jack Reed and his wife Louise Bryant (Keaton), also a radical journalist, since during most of its lengthy narrative, the latter is the unaltered focus of this epic and Beatty assiduously tells their relationship from her angle. Due to the similar political slant, they attract to each other almost instantly, when WWI edges to its end. But being labeled as an " exhibitionist" because of her feminist stance, Louise suffers from frustration to be taken seriously for her work as a writer and abetted by Jack's constant absence due to his job, she starts off a romance with Eugene O'Neill (Nicholson, who steals the limelight assertively with his trenchant dissection of their mnage ? trois), the Nobel laureate playwright and their common friend, in spite of their vastly conflicting political standings. Things go downhill after they get married when monogamy stands in the way of their life, selfishly and immaturely Louise uses Eugene to get back at Jack, only to be taken aback by Jack's philandering notion of partnership.They separate for a while, until in 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution, becomes the essential catalyst of their undimmed love, witnessing the revolution in the front row, and realising what a sea change their Socialist belief can make in the war-trodden foreign land, they work shoulder-to-shoulder as comrades, write first-hand reports of the revolution and return to USA with an evolutionarily reshaped prospect of life, which is also where their political ideologies diverge.Jack passionately throws himself into politics, to bring Communism to his native soil, against the widespread fear that it would also usurp the democratic government of United States, whereas Louise hold a different opinion towards the issue, as she claims, she is deeply inspired by the Russian revolution and how proletariat can stand up and takes the regime, but she is also clear- minded about the fact that it is completely another situation for socialism to bloom here in America. Soon the schism emerges in the budding but vulnerable socialist party, their love is under another critical test when Jack defies Louise's advice and accepts the assignment to go to Moscow and seek endorsement from Grigory Zinoviev (acclaimed writer Kosinski in his first film role) for his party. His journey turns out to be a disaster, he is briefly incarcerated in Finland and then as an exchanged hostage, he stays with the communist party in Russia and stands for a mouthpiece of the socialism in USA, but soon grows increasingly disillusioned with Zinoviev's policies, meanwhile his health deteriorates drastically, a final reunion with Louise seems to be an immense mercy for him.Beatty painstakingly interposes interviews of more than thirty real-life "witnesses" who personally know Jack and Louise into the chronicle account, sometimes as a voice-over juxtaposing with the story, offering sound-bites and tidbits to enrich our perspectives of them and a larger social background at then. The documentary approach is quite risky, not only it adds considerable length to the already protracted magnitude, it also takes a chance with a more elaborate editing process in the post-production, how come it failed to nab the editing trophy in the Oscar?REDS received four acting nominations in four categories, firstly, Beatty is apparently too old for the role (Reed dies at the age of 33, while Beatty was already over 40 during the filming), but if one is not familiar with the archetype, his very sympathetic portrayal is fairly engaging, we can feel for Jack's idealistic enthusiasm, his intense affection to Louise (there are at least three sex scenes to prove his prowess, even after he loses one kidney), and the root of his tragedy - his erudite perception of the society fatally conflicts with his simplistic modus operandi. Keaton, by comparison, really busts her chops to embody Louise as a flawed but flesh-and-blood human being, sometimes she is wilful, vexatious, self-contradictory, other times, she is lucid, gallant and endearing, all reflect from her imperfect visage, this is her best dramatic performance to date.As charismatic as Nicholson, the only Oscar winner among the quartet is Maureen Stapleton, finally paid her due for her fourth attempt in the category, she plays Emma Goldman, the no bullshit anarchist, whose limited presence seems rather paltry against the film's duration, and she is not even a key player in the game, but whenever she is on the screen, Stapleton seizes every opportunity to remind viewers of her progressive thinking and truculent spirit, all intrigues us to know her character more, when will be a biography film about her? Emma Thompson can nail that role. All in all, this film is an important cinematic legacy which conducts a non-judgmental and thorough account on a highly contentious topic at a tumultuous time through the lives of Jack and Louise, a commendable extravaganza, probably Beatty's best work in any aspect, and I have a taxi waiting, now...</fullReview>

That is not too different than how things are done on the history programs today.Perhaps not well known anymore, John Reed was a real journalist who really lived through the Russian Revolution.

His answer was anyone considering voting for the British Conservative Party in the next election. No doubting of his socialist convictions.However what about Lothario Warren Beatty? This actor/writer/director/producer was better known for his sexual conquests than leftist politics although he did take time out to campaign for George McGovern for the 1972 Presidential Elections. However Beatty is regarded as a typical liberal Hollywood millionaire. Griffiths is not and maybe it is him who gives the film a political centre. I can certainly see in scenes where there are endless arguments between various factions of the left and the cod bureaucracy that its Griffiths would have had first hand knowledge with his involvement in left wing politics of 1970s Britain. Goodness knows I encountered it in the 1980s.Reds was a long held labour of love for him and this film bagged him a Best Director Oscar. You need a strong constitution to watch Reds, it clocks in at 194 minutes and although it is an epic, frankly David Lean probably did not lose any sleep over this movie and that his own epics might get downgraded and Richard Attenborough would go on to show a year later what a real epic should look like.Reds covers the life of journalist John Reed (Warren Beatty) and his relationship with socialite Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton) from their first meeting, their involvement with the American left movement to Reed's final days in post revolutionary Russia when he is gravely ill and after he became famous for writing the best known account of the Russian Revolution. Bryant was married to someone else when they first met and afterwards has a complex relationship with playwright Eugene O'Neill (Jack Nicholson) the only (cynical) character who sees through the fog of romantic socialism the others are so enamoured with.To give the movie authenticity the film is interspersed with interviews from surviving witnesses who knew the people involved or were around the time period. This lends the film a documentary setting and for the time was an unusual narrative device. Something that was parodied later by Woody Allen in Zelig, a former lover of Keaton before Beatty became her lover.The problem with the film is its trying to do too much. Its a tragedy, its a romance, a globe-trotting political adventure, a growing disillusionment of the Russian revolution and the efforts to export the revolutionary ideals to the USA. Beatty has bit off more than he could chew here. Actors flit in and out without establishing much of a presence such as Gene Hackman.Beatty should had jettisoned some of the story strands and unleashed a tighter film. Of course we later realised that the aftermath of Russian Revolution did not install a socialist utopia and you feel the film tries but does not always honestly address this.This film was released in the year when Ronald Reagan became President and America entered an economic shift to the right with policies I daresay laid the foundations of the financial meltdown of 2008. Its a radical but flawed film which you do not expect to be made by a major film corporation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>epic both personal and geopolitical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1915 in provincial Portland. Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton) is a liberated married woman who is at odds with her husband. She goes to the Liberal Club to hear Jack Reed (Warren Beatty) who claims the war is for profits. She is drawn immediately to him and interviews him. She follows him to NYC but she struggles in Jack's shadow. She has an affair with Eugene O'Neill (Jack Nicholson) but marries Jack anyways. Jack and his colleagues rally against the declaration of war. The marriage is not going smoothly and Bryant goes to France to be a war correspondent. Despite his medical problems, Reed goes over to Europe and convinces her to join him in Russia. They become writing partners and witness the Bolshevik Revolution in October 1917. The second half has Reed struggle to bring Revolution to America but faces infighting with Louis Fraina (Paul Sorvino). He struggles even more in Russia as he fights with Bolshevik revolutionary Grigory Zinoviev with his declining health.The movie is very long although I understand why it had to be so long. There is an epic both the small scale personal romance and in the geopolitical world. The acting is superb. Keaton and Beatty really pushes hard. I'm less certain about the inserts of the real people. Most of the people are not well known. It gives it flavor but it also disrupts the flow. The movie needs faster pacing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard about this film many times before, specifically because it is one of only a few films to be nominated all four Academy Award acting nominations, I knew I had to see it at some point, from Oscar and Golden Globe winning director Warren Beatty (Dick Tracy). Basically the film tells the true story of radical American journalist John Reed (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Warren Beatty), during the First World War and the Russian Revolution, interspersed throughout with surviving witnesses from the time periods who knew Reed, the many of the people he encountered and giving their views on his exploits. Reed met married socialite Louise Bryant (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Diane Keaton) in 1915 at a lecture in Portland, Oregon, she is intrigued by his idealism, and over the course of an interview on international politics, which goes into the night, she realises writing is her only escape from the high society lifestyle. Bryant eventually leaves her husband to join Reed Greenwich Village, New York City, along with the local community of activists and artists, including anarchist and author Emma Goldman (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Maureen Stapleton) and the playwright Eugene O'Neill (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jack Nicholson), they later move to Provincetown, Massachusetts to concentrate on their writing, and become involved in the local theatre scene. Bryant becomes a feminist and radical in her own right through her writing, while Reed becomes involved in the labor strikes of the "Reds" of the Communist Labor Party of America, he becomes obsessed with changing the world, and in 1916 grows restless and moves to St. Louis to cover the Democratic Convention, during his absence Bryant has a complicated affair with O'Neill, Reed discovers this on his return, and realises he still loves her. Reed and Bryant secretly marry and make a home in Croton-on-Hudson, north of New York City, but desires for others are still conflicting them, Reed admits to his infidelity, and Bryant leaves on a ship to Europe to be a war correspondent, while Reed has a kidney disorder and is warned not to travel excessively and cause himself stress, but ignores this to join her, they reunite as professionals and rekindle their passion, while swept into Russia's Czarist regime ans the events of the 1917 Russian Revolution. The second half of the film is set ten days after the publication of Reed's book Ten Days that Shook the World, Reed is filled with idealism and tries to bring the spirit of Communism to the United States, because he is disillusioned by the imposed policies of Grigory Zinoviev (Jerzy Kosinski) and the Bolsheviks from Communist Russia, he is imprisoned and interrogated in Finland at one point trying to leave Europe, he is eventually reunited with Bryant in Moscow, Russia at a train station, his kidney disorder however has weakened him, Bryant nurses him until his death. Also starring Edward Herrmann as Max Eastman, Gene Hackman as Pete Van Wherry, Paul Sorvino as Louis Fraina, Nicolas Coaster as Paul Trullinger, M. Emmet Walsh as Speaker at Liberal Club, Ian Wolfe as Mr. Partlow, Bessie Love as Mrs. Partlow, Ramon Bieri as Police Chief, Jack O'Leary as Pinkerton Guard, William Daniels as Julius Gerber, Dave King as Allan Benson, Joseph Buloff as Joe Volski, Shane Rimmer as MacAlpine, Miriam Margolyes as Woman Writing in Notebook and John Ratzenberger as Communist Leader. This chronicle of the man who wrote Ten Days that Shook the World works well because of the great cast and crew, including the great music by Stephen Sondheim, and the terrific attention to detail, I admit there was more chat than action, and I found it hard to follow in small places, but overall it was an interesting epic biographical drama. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Sound and Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks like something that would pass in the History Channel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reds is fits the definition of a boring film. It is slow paced, an historical drama that you probably have seen one thousand times before, and utterly uninteresting, I mean, it looks like something that you can learn in a history class or something. It clearly isn't a good film, no matter what you say. It follows this guy interpreted by Warren Beatty, that is a defender of the revolutionary's ideas. But again, I think it's worth noting to say that nothing interesting happens or whats or ever. The most exciting thing about this film are the discussions and the conflicts between him and his wife. That's not saying too much, since that it's not like the most original thing in the world. And they always ended together, despite all their differences. And yeah, the characters always makes a good film, so the result of the film is that bad mainly because the characters (based in real-life persons) in that film are just horrible. They seems to have no personality, and despite the film being 3 hours long, the development simply don't happens. It just shows the protagonist traveling around the world, and he occasionally appears in the middle of discussions and manifests, while her wife becomes frustrated and bored, but nothing made in a way that would push the attention of the viewer to the film. All in all, it's very boring, overlong, and I find the idea of putting 'witnesses' to comment about the events to be horrible. It's not a documentary, for god's sake! Anyways, it looks a very accurate depiction of the US situation in the mid 20s, with the poetry being faded by the political subjects, an interesting idea in fact, but as a film, it has nothing to offer, at least for me. The cinematography, the sound, the editing, art direction, the acting, the story itself looked sub-par or average at best. It looks like a film intended to be taken as much more as something to watch in the school than anything else, or something that would pass in the History channel. 5.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>25 Years Later, 'Reds' Still Brings History to Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the midst of the Cold War, Warren Beatty set out to bring history to life with an epic tale of the Russian Revolution and the rise of the American Left. After an introduction at this year's 44th New York Film Festival, Beatty's Oscar gold shines through on REDS Silver Anniversary DVD.Reagan just took the White House, the hostages had just come home from Iran, the Berlin Wall still stood strong, and America had grown tired of the shallow and often gloomy films of the 1970's. The stage was set for a subtle political epic that would pave the way for such films as Gandhi and Chariots of Fire (which beat REDS for the title Best Picture). REDS took the critics by storm and garnered 3 Academy Awards in the process. Twenty-five years later, the film still carries a powerful message of the determination of love, and the dangers of fear.With the Cold War still raging full strength and America still nursing wounds from the Vietnam Era, Warren Beatty's epic historical drama of the rise of Communism in America may have been a gamble, but with a stellar cast and riding the wave of the success of Heaven Can Wait, the Academy Award winning director brought his dream to life. Beatty co-wrote, produced, directed and starred in the film that not only showcases his political beliefs that the American public unreasonably feared Communism, but also gave voice to his vision and talent as both actor and director. The film garnered more Academy Award nominations ? twelve ? than any other film in the previous 15 years.Based on actual events, the film tells the story of John Reed (Beatty), American Communist, activist and journalist, who falls for feminist/writer Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton). Their love affair grows as the world around them unravels in the midst of World War I, the Russian Revolution and Congressional inquests into the American Communist Party. Bryant's love is put to the test when Reed is arrested trying to return to the United States from Russia and she embarks on a treacherous journey to be reunited with him. As the only American entombed in the Kremlin, Reeds impact on both the American Communist movement and the Russian Revolution itself are chronicled in the film. The film deftly utilizes personal interviews with those who actually knew Reed and Bryant, along with a steady pace of drama and romance to completely immerse its audience in the story. Beatty utilizes historic re-enactments and poignant deliveries from his stars ? including Maureen Stapleton, who won Best Supporting Actress gold for her role ? to create a bond with the characters and hope for their fates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DVD Brings New Life to Beatty's Big, Bold and Sometimes Didactic Take on the Early Communist Movement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even at its epic length of 195 minutes, Warren Beatty's quadruple hat trick as producer, director, co-screenwriter (with Trevor Griffiths) and star of this 1981 historical drama feels surprisingly intimate despite periodic efforts at David Lean-style grandiosity. Finally on DVD in a pristine print transfer, it's hard to believe it's been a quarter century since I've seen this movie, yet it still casts an intriguing spell probably because Beatty seems so enraptured by the turbulent story of John Reed, the American journalist-turned-Communist activist who provided a vital and controversial first-hand account of the Russian Revolution of 1917, "Ten Days That Shook the World".The film itself covers the last five years of the young writer's life (he was only 32 when he died), and Beatty smartly uses talking heads by way of 31 surviving eyewitnesses of the period as a means to explain the context of the story being told. Covering the full political spectrum from left to right, none are identified outright, but a few are quite famous like writer Henry Miller, journalist Adela Rogers St. John and comedian George Jessel. This approach allows the core of the movie to be the love story between Reed and his wife Louise Bryant, a fellow writer who became his companion on his first trip to Russia. Theirs is a tempestuous relationship driven by their increasing politicization and complicated by adultery and conflicting priorities. They socialize in an elite circle, which includes socialist writer Max Eastman, political anarchist Emma Goldman and playwright Eugene O' Neill, with whom Bryant has a passionate affair.Divided into two parts (and consequently separated into two discs for the DVD release), the first part focuses on Reed and Bryant's involvement with political and labor disputes stateside and their fits-and-starts courtship, climaxing with their trip to Russia during the revolution. The second half shows them inspired by their experiences in Russia with Reed trying to lead the Communist party back in the U.S. but getting bogged down by bureaucracy in both countries. It all ends in an extravagant series of Zhivago-like sequences that crank up the romance quotient of the entire venture. Except for the occasional lapses into Hollywood formula, this is intelligent film-making if rather dense, and the politics become especially cumbersome in the second half with the actors resorting to speechifying.Beatty is as good as he's ever been as Reed, though his innately elliptical nature sometimes undermines the open idealism of the character he's portraying. With her self-effacing Annie Hall mannerisms held in check, Diane Keaton fulfills the comparatively more difficult role as the mercurial Bryant since she initially comes across as an embittered dilettante and then evolves in a somewhat disjointed manner to become the supportive wife. Both are so internally motivated as actors that they come across as a bit too contemporary and human-sized for such a romantic epic. Better is Jack Nicholson who threatens to steal the film as the cynically anguished O'Neill, especially in a hostile, painfully honest confrontation scene with Keaton. As Goldman, Maureen Stapleton transcends the dogma of her obsessive character with an undercurrent of humanity. Gene Hackman, Edward Herrmann, Paul Sorvino and writer Jerzy Kosinski are solid in smaller roles.Not too surprisingly, the technical aspects are impressive from Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, which ranges from the sepia tones of the early scenes to the bold colors used during the revolution montage, to Stephen Sondheim's original music score, which matches well with the period music used, to Richard Sylbert's production design. The 2006 DVD comes with just two extras - a trailer made for the DVD on the first disc, and an enlightening documentary in seven parts on the second disc, "Witness to Reds" by Laurent Bouzereau, which runs over an hour. Despite his open reservations about providing commentary on the film, Beatty is interviewed extensively, and other surviving key cast and crew members are included as well, including a surprisingly open Nicholson. Keaton unfortunately chose not to participate. Regardless, it's essential viewing if you want a greater context for the film from political history to actual production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could it be more boring?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinematography was good and I could look at Diane Keaton all day without it getting old. Other than that, this excruciatingly long soap opera is surely a movie one never has to or wants to see a second time. Obviously an exercise in conceit for Warren Beatty, who shamelessly promotes this confusing, pointless film with the transparently egotistical tag-line "Not since Gone with The Wind has there been such an epic" or some such nonsense. Sitting and fidgeting in the cinema, I was frequently reminded of the old Carly Simon song "You're so vain" rumored to have been written about Mr Beatty. To the ever-self-worshiping baby-boom generation, Beatty endeavors to tell us that this commie mumbo-jumbo would really work if given a the proper chance, etc etc. Predictably, in 1981, all the Hollywood limousine-liberals fell in step with the aging producer-director-star-messiah to give this wandering anti-history lesson their highest plaudits and most hyperbolic praise; then all went home to guzzle champagne &amp; cocaine, fire their American-born servants and hire illegal aliens for the money-savings. Basically, the film gives us several insights into the early days of Progressive Movements and the first successful Communist Revolution but doesn't know what to do with it...all we get is vignettes. The film-makers also try to develop the love story between the Reeds but can't take a stand there, either. If this WERE a 20th-century Gone With The Wind, we would never know why the confederates fought the union for or if Scarlett really did end up in love with Rhett.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the 10 best American films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fascinating, expertly made look at why "The Red Menace" never was that, here in the United States, and why the Russian Revolution never turned out to be what it could have been.Technically, the movie is beautiful to look at, well written and well acted. It has a lot of great professional actors in it, and lots of the people who were actually there at the time this part of our history was being made. The "witnesses" device works well for Warren Beatty who as a director and writer always seems to include the easily overlooked details of the stories in most of his films. He is also at his fumbling best as John Reed, whose 10 Days That Shook The World fell into well-deserved obscurity probably almost as soon as it was written. That this great historical perspective could rise out of that is truly a testimony to Beatty's talent.There are many great acting performances in this film, including one of Jack Nicholson's very best as Eugene O'Neil, as well as those of Paul Sorvino, Gene Hackman and George Plimpton who demonstrate the range of persons who touched Jack Reed's life. Jerzy Kozinsky is riveting as Zinoviev.If one likes historically based dramas, this one should leave you breathless, and will probably leave you wanting to watch it more than once, just to make sure you don't miss any of the details.10 Stars, Absolutely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old news that should not be forgotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film with the title Reds must be a propaganda film, and it actually is (joke: propaganda is a gentlemanly goose). From a political point of view it just hawks about the familiar worn-out stereotypes. If you like to deepen your political insights, this is not the film for you. However, the film also contains the delightful love story between Louise Bryant and John Reed - in the fantasy of the script writers. It is definitely worth while to watch this struggle between two very independent minds, who increasingly become to value their mutual relationship and company. It is not a cohabitation for the sake of the cats. Nevertheless, since politics is my real thing, I shall confine my comments to the historical scenes. At the start of the twentieth century politics was a mess. The democracy was anything but accepted as the best political system, not even in Europe. As a consequence of the failing liberal system (robber barons etcetera), there was a large support for unsound ideas like revolutionary socialism (Leninism), anarchism and fascism. This relative chaos had an enormous pull on intellectual adventurers, who believed that they could supply the right left-wing answers. Often they advocated a system of workers councils (which obviously does not work). To be fair, I know nothing about John Reed. But his case is very similar to Karl Radek (present in the film), and Dutch revolutionaries like Anton Pannekoek and Herman Gorter (should have been present). The normal system had failed so miserably, that their weird visions could gain some acceptance. Unlike the opportunist Lenin they were individualists, dogmatists and fanatics. This explains why Reed radicalizes: he starts as a supporter of president Wilson and the AFL, joins the IWW, forms his own socialist sect, and ends his life in Soviet Russia. He just can not settle. Abandon the search for truth, settle for a good fantasy. The script shows how Reed exclaims to Radek (or was it Zinoviev?): "Individualism is the true source of rebellion!" This libertarian stance is hard to reconcile with his socialist sympathies. Sure, you are unique, just like anyone else. In addition the film suggests that in his last days Reed distances himself from the revolution. He even tries to stop a charge of Red soldiers. This is stupendous, for in his actual final articles he still glorifies the Red Army. In such moments Reds does not stand to reason and seems to work on liberal propaganda. Having said that, the general picture remains credible. The interludes with real old acquaintances of Bryant and Reed repair some of the flaws in the script. They display how the common Russian people were misled in order to satisfy the lust for power of a ruthless party. This may be old news, but should not be forgotten. Man who leap off cliff jump to conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ain't no party like a communist party</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Our blindness to the results of systemic violence is perhaps most clearly perceptible in debates about communist crimes. Responsibility for communist crimes is ascribed an ideological source. But when one draws attention to the millions who died as a result from capitalist globalisation, from the tragedy of Mexico in the 16th century through to the Belgian Congo holocaust, responsibility is largely denied. All this seems just to have happened as the result of an 'objective' process, which nobody planned, and for which there was no 'Capitalist Manifesto'." - Zizek "Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past." - Marx Warren Beatty stars in, produces and directs "Reds", a 1981 epic about the life and career of journalist and activist John Reed. Diane Keaton co-stars as Louise Bryant, a feminist, activist and Reed's lover.Odd for a Hollywood production, let alone one released at the dawn of Reaganism, "Reds" both deals with the Russian Revolution and is sympathetic toward communism. Much of the film thus watches as Reed mingles with unionists, communists and documents the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, the subject of his 1919 book, "Ten Days That Shook The World".One of the most ballsy moments in human history, the October Revolution essentially saw different Marxist factions allying to usurp monarchy, feudalism and nascent capitalism. After their victory, Russia found itself surrounded, invaded and then essentially sequestered for the next 70 years. Utopian dreams would collapse and she quickly become a curious hybrid: an Imperialist nation like the then-contemporary Western Empires (though much less violent, by dint of much smaller colonial holdings), a giant socialist state (bringing genuine improvements to the lives of millions), a state capitalist command economy (and so antithetical to "Marxism") and a brutal dictatorial regime (which would incrementally dissolve after the death of Joseph Stalin).A similar movement happened in the 1780s, when the disparate forces of the French Revolution, influenced by thinkers like John Locke and Jean Rousseau, toppled monarchies, late-feudalism and cooked up many of what we now term "democratic principles" and "civil rights". They also enacted numerous "radical" policies (abolishing feudal dues owed to churches and landlords, nationalising land, creating constitutions etc) which we today take for granted, as well as popularising new political terminology (and even slang; the communist term of endearment, "comrade", comes from the French Revolution). Like the Russian Revolution, these "victories" were won through much violence, before their "gains" were set back by reactionary forces. Marx would call this "Bonapartism", a term he used to refer to any situation in which counter-revolutionary military officers seize power from revolutionaries, and then use selective reformism to co-opt the radicalism of the popular classes. The term was used by Leon Trotsky to refer to Stalin's regime.From the perspective of the lower classes, the French Revolution was ultimately lost, but it instigated countless "positive" changes across Europe. On the flip-side, it also forced the ruling class to morph, adapt and develop new means of control. The Russian Revolution (and German Revolution of 1918) was likewise lost, "communism" crushed across Europe and left-wing parties or labour movements murdered in the millions across most of Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and even at home in America. Still, out of these ashes, and the ashes of crushed labour groups, came minor "positive" changes: women's and minority rights, the shortening of work days, the end of the old Empires, the rise of nationalist/independent movements etc. On the flip-side, the ruling class once again morphed and adapted.So "Reds" charts broad movements which are as old as time itself. Each human epoch tends to find humanity constructing giant energy accumulation systems (feudalism, chattel slavery, theocracy, monarchy, capitalism etc) in which social hierarchies are set up and in which man exploits man. Those with power tend to win these class conflicts, with, arguably, minor benefits coming at the end of each cycle of conflict.Most of "Reds" deals with a rocky romantic relationship between Reed and Bryant. He's dedicated to his social activism and ignores her, she's seeking some semblance of independence but wants to be noticed. By the film's end, both have learnt to simultaneously pursue their own dreams whilst also giving to others. Their relationship symbolises the film's overall message, a message which Reed explicitly lays out toward the end of the film. "You don't think a man can be an individual and be true to the collective!" Reed yells, "You don't think a man can speak for his own country and speak for the International at the same time, or love his wife and still be faithful to the revolution! You separate a man from what he loves most, and what you do is purge what's unique in him! And when you purge what's unique in him, you purge dissent. And when you purge dissent, you kill the revolution! Dissent IS revolution!" In other words, "Reds" condemns the neurotic control society which the USSR became, but nevertheless advocates a kind of hybrid of collectivism and "independence", which of course was the the theoretical intention of 19th century communism anyway.Though interesting, "Reds" is slow, overlong and at times too conventional. The film also missteps by ignoring the brutal conditions of American workers, the Russian peasantry and so forth (even contemporary capitalism has 76 percent of Western workers living paycheck to paycheck, 1.3 billion globally in extreme poverty, 850 million in starvation, and roughly 80 percent of the world living on less than ten dollars a day), which has the unintended effect of painting Beatty's band of agitators and rabble rousers as hermetically sealed academics and intellectuals without a Cause. Jack Nicholson steals the show as Eugene O'Neal, an Irish-American playwright.7.5/10 ? See "The Spy Who Came In From the Cold".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Socialism in the 1910's that Looks too Much like 2010</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie on cable last night and watched out of curiosity. The story is more about the relationship between Jack and Louise than it is about Socialism and the Bolshevik Revolution; yet we see how both of those played out in their relationship and learn a little bit about both throughout the film (which is 3 hours, by the way!) I thought Beatty did a fairly good job with his part, but I've never been a fan of Diane Keaton and this role is no exception. Nicholson is terrific, as always. The interviews between scenes were spot-on.The active Socialist movement in the U.S. began in 1905 under the name "Intercollege Socialist Society." It was started by author Jack London, among others. Their numbers increased until about 1921, when Socialism fell in disrepute after the failed Bolshevik Revolution. At that time the ISS went underground. However their work continued, eventually under a different name (League for Industrial Democracy), and is still active today under multiple branches.Reds gives us a grim, real picture of the inside world of the beginnings of this Socialist movement, as experienced by two historical figures, both writers. A modern remake by some brave producer would likely be well-received with all the cries of Socialim that are heard within the country today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most beautifully romantic dreams are the doomed ones ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You got to hand it to Warren Beatty: making a three-hour epic about the birth of America's left conscience between 1915 and 1920 is quite an accomplishment. And to think that the budget of "Reds" was funded by a major movie studio (emblematic of the very forms of capitalism the film's protagonists denounced) makes the achievement delightfully impressive. But what exactly makes the Communists in general (and John Reed in particular) so controversial that most reviewers asked themselves: "how could they make a movie about reds?" paraphrasing the tag line of Stanley Kubrick's "Lolita". After all, the Soviet Revolution was one of the most pivotal events of the last century and John Reed, who covered it through his masterpiece "Ten Days that Shook the World", was the only American to be buried in the Kremlin walls. So maybe viewers are approaching the film with the wrong mindset, the question should not be "why making a film about American communists" but "why not?" The ideals, the dreams they stood for, maybe Utopian (were they?), still deserved recognition.And recognition doesn't mean tribute, or beatification. Warren Beatty plays the journalist as a politically engaged but not flawed character, capable to display the most idealistic romanticism and then the most cynical pragmatism in the same flow of ideas. While Beatty, the actor, delivers political slogans with conviction, Beatty, the director, confronts them to their limits, to reality whether it's set in Russia or America, or to the simple fact that ideas depend on people. And the strength of "Reds" is to care about people more than ideas (which even Communism failed to consider), to portray the men and the women who believed that Communism was the closest ideology to justice and humanity, with the fairest view on the world, while America's democracy was poisoned by liberalism and money. Which leads me to my favorite line from the film, one I even used it for my own purpose: "what is WWI all about?" "Profits". I admired Reed's accurate answer but then after a second viewing, I realized that countries also fought for intangible elements such as ideals and prestige. And I'm not sure that Communists were all reason and practicality. When Reed confronts Louis Fraina (Paul Sorvino) to determine which of their parties deserves to represent the Komintern, their debate is less a conflict of ideas than a battle of egos, as we're not even supposed to grasp the little subtleties that separate them. And that's the intelligence of "Reds": provided it's a historical drama, it doesn't teach history but shows people making it and being made by it. On that level, John Reed is the first ventricle of "Reds"' heart, the second being Louise Bryant, his wife, played by Diane Keaton."Reds" poster is eloquent enough: it doesn't feature the Revolution in March, or other symbols like the red flags, the Kremlin, the hammer and the faucet, it only shows the climactic reunion of John and Louise in the famous train station sequence. Like "Gone With the Wind", "Reds" is a magnificent love story interfering with the history with the perfect balance, never does one distract from the other, but they're never separated either. Reed is torn between the pragmatism of the political activist and the romanticism of the artist, Bryant is the strong-willed intellectual, she's an artist too, but more than anything, she's a woman, exercising her free will, whether it's to embrace her husband's cause or to take him from it, for his own good. Beatty is perfect to unveil a poignant vulnerability behind his dashing looks and Keaton to hide an inspirational courage behind her quirkiness. The romance is essential to the story because it's obviously doomed, just as doomed as the red dream in America. The film is served by a wonderful gallery of supporting characters from the hard-headed Emma Goldberg (Maureen Stapleton, who'd win her Best Supporting Oscar) to the gloomy and sensually indelicate Eugene O'Neil, played by Jack Nicholson, "Reds" is a period film that create contemporary characters, appealing to us without feeling anachronistic. In fact, the tone of the film makes it fresh and modern, and I guess it's partly due to the remarkable idea of inserting testimonies from people who knew Reed and Bryant. These interviews allow the viewer to detach himself from history, to quit this sort of emphasizing posture. These names that filled historical books were people like you and I, they had their egos, their flaws, their impulses etc. They all speak with a black neutral background, and their names don't appear so we don't fall in the documentary genre, but just start seeing these "Reds" as people, not symbols. Even if "Reds" is not a documentary, it has an undeniable educational value, but it's still a big epic in the great Hollywood tradition; a film is not a book, and Beatty understood that viewers would probably lose track on the political aspect. Cinematically speaking, it features the obligatory grandiose sequences of a big-budget epic like the unforgettable Internationale singing, and the train attack yet it has its share of anticlimactic moments like John Reed's sober finale or a score that cancels off the whole 'David Lean' feel. Now, to those who still wonder why they made a film about the "Reds" :America has never been communist, but many political decisions were driven by the Red Scare (which some parts of the film deals with), the Keynesian theories of the welfare state were an alternative to Communism, the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe was strategically guided by the Cold War, not to mention McCarthyism or the Vietnam War. That Communism was doomed didn't make it any less significant in the history of America, as it was and still is the best antidote against liberalism's own excesses, those that are destroying our world today. Call it Utopian, but still, the red dream hasn't lost all its relevance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reds color has faded.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Beatty's vainglorious attempt to join epic filmmakers with this plodding historical romantic melodrama back dropped by the Russian Revolution is filled with fragments from Lawrence, Zhivago and some Bonnie and Clyde but like former mentor Arthur Penn he directs with a leaden hand as Reds lumbers along repeating itself for over three and a half hours. There is decent two hour film* in Reds but the extra ninety minutes tacked on serves little purpose beyond Beatty the artist identifying with John Reed the swashbuckling newspaper man who marched to the tune of his own drum crusading for the masses. American Journalist John Reed (Ten Days that Shook the World) is passionate about two things in life, Socialism and Louise Bryant his feminist paramour. Torn between maintaining domestic bliss and turning the world into a Socialist paradise Reed attempts to juggle the two and in spite of being betrayed by both at various times (Louise has an affair with Eugene O'Neill and Bolshevik big shot Zinoeiv distorts his translated words the principled Reed refuses to let either dream die.With Vittorio Storaro (The Conformist, Godfather) lensing, Richard Sylbert (Chinatown, the Fortune) in charge of production design and Shirley Russell's (Women in Love) subdued (for her) costuming Reds has an excellent period look. The power of director Beatty's mise en scene remains inconsistent however as he dilutes the film's impact with an excessive amount of chaotic debates among party members and squabbles between the two stars along with a few kiss and make up silhouettes of the two humping. Moderation in all these areas would have clearly removed some of the film's lethargy but Beatty's attempts to balance a remarkable historical event with a romantic interest that has Beatty the actor's same stuttering seductive charm in play from a previous fantasy film (Heaven Can Wait) and a film based in Beverly Hills (Shampoo) on the face of it alone lacks gravitas. It's the same boyish love sick puppy with the silent pained expressions we get in the two confections but we're dealing with the real world in turmoil and a lot of time could be saved if they took Rick's Casablanca speech to heart.As Louise Bryant Diane Keaton spends most of the film in a state of frustration and disappointment both personally and professionally and in the incapable hands of the limited Keaton it is one long suffering sulk to behold as Beatty peppers us with dozens of ambiguous reaction shots of her in awe and anger with the mercurial Reed. Jack Nicholson's O'Neill is laid back and so much more interesting than the red rousing Reed you almost wish the camera would follow him around for the rest of the film. Novelist Jerzy Kosinski as Zinoeiv is surprisingly effective and Maureen Stapleton brings dignity and radical rational to the role of Emma Goldman.Beatty's most imaginative move is to intersperse the film with testimony from witnesses of the era and acquaintances of the two but here too he errs by not identifying them individually and most of the anecdotes do little to flesh Reed and Bryant out at all.One could make the argument that given Beatty's status in Hollywood in 1980 this epic film about an audacious journalist who blazed his own path mirrored Beatty's trail blazing part in bringing about Hollywood's last golden age with Bonnie and Clyde. It's certainly one of the reasons why Reds fails as epic. David Lean may sympathize with Lawrence and Zhivago but he keeps his distance. Beatty's Reed is Beatty's alter ego and the camera seldom leaves his face except for Louise's wide eyed admiration of him and conflict over him. Instead of size scope and larger than life we get the socially conscious Bickersons, something that would translate just as well on a theater stage. At best Reds is very lean Lean.* Actually Jaques Feyder's 1937 Knight without Armor with Robert Donat and Marlene Dietrich in similar period and setting is that film. Surpassing Reds in nearly every department and devoid of its heavy handed pretense it makes some sharp observations about the chaotic struggle between the Reds and the Whites with Feyder displaying a more imaginative command of composition and Dietrich a far more convincing Countess on the run than Keaton's pipsqueak feminist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In his Academy Award acceptance speech, Warren Beatty plauded a capitalistic system that would permit the making of a movie like this -- about a rabble-rousing journalist who joined the Russian revolution and wound up buried in the Kremlin. He was right to do it. Imagine a Soviet movie about an heroic capitalist? John D. Rockefeller as iconoclastic humanist? Karl Marx distinguished between what he called "false consciousness" and "class consciousness." In the former, you blame all your misfortunes on bad luck, personal flaws, a lousy upbringing, and so forth. In "class consciousness" you recognize that the problem is systemic, that you're humped because the class system is designed to keep you down at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. The path to improvement comes not through efforts to improve one's self but through collective power.In the film, "The Grapes of Wrath", Tom Joad and Casey the Preacher achieve class consciousness. Ma Joad, with her speech about hunkering down and letting the rich destroy themselves, does not. Here, Warren Beatty as Jack Reed wavers back and forth between false consciousness and class consciousness. The choice is put to him bluntly by Jerzy Kozinski as a Red Russian leader -- what's more important, your love for your wife (Diane Keaton) or the fate of all the people of Russia? Kozinski is one of many recognizable supporting players. I don't know why, but many of them have signed on for small roles in the way that European actors do. They don't mind taking tiny parts once in a while. They don't seem to be afraid that it will damage their standing on the A list. I won't list all of the established performers with small roles but they include people like Paul Sorvino and Gene Hackman. Good on them! But only half of the movie is about the "liberation" of the Russian people. The other half, probably the major part, deals with the love affair between Louise Bryant (Keaton) and Beatty's character. In the early years of the 20th century there was a movement towards greater freedom. (Women didn't yet have the vote, for instance.) And there are many talky and somewhat dull arguments between Keaton and Beatty. She seems more committed to throwing off the shackles than he does.The film is definitely not a propaganda piece along the lines of, say, "Mission to Moscow" or "North Star" -- the sort of thing that came out of Hollywood during the war years. And it's not an anti-communist tract either. It's unsparing in its depiction of the results of the revolution. The aftermath of the moderate Karensky government is thoroughly familiar to anyone who knows what happens AFTER a revolution. There's an internal split based on self-interest and a lot of shouting about ideological purity. A lot of blood is often spilled, which is shown in "Doctor Zhivago" but not here. Things fall apart. The center cannot hold -- because there IS no center, and eventually something resembling a dictatorship is established, if only to maintain order in the streets.I rather like "Reds" because it's a courageous movie in displaying so flagrantly the chaos that follows the deposing (and slaughter) of Czar Nicholas. The business about "liberation" is treated ironically most of the time, undercutting the seriousness of the theme.I like it too because of Jack Nicholson's depiction of Eugene O'Neill as a depressed, alcoholic playwright, smothered in false consciousness, given to loving individuals rather than social classes.At the same time, the movie sometimes drags. I think I understand why the love interest and the revolutionary motives are there, and why they're necessary, but I could have done with less of the former and a little more formal explication of the latter.There are a multitude of inserts of older people talking about Reed and Bryant and the revolution and Greenwich Village after the turn of the century. Most of them weren't alive at the time, but Henry Miller is charming in his candor and cynicism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton work well together. Their performances are earthy and seductive. The attraction and love between their characters is palpable, and I've always thought that an actor who can disappear into a role, actually become the character, is the main indicator of their talent. Both Beatty and Keaton accomplish this with seeming ease, and much of this must hinge on Beatty's directorial efforts. They appear comfortable in their roles. The script is witty and intelligent, hearkening to a time when America was younger and less sure of herself. The use of the information provided by the Witnesses adds a level of thoughtfulness and conjecture to this film by seeing the characters through the eyes and minds of actual people who remembered them. The film is long (over three hours,) but the persistence of the viewer is well rewarded by an impressive list of supporting roles played by Maureen Stapleton, Jack Nicholson, Edward Herrmann, and Paul Sorvino.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great romantic epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great photography, great production values, great acting, decent directing, but what brings the film together is the excellent editing. This film looks as if it was made in the editing room and probably was if the stories about Beatty as a director were true. Highly emotional at moments, a great love story above all else. But not quite there historically (on the Russian side), mainly because there is so much condensing (even at three hours running time) and at times it shows in the dialogue which has the odd cliche here and there. Someone further down the review list was banging on about it being a "poem to communism" or something when it so obviously is not. If anything it lingers on the lost opertunities and the betrayal of the socialist ideal. As for the "genocide" that reviewer mentions, this is pre-Stalin Russia and had just undergone being the victim of genocide courtesy of Germany which it was fighting against with the Allies. But as said, this really is a love story more than anything else and of romantic epic proportions not seen much in American movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully done by Beatty. A good campaign for socialism and communism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1981's "Reds" is a masterpiece of film well done by Warren Beatty. And Warren has been one that's never been shy about political views, and he clearly holds nothing back here with this picture. Set before the 1920's Beatty who directed also stars as journalist John Reed who's very outspoken and liberal and wants social change in America. I must say that Warren is tremendous with this role John Reed then meets an eager and feminist type lady named Louise Bryant which is portrayed just so emotional and charming by Diane Keaton. This love affair and search for social change all unfolds and happens during the Russian revolution. As it's a crusade to bring an end to capitalism and make a new policy of social freedom for all no matter how controversial or ant-war it seems. This man John Reed saw the need for new light and felt that big business and war was greedy and corrupt and the power needed to be given to the people. The film is long drawn out and touching with the pains of acceptance and denial that John feels first in Russia the viewer feels. It proves that this was a man that was willing to die for social and political change. Jack Nicholson is memorable as a tough and love scorned poet and play writer Eugene O' Neill his supporting role was great. "Reds" is overall a good film that makes one think about communism and a different way to live no matter what political stance you've taken.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Epic? How about suicide provoking? There's nothing quite like watching rich liberals parading around in their summer whites and discussing all the world's ills. I gave up after the Eugene O'Neill scene at the beach house ? the characters were too despicable too soon for me to want to get to Russia (where I was anxious to go from the get-go). My wife wants me to see if it gets better, but the truth of the matter is I would've walked in the theater immediately after the beach house scene. Very disappointing ... some wasted talent and I can only imagine dollars ... I'm not sure if there was a political motive to telling the story of these two characters ... as individuals, I found nothing interesting about either ... they appear to have been spoiled brats with no real knowledge of the "working man" (try raising a family on those wages you're looking to unionize) ... and I have to wonder about the depiction of O'Neill ... just wonder because even his romanticism/alcoholism was more appealing than the main characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film about 6 years ago on VHS and I made a bit of a fool of myself that day because without paying any attention I popped cassette number 2 into the machine first and just started watching. Got to the first cassette eventually and then realized when the credits started to roll what a dufuss I was. Anyway, I watched it and was impressed.A few days ago I bought the special 25'th anniversary edition on DVD at Costco and last night I completed watching it. I was just knocked out. I do not recall the original film having interviews with the survivors of that era spliced into the film (like it is done a bit in "Band of Brothers) but in this new edition we have cutaways to recent interviews with very old survivors of that time - to great effect.The print is crystal clear, highlighting one of the best lit and staged films in recent memory. It reminds me of the luminous colors of "Heavens Gate" and "Carrington". The cinematography by Vittoria Storaro is simply divine. The editing is very good with just a few moments that cut very rapidly and are a bit jarring; but I will give Beatty the benefit of doubt - perhaps it was meant to be sharp at that moment. The music is wonderful, not too distracting, always supporting the drama or humor of the moment.This is a true story and although I only know of John Reed's life through this movie, I do not know how much liberty was taken or how many facts were manipulated, if any. I grew up hearing of how important "Ten days that shook the world" was but have yet to read it. I am also aware that most American's still harbor a pathological loathing of anything to do with the word "Communist"; as such Reed's life was full of a struggle between his own social conscience and his lack of acceptance of the reality that to his fellow American's his vision was far too radical and at the end, poisonous. Reed strikes me as a man bursting at the seams with creative energy that is slowly but surely fastened to the plight of the working men and women, to blue collar suffering, finally to the emancipation of all the working class in the overcharged updraft of early Marxist Bolshevism. As an idealist at heart and a deeply concerned but ferocious activist and overall political troublemaker, he relished nothing more than to push his shoulders into the friction of debate, the center of which eventually took him to the Russian peasant revolution, the rise of Lenin and the modern Communist Russian states. He might just have spent more time in the political dog pit than was warranted and in the film he is reminded over and over again by his long suffering wife, Louise Bryant, that his efforts were best directed to writing rather than getting arrested for political activism.Beatty, as legend has it, was consumed and obsessed with the telling of Reed's story, of creating a film on a very large scale in order to match the enormity of the story as it unfolded in America and even more in Russia. After having watched this new edition I can happily say that Beatty should be more engrossed in many more projects: this is a remarkably adult, mature, insightful, talented, beautiful telling of a great history, one that touched the lives of so many people. It is a sad story that Reed is not well known today; I have heard that he is the ONLY American buried in the Kremlin. Even after the collapse of the Soviet empire and the falling of the Berlin wall, this is still a very important film and it involved huge personal risk for Beatty.The cast is outstanding. Diane Keaton is young and pretty. She is not the most beautiful woman but she does look attractive and her acting is terrific. Jack Nicholson does what he does best: embody characters with all his self and in this case the great play-write Eugene O'Neil. His brooding and broiling inner self does not overwhelm but simmers at a constant hot temperature. Jack holds in check his killer smile but the glare from his eyes is powerful and full of passion.In summary this is a film that has only improved with age, the acting, directing, script, cinematography and continuity are all excellent. Beatty took the risk of reaching further than his grasp but we are blessed with a sure hand, a clear eye and a total devotion to his craft. A great achievement and one he should be proud of. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greater Vasarian Parliament and the Social Democratic Party will now come to order?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And now a political address from His Excellency, Prime Minster Peter Andres of Vasaria: "Ladies and gentlemen of the Greater Vasarian Parliament and the Social Democratic Party, first let me state that 1981 was a bad year for films. The only exception I can think of was Steven Spielberg's RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, a classic adventure film which is still being enjoyed and embraced by millions today. Instead the Best Picture Oscar went to the tedious sports drama CHARIOTS OF FIRE. Another dull, tedious film that was nominated for Best Picture that year was Warren Beatty's REDS, which I have just finished watching in the palace screening room after experiencing over three long hours of pain and discomfort in front of the screen.In my opinion, gentlemen, the film's 12 Oscar nominations were undeserving. Possibly the only deserving award was for the cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, which won. Like Kenneth Branagh, star and director Warren Beatty displays his over-inflated ego here by striving to create another CITIZEN KANE or GONE WITH THE WIND and only succeeds in creating a clumsy, overlong film. The Oscar-winning direction by Beatty is uninspired and bland. The film's Oscar-winning screenplay is confusing and muddled, randomly narrated by senile witnesses in interviews and skipping all over the place and never giving us the chance to experience some character development. The Oscar-nominated art direction is claustrophobic, darkly-lit, and depressing?possibly the only nice sets in the whole film are the lavish interiors of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. The acting is truly bland and lifeless here?great actors such as Jack Nicholson, Paul Sorvino, and Gene Hackman are wasted in the roles of Beatty's fellow communist sympathizers.Where's the charm and the humor in this movie? There is none?resulting only in a bland, lifeless film like the cold, didactic politics it praises. Even the sight of seeing Warren Beatty in a bear costume in one scene did not amuse me. Heck, looking at U.S. Senator John Kerry's nose and wondering what's inside it is more entertaining than watching this film. If you want to watch a good political film, I wholeheartedly recommend DUCK SOUP (1933), THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940), or David Lean's DOCTOR ZHIVAGO (1965).Now, gentlemen, I will comment on this film from a political standpoint: Communism will not work! Millions of people have been oppressed, starved, and murdered under Communism?as well as under fascism?and this film praises such a government! Communism is also against religion and the Christian faith, making ridiculous claims that these faiths delay and oppress industry. Not only is this film boring?it glorifies an oppressive political system! As in Vasaria, Sweden, and other minor European countries, socialism can only work in moderation?that is, if conservative views are also evident in the government, as with the Social Democratic Party of Vasaria. The views of our party preserve private industry, personal freedoms of religion and speech, and also regulate government funding for public works and media here. This unique system of government, which preserves individual freedom and also uses a moderate form of government support to provide for financial and economic reasons, is not evident anywhere in Communism nor socialism.Warren Beatty, like Michael Moore, is a liberal sympathizer, a fat lying pig, and a dangerous, egotistical man. Both men attempt to manipulate and irritate the populace with their ridiculous liberal propaganda in their films. In my opinion, both men should be asked to be deported from their home country and therefore live happily ever after together somewhere in Vietnam, Cuba, or North Korea. It is my suggestion that we contact the American government as soon as possible in order to do so.And now if you'll excuse me, my lovely private secretary is waiting for me upstairs in the palace bedroom. Hail Vasaria!" Ladies and gentlemen of the Greater Vasarian Parliament and the Social Democratic Party, I must confess that I strongly agree with the comments and opinions of His Excellency. Let it be proclaimed: as with Hitler's MEIN KAMPF, this material has found its sole use inside Vasarian toilets. The issue is closed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When experiencing or listening to a story, the most important thing to consider is the point of view of the teller. Reds starts off and interweaves interviews of those who had some contact with either or both Louise Bryant and Jack Reed and put their story into both big-picture context and social irrelevance. This is delightful. The film, outside of this tells us Jack Reeds impression of his experiences as a radical writer who finds himself turned into an idealistic politician with his self-engrossed sometimes wife trying to be important by his side. I found their relationship hard to watch as Beatty turned Louise Bryant into some unbalanced and immoral slut. This is not so delightful and failed as a love story that I would care about. What is the real glue of the experience are the interpersonal speeches laid out by Jack Nicholson as play write Eugene O'Neil and the political summaries presented by Jean Stapleton and Emma Goldberg that seem to cut to the core, almost the way science fiction movies need that smart speech of 2 minutes that moves everything along. The movie needed to move along further as the darkness of post-revolution Russia, cell-bound Norway and the political basements in America show us frustration and loneliness but tell us nothing of what the fight was all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warren Beatty's 1981 epic "Reds" concerns radical American journalist John Reed and his involvement in the Communist movement both at home and in Russia around the time of the first World War. However, it is also a love story focusing on Reed and fellow writer Louise Bryant.The film's subject matter is intriguing but given the political aspect I'm sure that it won't appeal to all sensibilities. Meanwhile, the romantic angle is a complex and interesting one, made more interesting by the introduction of playwright Eugene O'Neill as a potential suitor for Bryant.The cast is a good one, as evidenced by the four Oscar nominations in the acting categories. Warren Beatty &amp; Diane Keaton were nominated in the leading roles while Jack Nicholson &amp; Maureen Stapleton were nominated for their supporting roles. Stapleton was the only one who took home an Oscar, which was a bit of a surprise to me. Not that she was necessarily unworthy but Beatty and Keaton were more deserving. Nicholson is great to watch, as always, though he's only in a handful of scenes. The rest of the cast, which includes Gene Hackman, Paul Sorvino &amp; Jerzy Kosinski, is well assembled as well.Beatty's direction was rewarded with an Oscar and that's a distinction that I find hard to argue with. One inspired touch was the inclusion of real-life 'witnesses' sharing their reminiscences about Reed &amp; Bryant. Of course, Vittorio Storaro's Oscar-winning cinematography also deserves much of the credit for the film's look. Stephen Sondheim's score is well done also, if not as striking as the film's visual elements.Overall, "Reds" is a high quality epic whose 12 Oscar nominations illustrate the strength of its composition. It would have made a deserving Best Picture winner but the Academy apparently thought otherwise. As for myself, only the political aspects of the film prevent me from recommending it unreservedly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Comrade, I'm not leaving the Revolution." - Emma Goldman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know enough about the Russian Revolution to claim whether this was an accurate accounting of the events of the era. The movie did seem to present an even handed treatment of the rise of socialism in America during the early 1900's and the formation of rival Communist/Socialist parties. As a historical figure, Jack Reed (Warren Beatty) epitomizes the ideologically driven 'savior' bent on tackling the problems of humanity by attempting to save it.The film is long at over three hours, and consequently bogs down at times. The romantic entanglement of Reed, Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton) and playwright Eugene O'Neill (Jack Nicholson) serves both as a central plot element and an absorbing backdrop to the political sympathies of the principal players. They, along with their circle of friends present an early look at the emergence of dissent outside the mainstream of American life. The inclusion of historical 'witnesses' to the lives of the characters and events of the time offer an intriguing first person account of the film's story, though admittedly some of those figures have some difficulty engaging their memories. Not that one could blame them some sixty plus years after the fact.I didn't get the sense that the film was taking sides one way or another, although I have to admit I personally felt a bit of a subversive element as the picture got under way. As director, Beatty appeared to keep personal ideology out of it, although the character he portrayed was certainly focused in his determination to unite the workers of the world in a grand communist utopianism. Visionary idealists like Reed always doom themselves to frustration when faced with the unyielding obstacles of reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think much of Warren Beatty's 70's output, shallow features too often promoting his physical features if you ask me and so was intrigued to watch this very long and thus highly detailed bio-pic of writer John Reed, firebrand supporter of Communism in America and firsthand witness of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.Hats off to him in the first place for writing, directing, as well as starring in a movie, the main subject of which was political anathema, I'd have imagined, to most of his fellow- countrymen and women. Okay, the dramatic narrative is shored up by his romance with his equally free-spirited wife Louise Bryant, played by Diane Keaton, but one suspects that while this was a necessary concession to the box-office, it does add degrees of emotion and human conflict to what on paper might have come off as dry, beat-around-the-head polemic.I did sense however that the "great love story" aspect was a touch overplayed and overwrought taking in as it did, her "free-love" affair with playwright Eugene O'Neill and found myself less interested in their played-out love-triangle than in Reed's Herculean efforts to produce a united communist interest in America and more, to have it sanctioned in Moscow itself, to where he is naturally drawn, moth-like to the flame of history on the march.The film puts one in mind of David Lean's massive epics, only Beatty bases his story on real-life people and events, rather than on the British master's reliance on classic literature for inspiration. The capturing of time and place is brilliantly achieved, from the foment of political meetings both in America and Russia to the vast and beautiful, if bleak landscape of Russia. I could probably have done without the interjections by the real-life witnesses to history as their recollections were often, perhaps deliberately contradictory, but possibly Beatty saw something in his research material that he felt deserved screen-time.The acting is mostly very good, Beatty outstanding as the unromantic hero and Keaton in one of her better-acted parts (I'm not a fan) as his complex wife. Eugene O'Neill is played by Jack Nicholson, but unfortunately Nicholson wins and Gene Hackman also gets not much more than a cameo role, but the acting by the non-star ensemble is much more effective.This film was an excellent combination of a literary script and ambitious large scale cinematography, a rare combination in Hollywood which for me largely succeeded and certainly sent me scuttling to download "10 Days That Shook The World" and to read up on the brief but eventful life and times of John Reed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Highly Intelligent Historical Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read, from numerous sources, that Warren Beatty's "Reds" is now widely considered to be an over-long and over-praised film. Having just viewed the whole show again, after many previous viewings. I simply wanted to express my firm disagreement with this opinion. It is not a film for those who are exclusively devoted to thrill-a-minute, fast paced action pictures. It is a thoughtful piece, conscientiously devoted to examining, in depth, a very important and dramatic moment in world history, and its impact on characters who played a central role in what happened at that time. I wish more such serious and intelligent fare was produced today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The kind of film that has sadly just about disappeared - the personal, auteur driven epic. Very rarely if ever now will a studio give a film maker huge funds to do a risky, personal, not obviously commercial project, one that could never be made as a 'small' film. While critics can nit pick, and a few of their points may be valid (both Beatty and Diane Keaton were at least 10 years older then their real life characters, making some behavior seem overly naive and juvenile instead of understandable for their youth and inexperience), overall this is a masterful combining of the big picture and the personal, and how the two interrelate in life. How do we deal with emotions that are much messier than our ideals of how to live? It explores the twin faces of revolution - the sometimes desperate need to fight to create a new order, but the danger that the new order may be just as corrupt as the old.Rare is the film that deeply, honestly explores both idealism and the dark realities of political compromise. Rarer still is the film that explores both in a personal way, without judgment, but with deep insight. Beautifully shot by Vitorio Storraro, wonderful production design. Keaton and Beatty are very good in the leads, and the supporting cast, down to the smallest role, is generally magnificent. Especially amazing are Maureen Stapleton as Emma Goldman, and Jack Nicholson in one of his very best (and most restrained) performances as Eugene O'Neil. He may capture the true pain of trying to live through the eyes of an artist as well as anyone I've ever seen.Thrilling, challenging, gorgeous, emotional and epic. They don't make 'em like this anymore, and that's our loss.</fullReview>

People believe this as the story of a writer and journalist,John Reeds. I had same misconception before i watched it. What i think is this movie is actually a saga on the rise of left movement in the US and feminism, which broached the idea of free sex and independent thinking. Please watch this movie, if you are more interested in Emma Goldman's life. It is a nice movie to know about the first world war and its aftermath. I disagree with some reviews who blame for its length-it is 196 minutes.I believe that only due to this length, it could portray lives of its actors in detail.</fullReview>

And - though it does go on for quite awhile - the story moves briskly and keeps you locked in to every moment.The power of the film is such that, even knowing how it all played out in real life, you yearn to be a part of "The Revolution" and take up arms with Jack and Louise against the evil capitalists. Well, maybe not entirely. But you do find yourself seduced by the romance and adventure of it all.I just can't say enough good about it. I'm just in awe of how well-crafted it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Warren Beatty (who also plays the lead role),Reds is a powerful mix of history in the making,ideals and love.Although a film of epic proportions, Reds is surprisingly intimate as well with a lot o time given to the characters.The film stars Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson.Beginning in 1915 Reds is the real life story of journalist John Reed(Warren Beatty)who brings the horrific and historically life changing events of the Russian Revolution to the attention of the Amercican public.He also becomes an advocate of the newly formed Communist party.The first half details his relationship with fellow journalist and feminist intellectual Louise Bryant(Diane Keaton),looking at how the events in Russia both strengthen and weaken their relationship.The second half chronicles his time in Russia covering the events there and his involvement with the Communist party.This is not a advertisement for Communism in any way.Instead it's a powerful look at history and how at the time of it's formation for many people it was the only way of life in a country born out of the ruins of revolution.Filled with excellent performances especially Warren and Diane.Also Jack Nicholson is very good as Reed's friend, the playwright Eugene O'Neill who has an affair with Louise when Reed's time away from home began to take it's toll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Idealism and Disillusionment in The Bolshevik Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reds follows the lives of American journalist John 'Jack' Reed and his wife, Louise Bryant, amidst the background of the Bolshevik Revolution. It's an interesting, enjoyable epic with several good performances by Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Paul Sorvino, Jerzy Kosinski, and other good actors in cameo roles. The movie has been sold as a romantic epic, and indeed shows a good deal of the difficult, complex relationship between Jack and Louise.But I think director Warren Beatty just used this as bait for the real interesting story of Reds, which is the way Jack becomes more and more involved in the Revolution to the point that he becomes one of the Party's members and an influential speaker.The movie starts shortly before Louise meets Jack, in an interview, and immediately they feel an attraction for each other that leads her to abandon her husband and come live with Jack in New York. The first hour of the movie emphasizes their relationship mostly, especially the love affair between Louise and playwright Eugene O'Neill, and the effect Jack's work, which kept him away from her for long periods, had on their love.It is when Jack invites Louise to travel with him to Russia to cover the Revolution, that the movie becomes fascinating and marks a turning point in his life as he stops being a man reporting news to being a man involved in History, in the creation of news.Although it's clear that Beatty has love for the character he's playing, he nevertheless paints a disillusioned portrait of the Revolution and shows how quickly and easily it started going wrong. The hunger, the lack of fuel, the rise of oppression, are captured in this movie. And as a testament to his courage, he never allows Jack to have doubts or regrets. When the character Emma Goldman observes how the revolution has betrayed its own values, he makes a passionate speech about ends justifying means. Seldom do we witness such inflexibility and callousness in lead characters, not to mention one played by a star like Warren Beatty. But even though Jack remains faithful to the revolution, Beatty doesn't shy away from showing how he was used by it and gives the impression that Jack was involved in something that was too big for him.In the acting department, this movie is flawless. Maureen Stapleton didn't impress me enough in her role of Emma Goldman, but Nicholson, Keaton and Beatty were all wonderful. Nicholson was very little in the movie, but the few minutes he was in were hypnotic. And Keaton showed just how easily she can transmit feelings with just her eyes and body language.I'd also like to commend the work of director of photography Vittorio Storaro. I've been a fan of him for a while now. The images he captured in movies like The Conformist or The Spider's Stratagem have never left my mind due to their beauty. And his work in Reds was quite good too. In the first forty minutes his camera seemed sedate, but then he slowly starts showing that style that has made him one of the best DPs in the world: the way he captures colors, the composition of his shots, the symmetry in them. When the action changes to Russia, it becomes especially memorable.The movie is not always engaging, sometimes it's dull. The pacing is uneven, and hardly helped by the intrusive moments with witnesses talking about the events in the movie. Sadly they're not identified and their relationship with the characters is never explained. It's an interesting, risky choice that I think didn't succeed. Otherwise, Reds is good movie to watch, a marvel of film-making that is also an interesting recreation of a historical episode that reshaped our world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant period piece: interiors, costumes and politics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this film after first seeing it on its release about 1982 and I found the film as strong now as I did then. The movie, in my opinion, was very well acted by everybody concerned (my favourite was Kosinski as Zinoviev). As I have said, the visuals of the period were extremely good and I thought the fast editing was particularly effective. The cinematographer's capturing of the director's shot selection deserved his selection for an Academy that year. The film was essentially a political film and, I believe, those political views must be commented upon. When in 1789 the French Revolution happened, the monarchies surrounding France attempted to strangle the Revolution. Napoleon thwarted that reaction by the conservative monarhies until his ultimate defeat at Waterloo and the same thing happened to Russia. She was invaded by the British, French, Americans and Japanese; these capitalist countries tried to snuff out their revolution just as virtually the same country's tried to do so with the French Revolution?same players, new situation. These nuances were alluded to when John Reed was in Russia and verbally jousting with Kosinski's Zinoviev. Obviously I thought Reds is a great movie; it contains all the elements missing in contemporary Hollywood silliness: cartoons that look and act like real people and real people that play cartoon characters. Are foreign films the only ones that assume a modicum of intelligence in their viewers?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Saw Red</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Reed, a founder of the American Communist Party, makes an unusual subject for a big budget Hollywood film. However, "Reds" is a long ambitious epic about Reed and his wife, Louise Bryant, that is intelligent, engrossing, and meticulously produced. "Reds" won Beatty the Oscar for Best Director and, with any other subject matter, the film would have taken home the Best Picture award as well. However, the Hollywood establishment appears to have rules about Best Picture winners, possibly because they represent "Hollywood" and "America" to the world. Thus, pictures that depict Communism or same-sex love can come to the trough with a nomination, but they cannot drink and take home the gold. Besides "Reds," think of "Brokeback Mountain," two worthy films passed over in favor of lesser works.Director-producer Warren Beatty assembled a first-class cast, which included himself as Reed. The performances are outstanding throughout, with special mentions for Beatty, Maureen Stapleton, and Jack Nicholson. However, Diane Keaton shines among them and provides the film's heart in one of her finest performances. Her eyes speak with a glance, a tear, or a downward cast and convey more emotion than pages of script. Only Joanne Woodward's performance in "Rachel, Rachel" rivals Keaton's for the power of wordless expression.The first part of "Reds" ends with a stirring montage set to a rousing rendition of the Internationale. The sequence is beautifully edited and photographed, and the fade out is worthy of "Gone with the Wind." Perhaps if the film had ended at that point, box office returns would have soared and the Best Picture Oscar bestowed. Unfortunately, the second half of "Reds" is slower and wordier than the first, and the film ends on a somber note. However, despite any flaws, the film boasts spectacular scenes with a cast of thousands and no CGI. The photography by Vittorio Storaro is more than worthy of its Academy Award, and director Beatty does not lose the interpersonal relationships amongst the spectacle. The unique inter-cutting of aged witnesses to the events depicted enhances the story and deepens the personal aspect. Many of the witnesses recall the characters and share anecdotes about them or about the times. Their occasionally faulty memories only make them more real and venerable. "Reds" is arguably Beatty's best film, at least as a director, and, despite the length and sagging second half, well worth seeing. A Google search on Reed, Bryant, Emma Goldman, Eugene O'Neill and others will undoubtedly follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reds (1981) tells the story of John Reed (1887-1922), an American journalist, poet and communist activist, famous for his first-hand account of the Bolshevik Revolution.His intention was to bring the spirit and idealism of Communism to the United States.This movie isn't only about the politics of that era but it tells also the love story between Reed and Louise Bryant (1885-1936), an American journalist and writer.She was well known for her Marxist and anarchist beliefs and the essays she wrote on radical political and feminist themes.Their marriage was troublesome from time to time and Bryant was the lover of the playwright Eugene O'Neill (1888-1953).Warren Beatty has made a brilliant biographical drama that's highly intellectual.His acing work in the film portraying the main star is terrific.Diane Keaton plays Louise.She's known for her portrayals of thinking women.We've seen that in those Woody Allen movies and others.Jack Nicholson does very fine job as Eugene O'Neill.And so does Maureen Stapleton as the anarchist Emma Goldman (1869-1940).Edward Herrman plays Max Eastman.Novelist Jerzy Kosinski plays the Soviet Communist politician Grigory Zinoviev.Paul Sorvino plays Louis Fraina.M.Emmett Walsh is Liberal Club speaker.Gene Hackman plays Pete Van Wherry.Max Wright is Floyd Dell.Jerry Hardin is Harry.William Daniels is Julius Gerber.Beatty won a Oscar for directing and Stapleton for her performance.Vittorio Storaro got one for Cinematography.What's interesting to me as a Finn is that part of this movie was filmed in Finland.Reed was actually imprisoned here for 13 weeks in 1919.In this film we see the famous Finnish actor and movie maker ?ke Lindman as a Scandinavian Escort for Diane Keaton's character.Another Finnish actor, also doctor, Pertti Weckstrm plays Finnish Doctor.Reds is a thinking man's movie.A movie for those who know a lot of stuff, or at least want to learn.I guess I belong to the latter.You learn a lot from movies.</fullReview>

Everything goes together so perfectly in this film.

You really did think watching it that they were Jack and Louise. Nicholson, while not having a big amount of screen time, is masterful in his performance as Eugene O'Neil.The academy without a doubt snubbed this film for Best Picture. Reds was just too perfect of a film and I think way better than Chariots Of Fire, but hey whats done is done.Reds is hands down one of the better films i've seen in a long long time.

		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of movies, but I haven't seen any particular films from Hollywood that is about communists. So that is a surprise. It also surprised me that the DVD that I checked out from a local library is its 25th anniversary edition. So the movie company is probably still making money from this movie. It was made in 1981 which the Soviet Union was still in power, the cold war was still going. Paramount actually financed this film to tell a story about a passionate American communist? Most people in the USA don't have a good impression about Soviet Union or the communists, so it is a surprise that it was nominated for 12 academy awards. Did people actually pay money to watch this long film in the USA? What is so fascinated about this person? I doubt that if it was filmed in 2008, it would be 195 minutes long. Just like the "Deer hunter" that I watched before this film, this one is also too long, especially the first half. There were a few scenes about the couple dancing in different clothes, it could have been cut. Time flies, we know that. There is no need to repeat it several times. What is most interesting was about what happened after he went to Russia alone to see the Commitern. He probably was a happy man when he died, because he died for the passion that he believed in.Diane Keaton should have won the title of Best Actress. For several scenes, she was able to act just with her eyes. She made the character believable.It was emotional to hear the song "Internationale" played in the film. However, the director mixed a few love making scenes during it, that is like playing a sex scene with a gosple song. They don't match.One scene is confusing to me, when the train was attacked by the counter revolutionaries, why did Reed run toward the other side while people were shooting at the train and him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The thinking-person's epic romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Beatty used the clout he achieved with the box office smash HEAVEN CAN WAIT as a means of finally mounting his dream project, the ambitious Jack Reed biopic Reds (1981). With tight ensemble, large-scale location photography, and an over three-hour runtime, REDS was certainly intended to be a grand epic that would rake in tons of accolades and awards for director/producer/co-writer/star Beatty. This is the exact type of high risk project that can often result in disaster, but REDS defied such danger and opened to uniformly excellent reviews, became a solid hit at the box office, and received a jaw-dropping 12 Oscar nominations. Beatty finally received the kudos he long sought winning an Oscar, Golden Globe, the Director's Guild of America award, and numerous other national and international awards for his direction.Any film that achieves that level of success among critics and within the industry is in danger being over praised, but REDS actually lives up to the hype and remains a highly moving, fully bodied movie experience. Typically romantic epics leave me a bit cold - despite their haughty pedigree, I personally find films like GONE WITH THE WIND (1939) and DOCTOR ZHIVAGO (1965) to be technically well-made, but detached and mechanical in emotion. Like those films, REDS emphasizes the romance between Reed and feminist writer/artist Louise Brooks (Diane Keaton) over the historical arc that follows Reeds involvement with socialist/communist political scene in 1910's. But unlike most historical/romantic epics, REDS treats it's characters as real people rather than generalized caricatures and isn't afraid to venture into some difficult territory (which is usually sidestepped by most films of this type in order not to alienate mainstream audiences).Beatty and Keaton both deliver very impressive performances. Beatty is so utterly convincing as a determined Reed that you completely believe that his faith in such inevitably flawed ideologies is very reasonable and genuine. In many ways, Keaton is even more surprising as Brooks - she displays absolutely none of the bumbling neurosis in which she is so commonly associated and brings a devoted, plucky, and indeed stubborn quality to Brooks that immediately humanizes the woman and her plight. The entire supporting cast rises to the level of Beatty and Keaton, with superstars like Jack Nicholson, Maureen Stapleton (who won an Oscar for her performance), and Gene Hackman abandoning their typical star mannerisms and turning in some of the best work of their careers in bit parts.The film also benefits form the then-progressive technique utilized by Beatty where he includes filmed interviews with "witness," real-life individuals who knew either Reed or Brooks and were active members of the sociopolitical scene that the picture recreates. Showing amazing foresight, Beatty actually began conducting these interviews in the early-seventies. Many of these individuals are no longer with us and having their accounts on film is priceless in and of it's self. This also gives the film the absorbing feel of a docudrama, presenting multiple accounts of the same story.The film has the grand, lush look and feel that all epic films aim for, but never sacrifices its intelligence or intimacy in order to achieve it. This is evidenced even in Stephen Sondheim's marvelous musical score, which manages to incorporate period music and original material in a manner that is both appropriate to the on screen action and true to its historical setting. The film is also remarkably subtle, making outstanding use of silence and body language, without resorting to the overboard hysterics of many similar films. Beatty obviously set out to create a masterpiece with REDS, and he succeeded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warren Beatty's Great Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've said it before and I'll say it again. Warren Beatty is neither a great actor nor a great director. Whenever he makes a movie, it is usually either abominable or a genuine box office flop that isn't noticeable. "Reds," on the other hand, is a pleasant surprise: a good Beatty film.It is a powerful biography of revolutionary John "Jack" S. Reed, an American Communist, focusing on his rocky relationship with feminist Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton) and his journey from journalism to full-on socialism. The drama is intercut with poignant (though often strangely contradictory) interviews with "the witnesses," a group of people who were there when it really happened.I think that the greatest piece of the film is Vittorio Storaro's colorful cinematography, followed by Maureen Stapleton's performance as activist Emma Goldman-- both of which won Oscars. Unlike most films (like "Rocky" or "The Godfather"), the shouting matches in this are actually bearable. And Beatty's performance is a bit regrettable, but he makes up for it with skillful direction that is absent in the rest of his career so far.It will be a cold day in Hades before I forgive Beatty for the mess that was "Dick Tracy," but with the quality of this film, I think someone ought to grab a thermometer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an intriguing work as a whole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>REDS is a remarkable work from Warren Beatty, not only because it presents a fairly copasetic understanding of the Bolshevik Revolution and the romance surrounding it, but because this film was produced during the years that immediately preceded the Reaganite restoration in this country. The depiction of John Reed in this film captures the national mood during the First World War, as well as the ideas to be found everywhere in the socialist movement that anything was possible. This sort of dreaming came before the 1917 revolution, and continued for some time, well into the years under Stalin and all his counter revolutionary terrors. But for a time, the people portrayed in this film; John Reed, Louise Bryant, Eugene O'Neill, Emma Goldman, Louis Freina, and the Bolshevik leadership; Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev,Radek,were some of the foremost commentators of their day on the increasing proclivity of western capital to go down the roads of imperialism and war.Beatty's film making is an intriguing work as a whole, particularly given the way he employed actual witnesses of the period to comment on the events portrayed in this work in semi-documentary style. Here we see Roger Baldwin of the ACLU, who was Reed's room mate at Harvard, Arne Swabeck, Heaton Vorse, Scott and Helen Nearing, Henry Miller, and George Jessel, Dora Russell, Will Durant, Adele Rogers St. John, Rebecca West among others talking about the real issues of the day as they remembered them. Unfortunately, the producer also throws critics of the Bolsheviks a bone in the movie's somewhat slanderous depiction of the Baku Congress of 1920, but it's a rule of thumb in film making that historic epics are rarely accurate. It's got to be enough for the savvy socialist scholar and critic of the work that Warren Beatty (for the most part) was attempting to portray events on their own terms, which is pretty rare in portrayals of the world's first victorious socialist leadership.Finally, Diane Keaton and Warren Beatty carry a romantic storyline which is fun to watch. The movie is three hours long, but it's tight, and it offers some superb craftsmanship. The work is about as long as your butt can stand to sit and watch it, but it really is very fine.</fullReview>

Beatty made a unique, fascinating film about a subject untouched by American filmmakers (strangely). The concept of having living (in some cases barely living) talking heads speak about Reed and Bryant and those times, interspersed with the narrative, is inspired. But the whole film just flows, and despite its length it never drags. I truly cared about these characters, because they were flawed yet compelling, and because the actors were just f-ing brilliant. I truly marvel at Beatty's ability to direct this labyrinthine undertaking and yet give one of his best performances. Keaton and Stapleton were also both perfect. Acting of this caliber is just a joy to behold. Screenplay, cinematography, editing, sets, costumes, everything about this film is of the first rank. A true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating, entertaining--the "Witnesses" are inspired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is so unfortunate that too often as time moves on inexorably, history can be forgotten. Even now Vietnam seems like a distant memory, and the exact details are clouded. Notice the "Swift Boat" controversy so often based on distorted or politically self-serving recollections--sometimes out and out lies that masquerade as truth. "Reds" may play a bit with the details of the times and specifics of the historical characters, but it sure captures the essence of this now distant time. And what gives it its extra potency, poignancy and fascination are the poetic, sometimes riveting, sometimes intriguing recollections of the "Witnesses". Beautifully filmed these witnesses with their resonant voices that speak across decades provide a window on a time and place in American, Russian and world history, Add to this the brilliant images of New York's Greenwich Village, Moscow at the time of the revolution, the endearing and enduring screen presence of Diane Keaton and Warren Beatty, the beautiful film score of Sondheim, and a story line which is as gripping and entertaining as it is historically fascinating, and you have a film to be savored and enjoyed through the decades to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic film with passion!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever watched a film and said to yourself, "This must have been a labor of love for the director"? I can just see Warren Beatty getting into the process when he made this film. 200- Minutes and not one wasted! 1981 was a good year for movies and this film won the Best Director Oscar for Warren Beatty, and I can say that he deserved it. You can hear at times real interviews of people who knew the real people portrayed in the film, and it works out well. The little details in the film are so many that it is hard to catch them all in one sitting. And the ending is one of the most emotional I've ever seen. All the actors did a wonderful job, but I must commend Diane Keaton, who should have won the Oscar in 1982 over Katharine Hepburn (despite Hepburn being my favorite actress. Watch "The Lion in Winter" and see why). Diane played a layered role in a way quite different for her Oscar-winning role in "Annie Hall" but just as good. I just have to applaud the whole production. Any epic-film lover should enjoy this. It is not on DVD but it definitely should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as epic as people said.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone says this movie is Lawerence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago combined, and I looked forward to the film. I automatically knew that no one could compete with David Lean's masterpiece, but I thought maybe Warren Beatty could see show me something I've never seen before. I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie, the movie had a lot of potential to be an epic film and possibly be compared to Lean's most famous work. Where the film lacked was editing, a good half of that movie could have easily been taken out, and the story wold have been gripping, it could have had something great. I think Warren Beatty tried to do too much with the film, with the interviews every five minutes, and that song they always sang, and the love affair between him and Diane Keaton that went off and on again. Yes the movie did have some good acting moments, but truly great acting is when there is no dialogue, and this whole movie is shouting and yelling (which could be considered good acting, but I think it more being dramatic then anything else.) The movie does have great cinematography though, and some of the scene are generally good in the movie, and I did like the ending, but for me the movie was too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John and Louise and the Russian Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reds is the story of John Reed and Louise Bryant, their love set against the background of the American Left in the World War I years and the Russian Revolution. Those were both heady and disillusioning times for those on the political Left and Warren Beatty as director and star does a good job in capturing the moments.John Reed, middle class kid from Portland, Oregon has great writing and polemic skills and reporter's instinct for news. Both of those roles get blended very nicely when he starts writing for the left wing magazine the Masses. Louise Bryant, also from Portland is another middle class kid caught up with radical feminist notions about not just the vote, but sex for the sake of same. Despite it all Diane Keaton and Beatty find themselves in what they would consider an old fashioned romance.American involvement in World War I was bloody, but relatively brief. A gang of second rate politicians running things in all the major European powers blundered the whole continent in a four year stalemate along two fronts enveloping Germany. As the casualties mounted, a lot on the left thought this was the time for a worker's revolution. As it began in Russia, people really did see it as the coming Utopia. Beatty's instincts as a reporter almost compel him to go there and his reporting of events and the writing of a book 10 Days That Shook the World became THE English language first hand account of events. One wishes Reed had lived a lot longer and published his account of things that followed the Revolution.Beatty and Keaton were nominated for Best Actor and Actress. Reds unfortunately was up against On Golden Pond that year and Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn were not to be denied. Beatty did win for Best Director and Maureen Stapleton won Best Supporting Actress for playing that doughty revolutionary survivor, Emma Goldman. Her scene with Beatty where she articulates her disillusionment with the longed for worker's revolution is a classic.However the best performance in the film was for me Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill. O'Neill was on the fringes of things back then, an aspiring author who hung out with all the left wing crowd in Greenwich Village, even then a mecca for rebels. He falls for Keaton and she has her fling, but returns to Beatty. Maybe it was out of jealousy, but he sees things a lot more clearly than the whole bunch of them do. Nicholson was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but lost to John Gielgud for Arthur.Beatty intercuts interviews with various elderly survivors of the days from 1915-1920 in the film. A decade later most of them would be gone and would never live to see the fall of the Soviet Union, their shining example of the worker's paradise. Nation's fall, but art lives on and Eugene O'Neill is a far more important figure in the 20th Century than the whole lot of them put together, both left and right. And as art and as story telling, Reds will also endure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some spoilers ahead.Warren Beatty scored big with this gem of a film. This movie is a great retelling of the life of American communist John Reed and his girlfriend, played respectively by Beatty and Diane Keaton. The love story between the two seems a little forced and uninteresting, and that is why I rated this movie a seven instead of an eight. It is also a very long movie, and probably will take most people two days to watch. For those with a passion for obscure history, especially that relating to American socialism, this movie is a must-see. Beatty plays Reed credibly, and he also wonderfully recreates the world of leftist bohemians during the late 1910s and early 1920s. Maureen Stapleton deservedly won that Oscar for her portrayal of anarchist Emma Goldman. Her dialogue with Reed about the failures of the new Soviet Union must be seen to be believed. This film is somewhat of a tragedy, in part because we see the dissolution of the socialist dream that Reed had hoped for. We also see the difficulties is maintaining a romantic relationship while also trying to work as a journalist touting the socialist cause. All in all, this is good stuff.Another great feature of the movie are the brief interludes featuring testimony from real socialists from the era portrayed in the movie. These people were well into their eighties and nineties when they were filmed, but their minds were still full of vivid memories, and their commentary adds a real life human dimension to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of a handful of American films that can be viewed as "adult".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in '81, when I was still a backwaters film "critic" for the throwaway Lake Tahoe News, I gave this flick a "rave" notice, not that anyone noticed. Earlier on, as a ditto for the late-'40s Los Angeles Daily News, before I was "gray"listed during the McCarthy redbaiting era, I once publicly, in print, that is, recanted on a first viewing of Cocteau's "Beauty and the Beast," having succumbed to preconceived expectations and totally failing to perceive the truly "original" conceits of the Gallic genius. Today, having seen "Reds" the one time in a tiny local "cinema," I still doubt I would, this time, rethink my enthusiasm. This thought is fueled by having scanned the opening sentences of some contemp(tuous) latterday online "review" of Warren Beatty's magnum opus, on film that is, wherein the erudite critic appeared to be judging the film as a Marxist dialectic? Whatever, I am amused, awed?, that ANYone can still be weighing in on such matters "esthetically." Socioculturally? Idealism is a dead issue? Capitalism lives? Socioeconomics sucks? Or is he a neocon? Bottom line: "Reds" worked for me on at least three levels: mind, gut, AND heart. Am I a commie? Nyah. Too rigid. Pinko? Well, maybe.</fullReview>

I've seen it a couple of times since on TV, and still love it. It's a great sweeping epic, the dialogue and acting are top of the line, and the photography is superb also. I like the author Jerzy Kosinsky as Zinoviev. He's not much of an actor, but that makes him seem more real. His lines about the private life being dead and that you can never come back to this point in history are classics. When Reed answers him saying, "You don't rewrite what I write." just as a bomb explodes behind him shows the madness and chaos of the Russian Civil war. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beatty's masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Reds' is one of the finest American films ever made- it is the film that Beatty worked towards from 'Bonnie &amp; Clyde'; tellingly he would not make another film until the excerable 'Ishtar' (which was probably more fun to make than watch).This film feels like a cross between David Lean ('Dr Zhivago' &amp; 'Lawrence of Arabia' from his oeuvre) and Oliver Stone (in 'Nixon' mode). As with 'Bonnie &amp; Clyde' the right music has been picked for the soundtrack- 'The Internationale' &amp; Keaton's take of '...In my Yard' standout (though the score is taken from Sondheim, with contributions by 'Graduate'-composer Dave Gruisin). The film is brilliantly shot by the great Vittorio Storaro- who uses the same huge talent as he did on Bertolucci's 'Il Conformista' &amp; Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now Redux'. Trevor Griffiths co-wrote this film- though there were contributions from a variety of historians- most notably Robert Rosenstone.Fans of the film should consult Rosenstone's biography of John Reed ('Romantic Revolutionary') and his chapter on his involvement with and objections to elements in 'Reds' in the book 'Visions of the Past'. This Biopic is an interpretation of a life- as with films like 'Patton' it takes a rather small period of the protaganists total life experience- running from roughly 1914 to Reed's death from typhus in 1920. The film charts Reed's major experiences- his coverage of the First World War and the Mexican War of 1916 is shown- though the major achievments are his ventures into the complexities of American Socialism and American-Communism and his eventual experience in Russia/Soviet Union. The main aspect, the stalwart element throughout the film is his love affair with Louise Bryant- which is where the film begins and ends. Rosenstone believes this may have been a concession to Hollywood audience- but I think it puts the human and greater-backdrop into context.'Visions of the Past' censures much of Beatty's "twists of truth" and the filmic conventions of compression and dramatic-symbolistic interpretation. This is not a documentary and this is not the actual John Reed. This is a biopic film, starring Warren Beatty playing 'John Reed'. If you want to read about the real thing- try 'Romantic Revolutionary' and Reed's masterpiece 'Ten Days That Shook the World' (which, ironically, came in for criticism regarding Reed's fictionalisation of the events of the Russian Revolution!- see the introduction to the Penguin edition by AJP Taylor). Remember historians have a vested interest in their interpretation- which by placing into lineal order in a history (non-fiction) book they are placing into a narrative form.Beatty and Keaton are great in this film- with brilliant support from Gene Hackman,Jack Nicholson, Paul Sorvino &amp; Maureen Stapleton. We see the John Reed on-screen move from Jack Reed journalist to John Reed idealist- the only American to be buried within the walls of the Kremlin.Various anti-commies have objected to this film as it depicts Communism- well, at the time, this development from Marx/Engels 1848 Manifesto seemed liberating. Many intellectuals pondered on a new collective, non-Capitalist world- which was sadly a utopia that was unattainable. The Russian experiment failed- Beatty alludes to the flaws and Stalinism in the speech which the Party retranslate towards their own ends towards the end of the film. The Russian Revolution was an ideal- the workers of the world uniting- which considering the treatement meted out by the likes of Henry Ford was a good thing. This message is still relevant- as 'free market Capitalism' means market dominance for Superpowers, poverty for others- the persistence of a constant underclass and the eradication of Union Rights. There are as many flawed ethics to Capitalism as Communism- the arms trade (Reagan/Bush to Hussain, the US-sponsored coup in Chile-Cambodia-El Salvador- a policy which continues up to the failed one last week in Venezuala). Beatty takes the socialist ideals which 'Shampoo' alluded to and which he continued in the satirical 'Bulworth'.Unlike Attenborough's 'Gandhi', this is not a biopic that is too reverent to its focus- many times Reed is shown to be a clown and it is Bryant's character who undergoes the vaster change- giving this film a strong feminist element. The other stroke of genius is the use of the witnesses- who provide a commentary on the film that sometimes contradict each other- alluding to a multiplicity of truths that overlap (as with Stone's alternate scenarios in 'JFK' &amp; 'Nixon'- they themselves are not true but point out that the truth is relative and the accepted historist take may not be any more "real").The Oscar people exhibited their usual poor taste again- choosing the yawnworthy 'Chariots of Fire' over this for best picture (well, the year before they chose 'Ordinary People' over 'Raging Bull'- and to this day mediocrity wins that coveted award: 'Forrest Gump', 'Schindler's List', 'Gladiator', 'Braveheart', 'Titanic'). This film has an epic scope- that the worthy Oscar winner 'The English Patient' also exhibited- though both show influence from David Lean. This was a time when Hollywood had ambition and made some great films that may not have set the box-office on fire a la 'Jaws' or 'Star Wars' but made some great works for posterity: 'The Deer Hunter', 'New York New York', 'Raging Bull', 'Heavens Gate' and this. 'Reds' is a masterpiece that should be seen by everyone and desrves to take its place alongside classic works by directors such as John Ford, Howard Hawks and Orson Welles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most overrated movie of all time...a tedious bore to watch for three hours...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Except for technical brilliance in photography and settings, this is possibly the most boring of all the epic movies to come out of the Hollywood mill. Not only is it difficult to praise the storyline, which wanders all over the place and never gives you time to sympathize or care about the characters, but the film is overbloated with dull scenes and some ludicrous casting. Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill??? Give me a break.Warren Beatty is at his most obnoxious throughout and Diane Keaton makes a most unattractive co-star in a bland and underwritten role as his adoring sweetheart. Unlike another tale told against the Russian revolution, DR. ZHIVAGO, this film seems claustrophobic from beginning to end, darkly lit interiors and muted color giving it all a very dull finish.How the Academy voters got so excited over this one, I'll never understand. It's one of those films where, by the time "The End" flashes on the screen, you're ready to breathe a sigh of relief that the whole impossible thing is over. Sorry, but this is about as atrocious a piece of film-making as I've ever witnessed. Hard to see how anyone can enjoy this film who does not come to it with a complete background in the history of Russia during a time of great upheaval. Even then, it is a clumsy piece of work that seems to have been created to puff up the overwhelming ego of its star/director who obviously thought he was creating another CITIZEN KANE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warren Beatty's opus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any film this ambitious and far-reaching is bound to have problems here and there, but overall this is a very good effort by everyone involved. Warren Beatty spent many years of his life putting this project together, and the result is a fine film that will stand the test of time. The plot, at its core, is simple enough. It's just a great big love story. Beatty plays John Reed, a left-leaning American journalist who finds himself caught up in the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. At the same time, he finds himself deeply in love with a compelling woman and trying to come to terms with their relationship over several years. Diane Keaton plays the lady in question named Louise Bryant. At first we see her as nothing more than a groupie of Reed's, but at the film progresses, we see her develop into an independent and resourceful journalist in her own right. Like most journalists, Reed eventually becomes one with his story, and ultimately finds himself helping the new Marxist government in Russia get started. Reed is still the only American buried within the Kremlin walls. For the most part, the people we meet in this film are true radicals. Not like the hypocritical jet-set would-be leftists of today. (Al Gore) There are surprisingly little politics in the film until Reed and Bryant make their first trip to Russia and witness the actual revolution take place between love-making sessions. There is quite a bit of time devoted to the couple and their bohemian friends from Greenwich Village. They all basically hang out and talk leftist politics. For a time, they even move out to a beach house and put on a bunch of small plays. It is at this time when their love affair becomes kind of a triangle with playwright Eugene O'Neill moving in on Bryant while Reed is away covering a convention. Jack Nicholson plays the scoundrel quite well, showing him as an opportunist, and not the radical that the others in the group are.The film takes on a grander scale with each passing moment. Eventually we see both Reed and Bryant trapped inside of Russia after years of searching the frozen wilderness for each other. There is even some political violence along the way. But above all else, this film is a love story. A great big love story.The film has many strengths. The acting is uniformly excellent, and there are several bit parts contributed by well known actors at every turn. The film looks very beautiful, even when what we're looking at is supposed to be dingy and bleak. The use of shadows is top notch in this film. Shadows are used so well, that they nearly add an extra dimension to the project in some scenes. Beatty is obviously very inspired by John Reed, yet this film never gets truly bogged down in idealism. Though Reed stubbornly believes in global Marxism, other main characters correctly point out to him that it could never work in a place like America.There are flaws here, as well. Is this film too long?, you might ask. The answer is "yes". It is a good twenty minutes longer than it needs to be. One solution I have would be to dump the parts with the old timers narrating things. Though they were presumably there when all this stuff happened, they don't really add much more than we the audience can already figure out for ourselves. Apparently Beatty spent years gathering these interviews before filming anything else. I guess it was important to him, anyway.Beatty has not done anything this significant since, and likely will never try to in the future. If this is the film he is most remembered for, then more power to him. Reds is truly a substantial work, and a good way to kill a rainy Saturday afternoon.8 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Reds" is about an artist who loves a woman. He is passionate about his art form (writing). I don't think the lead character really knows that he is an artist - but his girlfriend/wife does. Instead, the lead character (played by Warren Beatty) follows his ideals. He stands up for what he thinks is right and shows courage - which, in a way, brings him to dangerous circumstances. I am not sure if he really realized how dangerous his ideas were; I also don't think he realized that he put his safety in jeopardy - which in so many ways - blinded him. So the question that can be asked is: "is passion truth even if it hurts your sense of judgement?" The title of the movie is misleading. However if Red actually symbolizes Red for passion, anger and ambition - then perhaps it is a good title after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well written political love story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 6/10/2011 -- 8 out of 10(Dir-Warren Beatty): Well written political love story tells the story of Jack and Louisa Reed -- two early 1900's radical thinkers -- who also were writers and participated in the the early Communist movement in the United States. The movie is told from the point-of-view of elderly witnesses(who sometimes remember and sometimes don't), as well as being put in a chronological narrative with the main characters being played by Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton. Beatty helped write and directed this complex tale about two very complex and controversial people. The appeal of the movie is in the storytelling and the characterizations giving the viewer enough interest to pull them through this very long movie. Jack Nicholson, plays the writer Eugene O'Neill, and is really just used as a third cog in a little bit of a love triangle where the free love ideals of the main characters are explored and questioned. The main storyline is how these two radical characters learn to love one another despite their differences and similarities and the trek of Jack Reed from being an American idealist to being a member of the Russian Communist party and being used by them to spread their causes. The movie never really takes any kind of position but just portrays the story and characters as it happened in the early 20th century and this is where it excels despite it's controversy(especially being made by an American filmmaker). It's always exciting when movies take us to different places visually, intellectually, and emotionally and this is exactly what this movie does. A triumph for actor/writer/director Warren Beatty and for the viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How does one rate epic marathons of this ilk? If you grade them straight up, no more than a 6.5 because the love story gets in the way of the history lesson and the obligation of all that history invariably scuddles the dramatic intent of the love story. However, in comparison to a turkey of the same stripe, DR. ZHIVAGO, REDS looks occasionally like a world-beater, with some real moxy and teeth, especially whenever Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill shows up to shed a sharp, baleful light on the fairly impossible marriage between Jack Reed and Louise Bryant- which is the ostensible "raison d'etre" of the movie.Beatty deserves a portion of respect bringing home a movie that is probably in large measure the picture he envisioned in the first place. But ultimately, considering such controversial subject matter, the movie is, surprisingly, a pretty tame affair. Beatty, like most Method actors, loves (loved) to play the wronged, overly idealistic, noble sufferer. Also, the ultra-committed feminist. Frankly, it's always been a bit of a dodge, a womanizer's pose - and don't you know it. Beatty completists can point to THE ROMAN SPRING OF MRS. STONE and ALL FALL DOWN as notable exceptions, but for the most part, starting with SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS, to LILITH, later on, THE PARALAX VIEW and of course, his own productions: BONNIE AND CLYDE, SHAMPOO and REDS, it was always the same story. (Even when he innocently punches a door in understandable anger, we are not spared the long reaction shot of him in bed writhing from the cruel indignity of that dang, iliberal, unfeeling door. Only in McCABE AND MRS. MILLER, does a strong director intervene to insist on a different, contrasting tone to take hold at the end of the proceedings. Altman was right to have Julie Christie's tough doxy oblivious in her opium haze as Warren dutifully did his dying act in all that obligingly, lovely photo-processed snow. (REDS makes up for the coldness of McCABE's finale by having Diane Keaton's Bryant kneeling devotedly at Beatty/Reed's bedside for the final shot.Oh, by the way, Warren still hates McCABE for a host of sundry, and rather petty reasons.Was this review useful to you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A trivial error seems to be present. After Reed belittles Bryant's writing on the influences of The Armory Show in New York in 1916, they are featured to head for Provincetown and soon get involved in the Provincetown Players. But George Cram (Jig) Cook and Susan Glaspell started the yet-to-be-so-called Players in the summer of 1915. Not only John Reed but also Louise Bryant contributed plays to the playwright's theater which means they supervise or simply direct their own plays. The movie presents her only as an actress unfortunately,and Reed as both a playwright and an mouthpiece director.Also regrettably, with Euegen O'Neill in the triangle to make a classic love story, Jig Cook isn't even mentioned in the movie, and Glaspell's Trifles is only slightly mentioned by an interviewee. Glaspell wrote in The Road to the Temple that Cook and Reed seemed very close and they were also neighbors in Truro, after Reed returned from Russia.Well, a movie can't cover everything and this one is nearly perfect in reliving Reed and the Red Scare Era among other things.Just to mention one of the bylines of heroic Reed story, i'd like to say that free love in Greenwich Village is very well represented, with all the antagonism created between men and women. It is,above all, because Bryant learned Reed had other women even after their marriage that she decided to leave him and made it hard for him to earn his way back to her heart.If only names of those interviewees can be provided in the subtitle, a Chinese audience like me would find it easier to make the connections.Xopawo (ha-de-ra-sho )Reds!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tour de force worthy of comparison with the likes of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before Warren Beatty was justly reviled for Ishtar and Town and Country, his contributions to cinema were timeless. Spendor in the Grass, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Shampoo, Heaven Can Wait, and even Bonnie and Clyde were mere precursors to this epic and majestic oeuvre.As the entertainment editor for my college newspaper, I reviewed this film when it debuted twenty-five years ago, but only now, as an historical piece, can it be seen for what it truly is, a tour de force worthy of comparison with the likes of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane.Presented in a semi-documentary form, Reds is a love story cast against the cataclysm of early twentieth century world events. This format creates a sense of cinma-vrit, despite minor historical inaccuracies. The delightful recollections of "witnesses", which Beatty actually began filming years before the film was produced, are woven into the fabric of a Zhivago-esqe story of two Americans being swept up in the sprawling drama of the Bolshevik Revolution.The cast and their performances are almost indescribably wonderful. Picking a standout would be unfair, but even so, a few deserve special mention. George Plimpton is marvelous as the odious Horace Whigham. Gene Hackman's Pete Van Wherry leaves us wanting more. Of course, Beatty himself, along with costar Diane Keaton, are magnificent in roles that capitalize on their intellect as well as their skill as actors, and if you don't think these were intellectually challenging roles, let your imagination cast the likes of todays cadre of actors in a remake and you will see with tragic certainty the difference between great actors and talking heads.Of course, Maureen Sapleton won an Oscar as Emma Goldman, and she earned it in spades. But for me, the most memorable role was Jack Nicholson's desperately romantic yet bitterly cynical Eugene O'Neill. This is far and away my favorite Nicholson role of all time, and his understated brilliance is overwhelming.In honor of the twenty-fifth anniversary of this masterpiece, a special edition DVD set has been issued. Yes, the movie is over three hours long, but so was the insufferably banal Titanic. It is often said you can't save time, you can only spend it wisely. This is three hours well spent, and even if you have watched the film before, it's time to renew your investment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST epic in the last twenty years!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were two films battling out for Best honours in 1981. Malle's "Atlantic City" and this one. Forget the fact that "Chariot's of Fire" beat both out for the Oscar. Chalk it up to the English voting bloc edging that lovely little gem through the cracks created by the rift caused by the closeness of the vote between the two front-runners. The true race was between "Reds" and "Atlantic City." And for my money, then and now, twenty years after, "Reds" was the hands-down winner. A magnificent achievement muted by its "glamour-man" roots. Like Robert Redford, Warren Beatty is victimised by his celebrity. A celebrity that seems to contradict his achievements as a film maker. He will always be associated with failures like "Ishtar," "Love Affair" and "the Fortune" because it is comforting to know that dashing leading types can fall on their faces too. But Beatty gave us--as actor, director, producer, writer...some configuration--a good near dozen of memorable, timely, human and humane bits of terrific American cinema. "Bonnie and Clyde," "McCabe and Mrs. Miller," "Shampoo," "Heaven Can Wait," "Bugsy," "The Parallax View," "Splendor in the Grass," this film (and "Bulworth"). "Reds" is his masterwork. A romantic, political, literary, multi-hour extravaganza that, heretically enough, I'd put before Lean's "Doctor Zhivago" (and maybe before his "Lawrence"). That fact that "Gandhi" WON an Oscar for Best Picture a year after "Reds" nomination galls me to this day. "Gandhi" is a "2" to "Reds" "10." Easily. (Though I'll give you Ben Kingsley.) Beatty and Keaton deliver performances of nuance and complexity. (Keaton is the best Beatty "girl" since Zhivago's girl, Christie.) Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Jerzy Kosinski, Paul Sorvino, Maureen Stapleton defined the period and personalities of the time evoked by the picture. The cinematography, writing, the themes, direction, music...the little witness vignettes featuring the Durants and others...all aspects of this film were seamlessly crafted together into a perfect whole. It will leave you with images (Reed running during the Mexican and the Russian revolutions, Keaton's Louise Bryant looking at a child down the hall from a deathly-ill Reed) and words ("Don't you rewrite what I write!" or "This one even pisses red") that will stay with you long after the credits. The AFI's lone representative for 1981 on its 100 Best List was "Raiders of the Lost Ark." "Reds" is a far richer movie. Still, I wouldn't argue for the dismissal of "Raiders." Not when the AFI missed "Reds" yet managed to find "Guess Who Came to Dinner."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful film and one that seems politically timeless.Reed is an idealist who is fighting large forces and, despite his passion, is doomed to failure. Had he lived a normal lifespan, it's unlikely that the outcome would have been different.A beautiful element of this film is in the witness commentary which reveals that people live their lives in the throes of political turbulence- some grow old, some don't. You forget much of what was once important to you, then you die. Some are political activists, some love baseball.Filmed in 1980-81, it reveals the political climate of the early part of the century which is so similar to the propaganda and power struggles of today and tomorrow.I enjoy Warren Beatty's comedy style, whether it's appropriate to the character or not, I couldn't care less. Like Cary Grant, he's charming and he can turn it on and off at the appropriate times. I like when he's cooking on the floor, burning things in the kitchen, playing with the dog while writing, dancing with Keaton, putting the megaphone on his political opponent's head, wearing the bear costume. He brings out subtle and not-so-subtle comedy moments and these are the things that bring the film to life."You don't remember me?" "It's probably your hat."The film shows that life is greater than your political outlook and that politics are just a symptom of the beautiful disease of living.One of the witnesses suggests that war is something defeat-able if we were all so inclined and Reed says that it's all about profits but the grander perspective of the film reveals that war is a phenomenon. Like weather, love, aging, passion, race, class, sexual orientation, death, luck, genetics, FASHION, technology, time-period, politics, "war" is an element we believe we control but which ultimately controls us and is just one element of the backdrop of our lives.The DVD extras with Beatty, Nicholson, Barry Diller and other cast and crew 25 years later is enlightening and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Communism and Socialism Were Never As Good As This ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A definite film for history buffs and others."Reds" tells the story of American journalist Jack Reed and Louise Bryant, a woman who gave up everything she had in America, and followed the Communist reporter Reid to the new Soviet Union.Excellent for its historic detail, the film also shows the rise of socialism in America as Paul Sorvino is quite effective in one scene depicting this.Then, of course, we have Communist sympathizers such as Eugene O'Neill played, in an Oscar nominated performance, by Jack Nicholson.Director Warren Beatty plays Jack Reed and Diane Keaton is Louise Bryant. They are perfect together. They are the "Bonnie and Clyde" goes Communist gang.Emma Goldman, a noted anarchist of the period, is played in a well-crafted performance by Maureen Stapleton. She soon comes disillusioned with life in the Soviet Union and says that she is getting out.Interestingly enough, perennial Oscar losers Warren Beatty and Maureen Stapleton won Oscars-Beatty for his fine directing. He did lose the acting award. Stapleton, as Goldman, surprisingly beat out the late Joan Hackett in "Only When I Laugh" for the supporting actress award. It looked like a big night for "Reds" but it lost the coveted best picture award to "Chariots of Fire."There are wrenching scenes in this fine historical drama that depict Reed's illness and Bryant's devotion to her dying husband. The end of the movie says it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warren Beatty's continuing political activism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching "Reds", you might first want to know who John Reed was. Assuming that you know him, Warren Beatty plays him, and Diane Keaton plays his wife Louise Bryant. The movie traces his early days as a left-wing reporter trying to organize trade unions in the United States, before he covered the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. Eventually, he returns to Russia, hoping to get financial support for the IWW in the 1920 presidential elections, and finds that the revolutionary government has betrayed its Utopian ideals (leading to the fact that the Soviet Union never actually had Communism). Trapped in Russia, he dies there in 1920.The movie's best aspect is the "witnesses". Warren Beatty interviewed several people who knew John Reed and had them put in their two cents about him. He truly created a masterpiece here. Perfect performances by Beatty and Keaton, plus Paul Sorvino, Maureen Stapleton, Jack Nicholson and Gene Hackman, make this a perfect movie. Certainly Warren Beatty's best movie ever. He of course continued his espousal of politics with "Bulworth" (why he decided to star in "Ishtar" and "Town &amp; Country" will always be beyond me).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story of an American Communist, John Reed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as I know, this film was not shown in the former Socialist countries, including present Cuba. It is a partial biography of John Reed, the American who wrote `deciat dnei kotorie potriasali mir' (10 days which shaken the world). Good to see it and, perhaps, a story different to the one was told by Soviets, who always said that Reed was a good friend of the Soviets and that simply he died of tuberculosis, but never said anything regarding his debates inside the socialist movement in USA as well as his debates with Soviet leadership, including Mr Zinoviev, who in some years later will be completely deleted from Soviet hierarchy by his `excellency', Mr Joseph Dzhugashvili, alias Stalin. The main message of the film is that it shows a real devoted John Reed to Socialists ideas, able to sacrifice his life and family in favor of a just cause, the level of bureaucracy developed in few years in USSR, and the way their leaders think. It was good to see how easily Mr Zinoviev asked John Reed to stay in Russia and also to forget about his family. This is very cynical, family is the basis of any society, and who attempts against it, is simply a criminal. The Soviets degenerated and, at the end, wanted a religion and not a democratic system of all workers and farmers. Beatty acted well but much better Dianne Keaton, who was simply brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of, if not the best movie of the Russian Revolution of 1917,next to the wonderful works like Doctor Zchivago. This movie is a great epic, but falls just short of duplicating the success of Doctor Zchivago. Still theres plenty not to hate about the film, even if the focus is about the rise of communism in the former Soviet Union. Warren Beatty's tyrant-like acting is great, and under is own directing too, which is proably why Beatty got the oscar for Best Director. This movie was nominated for 12 oscars including Best Picture, but round up wining only 3 (Best Director for Beatty, Best Supporting Actress for Stapleton, and Best Cinematography). This film depicts how uneasy America was feeling about the rise of communism, during the time of the Bolshevik Revolution. This is another excellent movie to any historian wanting to know about Russian Revolution, and oh yea, Jack Nicolson isn't too bad in this too. My rating, 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey hey we're the Commies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reds, Warren Beatty's epic tale of an American Communist is a film that even now, decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union, is bound to raise a few eyebrows. The central character John Reed (Beatty) and his wife Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton) aren't exactly sympathetic to the United States or Democracy at all and spend the majority of the film rallying support for Communism and instigating anti-Capitalist demonstrations. Given that the few bona-fide Capitalists that crop up in the story are penny pinching industrialists determined to bathe in the blood of the poor or cynical, defeatist losers, it's easy to understand why anyone brought up on apple-pie and patriotism will loathe it. However, it must be remembered that while Beatty clearly had a very strong message to promote with his pet project, this is ultimately a fictional and biased account of a real couple's lives. The best way to watch it, is to try and forget everything you know about Communism, Capitalism and the Russian Revolution altogether beforehand.As a simple entertainment piece then, the closest relative that Reds has is probably Gone With The Wind. It is a sprawling epic love story that takes place over several years and lasts longer than the actual Cold War which raises a wealth of sympathy for the love-lorn central characters in some truly moving scenes. Unfortunately, it suffers from the same over-indulgence as Gone With The Wind and in all honesty, the first hour of the film is completely unnecessary. Had it been trimmed down, it could have been far more enjoyable and a lot less tedious.The story opens with the meeting of John Reed and Louise Bryant in Portland Oregon. He is a disillusioned war journalist and she is a feminist painter stuck in a dead-end marriage. About four seconds after they meet they're locked together and doing the bad thing and their lives become intertwined immediately. The first hour of the film then consists of them moving round America, getting involved in the Socialist party and arguing non-stop. Watching this, you have to wonder exactly why they stay together as Louise spends her time either cheating on him with Jack Nicholson or storming off in a huff. It's incredibly frustrating to watch and the two are so unlikeable you have to wonder whether it's worth sitting through another two hours or simply turning it off and playing some X-Box games instead.And then, somewhere round the hour and ten minutes mark it begins to get interesting. With the horrors of war sweeping Europe into a frenzy, the pair travel to Russia where they witness first-hand the makings of the 1917 revolution. The story picks up significant pace and the pair suddenly become much more endearing as their love for one another develops against the backdrop of a country experiencing a severe social upheaval. Before the movie finishes a further hundred minutes later, the pair have returned to America, tried to form an American Communist party and met resentment and suspicion at every turn. John winds up trapped in the burgeoning Soviet Union and witnesses the party shortcomings and inner-turmoil first hand as Louise makes a desperate journey to reunite with him that'll make your heart ache.As you can probably tell therefore, it should have started an hour in as the first third is nowhere as good as the next two. That isn't to say it's all roses though as the political message is layered on rather thick and as such, a significant portion of the movie consists of John Reed making speeches about "unions," "manifestos," "trade organisations," "free enterprise" and "united workers." Beatty puts in a fine performance of course, but you don't half wish he'd shut up and stop trying to save the human race for five minutes. Keaton meanwhile ably matches him and puts in the role of her career, despite Louise not exactly being a sympathetic character for much of the running time.Its easy to see why the film is regarded as a classic and ignored by casual viewers at large though. It is way too long and the celebration of an American who hated his own country and everything it stood for is going to be a very bitter pill for a lot of the audience to swallow. Political activists and anti-Capitalist radicals will love it though but watching it in any other light just leaves the impression of a romance that goes on for far too long and suffers from its own self-importance. Watch it with a pinch of salt folks, after all, Communists had feelings too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I liked this film very much for its breadth of vision and depth of characterization, with many fine performances in the minor roles supporting the well-focused portrayals by the main characters (and it has one of the most memorable lines of any film in the last thirty years), I have not met very many people who enjoyed it, and their reasons were various.Those who enjoyed it did so for one of three reasons: admiration for the career of one or another of the actors in it, interest in the period or the politics of the early twentieth century, or curiosity about whether Diane Keaton could actually pull off a purely dramatic role. The film is long and tends to meander somewhat, and neither the visual impact nor the sound track is enough to hold the attention of someone who isn't automatically captivated by the subject matter.More specifics about what I liked about the film? Jack Nicholson's uncharacteristically understated portrayal of F. Scott Fitzgerald; Warren Beatty's hyperactive and endearing performance, which I would have enjoyed disliking but could not; the eye-level view of Russian Bolshevism and the early U.S. Communist party; the memorable line I alluded to earlier, when the ax-handle-wielding union buster confronts Reed in the exchange"Who you?""I write.""You write? . . .

		<fullReview>Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton work well together. Their performances are earthy and seductive. The attraction and love between their characters is palpable, and I've always thought that an actor who can disappear into a role, actually become the character, is the main indicator of their talent. Both Beatty and Keaton accomplish this with seeming ease, and much of this must hinge on Beatty's directorial efforts. They appear comfortable in their roles. The script is witty and intelligent, hearkening to a time when America was younger and less sure of herself. The use of the information provided by the Witnesses adds a level of thoughtfulness and conjecture to this film by seeing the characters through the eyes and minds of actual people who remembered them. The film is long (over three hours,) but the persistence of the viewer is well rewarded by an impressive list of supporting roles played by Maureen Stapleton, Jack Nicholson, Edward Herrmann, and Paul Sorvino. This movie ranks in my top 10.</fullReview>

Red-diaper babies just couldn't gush enough about this somewhat-honest but meandering story on a slice of journalist John Reed's life. Also, the lefty Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences bequeathed an Oscar upon Beatty for his direction, which was more for the subject matter than for his magnificent job of direction, naturally. In short, "Reds" can't decide if it's an historical epic or a love story, leaving audiences with a empty feeling, not certain when the saga will end, or why it ended, or just if it ended. The only conclusion we find about the historical impact of communism comes from Emma Goldman, who emphatically tells her colleagues in the movement that the system "cannot work." No more than 8 years after this movie was released, good ol' Emma's words were found to be emphatically prophetic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting biopic of idealistic and Socialist writer John Reed, and his experiences, fulminating to his book, THE TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD. Reed is a fascinating and unlikely subject for a Hollywood movie, mostly because he is extremely complicated and doesn't say "gee whiz" a lot. Beatty (winning Best Director Oscar) really pulls out the stops to paint a serious portrait, in this movie. Yes, to a certain extent, it is sympathetic towards Socialism. However, one can't deny that it was particularly gutsy to make a film of this nature in 1981. Also undeniable, was the utter human misery and suffering of 95% of the Russian people during this period under Czarist rule. The question probably wasn't so much when a revolution would occur, but a question of what took them so long? Politics aside, REDS is a well made film, with much going for it. The script tends to run on in parts, yet tells a compelling story. The performances are simply super, with Maureen Stapleton a standout (with a well-deserved Oscar nod). Just be warned, REDS tends to run very long and gets a bit dry in patches. The viewer is rewarded though, with some knockout performances.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a great 2 hour movie there somewhere...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well acted, skillfully directed, tactfully written, 'Reds' is a disaster. The sheer length and repetitiveness of this film overshadows all of it's many redeeming values. Not all stories and premises merit films of epic length, and this is one of the tragic examples of a film that had great potential, but is harpooned by it's own bloated self-importance.Many of the best films have long running times, but 'Reds' has neither the story nor the action to make all of its 195 minutes worth watching. It lacks the luscious scenery of "Lawrence of Arabia" or the cinematic significance of "Gone with the Wind" and just leaves the viewer feeling sore. The film really has no backbone of a plot either. To summarize what is is about is quite an ominous task. You could call it a 'love story' but by an half an hour into the film the relationship between the two principal characters is so clearly defined that the 'love story' aspect of the film begins to just be annoying. Diane Keaton is spectacular as Louise Bryant, the would-be journalist who attaches herself to Warren Beatty's would-be revolutionary Jack Reed. Jack Nicholson is there seemingly just to be Jack, and you can't help but wonder why they bothered to include his character in the movie at all.Unless you have particular affinity for the history of communism in America (and think 'Dr. Strangelove' to be a bit too satirical), then 'Reds' really isn't worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reds: the greatest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie which touches all the emotions, as well as the intellect.A movie which does not allow itself to be hurried, but sensitively creates the mood and genre, with imagery and emotion long lost.A movie which centres on the most important thing to man: love and integrity.A movie which tells of hope, and hope lost, and sadness, and yet sadness beautiful.A movie with scripting unequaled, and commensurate intensity of dialogue.A movie which is a true story: John Reid, the only American buried in the Kremlin wall.A movie which impresses unforgettable images on your mind the first viewing, deeply touches you the second viewing, and haunts you the third.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't Age Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie doesn't age well. Or perhaps one needs to be in his teens or twenties to sympathize with the central characters.The supporting cast, as almost everyone agrees, is superb. How can Nicolson do anything wrong? He is superb here. Ditto the sets, costumes, and backgrounds.What doesn't work for me is the mismatch between the script and the two lead actors. John Reed and his partner/spouse were dynamic people irrespective of one's view of their politics. The script supports this fact. But Warren Beatty is just too juvenile to be taken seriously--he is one shrug away from a Hugh Grant-level of cluelessness. Diane Keaton is terminally cute and remains one big lovable Kewpie Doll. Together, they play these dynamic characters as spoilt, upper-middle-class ignorant kids who blunder into grown-up situations without any thought at all.They bring on themselves all their problems, and that because they're dumb, not noble. Too bad--the movie deserved better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it wasnt for the cast, this film would be almost completely unwatchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes star power can make or break a movie, that's the case with "Reds", its a rather dull story about a women who gets involved with communism. If this film was acted by unknowns, it would be a turkey with no redeeming values whatsoever. But the cast makes it worth seeing, if you have time to waste. I can give it a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the love of God...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went out and rented this flat snoozefest after watching Beatty's "Biography" on A&amp;E last week, thinking I might have missed something when I saw it 20 years ago. That anyone can still take Soviet sympathizers with anything but a large grain of salt is incredible. How unfortunate that the folks who bankrolled and concocted this valentine to the revolution never got a chance to live in the USSR.Political carping aside, the movie suffers from the worst thing possible for a film--It is boring. Oh, well. Since when did a film have to be good to win an Oscar?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well-made but intellectually dishonest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Technically, this was a pretty well-made film, though awfully long and a bit boring in spots because of this. So, for technical reasons alone, I give the film as high a score as I do.Okay folks, my rather conservative roots are sure gonna show through on this one. This is because Warren Beatty and crew produced a "homage" to a "great American"--a man who hated America and did his best to work for the spread of international communism. While an interesting story in some ways, the overly idealistic way that Reed is portrayed is, to me, rather nauseating. While America was not perfect (what nation is?), Reed and his mistress did everything they could to attack democracy--she ultimately being arrested as a spy. I think this film is probably one of the best examples when people complain that "Hollywood is out of touch"--by idealizing a person who doesn't deserve idealizing (similar to what happened when Frida Kahlo was recently portrayed on film--a woman who slept with Trotsky and later excused his murder by Stalinists because it was "good for the cause"--Stalin, the same man who was responsible for the deaths of millions!).To me, a film does not need to feature only "good" people. However, over-idealizing the bad is intellectually dishonest and excuses evil. Additionally, a film does not need to be pro-American (such as the great film "Z") but fairness and honesty are of at least of SOME importance.PS--Perhaps I am the only one who sees the irony of this picture. Warren Beatty, a very rich guy who made his money in American films, promoting communism!! I guess it's easy for a rich guy in a democratic society to complain--I wonder if poor guys in the old Soviet Union had this same opportunity?!PPS--this dishonest film that bored most viewers and lost millions was adored by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (the Oscar people) with lots of awards and nominations. This doesn't exactly surprise me but says a lot about these ultra-pampered fools. A couple reviewers called the making of this film "brave". Why brave? Hollywood eats up this sort of stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly dreadful movie.We have the usual hack performance from Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton could not act her way out of kindergarten drama school, and Warren Beatty wanders through the movie looking like somebody just smacked him on the back of the head with a length of two-by-four. The script is excretable. The politics are patronizingly didactic. The supposed romantic tensions are fourth-rate melodrama.Visit your local bookstore and pickup a copy of Reed's book instead. Judge the author on his own words, not on the abortion that Beatty has delivered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>4-hours of tedium. The worst movie I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1981, this film promptly secured 11 academy nominations. This dreary piece of smut, supposedly a documentary on one man during the October Revolution of 1917, was little more than 4 depressing hours of unimaginative and uninspiring bedroom scenes spread across Russia. What people were thinking when making this one is beyond me.This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the day I saw Reds when it first came out, it has become a benchmark against which I rate all other movies. It is the worst of all! It's hard to pick examples of what I hated about this movie, because NOTHING EVER HAPPENS IN IT. I sat there for the 3+ hours, waiting for something to happen -- and it never did! Yet you kept waiting because the movie kept giving you the feeling that it was going to break through and become interesting, but it never did!When I saw it, I remember that there was an intermission at about the 2 hour mark. As we all left the theater, the usher said "I hate to tell you this, but there's over an hour of this movie to go." There were audible groans throughout the theater.I can't for the life of me see what some critics liked about this movie. To me, it was a total cure for insomnia. I gave it a 1 out of 10 only because there was no negative scoring allowed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Misunderstood, Classic Movie in the World. Misunderstood the Most Here in America, Because of Stupid People That Live Here in America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Beatty is the most misunderstood man in the world, during all of his regret-free career as actor and political to be President of the United States Man, Warren Beatty to be like George Washington, first President of United States of America Man, Yes! This movie is called stupid by people in world, but, they are wrong, very wrong, so very wrong, WRONG!WRONG!WRONG!, they, the people that call this movie I'm writing about here on the computer, Reds(1981), the people that call Reds(1981), the movie I'm writing about here on the computer, the people that call Reds(1981), this movie stupid, all people that call Reds(1981) stupid are bad people.This movie, Reds(1981), right next to another movie by same movie guy that made us watch this, Warren Beatty, Warren Beatty's other movie about guys running countries America and Russia, being seen a lot and cheered good by good people, Bulworth(1998).Bulworth(1998) and Reds(1981) have been called misunderstood good by living in our America Senate Washington, D.C. Jewish idiot dork Communist Al Franken,so called phoney baloney Republician in reality bad man Mancow Muller, and Jewish came from Russia living in Hollywood movie star actress Jennifer Jason Leigh. The people before all call Reds(1981) here misunderstood bad. The people before call Reds(1981) a good time at a movie from a book by Jewish guy, The Communist Manifasto by Karl Marx. What the people before said about Reds(1981) is poop. I've watched WWE TV for the past 28 years. Does that mean because the way Hulk Hogan and Steve Austin act on WWE TV that the man that makes Hulk Hogan and Steve Austin on WWE TV do the stuff that Hulk Hogan and Steve Austin do behind them, pulling the strings as the puppet master, writing everything down for Hogan and Austin to do,that man that makes Hogan and Austin act like they do, that man is like Richard Donner, George Lucas, or Steven Spielberg, a movie director, that man I am talking about making Hogan and Austin do stuff on WWE TV is Vince McMahon, Vince McMahon tells everybody what to do and how to act in WWE TV, does that mean because of what Vince McMahon tells Hogan and Austin how to act, does that mean Vince McMahon is Republician(think George W. Bush in America)? No! I can't get inside Vince McMahon's head, but for all I know, Vince McMahon belongs, acts, and is a member of the other big word parties here in America,the Democrat Party, the Constitution Party, the Reform Party, the Liberterian Party, and lastly, the Nazi Party in America.The movie I'm talking about on the computer here, Reds(1981), is a celebration of a government we see with eyes for all the people, not the selected, like we see selected here in America with our own eyes, if you live in America, which is the country I was born in, which is the country I love, America, I who write this, love America, I would die for America and go to Yaweh's Heaven with Jesus because I would die for America.If you live in America, like me who write this on computer, our America, and the way we live in now in America by America President Barack Obama is for selected people not all people. Selected People bad. All people good.P.S. Faye Dunaway, I know you, as an actress co-starred with Warren Beatty in Bonnie and Clyde movie(1967). If your reading this, this author guy sent you the crazy Xmas card last year in 2009.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a romantic treatment of journalist John Reed's advocacies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stream-of-consciousness plotting undercuts this telling of the events surrounding Reed's writing of "Ten Days That Shook The World". Personally, I think it's curious to see the establishment of a dictatorship treated romantically, but some see the events of 1917 as a high point in recent political history, so it's instructive to see a film like "Reds", so as to experience the way advocates of socialism see the theory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Communist Governments have killed over 100 million people!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a typical Hollywood pro-Communist movie! Its amazing to me that some people still look at Communism as good when it has murdered and starved so so so SOOO many!! Read your history books people! Just look at the people in Vietnam and Cambodia, people get arrested for certain religion, speaking out against the Government etc. etc., even getting their toe nails pulled off, beaten' and killed! (I've read about these thinks just recently).If Communism ever did actually have a Government that didn't murder and starve you people still would be measurable because you wouldn't have goals and the sky to reach for because you wouldn't be allowed to! I love individual capitalism, I'm 22 years old and didn't go to College and only makes about 350 a week but I have hopes and dreams of doing real well on my own! And thats whats so great about it!Back to the movie, its boring and its garbage and a wast of too many hours!</fullReview>
