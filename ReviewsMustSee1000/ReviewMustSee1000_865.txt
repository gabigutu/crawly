		<shortDescription>One of my favorite sequels!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that there are a lot of haters when it comes to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, it has it's flaws and is by no means the strongest movie of the Indiana Jones series, but I just have so many good memories about this film and still to this day when I watch it, it gives me chills and excitement. The characters are memorable, the script is great, and Indiana is still pulling in the action packed excitement continuing from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The direction, editing, even the special effects are great. You have to love Short Round and Willy, the two new side kicks to Indiana's new adventure. Now I agree, Willy can get a little annoying here and there, but she was just so hilarious in that scene with the bugs and having to save Indiana and Short Round. Plus, Short Round has some of the most memorable lines of the entire series "Okey, dokey, Dr. Jones, hold on to your potato!", cheesy, but so funny. Harrison Ford still has Indiana down to a tee, this was the role that was meant for him.In this prequel, we start off in China on a trade off gone wrong with Lao Che, he ends up meeting a beautiful and very high maintence American girl, Willie. They escape together with Indiana's little side kick, Short Round and accidentally without knowing, they've escaped onto Lao Che's air plane. They wind up in India, where they find out about these rocks that can restore the village they're in, also the children have been kidnapped by Mola Ram and Indiana must free the kids and restore the rocks so the village can be safe again.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a fun sequel, I don't know why people complain so much about it. I can understand if people say it's the weakest of the series, but on it's own, this is a fantastic movie. It's one of my biggest recommendations to my friends as well as other film viewers. It just has everything you could want: action, romance, alligators, and heart sacrifices, lol, OK, that sounded gross, just trust me this that this is such a fun movie. It's one of my favorite films, I know that sounds bad, but I just love this film. It's a lot of fun and Indiana and Short Round are just the best buddies to watch argue on screen. This is an awesome sequel, definitely a must see.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest adventure films of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone complains about Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. One of my friends and I used to argue for months on end about which Indian Jones film was the superior. Almost anyone we ask say that Temple of Doom is their least favorite, and the worst in the Jones trilogy. I believe the only reason people say this, is because it's the middle film, sandwiched between an all time classic, and a Hollywood blockbuster. To me, there is NO question that Raiders of the Lost Ark is the far superior Indiana Jones film. To anyone who says Last Crusade is the best I can do nothing but disagree (let me point out that all THREE films are nothing short of phenomenal). Temple of Doom had so much to live up to after the first film, and instead of trying to re-create Raiders (something I feel Crusade did), Lucas and Spielberg decided to take the franchise in a new direction. In my opinion, this was a great idea. Crusade and Raiders are too similar: both of them take place in desert terrain, both have Indy going after a very famous, biblical artifact, and both have Indy fighting off the Nazi's from attaining this object for global domination. Without Temple of Doom, Last Crusade would be an obvious copy of Raiders of the Lost Ark. A different style of Indy film is needed to expand the trilogy, making Indiana Jones a truly global character, and Temple of Doom did just that.The film itself is a non-stop action, adventure ride. Harrison Ford is once again AMAZING as the dashing professor/archaeologist thrill seeker. Short Round is a loveable character who adds a humorous touch, and reveals the more compassionate side of Indy's character. The ceremony scenes are truly breathtaking and tense. During these scenes the film contains some very graphic images, but are used justifiably to convey the real dark, feel of this film (i.e. the removing of the man's heart while he's still alive, and lowering him into a fiery pit). The mine cart chase scenes are the most amazing, fast moving action sequence in any of the Indy films, and you feel like you're on a roller coaster each time you watch it. All these events lead to the film's spectacular and memorable climax.I know with three films as amazing as the Indiana Jones trilogy, it's hard to pick a best and worst film, in fact it's nearly impossible. I'm just going to say that each film is great on it's own, and really shouldn't be compared to the other two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is this one the darkhorse?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Temple of Doom may not be as good as Raiders, but it doesn't deserve all this negative flak. The story is a little darker but that doesn't take anything away from the film. It makes the situation that much more dire. John Williams' score infuses the sacrifice sequence with a sense of building dread. The chanting, the heavy drums all building into a wild climax of heart burning and lava filled mayhem. The mine car chase is wild fun and Indy's bridge manuver is one hell of a climax. Still don't know why everyone's so down on this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prequel to "Raiders of the Lost Ark"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny to call "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" a followup to "Raiders of the Lost Ark". This film is a prequel to the 1981 smash hit, a movie where the events that take place actually took place before the events in "Raiders". Notice at the beginning of "Raiders" that the year is 1936. In "Temple of Doom", the year is 1935. See what I mean? "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is another rollercoaster ride of a movie brought to life by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Harrison Ford is back as archaeologist Indiana Jones who this time searches for a sacred stone that was stolen from an Indian village. Along for the ride is American singer/entertainer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw, aka Mrs. Steven Spielberg) and little Chinese sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan). On their way to finding the stone they stumble across a palace that leads to the gateway of the Temple of Doom run by an evil Thugee cult. The action and special effects are first-rate as you would expect, though the story is a tad weaker than it was in "Raiders". Plus, Capshaw's performance leaves something to be desired. She goes so far over-the-top in some scenes that you'd wish Karen Allen would show up as Marion. Nevertheless, Capshaw isn't all that bad. She does make an impression during the times when she's not screaming. But Ke Huy Quan (now known as Jonathan Ke Quan) comes off better as Indy's young sidekick. The following year he starred in the Spielberg produced Richard Donner directed "The Goonies", but then didn't appear in much after that. "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is great fun only if you can get by Kate Capshaw's simpering wimpering character or the over-the-top violence. I found it to be exciting from beginning to end.***1/2 (out of four)POINT OF INTEREST: this was the film that lead to the creation of the PG-13 rating in 1984 (along with Spielberg's other 1984 movie "Gremlins"). Both "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" and "Gremlins" feature violence that most people felt was too strong for a PG rating, though the MPAA felt that it wasn't strong enough to merit an R rating (other Spielberg movies that got PG ratings that were quite intense were "Jaws", "Poltergeist", and the original "Raiders of the Lost Ark"). So after "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" and "Gremlins" opened in theaters at the beginning of the summer movie season of 1984 and became two of that year's biggest hits, the MPAA realized a new rating had to be created. The PG-13 rating was born. In August 1984, the first movies were released with the new PG-13 rating ("Red Dawn" and "The Woman in Red"). It's not a new rating anymore. The PG-13 rating has held up very well these last 18 years and it'll still go strong in the years to come. But I'll always remember "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" as the leading factor to the creation of the PG-13 rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining experience, but unable to match the sheer brilliance of the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the second of the Indy films from director Steven Spielberg, though chronologically it is actually the first. This prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark tries to out-do its predecessor for breakneck spills and gross-out moments, but the sparkle isn't quite there. It's an entertaining film for sure, but not as good as the original, partially because the plotting this time round is a little awkward and partially because Kate Capshaw as the main female character is an almighty irritation.The film opens in a Shanghai restaurant, where Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) causes a riot in pursuit of a diamond. Fleeing the scene with American singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and teenaged pick-pocket Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), he escapes to the airport. However, Indy and his companions unwittingly board an airplane owned by one of Indy's enemies, from which they have to make an audacious mid-air escape when the real pilots bail out mid-flight! Soon, the intrepid trio find themselves in India, where they come across a village in the grip of starvation. The village children have been kidnapped by local cultists to work in a mine, digging for the sacred Sankara Stones, and Indy is persuaded by the distraught villagers to rescue their youngsters. His quest takes him to the opulent Pankot Palace and, beneath it and beyond a maze of tunnels, the Temple of Doom.Ford is great as Jones, bringing genuine charisma to a role that he was born to play (can you imagine how things would have turned out if Tom Selleck had got the part, as originally planned?) There are some great moments along the way too, including the intentionally subversive opening sequence in Shanghai, a particularly funny and exciting runaway mine-train sequence, and an unforgettable banquet at Pankot Palace in which the food served up is enough to churn any stomach. But Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom still can't live up to the standard set by Raiders of the Lost Ark. As mentioned, Capshaw is a real pain on the senses as the always-squealing heroine, and the plot seems to over-stretch in an effort to link to the next development or set piece. The hunt-for-the-missing-children plot device allows Spielberg to dip into the kind of cloying sentimentality that occasionally mars his films too. This is certainly an entertaining and professionally assembled film, but in no way a rival or an equal to the excellence of its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>juvenile hell-pit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is proof that directors often don't understand their own franchises. Although Lucas has offered regrets for this bomb, it's the Spielbergian touches that make it so irritating. Claims that audiences were turned off because it was darker than the original are just goofy. This material was risible because it was infinitely more juvenile than what people expected.First they abandon real-world historical/biblical artifacts to make room for the crappiest MacGuffin to make people ever run around a movie (magic stones!?). We get antics in place of thrills; a bug and critter dinner menu (!?) a sequence with Capshaw frightened of everything. We get Kate Capshaw, shrieking and being girly until viewers pray for a character to put her out of our misery. We get Spielberg foisting crowds of children onto us when the first movie was blissfully free of children. Here, a kid is the shrieking protagonist (Short Round), kids are the victims (hordes of kidnapped &amp; enslaved kiddies) and a kid is the villain (Prince something-or-other). And as the final disgrace, Spielberg can't bring himself to kill the kid villain and just has him demure &amp; apologize the exact moment moral balance is restored. Terrible scripting. We get kids on screen for 95 percent of its running time, and a Spielbergian kiddie exodus provides the limp, hokey finale.To wash it all down we get a forgettable, conventional death for a seriously uninteresting villain. A forgettable arena for the climax, etc. This movie is only good for inducing groans. It's a lousy movie that delivers none of the quality of the previous or next entries; best for pitching into your own fiery hellpit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Waited Three Hours For This?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:My header was heard from the mouths of dozens of other sunburned faces exiting the Westgate theater in 1984. It was over ninety degrees out; we all stood out, in the blazing sun, for over three hours with the memory of Raiders Of The Lost Ark in our minds. There was such palpable excitement in line. We all shared our favorite scenes from the original. The movie starts so well, my friend Eric whispers to me,"Hey, this is going to be good." What happened? Well, from the moment that the three of them fall from, like three thousand feet, slide down the side of the Himalayas on a rubber raft, off the side of a thousand foot cliff. Eric says," WTF? I said, We're in trouble," yes, we were in very big trouble. For everyone, like everyone in the theater, wondering why Short Round is in the freaking movie: he is put there by the studio after they saw the dailies and Paramount knew the Asian community was going to go ballistic at the painfully racist depiction of the Indian people. Look, I am a conservative and I found it offensive; what does that tell you? Indian cuisine, which I love, actually does not consist of snake surprise, eyeball soup or chilled monkey brains. Take it from some one who wrecked his stomach eating Chicken Vindaloo; they have some of the best food known to man. I should know I kept our local Kashmir's Indian restaurant in business filling up my car with take out. Now, when we think of all the kiddies who filled the theater, a huge chunk of the demographic for Indy movies; who was the genius who thought,"Hey, how about the Cue ball Indian villain rips peoples' freaking hearts out of their chests? The kids will love it; the parents will bring them back over and over? In the theater I was in parents were covering their little darlings peepers with their hands. You had really P off'd parents walking out of the theater with their kids. What is this Alien? The acting, given the language barrier, is just dreadful. Even the guy with the quadfocals stinks it up big time and voodoo doll boy. Do you want to know how this was received in 1984? It went from an exclusive engagement at the Star Wars cinema to the drive ins in about two weeks. Stevie was up to his Adam's apple in really p'd off Indians who did not exactly like their portrayal. The movie is awful; there is zero chemistry between Ford and Capshaw, Stevie's alleged squeeze, by the way, which explains her bad acting yet prominent placing with the wrecking ball she swings on the movie. Want to really appreciate Karen Allen, check out Capshaw's performance, please? She is beautiful but her acting sucks. She wrecks the movie; I can still hear the shrieking thirty four years later. The revolt of the Kiddies: is this what you expected? Indy shouting some Hindu religion against Big, Bad Acting Baldy; are there a lot of Hindus watching? Let me check, no, not here in Oregon? We do not understand the Hindu religion, did I miss a hand out at the box office? Why is he quoting Shiva when we have no idea WTF he is babbling about? For all we knew, he was summoning Ronald Mcdonald; look, the movie will never complete my trilogy for a reason. I will not own this film. It has been rehabilitated since it landed with a booming THUD in 1984. The movie was ripped to pieces by critics. Due to the new comic book movie generation, it may have found its new audience.Save your money, your time do not buy this movie. It is just as bad as it ever was and yes, coming from the most non PC person on earth: it is racist against the Indian people. Besides that it is boring, stupid, gross, ugly and relentlessly offensive. One Lousy Movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the biggest movie adventures ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All this endless quarreling about which episode of the sensational Indiana Jones trilogy is the greatest one seems so futile and pointless to me. Personally I love the whole classic series and it's been a highly important part of my childhood. There are only few films that has effect me as much when I was young. It's easy to notice that each Indy-film is downright brilliant yet refreshingly different from the other and could easily be the best of the three so why not just enjoy all without using energy to locate flaws and make comparisons. Terrific "Raiders of the lost ark" was of course the first and the original and therefore freshest one - the true and the genuine Indy-movie."Indiana Jones and the last crusade" had Sean Connery playing Indy's daddy and if you ask me "Indiana Jones and the temple of doom" is the biggest adventure of them all. I'm not saying that it's necessarily the best part because I don't want to put these movies in any order. I just happen to think that it's the biggest adventure film = it's more exotic, danger-filled and action-packed than the first or the last one. I've never thought "Indiana Jones and the temple of doom" as an over-violent movie, not even when I was a kid. So they rip a guy's heart out. That's cruel but this is only an old-fashioned fairy tale, a fantasy - not a gory horror picture. To pack it all up in one sentence: Among the biggest movie adventures ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set before the events of 'Raiders', Dr. Jones is in Shanghai doing business with Chinese crime boss Lau Che. Losing the upper hand in a night club he barely escapes with his life (and baggage in the form of Willie Scott and sidekick kid Short Round) to the airport. But little does he know the plane he gets on is owned by Lau Che and the pilots sneak out in mid-air while they are sleeping.After jumping to safety in an inflatable dinghy Indy, Willie and Short Round drift by an Indian village that has been stricken with bad luck since the theft of their magical Shankara stones. Encouraged by the villagers to go to Pankot palace and retrieve the stones, Indy has no idea that what he will find involves an evil cult hellbent on taking over the world with their lunatic new religion.Temple of Doom is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best Indiana Jones film. I know a lot of nerds are going to disagree with me but I do think it superior to Raiders of the Lost Ark because I prefer the darker, nastier tone and the fact that it just doesn't let up from the word 'go'! Two hours of Temple of Doom's running time pass in a breeze of sheer adventure as Spielberg takes us from one memorable set-piece to another. The opening musical number, the fight in the Obi-Wan Club, the chase through Shanghai, the plane crash/dingy ride, the journey to Pankot Palace, the dinner scene, the human sacrifice, the freeing of the slaves, the mine-cart ride, the water rush, the rope bridge, the cliff-hanging...wow! How much more can you pack into a film? It's physically impossible!Originally criticised on it's release for being too dark, Temple of Doom still ends up being a classic. I guess the audiences of 1984 were expecting Raiders of the Lost Ark 2 and were taken aback when they got something else. If you watch it with the others you can feel how different the film is with no scenes taking place in America, no University and no Sallah or Marcus Brody.John Williams' brilliant music is also at it's best. He even received an Academy Award nomination despite already being nominated for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, which is quite rare. The film did win an Oscar for its visual effects (beating the equally impressive effects of Ghostbusters) which, when viewed today, at least might seem a little bit dated, but still hold up quite well.Or course, there's nothing really important about the film. I mean it won't beat Schindler's List or Munich in terms of drama but if you want escapism and soaring, thrill-a-minute adventure his name is Indiana Jones and the place is the Temple of Doom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Changed My Mind About This Stylish Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a long time, this was the only one of the three Indiana Jones films I did not like. Then, when it was part of the DVD package that came out over five years ago, I had to buy it if I wanted the other two, so I gave it a third look. Wow, all of sudden I liked it. For the first time, the woman (Kate Capshaw) and the young boy (Ke Huy Quan) weren't as annoying as I had remembered them. The stupid kid really had rubbed me the wrong way, but this time only Kate was annoying....and she was fine once she calmed down and got rid of the hysterics.The action in this film is mostly at the beginning and at the end. It is so Rambo-ish (bad guys never hit the target but good guys always do) it is ludicrous. It also has dumb dialog in a number of spots, paying homage to voodooism, spells and other nonsense.Yet, despite these criticisms, it's entertaining start-to-finish and has some fantastic visuals. The photography in here is beautiful: the best of the three Jones adventures. I particularly liked the opening dance number which reminded me of a Busby Berkeley extravaganza. This whole film looks spectacular on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great potential, but failed delivery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was fun to watch when I was young, but now that I've seen it again, I must say this is the worst Indiana Jones movie. The film had great potential (murderous cults, eating bugs&amp;brains, mineshaft chase scenes), but there were two things that killed it.First there's Short Round. Spielberg takes some random orphan and injects him into the story. His dramatic lines with Harrison Ford did nothing but cause an awkward bout of laughing.Then there's Willie Scott. She doesn't contribute a thing to the survival of the characters (at least Short Round helped Indie snap out of the hypnotism). All she does for the whole damn movie is scream and whine. The 2 hours of hours of hearing "indieeeeeeeee" was a difficult thing to sit through.1/10 because of the annoying and unnecessary characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kate Capshaw Annoying, Movie Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a big disappointment. Steven Spielberg is taking the franchise into ridiculous comedy slapstick action. Kate Capshaw is super annoying screaming non-stop. While the first one had a great brassy and tough Karen Allen, they're going for a blonde bimbo this time around. Somebody really needs to shut Kate up. With people shooting at them, she tosses out the gun and complains about her chipped nail. She's not only playing the blonde bimbo. She's playing it in the most cartoon way possible. Then there is Short Round. He's yet another character to create comedy. If it wasn't for Kate Capshaw's stupid character, I might enjoy Short Round's funny banter.And the story reeks of stupidity. The first one was well crafted, but this one goes beyond camp and over the edge. It borders on racist against the Indians. But even the basic logic is missing in this one. For example, if Lao Che owns the airline and got the pilots to crash the plane. Why not just return the plane to the airport? Heck why not just not take off? That kind of silliness shouldn't be excused. And I'm not even talking about gliding down on an inflatable raft. This is one big disappointment. It's one long series of ridiculous action scenes. Sadly I didn't care about any of the new characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>weakest of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSThe 1980's were a busy decade for Harrison Ford. From the second "Star Wars" film in 1980 through to the final "Indiana Jones" film in 1989, Ford was rarely away from the picture screen. This was not always a good thing however as this middle of the road second adventure about Dr Jones from 1984 proved.In "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", we find Dr Jones in Shanghai in 1935. After a violent confrontation with a Chinese villain, Jones eventually finds himself in India. Taken to a small village, he encounters a badly treated people in need of help. To do this, Jones will have to travel to an ancient palace and combat the forces of evil.The key problem with this film is it's problems in the plot department. Whilst a fun film to doze off to on a Sunday afternoon, it is by a long distance the worst of the three "Indiana Jones" films. With a story involving an evil cult underneath an ancient palace, the story just doesn't have the special feeling which "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "The Last Crusade" thrive on. Whether because of a considerable lack of Nazi's (this film actually being a prequel to "Raiders") or because Amrish Puri's Mola Ram just isn't that interesting a character, "Temple of Doom" simply feels lacking.At the same time, another problem with this film is the below par standard of acting. With characters like Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) and Willie Scott (future Mrs Spielberg, Kate Capshaw), we should never have expected much, but both performances are, to say the least, dreadful. Add to this some awful performances by the villagefolk who Indy is helping, and you know there's problems.It feels a shame that so much of this film is wrong, when the other two films of the trilogy are so good. With bad choices in plot and characters (Denholm Elliot's Marcus is a necessity for any Indiana Jones film), the story never really takes off and feels awkward. At just under two hours long, this film seems to drag and makes you feel like your watching all three parts of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Still, for something to put on television and doze off to, it does work wonders. The question though is whether this is actually a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that truly made Indiana Jones the adventure Masterpiece...BRILLIANT!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people say Indiana Jones I think this is the film that comes to mind. While Raiders started the amazing series, and Last Crusade wrapped it up and took it to different heights...Temple of Doom IS Indiana Jones, it's everything the character stands for an gives people in entertainment. Terrific adventure, jaw dropping action, brilliant sets and exotic locales, larger than life characters, violence, darkness, romance, and wicked villains all balled up into this mysterious history lesson not based on reality. Many people that grew up in the eighties will fondly remember Temple of Doom as their favorite film and it's easy to see why. This film is the pinnacle of adventure...unparalleled by anything else right up to this day. Spielberg and Lucas have said that they longed to make Indiana Jones as an homage to the 1930's and 1940's serials and again Temple of Doom really does fit that bill. Indiana Jones in general and even more so Temple of Doom almost has this campy feel to it but you never once think of it as campy because it is incredible adventure. Steven Spielberg returns as director and George Lucas returned as writer for the story and the two of them know these characters and Spielberg just seems to have this innate knowledge of how to entertain and Temple of Doom turns in one of the greatest performance in an adventure film let alone a sequel which blows away it's predecessor.This series would have died dead in the water had Harrison Ford not returned. Ford IS Indiana Jones, everything about him just completely embodies the character. His rugged, tough talking, intelligent portrayal is mind blowing and if he got comfortable with the character in Raiders of The Lost Ark, he completely honed the character in Temple of Doom (which technically takes place before Raiders.) He is awesome, and one of my favorite actors but also gives us one of the greatest characters in movie history. Kate Capshaw is Indy's love interest and she is the complete opposite of previous love interest and his later ones and that is what they wanted. As lounge singer 'Willie' she is completely out of her element, whiny almost but it works for the story. I almost find her overused and overplayed but not quite as her character just jives with the story. Jonathan Ke Quan...what can I say...one of my favorite sidekicks in movie history as Indy's little partner Short Round. They give him a tiny bit of background but still leave his past kind of a mystery but still gives Indy this softer side and the two of them are terrific together. Ke Quan is awesome and just a really good addition to the story and gets some great lines. Amrish Puri is one of the film villain greats as the evil Priest type character Mola Ram.So many Indiana Jones fans have listed Temple of Doom as their least favorite in the series and that stuns me. I mean the film starts in a Chinese lounge with a musical number that makes you wonder if you're watching the right film...next thing you know you're in a high speed car chase across China, on to a plan that is going down, into a raft on a high speed river, into a village pillaged by evil, into a temple of the strangest religious practices...the film is brilliant. I could watch it a million times over and it will be my favorite Indiana film. If you only force yourself to watch one Indiana Jones film...well you're crazy...but if you do, make it Temple of Doom because this film is what Indiana Jones is all about...adventure. Granted there are some key elements I think missing from the series that the other two have but being a technical prequel it's understandable...first of all you have no Marcus Brody (played by Denholm Elliott), and Sallah played by John Rhys-Davies who are small but pertinent characters to the Jones films. Also the supporting characters like Willie and Short Round are a little more used than most supporting characters but Temple of Doom is just fun and by the far the darkest in the series. I was almost blown away by how dark and gritty and violent Temple of Doom was compared to the others but it works for it. Definitely my favorite in the series. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excruciating. Simply Excruciating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When thinking of this movie, I only need to remember one thing: Kate Capshaw spends the entire movie shrieking in agonized fear. This is not what I consider acting, but after having seen this movie I have always been inclined to join her anyway. I loved Raiders, and Sean Connery's appearance as the dad enlivened the third, but this one needed a major job of rewriting and recasting. I usually compare the notion of watching this mess again to watching two hours of watching a blank screen, and darned if the blank screen doesn't win every time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg/Lucas' guide to sheer cliffhanging, shamefully entertaining adventure-lore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a part of me that wonders why I might have a rating as listed here as an 8/10 for Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, an 1980's blockbuster thrill-ride that many 'Jones' fans list as their least favorite- at the least inferior to Raiders- in the series so far. But then I have to take into account that for a film of this kind, one that poses the no-holds barred case of eleven-year old minds caught up in a grown-up control, it's quite spectacular in its manic, throw-in-the-sink kind of action film that more than pays homage to the matinée serials of the past. Since the last time I saw the film the bulk faded away from a random childhood day, seeing it today I'm struck by how it does tap into that sense of humor that is unhinged. This is more than just a vehicle for Harrison Ford, it's a crash course in delirious escapism, of things that make your skin crawl, thrills pushing a relentless arena, and dark comedy.This time, in a way, Spielberg, Lucas, and the American Graffiti co-writers (hence a bit of a push from Raiders on the bits of comedy), they set themselves up to make what happens so outrageous and (in its classically conventional way) manipulative. The story takes place in 1935, a year before Raiders in 1936, but the links of the story lines aren't important like in the Star Wars movies. It's simply sets a precedent for the filmmakers- the audience knows he'll get out of whatever's dished out, almost as a kind of toughening up for future tales of Dr. Jones. On the one hand the film delivers with a lot of promise on just the terms of pure spectacle (the brilliantly over the top opening Shanghai sequence, the whole main temple arena with its satanic overtones, the cart chase) and in pulling laughs out of the supporting characters here and there (Kate Capshaw will hit or miss with people, though Short round is quite the amusing- and not annoying- side character).On the other hand, however, there is a lack of real classic movie cliché thrills of Raiders, or with the movie star repore of Ford and Connery in Crusade. And, in truth, everything here is so completely immersed in the B-movie ideal of f***ing with you at every turn, even as a PG movie of the time, it very often pushes on the line of being hokey. The song that starts the film, Anything Goes, should give anyone an idea of what to expect from Spielberg and Lucas, two thirty-something men who in Temple of Doom- for better or worse- tap truthfully into their inner immature selves. It may miss the mark of greatness, but it's still one of the real guilty pleasures of the 1980's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Doom" is about right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a shockingly bad movie. I can't for the life of me understand why it has earned over a 7.0 rating on IMDb and a club of supporters on the Internet. Nostalgia, perhaps? I enjoy "Raiders of the Lost Ark," even though I find it to be a little politically incorrect and overrated. "The Temple of Doom," on the other hand, is downright atrocious, mightily racist and even a tad sexist. Apparently the movie was banned in India, and I can understand why, since it depicts Indians as miserably poor, superstitious, knife-waving, monkey-brain-eating lunatics.The really sad part is that the movie stinks even if you manage to ignore the racism. It's chock full of disgusting moments, like the beetle-eating scene and the part where about a hundred bugs crawl all over Kate Capshaw. It simply pushes the gross envelope too far.Even the never-ending action scenes are lacking. They're okay, I guess, but there's quite a lot of unconvincing blue screen work, and the big flood segment doesn't work because water doesn't "miniaturize" well. As if the special effects weren't bad enough in themselves, they're complimented by an obnoxious soundtrack, including some unusually bombastic John Williams music and Capshaw's relentless screaming.You know, she really is a terrible heroine - annoying and painfully unfunny. A beautiful woman, sure, but irksome as all get-out. It's very surprising (in a bad way) to see such a lame female character in Indiana Jones after the series started off with Karen Allen's excellent performance as the (relatively) tough Marion Ravenwood.Capshaw would be quite bad enough by herself, but compounding the casting problem there's Ke Huy Quan as Short Round, Indy's pointless kid sidekick. Whenever there's a stupid bit of slapstick comedy in the movie, Short Round helpfully cries, "Very funny! Very funny!" Which is code for painfully unfunny, of course.Weirdly enough, Capshaw (whose character is called Willie, for goodness' sake!) and Short Round are really the only characters - the villains are completely faceless. There's a very bizarre segment when Indy puts on his scholarly glasses and has dinner with some people who I guess might qualify as characters, but the scene just doesn't fit with the rest of the movie, and never for a moment does the dialogue feel "real." So, in the absence of strong characters, the movie just sort of drunkenly reels from fight to fight.I have one last observation. At one moment, Indy is waiting in his bedroom, expecting Capshaw to come in and have sex with him (he's too proud to go to her bedroom). The strange part about this set-up is that Short Round is in Indy's bedroom. Soooo...I guess Indy is expecting to have sex in front of Short Round? Isn't that a little strange? Well, maybe not; I guess the kid has to learn sometime. But maybe Indy should just go to her room, huh? Sloppy scenes like that are a sure indication that Spielburg, Lucas and co. were really having an off day when they made this. Terrible, terrible, terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hey, Dr. Jones, no time for love. We've got company."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of Raiders of the Lost Ark, the sequel was inevitable. George Lucas came up with the story and Steven Spielberg again directed this second adventure in the Indiana Jones serial. The high energy and joy seen in Raiders of the Lost Ark has been replaced with a darker, more serious adventure, as Indiana is charged with recovering a magic stone for a village in India who has seen drought and all of the children have gone missing. The beginning of the movie is the high point of the film, with an extravagant musical number in club Obi Wan (oh, that George Lucas and his inside Star Wars jokes), a Shanghai night club where Indiana is closing a deal over artifacts from the Chinese dynasty. Kate Capshaw is the featured singer and the latest "Indiana girl" in this film, a movie that, curiously enough, occurs BEFORE Raiders of the Lost Ark, so the suspense of Jones' fate (if there really was any) is removed, and so any potential love affairs that fail to carry over between movies. Also missing is John Rhys-Davies' Sallah and Deholm Elliot's Brody, instead, we get to see Indy's child helper, Short Round, who's job is to go into tight quarters and say "Doctor Jones" about 300 times. The plot is complicated, as I had to watch the movie a couple of times to get an idea of was actually happening, and, unlike the previous film, most of the movie happens in one place. The famous scene in this movie is the dinner at the palace, where the visitors are treated to chilled monkey brains and other appealing meals. The movie does feature a fantastic scene with an underground rail system that turns into a chase sequence that is filmed well and is enjoyable to watch. This film does not have the whimsy or innocence seen in the other two Indiana movies, and suffers because of it. While still an enjoyable film, it is the least of the three Indiana movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie misrepresents India and its culture. The scene in which Indians have been showed eating snakes ,monkey and all the wild creatures is very absurd. The truth is around more than half of India's population is vegetarian. And those who eat meat ,mostly eat lamb ,fish and chicken. India is very peaceful country and believes in the ideology of 'live and let others live'. The movie is entirely against the Indian culture and it's belief. This movies gives viewers wrong impression about India and it's people. I am sorry if this comment of mine hurts anyone here. But this movie hurts me because i am an Indian. Being Indian it's my duty to tell everybody that this movie reflects false image of India.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong- I love the Indiana Jones franchise. This movie, however, didn't do it for me. First of all, they leave the excellent idea of Jones battling the Nazis for artifacts, which Steven Spielberg used as a metaphor for the tensions of the Cold War. What did they turn to? A psychotic, satanic cult leader using child slavery to find magic rocks. Add in one of the most annoying and horrible of female companions in film history (Willie), as well as the bland and rather stupid role of a young Chinese boy (Short Round) as Indy's sidekick, and you have the makings for an awful film.Honestly- the antagonist rips people's hearts out but they survive? What's the purpose? Also, the child slavery and torture of Indy and subsequent attempt to brainwash him makes this movie very dark in nature.While this movie had an intention that wasn't terrible, the violence and depressing feel of the movie, as well as terrible acting by the main characters (except for Harrison Ford, who does excellent as usual), makes this film a very bad one. The only reason I didn't rate this film lower is because I am a huge Harrison Ford, George Lucas, and Stephen Spielberg fan, and the music by John Williams was yet again fantastic. Too bad the same can't be said for the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only this movie had fulfilled the promise of it's first 15 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Temple of Doom begins with two of the best set pieces of the Indiana Jones series, a delightful Busby Berkeley-esque musical number and a frenetic scene involving an antidote, a diamond and some ice cubes. They're light-hearted and beautifully done, and for the first 20 minutes, everything in the movie suggests a fun, frolicsome adventure of foreign intrigue.And then it all falls apart.The problems start when Indy and his companions arrive in a blighted Indian village. The change in tone is striking; suddenly the movie is a grim story of suffering villagers, their lives in ruin, desperately begging Indy to help them (oddly enough their main concern is a little stone, although he soon learns they are missing something that most people would consider far more precious). From here, the movie drifts into eyeball soup, giant bugs, human sacrifices, and child slavery. While there are some good scenes, particularly towards the end, where there is a exciting mine cart chase that could easily fit in with that first 20 minutes, the movie is generally not good at all. The story is poorly structured, the dialogue is weak, and the romance between Indy and Kate Capshaw is forced (she's whiny and he holds her at knife point in the first scene; how is that a good start for a relationship?)Apparently Stephen Spielberg and George Lucas had just been divorced and were feeling depressed, which would explain both why they decided to pursue such dark subject matter and why Capshaw's character is so shrill and inept that I felt embarrassed for the actress (especially since she had to follow Karen Allen's strong character from the original). Light adventure is not the venue for working out your unhappiness. The writer of Raiders of the Lost Ark actually turned down a chance to script this movie because it was so unpleasant, and that should have given Spielberg and Lucas pause, as should India's refusal to let them film there because they felt the movie was racist. These complaints seem justified; the movie is a mix of weak Indians who need a white man to save them and evil Indians that need a white man to stop them. If only I could clip the first 20 minutes from the movie and plant it like a seed and let a two-hour movie in the vein of that beginning grow in place of Temple of Doom. This movie isn't just mediocre, it's also tragic; it's the movie that might have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Second Indiana Jones film is actually a prequel[1935] where Indiana(Harrison Ford of course, back in fine form) finds himself(after escaping some gangsters, with Kate Capshaw in tow) in India, where he is enlisted by a village to find their kidnapped children, who are going to be sacrificed by a murderous cult in order to gain mystical powers.Film is as breathless as the first, with lots of set-pieces and fights, but somehow this isn't much fun, since the violence quotient is quite high, and surprisingly graphic. Credibility is quite low as well, and whole thing becomes head-ache inducing by the end. Still, this was a huge hit, but a disappointment for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is why I think this is the worst Indiana Jones film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, this isn't really a review, but a short statement of why I hate this movie, EVEN IF it is far from the worst movie ever. The big issue with this movie is how it handles it's tone. It's fine to change between tones to a certain extent in order to bring up its point, whether it be fear or laughs. The problem with this movie is that it ditches the previous tone altogether only to bring it back in the end.When you start off your movie as a family adventure, then end up showing child slavery, graphic violence and an overall mean-spirited tone, you can't expect the viewers to laugh again once it reaches the end. Sure the first Indiana Jones had its share of gruesome violence, but it still kept the adventurous tone from start to finish.There may be other problems, such as annoying characters and offensive stereotyping of Hindu cults. But considering the well-paced action and haunting music, these could be easily forgiven as cheesy fun.The real reason why I hate this movie is that entire issue with the tone. If you want to be mean-spirited, keep it that way. If you want to be family-friendly, keep it that way. But don't expect that you can keep both of them and make an enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

I'm a real Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford fan but Willie is simply not believable as a character. She spends the first 2/3's of the movie whining and then undergoes a magical transformation. Really hard to take. Why couldn't she be a little stronger to begin with. She is a "scamming gold digger", after all. Maybe not Laura Croft but, at least SOME ovaries! The is good solid fun once Willie gets over herself and becomes a believable character. It is after all an Indiana Jones movie.

		<shortDescription>Pretty Poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' is the second instalment in the Indiana Jones franchise but acts as a prequel to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. Compared to that film, the Temple of Doom is pretty poor. The story itself is okay but not excellent. The plot of the film is introduced very well but the plot itself can be really offensive sometimes, particularly when they're in the palace and people are eating monkey brains, eyeballs etc. These parts are really racist and out-dated nowadays.The acting is terrible, Kate Capshaw is awful; she is supposed to play an extremely annoying woman who causes nothing but trouble for Indiana Jones but you cannot help but feel insulted at her character as she's a huge stereotype. Harrison Ford is okay, his performance is not as good in this film as it is in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or in 'The Last Crusade'. The best performance was probably from Jonathan Ke Quan.Overall, this film is the worst Indiana Jones film (apart from the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) and is a bit pointless. The Indiana Jones franchise is overall a really good series of films and provides great family entertainment but this film is the weakest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>has a few issues that could have been ironed out...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie had TONS of potential, but there's just a few too many scenes that are closer to the "King SOlomon's Mines" remake than they are "Raider's".The first scene that has serious issues is the scene where they are sliding across the snow in the inflatable raft. I have no problems with the plausibility of the scene(after all, it's an adventure movie), but the fake backdrop was pretty bad for Spielberg standards. Another scene that could have used a nice splice is the campfire scene early in the film. The entire scene is a definite swing-and-a-miss.just after that, from the 40 to 100 minute mark, this is absolutely excellent. Their arrival and first encounters at Pankot Palace are extremely entertaining.Basically, this entry and "Crystal Skull" suffer from some campy visuals that take away from the overall realism. "Last Crusade" and "Raider's" do not have these "seriously flawed scenes", and hold up extremely well because of it.I like the film because the story is a departure from the expected story lines, and the film really has a totally different/perhaps-even-more-fun feel compared to the original, but "Temple of Doom" is really nothing more than an unpolished gem that could have been much, MUCH better.For reference, here are my ratings of all four Indy films: Raiders - 10 Temple - 6.5 Last Crusade - 8.5 Crystal Skull - 564/100For the longest time I had this at 7/10(69/100), but a recent re-visit dropped it down a notch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior prequel -- too comic booky and not enough substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Raiders of the Lost Ark" introduced the character of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and was such a massive hit in 1981 ? truly one of the greatest action/adventure movies of all time ? that there had to be a sequel; or, in this case, a prequel ("Raiders" takes place in 1936 and "Temple" in 1935).The opening sequence starts out in Shanghai where there's a wild brouhaha over a huge diamond in a ritzy bar. Indy escapes on a plane with a noisy singer named Willie (Kate Capshaw) and a Chinese boy nicknamed Short Round, which leads to the Himalayas and an Indian village. It's clear that they were trying to outdo the opening jungle sequence of "Raiders" and that's the problem: They overdid it to the point of ridiculousness. At least the first film kept an air of quasi-realism with its fun, adventurous spirit. "Temple" is fun and adventurous too, but the action is so out of the realm of plausibility that it becomes a cartoony farce, not far from a "Road Runner" cartoon. Say what you will about "Raiders," but most of the action sequences were later reenacted on a TV show in order to see if they were plausible, and they were! Not so with "Temple." The bulk of the story takes place at the great Pankot Palace in India (actually shot in Sri Lanka) and about an hour of that in the hellish bowels of the Palace, the titular Temple of Doom. These sequences feature great sets akin to Conan the Barbarian but with a noticeably comic garnishment. This is why I scoff at criticisms of the movie as too extreme or horrifying for kids. Get Real. "Temple of Doom" is a rung or two above a live-action Scooby Doo cartoon.Kate Capshaw got the part of Willie out of 120 actresses vying for the coveted role. This is the film where she met her future husband, director Steven Spielberg, and they've been married since 1991. Kate's amiable and effective, but her constant screaming really starts to grate on the nerves. Yet that goes with the part; remember Indy's description: "the worst part about her is the noise" (lol).Despite my criticisms, there are some entertaining parts, like most of the opening, the trip with the elephants, the introduction to Pankot Palace, the dinner scene and the initial explorations of the catacombs. Parts of the ending are good too, like the cliff sequence and, later, the rope bridge. Overall, though, the story never gains the momentum or insights of the first film; worst of all, the Temple of Doom sequence goes on forever and it's just not compelling enough to sustain interest, plus it's too cartoony. "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is a prime case of too much flash with too little substance. Although sporadically amusing, it doesn't gel as a whole and is a huge disappointment after the incredible "Raiders of the Lost Ark." The film runs (overlong) at 118 minutes and was shot in Macau, China; Kandy, Central Province, Sri Lanka; California, Washington, Arizona and Florida; with studio sets in England.GRADE: C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), but its sequel, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), is one of the most annoying films I've ever sat through. I can somewhat see why others would enjoy it, but for me this was nigh unbearable.Harrison Ford is a good sport as always. There is nothing to fault in his performance. Jonathan Ke Quan isn't shabby either as Short Round. But Kate Capshaw is just atrocious, one of the worst heroines ever. She is useless, obnoxious, and as grating as a mosquito buzzing in your ear. She gives Jar Jar Binks a run for his money, and I say that with the utmost sincerity; the only thing she has over that cinematic abomination is that she is easier to look at.I enjoyed some of the darker elements of the film, but for the most part, they killed the fun. And I'm not talking about the villain ripping people's hearts out with his bare hand, I'm talking about the depiction of child slavery, which was just brutal, too brutal for a film that seeks to be escapist. It feels jarring.It's easy to see why the response to Temple of Doom is so divided. For me, the terrible heroine and the general unpleasant feel of the movie destroy my overall enjoyment. But as the TV Tropes website says, your mileage may vary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For no apparent reason, this story is set one year before Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we are reintroduced (or introduced, as this is a prequel) to Indiana Jones, in a bar in Shanghai, where he is obviously slipped a drug; a slow-acting poison in his drink. A huge fight ensues as he searches desperately for a vial containing the antidote, in a D.O.A.-inspired opening.Unfortunately, after finding that vial of antidote in the decent enough intro, the vile film proper begins, as Jones and constantly whining sidekick Willie, and obnoxious little kid Short Round (oh please) endure all sorts of grotesqueries in their search for ... some rocks. Rocks? No fun at all, this film degenerates into nothing more than a seemingly never-ending series of repulsive, horrifying events (heart-ripping, kidnappings and child sacrifice, and enduring rooms full of bugs and tarantulas and creatures which have not yet been named crawling over people) for a couple of rocks? Are you kidding me? In the previous film, they found the Ark of the Covenant. Granted, it ends up being locked away in a huge warehouse, probably to never be seen again, but they found the Ark of the Covenant! There was a sense of wonder and accomplishment there.Here, nothing.Gone is the (slight) realism of Indy's quest for a historical Biblical object- in its place now, is the horrible doom and gloom of one of the lamest MacGuffins imaginable: rocks in an underground temple, being horded by a wholly forgettable villain.John Rhys-Davies' character (Sallah) is sorely missed, but I doubt even he could have done much to salvage this material.I'm sorry to keep bringing this up, but rocks?

		<fullReview>The original "Raiders Of The Lost Ark" was an old-fashioned fast-actioned entertainment show, full of exotic locations, wild (if improbable) stunts, stereotypical (but scary) villains, and clean humor. It took place in the 1930's-1940's and was meant to mimic the pop action entertainment of the era.This prequel (taking place before "Raiders"), however, is awful. Instead of fun adventure, we're treated to a stupid screaming female companion and an even more obnoxious little boy companion, a silly plot and villains, and worst of all disgusting scenes of eating bugs and steaming monkey's brains. This movie actually made me glad when it ended. Fortunately the franchise was strong enough so that this movie didn't kill it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice adventure movie, ruined by the over-acting of Kate Capshaw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I was a child when this movie first came out, I distinctly remember finding it annoying for some reason. When I went back to watch it again as an adult, I found it unwatchable for that same reason: Kate Capshaw. I can only wonder if the budding love affair between her and Spielberg might have been the only reason she appears in this film, let alone practically in every scene. She delivers her lines with all of the flair and timing of an over-zealous junior college drop-out. An otherwise decent movie is ruined with every attempt by Mrs. Spielberg to be funny. But I guess landing Mr. Spielberg as a husband made ruining this film a worthwhile experience for Kate Capshaw. The other two films in this trilogy were such fine movies, it makes this middle chapter all the more embarrassing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My least favourite Indiana film in the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones who teams up with a kid named Shorty and a very feminine dancer to sort out some problem with an underground cult of human sacrificers who are reaping trouble upon a small rural community. This is my personal least favourite of the Indiana Jones films. I found much less substance to it, and I found the characters and the idea of the cult to be very silly. It is difficult to take this film seriously. It's still got some action, but it's probably best appreciated by children than the other two films. I say it's a stinker, despite some of the action scenes, and it's best avoided unless you're not an adult. I will say I appreciated it slightly more as a child, but the other two films ('Lost Ark' and 'Last Crusade') are much better films, in my personal opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A character in search of a story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You are Steve Spielberg and George Lucas. You have created one of the best made films of all time. You have created a box office bonanza. You have created one of the most iconic movie characters of all time.What do you do? How do you follow it up? All too often we see filmmakers fall into the deadly sequel trap, this trap of course being "take the elements and scenes the public really responded to in the first film, and ramp it up to 11"Invariably, this approach always fails. Why does it always fail? Because this strategy is often pursued at the expense of the most important element of all- character development and a coherent story, which are the elements that made the original as successful as it was in the first place. From the first scene of Raiders the character of Indy is carefully unfolded before us- he is a man who is driven, resourceful, intelligent, and not afraid of a good fight. But he is also has his weak spots( fear of snakes, which isn't even a weak spot because it enhances his character by showing he has some vulnerabilities) and can be a bad judge of character( the underling who double crosses him in the first 10 min of Raiders). These elements are developed and built upon as the story unfolds.As for the story, again it is laid out carefully. We have Indiana's rivalry with Belloq who is Indiana's cynical foil, his willingness to fight against evil by seeking the Ark to foil the Nazis, his past relationship with Marion, and the unveiling mystery surrounding the ark. All of this is done in a balanced and measured way.The characterization of Indiana and the other major characters is balanced with the telling of the story. Do we learn all of the backstory for each major character? No, but we learn enough about them to make them fully fleshed and compelling. Belloq is amoral and greedy, but like Jones he does have a love for knowledge and values artifacts, also he does at least feel human compassion for Marion- a tough nut, a woman who can fight her own battles and as the movies goes on you can see why a man like Indy fell for her. Sallah is a loyal friend to Indy with whom we can infer he has had some previous adventures. Raiders was a great balance of characterization, story, plot, great action sequences, amazing FX and an iconic score. All combining to make one of the best movies of all time.Sadly, Temple sacrificed the characterization and plot and just decides to make this simple one big action sequence with some gross out sequences to pander to the kids- Temple really went of the way to pander to the child audience( the character of short round, the plot of kids needing to be rescued, gross out moments etc). Was this an attempt to increase merchandising sales? I do not know. Even more disturbing, Indy's "love interest" this time around is more a caricature of the damsel in distress rather than a fully fleshed out character. We are not given insight into the motivations or desires of the villains other than they are Eeeeeevell. In the other words, the villains are just stock wooden characters there to be defeated by Indiana. Granted, its hard to create a better villain than Nazis, but at least Belloq had some charm and style. But the most disappointing aspect of this sequel is..we don't learn anything new about Indiana. How did he become the man we saw in Raiders? Given that the film is set a year before the events of Raiders, it was a perfect opportunity to show some of the events that lead to Henry Jones jr becoming Indiana Jones. But in this film, we are given nothing to add to the aura or mystique of Jones, nothing to illuminate other facets of his character or his relationships that existed by the beginning of Raiders.Some said the movie failed because it was too dark, or too violent or too gross and too much action. The movie failed because despite having a fantastic character to base the movie upon, it failed to tell the story of that character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A child's dream of masculinity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Indiana Jones films are redolent with scenes of brutality. One such we find here: a demonic priest ripping out the still beating heart from a sacrificial victim, who is then lowered into a pit to be burned alive. Ornamental skulls abound, omens of doom. Why is it then that, despite all this, these films are nothing like the masculine, barbarous art of Frank Frazetta's Death Dealer? The answer for me is that the filmmaker behind this is an overgrown child. We find that again in his more serious films, but in Temple of Doom he doesn't have to hide. This is as sophisticated as a Conan film, but without any manliness to speak of.Garish, obnoxious spectacle, a board game narrative, encounters with strange cultures reduced to 'exciting' theme-park rides and stereotype, Temple of Doom spares us nothing that is cheap and parochial.Spielberg's destructive contribution to cinema with these films then is not simply that the horrific and grotesque are now served out of the multiplex so that anxious teenagers won't have to sneak anymore into late-night grindhouse showings of b-movies to experience them under the allure of the forbidden but instead they now safely beckon to the entire family with the dazzle of a blockbuster, but also that, having made fortunes, these disposable films become prototypes to be emulated. Twenty years later we look back at these clamorous nothings and call them 'classics'.At the end Indiana Jones lassoes his woman close to him for a kiss. This adult moment Spielberg interrupts by having an elephant hose them both with water. The shtick over, the two of them finally kiss, at which point a chorus of happy children surrounds them. Spielberg's cloying vision of a happy family where the poor and starved are happy to have been saved. Surely one of the most naive, offensive finales in cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it amusing that many people seem to think that the reason this film didn't go over with many fans is because it is too "dark". As a person who highly enjoys dark movies, art, books, etc., I can say that in my opinion this was the least disturbing of the three movies (not that any of them are overly dark).The humor and sequences such as the famous "dinner scene" are so ludicrous that they take away from any sense of real foreboding. The plot is also laughable and the poor writing and terrible acting (Willie and Short Round) rip you out of any brief moment of suspended belief. Not to mention, it's hard to be disturbed or scared when you're too busy being annoyed (once again, Willie and Short Round), and you have to be really annoyed to overlook torture and child slavery.Overall, pretty stupid, not very dark. Watch the other two and pray that the new one isn't this bad.</fullReview>

Also, it is overtly dependent on the threat of violence to children--much like Jurassic Park, another Spielberg movie I have trouble enjoying for the same reason--but at least Jurassic Park has those amazing dinosaur special effects; Temple of Doom is mostly just a big gross-out, with way too much screaming and not enough fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Indiana Jones film to avoid!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the first wonderful Indiana Jones movie (RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK), it was obvious that Paramount Pictures had a mega-hit and doing a sequel that would make another fortune was guaranteed. In essence, they could even put crap on the screen and it would pack theaters--and unfortunately, that is exactly what they did! The biggest difference between the two film? Well, the first one was fun--the second one was rather sadistic and cruel. Now I am not saying there weren't some intense and possibly exploitational scenes in RAIDERS (such as the face melting finale or the temple filled with snakes), but there was a certain sadistic quality of TEMPLE OF DOOM that just looked like the writers were substituting gross-outs for intelligent scripting. Giant bugs and monkey skulls being open and eaten--complete with slurping sounds and slimy guts was neither entertaining nor needed. The same could be said for the scene where a person's heart is ripped out of their chest by the priest (also a physical impossibility unless you have the proper equipment). Throwing a cute kid into this mess of a film just seemed exploitational and mean--trying to exploit the audience's natural concerns for a poor little kid.It's no surprise that when this movie came out, the MPAA was pressured to create a new rating--PG-13 to warn families against bringing little kids to certain movies. Too bad this warning wasn't given when TEMPLE OF DOOM was released--I never would have bothered bringing people to see this mess. I did and I ended up leaving mid-way through this film because of the sick and cruel streak throughout the film. You have been warned.</fullReview>

The plot crosses the line from good yarn into fantasy, the mistakes they make whilst revealing their lack of knowledge about South Asia would horrify anyone less geographically challenged, &amp; the naive way they make a Shanghai street urchin (whose language would make him more at home in Hong Kong) so devoted to American culture. barely acceptable in a kids picture but in a film whose rating makes it unviewable to most kids, no. The fact that Kate Capshaw had to beat over 100 other actresses to get this role makes me dread to think what the others were like! (I still remember her fake-fluent Japanese in 'Black Rain'!) However, even the best of directors have their weaknesses; Clint Eastwood had Sandra Locke &amp; this film 'introdcuced us to the future Mrs Spielberg. I read that she had to learn how to scream for this film, but as she does very little else, what did she do for her screen test -- or maybe I don't want to know!

		<shortDescription>If Classic Has A Name, It's Temple Of Doom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An underrated gem of the 80's, An adventure not to be missed and indescribably classic in every sense of the word. I'm a huge fan of the Indiana Jones franchise and unlike most fans, consider Temple of Doom to be my favourite of the series and one of my favourite films.Set one year before Raiders(In 1935), Temple of Doom's plot doesn't revolve around the Nazis and takes a darker root. This time Indiana teams up with a club singer named Willie and ten year old, Asian boy named Short Round. After a treasure deal goes wrong the three escape in a plane which turns out to be a trap, causing them to do a death defying escape which ends up in India. When the village people their warn them of the mysterious temple and the horrible loss of their children, the three set off to discover the temple. The plot just gets darker and more action packed from there.Harrison Ford returns in his signature role as Indina Jones and is still the tough as nails archaeologist he was in Raiders. Short Round is a lovable and has great chemistry with Indy, and during the film he becomes one of the most memorable sidekicks ever. Willie, is a typical damsel in distress, who spends the movie screaming and moaning, but this is just a throwback to the 'B' movies, the Indiana Jones films are inspired by.From start to finish the film is filled with tons of memorable moments, classic set-pieces and amazing stunt and camera work. With a snow ball pacing that gradually gets bigger and better as it goes along, the movie is pretty much impossible not to enjoy. The score is one of the best I've heard in a film a mixed with the creative and memorable camera work, just makes the film even better and gives me chills every time.I can't stress this enough, but Temple of Doom is a must see for any fan of film. Some say it's too dark (Heart Scene)and the sillier moments ruined it(Dinner Scene), but the experience for me was never spoilt and the dark moments just made it better. With a bigger 'B' movie feel, great action, amazing set-pieces and effects and timeless feel the film gets my highest recommendation. Not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seem to recall thoroughly enjoying the first Indiana Jones film, many years ago, and the last one with Sean Connery was also immensely entertaining, as I recall. So it was without any mixed feelings that I sat down to watch Temple of Doom. It got off to a bit of a shaky start, although the Busby Berkeley routine and the singer were all worth watching: something was a little too heavy-handed for my liking, or missing. What was it? After about ten minutes I realized that it was Harrison Ford, who really is a terrible, wooden actor. i was watching the film in English, having seen the other films dubbed in German by presumably skilled actors. What a difference! But even that (and the leading lady's appallingly silly role - nothing she could do about it I guess, that was the script), shouldn't have spoiled things. What now came was the tritest and offensive (truly offensive) pile of never-ending clichés about India I could ever have imagined. Not even clichés, but downright idiotic fantasies, such as Indian's eating monkey brains, performing voodoo, etc etc. And then the depiction of Kali, the protecting mother goddess in her ferocious aspect as a king of sub-Aztec monster took the biscuit. Sure, her cult has been abused, was indeed so by the historical Thugees, but Dr Jones should have shown a little more comprehension on these matters. Add to that the invocation of Sita and Ram - anything but nasty deities in the Hindu pantheon - in the demonic gibberish chanted by the Thugees and one wonders how Hollywood wasn't nuked. Sure, this kind of film doesn't live from method acting and stereotypes can be amusing, but if Spielberg wants to teach us respect to our neighbours he would do well not to go trampling about on other people's beliefs just to produce a blockbuster. Apart from which, I found the action sequences interminably boring, lacking the kind of build up and choreography which by You only live twice should have been standard. Maybe the underground trolley ride had its moments, and the bridge sequence could have been worse, but most of it was cluttered and strangely unmotivated. All in all I found this a really dismal bit of Hollywood propaganda for Western colonialism (note: there were only nasty fanatical Indians who we should despise, or the poor and helpless who need Western help - a very familiar Hollywood scheme).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Temple of Doom was truly one of the worst things I've ever had to sit through. Somehow it seems to have hit every cliché, stereotype, and bad movie technique without meaning to, or being aware of it. The lack of any sense of shame makes it completely intolerable. The characters are all, except Indiana Jones, annoying. (Especially that kid who alway yells "Dr. Jones!") Sometimes a stupid movie can redeem itself by refusing to take itself too seriously. Sadly this does not happen here. The presentation of the "native tribe" is really pathetic. Cliché and horribly dated, even for the 1980s.The action scenes are overly long, done before, and boring. The "roller coaster" scene is completely implausible, and feels like it was designed specifically so that a video game could be produced easily.Terrible. Just terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Temple Of Doom Does Not Need My Recommendation But Receives It Anyways, Highly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of 2005, I have never seen any of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Yes, I have been living under a rock, however, I decided I was going to watch them all, and soon. I watched Raiders a few weeks ago, and now, I have finished viewing Temple Of Doom as well. I have to say that I enjoyed Temple Of Doom a tad more than Raiders Of The Lost Ark. I can not compare Last Crusade yet, but will shortly.There are many reasons I like this movie better than the first. This seemed like more of a cohesive story to me. By that, I mean Indiana does not have to cross into all kinds of different countries for all kinds of different adventures, seemingly to just fit as much in the movie as possible. Other than the opening, which is meant to introduce Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and Shorty (Jonathan Ke Quan) and bring them together with Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford). Once they are in India, they stay in India. There was plenty of trouble in the one country for them to get into.The main plot is that once Indiana and friends are stranded after a plane wreck in India, they need to get some special stones for the village. Once they find the Temple Of Doom, that is where the story really takes off and gets fun. They discover that the children of the village are slaves to the Indian Chiefs and warriors and make it a point to save them as well. Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) was a great intimidating character. This was by far his most prominent role in the U.S.For the most part, the special effects in this movie were great, with a few minor discrepancies (not bad at all for 1984). In fact, the only reason I can really see for making the 4th installment of Indiana Jones, is to use todays technology on this great series. It is bound to have some awesome looking displays. The only thing that truly annoyed me in this film was the constant screaming by Kate Capshaw's character Willie. Man, did that ever get tiresome. Overall, a great movie which does not need my recommendation but receives it highly. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indiana Jones and the tumble of doom after the first one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indiana Jones 1 and 3 are amazing films for their adventures, suspense, and treasure. I haven't seen much of the 4th one, but it's not that good. But what about Temple of doom? Well, I didn't really like it as much, and here's its problems.The plot in this is about Indiana Jones escaping from Shanghai bringing a singer and a child. They fly toward India and crash land into an Indian village where Indy learns about powerful stones and discovers an evil empire within. This movie is supposed to be a prequel to Raiders of the lost ark (which was better). We can tell its stand alone. It doesn't lead into Raiders at the end, no characters from Raiders are mentioned, and its not even important to the Indiana Jones franchise. Also, can I just mention that the plot doesn't work for Indiana Jones. Instead of getting involved in an adventure slowly but surely and even fighting the Nazis like in Raiders, they just get there by crashing a plane. That isn't a good way to get you in when it comes to Indiana Jones. It's just not executed that well. So this story is 100% bad, right? Wrong. I will give it some credit because the opening scene, while not as exciting as the one in Raiders, serves a purpose, which led to the 3 going on the plane. Plus sometimes I didn't care about the stones as much as the getting-out-of-the-temple goal in the second half. It can be enjoyable at times, but it still doesn't make up for this choppy story.The special effects in this are great like in Raiders. Its very enjoyable and is a good quality for Indiana Jones for its fun and excitement when they those stunts would come its just engaging. But one problem is that some special effects don't look too good like you can tell its filmed on a green screen. One other problem is how it gets to get so gory when that scene with the heart removed plays. So overall, the special effects in this can be really good.The characters in this movie aren't much better than the choppy story. First off, lets start with the characters I like. Indiana Jones would be one because of his bravery and un-annoyance, and a bit charm. The villains in the movie are mostly ruthless, but not as good as the Nazis (Fun fact: Temple of doom is the only Indiana Jones film with the antagonist not being based on any real life armies since the ones in Raiders and Last Crusade are Nazis while the ones in Skull were Soviets). As for the rest, Willie is the love interest with a love/hate relationship with Indy and spends lot of time screaming, making her a huge step down from Marion from Raiders. Short round is the innocent little boy who looks at Indy as a father going on this dangerous adventure. For the others, there are gangsters from the beginning, the village kids a, the royal kid who I just want to strangle like Homer strangling Bart, the list goes on. So overall, this characters aren't very good in this move other than Indy.So overall, even with the things it did do right like the good special effects and important beginning, Temple of Doom is a film that is just meh. But compared to greats like Raiders of the lost Ark and the Last crusade, its a disappointment. For Indiana Jones fans, its just a pass, or a rental if you're curious. And one last thing: Don't let your kids see it till they are 12. This is not a 2 hour Brochure to India.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering that Raiders of the Lost Ark is the most stylish, exciting family adventure film ever made, it's remarkable just how much Spielberg and Lucas lost their way on Temple of Doom.The script has little or no wit, the supporting female character is just irritating (what happened to Karen Allen?), there's casual racism galore, and the last half hour just feels like one identical piece of drawn-out tension. Despite virtually never pausing to take a breath, it's simply less interesting than Raiders because it lacks timing and intelligence.Still, it's Spielberg and Ford, so it can never be all bad, and there's usually enough going on to keep the attention. And maybe we can thank Temple of Doom for one thing; I think there's a strong chance that Spielberg decided to make the superb Last Crusade by way of an apology.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My impression was that Spielberg had finally directed a movie he didn't want to even see, let alone make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" was directed by one of the most talented men in Hollywood today, but it's very hard to tell by what has been finally put on the screen. Sure, the Steven Spielberg technique and flair is ever-present; on a technically level, the movie is superbly done. Hence why the movie's two high points, fatally placed at opposite ends of each other, do ring so powerfully, and unsuccessfully coerced me into forgiving the utter boredom that I suffered through in the middle. Spielberg's hand is present in the second Indiana Jones film, but his heart is missing.The movie gets off on the wrong foot very early on, after a rousing and clever opening sequence set in Shanghai. Then, toward the end, in a fantastic climax set upon a rickety old bridge spanning a chasm, it regains the momentum and joy of filmmaking that made "Raiders of the Lost Ark," among other Spielberg films, so strong. It is here that "Temple of Doom" accomplishes what its predecessor did: recalling the admittedly cheesy but nevertheless lovable Republic serials of the days gone by. Shootouts in big fancy casinos, with MacGuffins from opposite parties being exchanged via a turning table for drinks. Bad guys trapping our hero over a chasm, leaving him no choice but to cut the rope and take whatever chance he has left. And, in the tradition of those serials, we have crocodiles waiting at the bottom.So amazingly enough, "Temple of Doom" soars whenever it stays out of the Temple of Doom. For once Indiana Jones and his two sidekicks, and obnoxious singer (Kate Capshaw) and an kid from Shanghai (Jonathan Ke Quan) start traveling into that booby trap-filled pyramid?the point where we would expect the movie to really get moving?everything begins to drag. And although I do compliment Spielberg for delivering the movie's best moments, I also shell him some blame for accepting the screenplay handed to him. One of the best things about "Raiders of the Lost Ark" was that both Spielberg and the screenplay had the same goal. Here, they split paths. The director wanted to continue the tradition of the Republic serials; the screenwriters wanted to make a dopey mishmash of kiddy comedy and gruesome terror. Everything that takes place inside the titular temple plays against each other. It includes scenes where Kate Capshaw is served movie-Indian food (in other words, grotesque bugs that are still living) and she attempts not to gag and is then contrasted with voodoo sacrifices, where the victim's heart is, right before our eyes, ripped out, and the body is thrown into a pit of magma. The screenplay handles these negatively conflicting attitudes with no discipline, resulting in a frantic, schizophrenic demeanor.Is it not a coincidence that the two people who wrote "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom," Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, would, two years later, write the screenplay for another unpleasantly mean-spirited movie that would attempt to ram kid comedy with grotesque horror together? The hinted-at catastrophe: "Howard the Duck." That is where "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" goes so wrong: the unwillingness of the screenwriters to pick a mood and go with it. Harrison Ford is his usual charming self as the titular adventurer, but he's got nobody interesting to tag along with him. And in a movie like this, the hero can only be about as interesting as the adventure he is given to undertake. Dodging the Nazis while searching for religious artifacts worked before and after this movie, but running from voodoo practitioners and being hypnotized into nearly through a comrade into the core of the earth is not what I had in mind for an Indiana Jones adventure. The villains are memorable, but for all the wrong reasons. And his sidekicks are utterly obnoxious. It is hard to tell from this movie that Kate Capshaw is a talented actress. Her squealing and whining goes a long way and really fast. And it is no big wonder why Jonathan Ka Quan, as the little kid, never had a kickoff career. Yes, he was just a kid when making this picture, but there is none of that real spark the audience looks for in a character we're meant to root for.I wanted more of the traditional stuff when the movie goes into the temple. More booby traps, more trying to figure out how to escape, more fights where the hero has to worry more about being shot or impaled as opposed to being burned alive (because the former can be dealt with in a way that is not unpleasantly gruesome in a movie meant to be joyously enjoyable), and a lot less of the mean-spirited material we get in this installment of the series. In watching "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom," I was overcome with this horrible sensation that I never before felt about a Steven Spielberg film: he made a movie he probably would have never wanted to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as satisfying as its predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are various scenes and images in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM that are really cool: the big Hollywood song-n-dance/James Bond opening, the absurd life raft save, Indy's badass line on the bridge ("Mola Ram, prepare to meet Kali . . . IN HELL!").But they overdid it on the gross-out stuff. There are plenty of bugs and creepy-crawlies all over this movie without that awful dinner scene. I think the big problem I have with this movie is that most of it takes place in/under Pangkot Palace, when the good stuff is at either bookend. It's cool that they actually went dark for the sequel to RAIDERS, but if it's not that snot-nosed Maharaja, it's some depressing child slavery stuff. Get out of the palace and back to being an Indy movie. When they actually do that, it picks back up. I have no problem with darkness, but I couldn't wait to get out of there. It drags down the movie a bit.6.5/10Also: Short Round was my favorite thing about this movie. And Harrison Ford and Ke Huy Quan have terrific chemistry together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scabby and unbalanced rollock along the lines of Raiders of the Lost Ark, only without a truer tone and as much of a kick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We like bits of Steven Spielberg's 1984 sequel to his highly enjoyable Raiders of the Lost Ark -the nice bits, the pleasant bits; the bits like the mine cart chase or the humorous escape from a room containing a ceiling full of spikes slowly making its way down onto of the now titular lead and his junior sidekick. As strange as it sounds, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is very much the sort of film in which a ceiling of spikes descending and threatening to impale its hapless characters is qualified to be a pleasant excursion from proceedings. Around content such as this, a rather grotesque spectacle of third-world Asian rituals; corridors of insects and child slavery uneasily unfolds in tow with what ought to be a straight-forward enough, linearly told adventure film worthy of a good crack as was overtly evident in the last film. There is one instance, involving a centuries old cult gathering, featuring much peril and pain which leads one character to reiterate that "nobody has seen this for (about) a hundred years...." ? we get to see one and a half of what the guy's talking about in about ten minutes, and it still wasn't a pleasure.On the one had, and pleasingly so, Spielberg's film cannot help itself; it is so preoccupied with moving onwards and upwards to a fresh set piece or instance of great surprise or action that it cannot be reprimanded for dwelling too much on its instances of great repulsion. Its narrative is weak, but its general sense of spectacle and show is second to very few; its obsession with doing its utmost to try and take its viewer's breath away, or coercing one into exhaling deeply when it is evident peril has been averted for the time being, somewhat infectious. There is a moment nearer the end when we're led into thinking the way out of a proverbial Hell for the leads lies with a hole in a mineshaft wall beyond yonder, but it is revealed when they get there that the exit is merely the access to a thousand yard drop ? and the few hundred tons of water hot on their tails has got to flow into somewhere....The film begins in 1930s China, and rather inexplicably with a dance number following a neat reference to the old Rank studios ident in the form of a gentleman sounding a gong. During the dance number, we cannot get a lock on what it is the primary female performer is singing, such is the language barrier, but we catch the lyric "anything goes...." plus her wink to the camera - effectively the film announcing that the rule book is out the window and you're now in LucasFilm's domain. Jones, played by Harrison Ford, in what is to most his seminal career role, is milling around; speaking Mandarin and dealing with some shady looking locals whilst keeping a cool head in amidst the chaos which eventually erupts. In doing business there, he picks up an American lounge singer; a certain Willie Scott (Capshaw), who's famous enough for some random British docks merchant in the area to know whom she is, but is ultimately a gold digging, vanity subscribing annoyance whose presence pales in comparison to Allen's Marion character three years previously. Jones and Willie's initial coming together is wholly representative of how their overall tie will unfold; that is to say, her inherent goofiness playing out along side his suaveness as he does what he does.Fumbling out of China and crash-landing into the wilds of India, Jones; Scott and his miniature Chinese accomplice named Short Round (Ke Quan) happen upon a desolate village, whom charge him with heading out of his way to retrieve a sacred stone stolen from them as well as rescue the village's child population whom were additionally taken. Later on, one of the missing children actually survives the long trek back to the village after an escape, in what is a visual indication of the off screen enemy and the looming brutality of their nature. Accepting the proposal to investigate, the trio arrive at a local palace in amidst the hotbed of the apparent nastiness; a place occupied by Oxford-educated locals doing well to elevate the somewhat damning representation of Indians as these backward, mythicism subscribing kooks, but a happening which further still carries with it grizzly underbellies of unfortunate wrongful representation.The film is essentially a LucasFilm show-reel, a showing off of numerous illusions and gimmicks formulating into a number of set pieces running on wafer-thin plotting; a welcoming, via that more than revealing fourth wall breaking opening wink, into the Spielberg theme-park of tricks; ghost trains and rollercoasters best encapsulated when a roller-coaster point of view composition on the front of one of the carts involved in the later mine chase dominates screen time for a good fifteen seconds. It is nothing like Radiers of the Lost Ark, and yet has inherently similar characteristics with said film; those exchanges then were fun and full of glee, these are just wacky and off the reigns ? often disgusting. The women are not as strong, the sense of adventure as characters charged around the globe thwarting evil feels less present and the entire exercise has an unwelcome sense of unbalance about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth an Indiana Jones movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing raiders of the lost ark and the last crusade, I had great hopes from this movie. But was clearly disappointed. Neither the humor nor the excitement matches the other two movies in the series. Also, the pattern seems to repeat and the novelty seems to have disappeared in this movie. Also, the Indian tribe seems a lot over exaggerated and neither funny nor scary. It was only uninteresting and boring to say the least. However, as you would expect in a Spielberg movie, the movie has its moments, though they are few. Amrish Puri is far better in the Shyam Benegal or Govind Nihalani movies. Roshan Seth's role is minuscule. Ford is good as usual. Overall a disappointing movie. I would rather watch an E.T or Raiders of the last ark to enjoy a Spielberg movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a huge stepdown from raiders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After raiders of the lost ark was a superb film this was a very anticipated film for me bit boy does it disappoint. This is a prequel to raiders and it sees indiana Jones and his gang attempt to retrieve a stone for a local tribe while battling evil forces. Now as always Harrison ford returns as Indiana Jones and he is still fantastic with his macho charismatic style that makes this character legendary and one of the best of all time. Unfortunately Harrison ford takes all the acting talent in this film and leaves none for the side characters. Singer willey Scott comes in as his love interest and all she does is scream and shriek and she is just plainly irritating making me wish Marion had returned. A controversial one is the kid short round who most young kids and girls like but I cannot stand him and he is just an irritating side character and I wish either salah or Marcus Brody had been in this film. The villains are also ridiculously over the top and really don't provide any entertainment at all and they don't have any interest at all. The story is okay looking into the supernatural effect and the simplicity of like a treasure hunt. However, I wish they had something involving the Nazis instead of the weird villains in this film. The script is okay with ford doing a great job with his dialogue but nobody elses dialogue is interesting at all and it is just boring like the other characters in this film. The style of Indiana Jones is legendary with the hat, whip and music being awesome. But the setting of the film and the villains really brings it down in my opinion. This is an average film that really disappoints me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas again tries to go "dark" in the second installment of one of his series. And, screws up again! "The Empire Strikes Back" is a great movie that all-but-permanently took the fun out of the "Star Wars" saga. But, at least it was dark and a great movie!On the other hand, "Temple of Doom" is just plain dark. There is little to no fun here, and only the brainless action of the ending kind-of-sort-of redeems it. Spielberg was three years past the point where he made great movies (yes, "Raiders" was the end). Here, he just directs a big, bloated, brainless train wreck that permanently neutered the Indiana Jones series.John Williams crafts an excellent score, but can in no way redeem the rank stupidity of this movie.**** (Four out of Ten Stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great imagination but the acting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything was good except for the acting and some of the stereotypes. Spoiler: Negatives: The foremost villain was plainly stupid, except the part when he rips the victim's heart from his/her chest. The guy look like a devilish monk. The idea about the Indian children eating monkeys and acting like savages was totally ludicrous. One stupid idea was the voodoo doll. Wassup with that! And oh my god, the actress that plays Willie! The only thing she's good for is, hmm... whine and cry every time her poor-heroic boyfriend is in danger or hurt. All she does is scream, repeatedly say "Oh god!" She definitely can't act! She tries too damn hard! I really wanted to throw this DVD disk at the wall because of her. Stephen Spielberg could have selected a better actress. Last but not least, the atmosphere is to light-hearted. I mean it's not realistic and it's too cartoony and elementary, despite the fact it is obviously a kid's movie. But wait isn't it? The movie has some abusive action towards children like: slave drivers beating little children and well yes, the 'Indian' children are slaves. I seriously believe that India feels absolutely humiliated when this movie first came out but what I heard, India forbid this movie to show in theaters. Positives: Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones) was pretty good at his role! The little kid was also great! That's mainly it. I haven't seen the other sequels just yet but I heard the others were way better than this. If this is true, this means that George Lucas lost his touch, once again. Well it is a certain that I don't like this movie very much. I did like it when i was eleven but the only thing that interest me was the ending. Now since I grew older and became more concerned and aware about the plot, graphics, and offensive stereotypes, my liking to this movie has suddenly dropped. But if you enjoy dark-adventurous, light-hearted movies well this is one of for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weakest of the Indiana Jones movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the weakest of the three Indy feature films. When they release the fourth film it will lose this title. The plot this time sees a sacred stone stolen from an Indian village. Indy agrees to find the stone and return it to the rightful owners. The film doesn't have quite the same feel good factor as the first and third installments. The female lead isn't anything like as good either this time out and you get the feeling that maybe she was sleeping with the director to get the part. There's enough action to keep most people entertained for a couple of hours though. I suspect this DVD will be the one that most people play once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a real disappointment after the enjoyable excesses of the "Raiders of the Lost Ark". There is a mere apology of a plot, and the film is essentially a series of disjointed action pieces. There is also unnecessarily vulgarity in several scenes. Fortunately the makers evidently realised their mistake and decided to give "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" a plot.This film is a good illustration of much of what is wrong with modern films. The emphasis is on action, to the exclusion of a credible plot. More seriously, it contains sexual references which are inappropriate in a film which appears in some other respects designed for pre-teenage children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Abuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard a lot of distressing reports of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" and had been warned not to see it. I love "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and thoroughly enjoyed "The Last Crusade," but it was "Temple of Doom's" PG rating that attracted me. There was no PG-13 rating then, yet even by today's standards it should be rated R. The last thirty minutes contain great action even by the standards of directing legend Steven Spielberg, but there is no suspension of disbelief. Far too much damage has been done by that time.It is structured in four segments: neat and fun; irritating and boring; reviling and sick; and irrelevant. It is essentially half-trash, half-silver. The affair would be better if all the silver existed in one place, but most of it arrives after the movie has crossed the point of no return. Even without the lofty standards placed by "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is a bad movie.The opening Shanghai club fight and street chase introduce us to Indiana's (Harrison Ford) partners for the movie: Chinese youth Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) and club dancer and singer Willie Scott, the character who falls short. Another reason for their inclusion is pace. Once the movie shifts to its main location of India, there is no action for more than an hour.At this point, they learn from the elder of a nearby village that a long-extinct occult may have been revived by the residents of a nearby palace. Indy's curiosity is roused when he realizes that a legendary stone may be there. Since he, Willie and Short Round need to visit there anyway, Indy decides to investigate."Raiders of the Lost Ark's" Marion Ravenwood shared most of Indiana's good qualities: bravery, resourcefulness, wit, toughness, and so on. Her mixture of happiness and disdain at seeing Indiana, followed by her defiance towards the Nazi task force characterize her before story shifts to its main destination. Willie made me want to throw a brick through the screen, but then I remembered that I could not kill her by doing that. Her main function is to scream, whine about every little inconvenience and scream more. Granted, I would probably be complaining if I was in that situation, but not about *everything.* I certainly would not be as loud and incessant as she.Willie is not the biggest problem, especially since her behavior is far more palatable once the trio enters the Temple of Doom. It is the first 25 minutes of that second hour that behead the movie. It dives headlong into revolting territory. The most famous instance comes first. Occult leader Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) cleanly removes the heart of a human sacrifice victim. Still alive, he is lowered into the pit while begging Shiva for deliverance. My ability to suspend disbelief was not merely broken when I saw that; it was shattered like car window glass. My desire to be entertained by the movie was not far behind.The problem grows worse once the movie introduces forced child labor complete with sadistic slave-drivers and their scourge-whips. Spielberg does not merely gloss over this. We see the guards punish children no more than ten for tripping or walking too slowly. That is not all. Upon Indy's capture, he is forced to drink blood that will supposedly hypnotize him. If any suspension of disbelief remained by then, it would have been nuked. This comes complete with a graphic whipping scene that goes *way* too far for a PG rating. Scabbed lines on Indiana's back and his bloody shirt are later visible. Finally, an Indiana voodoo doll is stabbed by another hypnotized child (Raj Singh). Children saw this movie in theaters! Spielberg and writer George Lucas decided to include all of the distasteful material. They should have taken it all the way. Mola Ram dies while being pulled apart by competing crocodiles, but the visuals are not nearly graphic enough to satisfy. "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" stretches itself way too far to get away with a using a neutered portrayal here. When a character is the most evil man on the planet, he needs to have the most gruesome and degrading death in the movie, end of discussion.Lucas wanted a darker feel after the success of "The Empire Strikes Back." The most upsetting scene in that movie is Darth Vader's force strangulation. That would be so mild in "Temple of Doom" that it would pass without notice. Actually, this is the only Indiana Jones movie to date where the signature action is decisive. The Holy Grail, the Ark, and the Crystal Skull took care of themselves. This movie's victory is most complete. John Williams' theme combined with the cheering of the villagers could have made for a rousing conclusion. I no longer cared. With so many poor decisions in its making, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" cannot rate higher than a three of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Disappointing Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was another disappointing sequel in the 80's. After the first Indiana Jones film, I was really looking forward to this one, but it was hardly worth seeing. Kate Capshaw's role and script were horrendous, completely silly, useless, and unsympathetic. The movie was actually depressing; it was very dark and more like a not-very-good horror film. It appeared they were trying to copy the Conan movie settings and stories, which was inappropriate for the Indiana Jones persona established in Raiders of the Lost Ark. The mine car scene continued a long time past the point at which it became boring, and the filming of it made it look just like an amusement park ride. Altogether, this is a pretty bad movie, and I do not expect to watch it again.There was one humorous item: the nightclub in the opening sequence is called Club Obi Wan, a reference to Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An improvement on Raiders? Don't make me laugh. The over the top feel, the corny dialogue, the kiddy focus, the lack of dramatic context for the action and the weak and superficial attempt at mythology are all forgivable in a movie such as this.What is harder to take is the appalling disrespect shown to Indian culture. As one reviewer here has noted, all Indians in this film are either demonic (i.e. soulless) bad guys or waiting for a westerner to save them. The only other use Spielberg finds Indian culture serves is to disgust us with entirely fabricated depictions of people eating monkey brains and beetles.Kate Capshaw's character also deserves singling out, it seems that the only purpose women serve in this film is to be mothers to children (the women in the village), to complain when they break a nail, but mostly, to scream very loudly, and engage in sexual banter with the lead.But hey, all of these are peripheral issues for what is an action movie.What really bites is just how slipshod some of the direction, but especially the editing of some key action scenes were. The fight to save KC from being dropped into the lava makes absolutely no sense. If we look at it, Short-round in one cut must dispose of about 6 massive bad-guys AND wedge the pulley to account for what we are shown next. But we see NONE of this. We have to imagine it for ourselves, which is asking a lot, if you are over 10.This kind of slipshod editing/direction occurs several times during the movie, and is really the reason why people say this movie is inferior to Raiders, and Last Crusade. It has nothing to do with any 'darker' feel to this picture compared to Raiders, which is something I personally just don't recognise. It's the quality of the action, editing and continuity that made Raiders in particular such a special action film. We can suspend our disbelief in many ways, but, if the action doesn't hold together cinematically (let alone create an illusion of material realism), the film fails.Also to many modern eyes, some of the special (even basic ones) effects will appear remarkably crude, even accounting for the fact the film was made 25 odd years ago.Luckily the film provides us at least one magic moment that reminds us what good action movies are all about. The chase on the mine cart is a simple idea that is brilliantly edited, humorous and exciting, and satisfying in almost every way an action sequence can be.There are many other good moments in this film too, but this is the only one that isn't in some way spoilt by any of the reservations people have about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gory and indulgently sadistic sequel (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Raiders of the Lost Ark", it was decided that the character of Indiana Jones was deserving of a sequel. But director Steven Spielberg was unsure as to how to make it: should this new film be completely different, or follow the exact same formula as its predecessor? The end result is a little of both. The basic plot is the same (Jones wresting an artefact with mystical powers from sinister evil-doers) but the villains and the settings are completely different. More crucially, the violence and sadism in "Raiders" has been multiplied tenfold for "Temple of Doom". This movie saw the creation of the PG-13 certificate in the United States, but with a bit of trimming it passed for a PG certificate here.The film is a prequel, set in 1935 (a year before the events of "Raiders") and the film opens in a Chinese nightclub, where singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) belts out a Chinese version of Cole Porter's "Anything Goes". Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) arrives to make a deal with a Chinese gangster (Lao Che) that quickly goes awry and the club descends into chaos. With Willie's help, Jones gets out in one piece and the pair of them escape from Lao Che on board a plane, along with Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), the archeaologist's pint-sized sidekick.The plane is forced to crash-land, so Jones and his friends escape via inflatable life-raft to end up somewhere in India. A local shaman (D.R. Nanayakkara) leads them to a village where the children have been kidnapped and the surviving adults are enduring poverty and despair. Jones is commanded to find the children and a sacred rock (which will restore prosperity to the village) from the Palace of Pankot, now over-run by evil...The Indiana Jones films received alot of criticism from their stereotypical portrayal of Third World peoples. The cause of this is never more apparent than in "Temple of Doom", where the Indian natives are portrayed as pitiable and in need of help from the white man saviour. When our heroes reach the Palace, there is an elaborate dinner scene where cockroaches, snake intestines and monkey brains are served up as delicacies. Through Willie and Short Round's reactions, the audience is invited to both laugh at and be disgusted at this natural ritual. The villains this time are the Kali-worshipping Thuggee cult and they are shown as a far more gleeful, nastier bunch than the German Nazis in "Raiders". Having said that, most of this merely serves the story and is clearly NOT intended to be a generalised or realistic depiction of India.Another complaint levelled at this film was the violence, some of which is considerably vivid for a family action film. To be fair most of it is done in a fun and knockabout slapstick way but the scene which caused furore (and which is unnecessarily graphic) is the human sacrifice scene where a man gets his heart ripped out and stays alive long enough to be burnt to death. As for the performances, Harrison Ford settles back into the role of Jones as though he'd never left it and delivers his usual ruggedly charming performance. Kate Capshaw's Willie is an unashamed clueless bimbo, but she still manages to be funny and sexy, even if her constant screaming eventually becomes wearisome. Ke Huy Quan is a likeable, streetwise and resourceful Short Round, and makes for a good surrogate son for the hero. Amrish Puri doesn't have much screen time, but he uses it well as the Thuggees' sadistic leader.Perhaps too over-indulgent in its violence and racial stereotyping, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is still exciting and enjoyble but remains the weakest of the Indiana Jones trilogy.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was disappointed with the script, the supporting cast, and many of the stunts. That said, Harrison Ford proves that he can belong in any movie no matter how bad it is.Beyond the opening Lao Che sequence, the story is contrived and surprisingly dull. I thought Capshaw was effectively annoying, but there was very little beyond her veneer that made me want to care what happened to her. This is true for many of the other characters as well. The whole thing seems rather childish, as if adult emotions do not exist. I got the feeling I was watching a hyped-up version of another Spielberg movie, "The Goonies", an adolescent adventure movie."Doom" lacks the irreverent humor, the excitement, and the audacity of the other two movies in this series. I wish they could go back and fix it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg and Kennedy Should Take This One Off Their Résumés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 11 years old when this film came out and loved it. What else was there to do in the summer but anticipate the new blockbuster that everyone was talking about?But, unfortunately, as the years have passed, Temple of Doom has become unwatchable. While both Raiders and Last Crusade both got by with suspending our beliefs while we immerse ourselves in fantasy, Temple of Doom did it through horrible continuity, sexism, and cheese. Thank god it is not the trend for George Lucas, but it certainly seems to be for Kathleen Kennedy and Steve.When people approach me and ask, "I'd like to be an annoying film 'nitpicker' like you!" I tell them to start off with Temple of Doom. The jump cut to cut ratio is higher in this film than any other I've ever seen. A great example of poor direction and even worse cinematography. My apologies to veteran, Doug Slocombe. I don't blame him. Kathleen and Steve should have known better.The audio in this film, however, is stellar. In the non-digital, ambience rooms as big as a GM factory, pre-ProTools age, the ADR is this film is all but invisible and the design would be top of the line even today. The audio production smudged (while still not able to solve) the film's continuity and production errors beautifully. Events not in the primary focus were still audible while not trampling on the foreground. Hats off to Ben Burtt and his crew for salvaging this painful film. Hopefully Ben can regain his talent for Episode 2 . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Since when do Indian's speak in Sinhalese??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me be honest, I'm not a big fan of Indiana Jones, well I actually don't like it all, the matter of fact I actually covered my eyes during for some parts of the film. I had to watch the film due to a bet with my boyfriend "for every Pokémon movie, one Indiana Jones movie". So I guess you've understood what kind of films I prefer. Anyway, while watching "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" I was shocked to see some actors from Sri Lanka and even more freaked out to hear them speak Sinhalese. After a few seconds I had to pause the film because I had a question. Didn't Indi and the others fall above the Himalayan mountains?? Isn't it suppose to be in India?? Well the film review says that the village is located in India and also during the film they talk about India but then how come the village people speak in Sinhalese??OK, so I'm sure that Mr. Steven Spielberg wanted to keep a low budgets so he got some actors from Sri Lanka (ex Ceylon) but did he really have to let them speak in Sinhalese?? Couldn't he dub it in Indian?? Sinhalese is a language spoken by Sinhalese people and Sinhalese people live in Sri Lankan and being a Sri Lankan I'm pretty sure that there is no village in India that speaks Sinhalese instead of their mother language.Well I guess they didn't do their home work before they started making the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indiana takes on the vilest of enemies...Child enslavers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indian Jones fights an enemy far worse than any he has encountered thus far, the Indians that enslave children for labor.The hero is thrust into the heart of India to fight the followers of the local religion that allows for the capture and enslavement of the village's children to fulfill the Indian's religious objectives. Since these enemies are so evil the movie seems more fun as Indian Jones keeps fighting and defeating these foes.This film although meant as a "fun" adventure movie contains scenes which are gross, disturbing or vile like the monkey brain eating scene, child slavery scenes, the religious torture scene (heart ripped out) to name a few. May not be suitable for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg on devilishly OTT form!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to the long mooted and eventual release of part 4, Temple Of Doom was often thought of as the weakest part of the series, yet it actually appears to me to be maturing nicely with age. With honest appraisal I see the only crime that Temple Of Doom can be charged with is is not being as good as Raiders Of The Lost Ark. But since few films can match that movie's classic status I find it churlish to do the second film down for it.Temple Of Doom is a frenetic roller-coaster ride, full of enough crash bang wallop fit to grace any action adventure in the history of cinema. The set pieces are pure outrageous fun; life raft escape from a crashing plane, mine cart thrill ride &amp; a bridge sequence that is pure boys own brilliance. And while the film finds Spielberg cramming the action with a darkly sinister streak (hence the PG13 rating), we find that the fun still far outweighs any horror that junior viewers might get from certain scenes.The film also finds Ford giving his best performance as Indiana Jones since the plot calls for a more humane Jones. In fine physical shape, his witty interplay with Short Round is coupled with a textured feel of friendship that plays real well up on the screen. Kate Capshaw was always going to struggle to get close to Karen Allen's wonderful turn as Marion Ravenwood in Raiders, for where Marion was feisty and tough, Capshaw's Willie Scott is more scare-d-cat and reliant on Indy's guile to save her from peril, but she does OK and looks gorgeous into the bargain.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was a massive hit at the box-office and firmly bought Spielberg the time to then go out and make two dramas in Empire of the Sun (1987) &amp; The Color Purple (1985). He would then return with the third Indiana film to finish what was then a marvellous trilogy; of which Temple Of Doom is the prime piece of meat in the delightful (original) trilogy sandwich. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PG 13 Hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>INDIANA JONE AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is the film that basically gave birth to the creatively stifling PG-13 rating that's been the bane of the movie industry ever since. When TEMPLE OF DOOM was released, many complained that the film was too violent for a PG-rated film and the MPAA subsequently created the PG-13 rating to calm parents and watchdogs. Now, ever since its implementation movies have basically sucked. R-rated films, which were common in the 1970s and early 1980s, suddenly started disappearing from theater screens as Hollywood preferred having/making films for 12 year old boys than creating amazing thought provoking films that often end up being rated R, whether it's for bad language, violence or sex or simply because of its subject matter. The quality of movies has been going downhill since then and today movies are mostly disposable junk, peddled endlessly to young boys who know very little about quality acting, storytelling or emotions. And it's all thanks to INDIANA JONE AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM.As for the movie itself, I recently watched it in Hi-Def and it's as embarrassing today as it was when it was originally released. Terrible script, terrible acting, terribly forced action with a racist tone to it all. And to think RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was/is such a brilliant action film, which I also saw on Hi-Def and still holds up beautiful today.PG-13 Hell indeed!</fullReview>

Of course everybody always rates the first movie in a trilogy the best - like Godfather I and Star Wars(the original 1977 movie), but clearly the films that followed them were better, as is the case with this one. I saw this film about 20 times as a kid and have recently watched all 3 movies again, enjoying this one the best.

		<shortDescription>This is a GOOD movie...you people need to get over yourselves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it very humorous when self-acclaimed critics try to rate a movie. For one, most of you don't know what you are talking about, and second, most of you are biased.After talking to many of my friends, I found out that many didn't like the Temple of Doom simply because it didn't stick along the same lines as the other two (Judeo-Christian beliefs). God forbid that people should be exposed to other cultures and religion. After hearing this response from my friends, I became infuriated and realized that's why most people probably didn't like this film. It infringed on their own beliefs and ideals. You people need to wake up and see films open-mindedly.Ranting aside, I liked this film and it rates better than most movies today and in the past. It is action packed and has beautiful scenery and props. It also has a magnificent score by the maestro himself, John Williams, but would you expect any less? It is definitely darker than the other 2 in the trilogy, and may be frightening to children under 10.For those who are not open-minded and will only watch Indy films that follow the "Judeo-Christian" belief system, this film is not for you. However, if you are not close-minded and enjoy watching GOOD films, then this is for you. I give the film an 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This sequel, an inferior film... I think not!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people think that sequels are just another way to make money, and maybe they are. But just because it's a sequel doesn't mean it is a pointless movie. In my own opinion, I thought this was the best Indiana Jones film yet. I found the action sequences much more appealing and the comedic performances hilarious! Kate Kapshaw joins the cast in this brilliant film which is directed by her husband Steven Spielberg and is written by George Lucas. Kate plays Willie, a singing showgirl. She joins Harrison Ford (who reprises his role as archeologist Indiana Jones)in this film about searching for a tribes kidnapped children. She shows much comedic relief as her whiny character, and although some people find her irritating in her role I found that she was the one thing missing from the original "Raiders of the Lost Ark".In all the Joneses films, the opening sequences are always the most gripping part of the movie. In the original, Ford is searching for a historical statue in a booby-trapped cave. In the third, young Indy is pursued by a bunch of menacing men atop a circus train. But in this one he isn't just in one place. He is at first in a clubroom with a shoot out,and then escapes with Willie and Shorty (an annoying Japanese boy)onto a plane. Later before the plane crashes they escape on an inflatable boat, slide down a mountain and then land in rapids. If that is not action then what is?As you know, Indy hates snakes, and so do I. That could possibly be another reason why I like this one inparticular. There is only one scene with snakes (it's at a dinner party where they serve repulsive dishes), and after that they do not appear again. Sometime soon they are going to start shooting an "Indiana Jones 4". Harrison Ford has agreed to do the film and hopefully Spielberg will direct once again. The only thing I could hope for more is for Kate to come back as Willie, but what are the chances of Indy being with the same girl in two different movies? God forbid!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guess what? After seeing "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", I don't feel sorry when I did some really stupid bad thing--because I realized that even great director or producer or actor did bad job too. That makes me feel better.This movie is silly: 1. The geographical mistakes. One example is when the airplane fly from Shanghai to Chongqin I saw Great Wall on the ground--but there is no way you will see Great Wall on that course. And then suddenly they crashed on some snow mountain and Jones said its India. I felt no adventure but ridiculous. There is a lot these kind of mistakes that only show one thing--the makers had no respect of their job.2. The lady. Why Jones had to take that silly girl with him? Isn't that easier that he run away by himself (and the boy--oh that's another question) ? Maybe there was a reason but I didn't see it and I won't see this movie again I swear so I will never find out. Maybe he just needed a woman--I mean the director needed a woman but he couldn't be bothered to find a better way bringing her in the story.3. The overdone action. Maybe I am just spoiled by latest action movies like Speed or Crouching Tiger or The Matrix, but wait a minute, why I never tired of Star Wars? Because the action scenes in this one are meaningless, unoriginal and unemotional. I won't describe them here because they were all over the movie I am going to over 1000 words.I like Lucas, Spielberg and Ford, I am a Sci-Fi and Star Wars fan. I just couldn't stand these great people did such a bad movie.The only good thing of this movie I've already mentioned in the first paragraph, that's the reason I give it 1 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tone nearly dooms Temple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot; Archaeologist Indiana Jones, his spunky young sidekick and a spoiled singer travel across--and beneath--India in search of a magical stone that can save a dying village.I think it's fair to say that this is the most contentious entry in the Indiana Jones saga. The general consensus (I believe) is that Raiders and Crusade are viewed as classics and Crystal Skull... isn't. But even though Temple of Doom sports a 7.6 IMDb rating and a %85 score on Rotten Tomatoes, I don't think anyone would disagree that it doesn't share that near universal love that ROTLA and TLC do. Passions run deep on both sides, though, as TOD has more than its share of hardcore fans and champions. Personally I'd always found TOD a flawed film, but not fatally so. For sure Willie Scott is no Marion Ravenwood, though I think the problem lies more with the character's conception, not its execution. The lovely Kate Capshaw gives a good performance of a character I just don't like. I see the logic in making her the anti-Marion, but it just doesn't work here. The film also lacks the globe-trotting scope and scale of its bookends, feeling claustrophobic as it spends a good 2/3 of its runtime indoors; particularly in tight, dark confines. The tone is also off for me. Many often describe it as "dark", but I don't see it, unless they mean the cinematography. The actual tone too often borders on camp, with "humor" that is too broad and on the nose.There's still an awful lot to like here, though. I realize now that I've come full circle on the character of Short Round, finding him a fun an engaging Robin to Indy's Batman. I don't think he'd have worked in Raiders or Crusade, but he works just fine here, and Jonathan Ke Quan deserves all the credit. There are also a number of fun action scenes, from the opening scrum for the poison antidote to the white-knuckle mine car chase.So, a lot works, but a lot also doesn't. It leaves Temple of Doom an uneven viewing experience for me, and a film that is difficult to reconcile my feelings for. Still, I suppose my initial feeling that it was "flawed, but not fatally so" still stands, though on slightly more wobbly legs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A childish film that is not for children, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is the least by far of the four Indiana Jones movies. However, the opening sequences are terrific, and the film promises at first to become a first-rate sequel. Willie Scott, a cabaret singer working in Shanghai, sings "Anything Goes" in Chinese, backed by a glittering bevy of Asian chorus girls, while the main titles play in an around them. Moments later, Willie and Indiana Jones are sliding around the dance floor searching for an enormous diamond and a vial of poison antidote, while guns blaze, patrons flee, and a huge bucket of ice spills across the floor. Jones, Willie, and Jones's young sidekick, Short Round, soon find themselves aboard a plane heading across snowy peaks in a scene reminiscent of "Lost Horizon." The action is breathless and exciting, but once the threesome returns to earth, the film crash lands as well.The sequences in an Indian cult temple are gruesome at best; there is nothing entertaining in watching a heart plucked out or a man incinerated in a blazing cauldron. While the feast of the creepy crawlies is amusing at first, watching the guests of a boy Rajah relish live eels, suck out huge beetles, or sip eye-ball soup wears thin after awhile, especially with Willie mugging shamelessly throughout. However, Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones, first, last, and always; and he manages to stand above the mess and emerge unscathed. On the other hand, Kate Capshaw as Willie is either giving a bad performance as a badly written character or doing what the director directed with a badly written character. Whatever, Willie is annoying, girlishly silly, talks of broken fingernails, screams at bugs and snakes, and single-handedly sets feminism back a century; viewers will long for Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood. The addition of Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round is inexplicable and adds little to the film. Indiana Jones does not need children or dumb blondes; he needs Marion Ravenwood, Sallah, Dr. Marcus Brody, and Professor Henry Jones.Fortunately, the Indiana Jones saga regained its footing with the next episode, "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," because, other than a terrific opening, this misfire sequel could have put the nails in the intrepid archaeologist's coffin. The film certainly did nothing for Capshaw's career, as a glance at her resume will indicate, and Short Round's followup filmography was also quite short. Of course, book ended by two vastly superior films, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is hard to ignore, but, aside from an initial viewing for complete-ists, it is not as repeatable as the other Indiana Jones films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not vintage Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose it is always difficult following up a huge hit, but lets face it, Mr Lucas has done it before (The Empire Strikes Back being miles better than Star Wars). Unfortunately, Messrs Lucas and Spielberg appear to have left their sense of humour at home when they made `Temple'.The film lack atmosphere and the attempts at humour often fall flat. Even the creepy-crawly quotient seems to try to out-do `Raiders' but ends up being silly. The film isn't without it's good points, being mainly Ford's hugely watchable Jones and his kid side-kick Short Round is good fun. The stunts are good, even if they occasionally stretch credulity to breaking point (did all that water really come out of that pot?). However, when push-comes-to-shove, this isn't vintage Spielberg. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When sequel and excess makes success ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not one ounce of believability in any of the frames from "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", no situation we can relate to, no credible character. Yet what sounds like a weakness might be the film's greatest asset and what most contributed its success, besides the name of the director, the titular hero and the fact that it was the second opus of the highest-grossing film made three years before."Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is perhaps the most cinematic movie ever made, and it's not surprising that Steven Spielberg directed it, the fans will love him and the haters will hate him even more after watching "Doom". Of course, chances are that the fans would still prefer "Raiders of the Lost Ark", but why? Was it more realistic or less fantastic? Was the portrayal of all the Germans as cruel and cunning Nazis more acceptable than Hindus as monkey-brains eaters or Satanist-cult followers? No, sir, if "Doom" has at least one merit is to confront the fans to the fact that "Indiana Jones" is a series not to be taken seriously.And Spielberg follows this pattern with a delightful sense of excess, to the point that the film constantly flirts with parody. Indy is cooler and funnier, the obligatory female element incarnated by the screaming nightclub singer Willie (Kate Capshaw) whose status set the fights of feminism many decades back (thanks 'Watchmojo') and Round-Trip, the Chinese boy, a sidekick who could have been an annoying comic relief if it wasn't for his heart-breaking "I love you, Indy" near the end. Spielberg was dying to make an adventure of "Tintin", but before the dream would come true 27 years after, and because of the passing of Herge in 1983, his reference to Tintin's friend Chang was his wink to the Master.And I like to see Round-Trip (rememeber, he was the geeky Data in "The Goonies") as Spielberg's allegiance to Tintin, to Herge's paternity, although there was already some Tintinesque stuff in "Raiders of the Lost Ark". But "Doom" borrows more from the earlier Tintin's albums: the mission, set in India, is rather simplistic, taking back a sacred stone stolen from a village of poor peasants, who lost all their children in the process. Indy discovers later that they were enslaved in a mysterious temple ruled by an evil Thuggee priest. Indeed, even by Tintin's standards, the film is rudimentary. But at least, it never lies about its premise. Right from the beginning, in Shanghai's ballroom scene, the film shows some glimpses of comedy and even slapstick totally absent from the first film.It's pretty obvious that Harrison Ford grew more confidence toward his character, as he did with his no-less iconic Han Solo. Ford portrays Indy as if he knew he was exposing his aura to a group of old friends who missed him after a three-year absence, and this is exactly what Spielberg does. The references to the first film includes also the hat signature shot, I would have loved to see a parody where the hand gets crushed under the door for once. And right near the end, Jones tries to reprise his gun' trick against the evil Army, until he realizes he has no gun, it doesn't work but the gag does. The comedy is really a relief after so many actions scenes, and 'Indiana Jones' is a character that can't do without comedy. It's the alibi of its deliberate campiness.But this leads me to the key element that make the film worth to watch, an abundance of action scenes, it's like "Aliens" for "Alien", it simply never stops, apart from a few romantic interludes or the infamous dinner scene meant to let the viewers catch their breath or digest their popcorn, (well, I don't think they'd eat anything during that part) the film is pure thrills from beginning to end, from the snow sequence to the cart mine chase, with a longer trip in the disturbing temple, that might discomfort some younger viewers. If not the best, "Doom" definitely deserves the title of "creepiest" movie of the franchise, establishing Spielberg's craftsmanship when it comes to inspire us very specific reactions.I had the feeling that the film was maybe too intense but after a second thought, I understood the following point, since it's deprived from any intellectual substance, "Doom" couldn't be anything but an action film, and Spielberg knew that. A character like Willie, whose existence is due to Spielberg's marriage with Kate Capshaw, had only one purpose: being saved by Indy (and saving his life once) therefore, danger had to be everywhere, but I wonder if he wasn't tempted to let her drop in that mountain of lava. At least, Round Trip had some skills, and we'll never thank him enough for saving Indy.Anyway, "Temple of Doom" is the film the word 'spectacular' has been invented for, it's very telling when the most impressive action sequence isn't the climax, although the bridge scene is pretty memorable, it wasn't as thrilling and heart-pounding as the escape on the cart mine with the water playing the role of the infamous boulder. Roger Ebert called it a 'forearm bruiser' referring to the fact that your girlfriend would grab your arm several times, well, I didn't see in the movie theaters, but I understand why the film was the highest grossing. The rest of it, analysis of accuracies and all that stuff is just as superficial and futile as the object of their accusation.Again, would you take seriously a film whose final gag is an elephant splashing water at a kissing couple? It's obviously cartoons' stuff, but that's what "Doom" is, a great live-action cartoon, and just because it doesn't have the pretension to be anything else, I give it a slight edge over "Raiders of the Lost Ark".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indy's Formula Still Works, Although the Temple Waters it Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A divisive chapter among fans of the series, Temple of Doom is easily the silliest of the initial Indiana Jones trilogy. While I've heard the argument that this character thrives on fantastical situations and traces of lore, for my money the envelope is pressed just a bit too far in this instance. Sure, Raiders used the power of the ark to melt the Nazis' skin and Crusade showcased an immortal knight with a collection of stand-in grails, but in each case those represented the climax of a long, grounded adventure - a mere taste of supernatural payoff. Temple shows no such restraint, diving straight in with voodoo dolls, mysterious brainwashing liquids and, memorably, bare-handed heart removals. It also tinkers with the formula of Jones as a loner, with mixed success. Indy's de-facto sidekick, Short Round, plays up every stereotype of a kid tagalong. He's shoehorned in, no doubt about it, but also adds a new dimension to the larger-than-life lead character via their rapid-fire rapport. The additional presence of a blonde love interest, Willie, seems redundant and unnecessary - her constant shrieks and clueless nature gives the impression Indy's babysitting two kids. Of course, it's not all bad news: Harrison Ford works wonders with his shadier lines and knocks the good ones right out of the park, the comic relief scenes (though over-applied) work surprisingly well, and the action / adventure elements the series is best known for hit all the right buttons. There's no shortage of that old, familiar formula here, but I wonder if Spielberg and Lucas may have overreached in an effort to make the film more palatable to the Saturday morning cartoon crowd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wouldn't it be really cool to make a James Bond movie? A proper one, with Sean Connery." ? Steven Spielberg.In a prophetic article on "Raiders of the Lost Ark", Jonathan Rosenbaum predicted the rise of "set piece cinema". He called the directors of these films "disciples of Hitchcockian storyboards" in which "The Sequence becomes the raison d'etre of film-making". These sequences would themselves increasingly demand more time and money, as the only way to satiated audience would be to offer bigger and more outrageous set-pieces.The James Bond franchise was arguably the first big budget series to exploit "set-piece cinema". To minimise financial risks, each Bond script is virtually identical. The stunts differ, the exotic locales are alternated, but beyond these superficial changes the Bond plot is always the same. By the time George Lucas started working on "Raiders", there'd already been 12 Bond flicks. The Bond formula had been set in stone and "proven" successful. All that was needed were a few minor cosmetic changes, and Lucas would have a franchise of his own.As such, all four Indiana Jones movies follow the Bond formula precisely. First we have the pre-story action sequence, a self-contained action sequence in which Indy searches for an artifact. In "Raiders" it's a Golden Idol, in "Temple of Doom" it's a flask of Ashes and in "The Last Crusade" it's the Cross of Coronado. In each film, Indy finds the artifact and then promptly loses it to the villains.After this pre-film action sequence, we then get the exposition. In the Bond films, this is where Bond learns of his mission. In Indiana Jones, this is where Indy learns of some religious myth. Bond and Indy then travel to an exotic location, Indy typically meets an attractive woman (who is always later captured), the audience is introduced to the sub-villain, and we're treated to two action sequences. At the end of the second act, Indy and Bond are then always captured by the central villain.Of course our heroes then escape, there's a final big action sequence (always, in Indy's case, involving a vehicle), and an ending in which the bad guys are killed by the very artifact they sought. There are repeated plot beats, like Indy making a deal with the enemy, run-ins with henchmen, repeated scenes dealing with Indy's phobias, but basically the film follows the standard Bond formula. As Spielberg remarked after first reading the "Raiders" script: "It's Bond without the hardware".As all Indiana Jones films are essentially the same, the only way to judge them are to pit their action sequences against one another. Each film has 5 action sequences. "Raiders" has one sequence involving a giant boulder, one involving an indoor gunfight, one involving a running battle with henchmen in Egypt, one involving a fistfight underneath a plane and one involving a moving truck. As what what constitutes action continuously gets "faster" and "harder", most of these sequences are deemed tame by modern audiences."Temple" also has five showcase sequences. One involving a song and dance routine, one involving a chase from henchmen, one involving an extended fist fight, one involving mine carts, and a final showdown on a rope bridge. Most of these sequences have aged well, the rope sequence the most tense moment in the trilogy, the others striking a tone that alternates between ultra sadistic and goofily over-the-top. More than other Indy films, "Temple" still feels audacious; part vaudeville movie, part musical, part quasi-racist B movie in the mould of 1930 serials. Opening with a rendition of "Anything Goes", it's totally ridiculous. Spielberg fans hate it."Crusade" likewise has five action sequences. One involving young Indy, one involving a Venice chase, one involving a showdown with air-planes, one involving a motorcycle chase and a final battle in which Indy faces a tank. While the opening and closing sequences are very strong, you sense Spielberg bored with everything in between.In contrast, "Temple" is the Indy film which holds up best today, its cinematography richer, its camera work better, its pace faster, its tone unashamedly goofy (shades of Verhoeven) and with a hero who's simultaneously more muscular and more vulnerable than usual. Spielberg would go on to condemn and all but disown the film ? he thinks its "sadistic" and "in poor taste"; he would say the same of "Jaws" - but it's the fact that "Temple" embraces the baseness that lurks in all his films that makes this Indy outing less hypocritical. Elsewhere "Doom" goes beyond emulating its influences ("Stagecoach", "Sierra Madre", "King Soloman's Mines", "Zorro", "Valley of the Kings", "Lawrence of Arabia", "The Naked Jungle", the same plot as "Gunga Din", often misread as a pro-colonalist film) to replicate wholesale the Colonialist/Orientalist/racist/sexist tone of 1930s serials, characters exoticized and demonized, the Other base or thoroughly in need of white salvation and the script falling back on various racist binaries. This repeats the treatment of Arabs and Nazis in the other two films (the way Spielberg/Lucas yearn for 1930s popular culture goes hand in hand with the decade's rise in Reaganism).Nowadays, of course, popcorn films are moving away from what Rosenbaum called "set piece cinema". With spectacle dead, the majority of modern pop-corn flicks abandon elaborate set-pieces and instead seek to bombard their audiences with information. This is the post-cinema, cyber age, blockbusters now overwhelming audiences with plot. Thirty years ago we marvelled at Indy outrunning a giant boulder. Today, we salivate over narrative gymnastics, popcorn plots seeking to excite us with the sheer density of their tales. You know, like checking email, watching Youtube, wheeling through an Ipod, ebooking and cyber-surfing all at once. Indy would weep.Raiders of the Lost Ark ? 8/10, Temple of Doom ? 8.5/10, Last Crusade ? 7.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining for the first hour or so, but eventually gets too dark and disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three years after release of the classic "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (the first installment in the "Indiana Jones" franchise), it was followed by this prequel, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom". I just got around to watching the 1981 original a couple weeks ago, believe it or not, and could understand why it was such a popular action adventure. Before watching this second film, I knew the first was the most popular in the series, and this one was the least popular of the first three, but that didn't mean I wasn't going to watch it. For over 50% of the film, I found that it wasn't as good as "Raiders", but still very entertaining. However, I had been warned that it was darker and more violent than its predecessor, which eventually began to make a lot of sense! In 1935, Indiana Jones makes a trade with Chinese crime boss Lao Che in a nightclub in Shanghai, but the gangsters want to kill the archaeologist! He narrowly escapes with nightclub singer Wilhelmina "Willie" Scott, and with the help of his sidekick, a young Chinese boy named Short Round. The three of them leave Shanghai on a plane, unaware that it belongs to Lao Che! While they are asleep, the pilots get off the plane, leaving the three in peril! Indy, Willie, and Shorty escape the plane in an inflatable boat, landing on the slope of the Himalayas and sliding down into a river! They come to a village in India, where a sacred stone has been stolen and all the children are missing! The people believe that evil spirits are responsible for this, and the trio venture into a nearby palace to save the kids and retrieve the stone, but are headed for a terrifying experience! This prequel starts out showing Willie Scott, played by Kate Capshaw, performing, which is a lot different from the beginning or "Raiders", and I did not care much for it. After that, it gets better, with Indiana talking to Lao Che. This is where the suspense begins, and Harrison Ford still is charismatic as Indy. I quickly realized that Willie Scott is not a very good comic relief. I didn't find her as annoying as many others probably have, but didn't think she was that funny, constantly freaking out and complaining, and sometimes screaming a lot, like when she keeps seeing one jungle creature after another. Still, there are some mildly amusing parts, as this character does have her moments, and so does Short Round, played by Jonathan Ke Quan. For a long time, the film succeeds as an action adventure, with great action scenes, consistent suspense, and some nice special effects and sets, much like its predecessor. However, we eventually see a man getting his heart magically pulled out before he is lowered into a pit of lava, and then we hear screams as we see child slaves mercilessly lashed while they are forced to toil in the horrible underground chamber! Starting here, the film isn't so entertaining anymore.To me, the first hour of this movie seemed to go surprisingly fast, but after the brutality starts, the film drags a little. If it hadn't made this sudden change, I would at least be able to give this "Raiders of the Lost Ark" prequel an 8/10. A highly entertaining action adventure turning into what is more like a brutal drama (with the child slavery scenes) is kind of like a mean trick! As a movie billed as an action adventure, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is obviously supposed to be fun, not a film to remind us of the cruelty of humanity! Don't let the PG rating fool you. Kids should not watch this movie with or without their parents! Apparently, it was one of the films that inspired the creation of the PG-13 rating, which is not surprising. I guess there was nothing in between PG and R before then, and of those two, "Temple of Doom" probably would have been better off with an R rating. So, while this film does have some good entertainment value, no wonder it's the least popular installment in the original trilogy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulp Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing "The Crystal Skull", I decided to see one of the most famous of the "Indiana Jones" installments. Now I realize the archaeology teachers and writers I've experienced had it all wrong. "Temple of Doom" proves that "Indiana Jones" is pure fantasy. Nothing in this movie is remotely related to reality, except for some passing mention of the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny. It's Spielburg And Lucas's homage to fast-paced, nonstop-action adventure movie serials of the 1930s, which in turn were derivative of "King Solomon's Mines" or anything written by pulp adventure novelists. Stop worrying, academics of the ivory tower! Nobody will believe Indiana Jones is even remotely close to a real archaeologist.With that out of the way, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is exciting and fun and delivers on the thrills and spills one would expect from an adventure movie. The Temple of Doom set is superlatively designed, an is quite convincing as a scary, demonic place. The mine cart chase is one of the most classic scenes in cinema history, certainly in the top ten somewhere---though I suspect it was based on a mine cart chase from an earlier adventure serial. I wonder why Disneyland based their Indiana Jones ride on a Jeep rather than the familiar mine cart in the Thuggee gem mines. It would have been very exciting to slide back and forth an "Mr. Toads Wild Ride" meets "Space Mountain" adventure ride in a mine cart.Anyway....The acting is decent. Harrison Ford cements his role as an action hero. Fans of the timeless classic "The Goonies" will spot the actor who played Data here, in an earlier role. He's very fun to watch as Indy's resourceful and brave sidekick...he almost seems like the inspiration for "Talespin's" Kit Cloudkicker. Cate Capshaw is not so great as a scaredy-cat lounge singer/love interest. She has little to do but scream and bulge her eyes at creepy-crawly bugs and reptiles. I am a bit sorry to see the Indian actor who brilliantly played Jawaharlal Nehru in the excellent biopic "Gandhi" reduced to playing a generic henchman; he's way too good for this popcorn flick!Accept "Temple of Doom" for what it is, any you will really enjoy it. Watch this on Halloween with some friends. It is a classic pulp adventure flick, with all the requisite standard features such a movie would have. Don't expect anything more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark prequel takes Indy to the Temple of Doom....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of Raiders of the Lost Ark, series creator George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg took the Indiana Jones series into its dark second installment, 1984's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Written by American Graffiti's Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz and set in 1935 (making this film a prequel to the first film), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom takes its archaeologist hero (Harrison Ford) from a swank Shanghai night club to the rain forest of India as Indy, his orphaned sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) and his very reluctant companion Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw, who would later be Mrs. Steven Spielberg) go on a quest for an Indian village's sacred stone, which has been stolen by evil Thugee followers of the Kali cult. Indy is at first reluctant to go on this quest for yet another mythical artifact, but when the villagers tell the archaeologist and his two companions that the followers of Kali, now based in Pankot Palace, have stolen their children, Jones agrees to pay the new Maharajah of Pankot a visit. His interest is peaked when a dying young escapee arrives at the village and hands Indy a scrap of cloth with a fragment of tapestry. Reading its Sanskrit inscription and by looking at the pictographs on the cloth, Indiana discovers that the villagers' sacred stone is one of five Sankara stones, left to men by the Hindu god Shiva. When a puzzled Short Round asks Indy what a Sankara stone represents, the professor/adventurer replies, "Fortune and glory, kid. Fortune and glory." But Indy's quest for "fortune and glory" takes a disturbing turn when the trio reaches Pankot Palace. The prime minister, Chattar Lal (Roshan Seth) appears to be just another Oxford-trained Indian bureaucrat, but in reality he's one of Kali priest Mola Ram's (Amrish Puri) lieutenants. Soon, Indy, Short Round and Willie go from honored guests to prisoners when they discover the goings-on behind the high walls of Pankot Palace. Although Temple of Doom is an enjoyable adventure film, its dark tones (both in storytelling and visual terms) and a few gory scenes involving a really gross banquet and a human sacrifice made it the least favorite entry in the series. And even though it was rated PG, the criticism Temple of Doom received caused director Spielberg to be one of the advocates of the PG-13 rating that the Motion Picture Association of America created within months of the film's release. Nevertheless, the film's action set pieces (some of them conceived for Raiders but left out for time constraints) are still thrilling, Spielberg's directing is top-notch and John Williams' 1930s-flavored musical score is, as always, brilliant. Although the other two films in the series are more fun and lighter in tone, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is still worth watching. Just not, of course, right after dinner.

		<fullReview>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) ** (out of 4) After a battle with gangsters in Shanghai, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) along with two new sidekicks (Kate Capshaw, Ke Huy Quan), gets dumped off in the Himalayas where he is asked to locate a magical jewel, which disappeared from a village along with all the children. This prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark certainly has a lot of eye candy in it as it's an incredibly well made film and the set designs are among the greatest I've ever seen but in the end I was left bored throughout the majority of the movie. I found the screenplay to really be lacking here and if you're going to follow up a classic then you really need to deliver better stunts and action sequences than the previous film. The first film, while I didn't love it, had some incredibly action scenes that are certainly among some of the best ever created but I didn't find that here. I found most of the action scenes to be below par especially the opening sequence in the Shanghai nightclub. The only stunt that manages to be anywhere near the original's is the final sequence on the bridge, which did contain some nice suspense and thrilling action. Ford once again delivers a terrific performance and his sly humor makes for some good laughs. Ke Huy Quan is also very good and fun in his role. Capshaw on the other hand had me annoyed but this really isn't her fault as this goes on the screenplay. I'm guessing her character is paying homage to all the women in those 1930s serials who found themselves in positions that they didn't want to be in but it comes off really annoying here. The worst scene in the movie is where the three are camping out and Capshaw is running around from one point to another, screaming at the various creatures she runs into. This is far from a bad movie but I expected a lot more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Temple of Overkill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember after Raiders of the Lost Ark came out my friends and I were all waiting for a sequel. There was no doubt in our minds that the team of Spielberg, Lucas and Ford would return again to give us another rousing adventure in the form of Indiana Jones! We waited three years only to find that the sequel wasn't even close to the original in its craftsmanship, story-telling and overall adventure. What Raiders gave the audience was a classic story of good vs. evil with a charming, believable hero who defied odds and came out on top because he was fighting for the good and just cause. With Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones seems to step from his archeologist's leather coat and into a James Bond Astin Martin. He's suddenly not so fallible as he was in the first movie. His rough edge is gone and Indiana Jones seems a bit smoother and more refined. In this one he's more assured and no matter what trials and perils he faces he readily has an answer. And the trials and perils he faces are many and way over the top!From jumping out of window, with a nightclub singer in tow, crashing down through awnings and into the backseat of a waiting car we know right away that our hero is something out of the ordinary. From there we follow him on an airplane ride (reminiscent of the Lost Horizon) where the pilots abandon our hero and his cohorts. As the plane goes down they jump out in a life raft and take a toboggan ride that puts the scariest Disney rides to shame! This is how the movie goes, one daredevil stunt after another after another with a bevy of gross bugs and dinners with eyeballs in them thrown in so the audience never really feels at ease.This is what I hate about sequels! They (directors, producers and actors) want to top everything in the original movie and so they do complete overkill of all that made the first movie a success. Spielberg once claimed that he wished he had made Jaws 2 as he thought he could have done justice to the shark. But viewing this movie, I don't see how Spielberg would've saved the shark from its campy fate. Temple of Doom is just too far-fetched and too campy for it's own good. Everything seems forced in this movie: From Indy's sidekick "Short round", to the evil, heart-eating witch doctor to the romance between Indy and the nightclub singer 'Willie' Scott, adequately portrayed by the soon to be Mrs. Spielberg, Kate Capshaw. Everyone in the movie seems as though they are trying their hardest to act, sing, be heroic, scream, menace, be evil, or just be silly. It all ends up being cartoon-ish which is far from what attracted us all to the first Indiana Jones movie.The trio of Spielberg, Lucas and Ford would later re-unite (and redeem themselves) to make Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade. Sequels don't need to be over the top to be successful. Usually, they just need a good story and a good team in front of and behind the camera. Lucas has done it numerous times now with the Star Wars series. Maybe it's just too easy to overkill a story, laden it with incredible stunts, cheesy plot points and extraneous characters. I don't fault Spielberg, Lucas and Ford for making this movie. I'm sure they thought they were giving us what we all were clamoring for. Lucky for my friends and I we only had to wait another five years after Temple of Doom for the sequel we had been waiting for. </fullReview>

It has good thrills now to the problems - Kate Capshaw is irritatingly annoying as a whining crybaby who is upset because she broke her nails. She acts too much like a spoiled brat and just screams out her lines(I think the director was more interested in getting her in bed then in her acting).No offense to her looks,she is a decent looking woman but she cant act worth a spit.Take a look at her movies(average at best for any of em), she is married to spielberg now so thats her meal ticket(notice she no longer does any major acting , shes a housewife pumpin out babies now). And the little chinese kid is another pain to watch, ill bet his movie career was short. The action is fun and the special effects are great but the dramatic scenes between capshaw and ford are rather awkward and dull .Watch the first 15 or so minutes then fast forward to the last 20 or so minutes ,save yourself some boredom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not good either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is a PREQUEL to "Raiders of the Lost Ark", taking place a year before the original movie. In this adventure, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), lounge singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and Short Round (Ke Huy Kwan) arrive in India to help a small village recover stolen stones, called Shankara, and to rescue their kidnapped kids. They fight against the Thuggee Cult and it's leader, the evil Mola Ram (Amish Puri). This movie is filled with action, more action than the original film, but it's loaded with extreme violence (i.e. a man's heart getting pulled out of his chest) and gross out gags (bugs, bugs and more bugs). The plot is different from "Raiders" which is a good thing, since it didn't copy the plot. The acting could have been MUCH better though. Kate Capshaw is a terrible replacement for the awesome Karen Allen. She is whiney, annoying, and just there. She really has no connection to the story, she was just stuck in there for comic relief and it didn't work. Harrison Ford is great, again and the little kid isn't that bad either. The Nazis are replaced by the Thuggee cult, they seem to be more evil and sinister, considering that the leader pulls out a man's heart. All in all, this is a good flick, but it might be a little too violent for younger kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware the even-numbered Indys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not that Temple is as bad as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull; action set pieces here are neat and stylish, Spielberg at his top form. The big issues are plot, characters and tone.I hate the clunky James Bond opening, the unfocused way the story unfolds: a particularly smug, dense Indy escapes Shangai with the villain's own plane (why did the pilots even take off, or didn't just shoot him in the head instead of staging a plane crash, it's beyond me), randomly lands in India, randomly ends up in a village whose mystical MacGuffin the horned villain has stolen, and... this makes The Last Crusade look as tightly plotted as Chinatown.Kate Capshaw's obnoxious Willie destroys the good job done with the strong female character of Marion in Raiders - constantly screaming damsel in distress and fatuous femme fatale, the object of alternatively ridicule and leering, she is insufferable. Short Round has the dubious privilege of getting a few "the kid saves the day" Spielberg moments: the scene where he beats up thugs thrice his size with karate moves as a cute oriental jingle plays in the soundtrack is so childish it makes The Goonies look like Blood Meridian.Even forgetting casual racism - I'll give Spielberg and Lucas the benefit of the doubt and attribute it to silly attempts at humor rather than actual malice - tone is a mess. Doom wants to be quirky and it wants to be creepy; it wants to be dark and it wants to be stupid. So we have Ford and co-stars mugging for the camera and going for slapstick, and then suddenly an innocent man screams in agony as his heart is ripped off his chest - "tonally inconsistent" doesn't quite convey it. Look back at that dinner scene with its juvenile humor and ponder how a bloody human sacrifice fits with it. 6/10</fullReview>

The opening sequence was classic Indy with a bit of James Bond car chase thrown in, but the storyline of child slavery and voo-doo was a bit much. The movie really took off in the mines and the chase in the mine carts was very entertaining and the sequence on the wooden bridge added to the climax. A few annoying things like Willie, who was there more comic relief, but Short Round did make the movie more entertaining, and would have been a very different movie without him in it.

		<fullReview>For me, this movie had little merit, it only sought to perpetrate notions of racism. As an Indian, I would like to point out some of the misconceptions about the county presented in the movie. First, the filmmakers seem to promote the concept that all Indians are small, dark skinned, poverty ridden people surrounded by superstitions and ignorance. In comes Indiana Jones, the globe trotting archaeologist, and the people believe him to be a saviour. Of course, only a white man can protect them against evil forces, and bring back their lost 'fortune and glory' represented by a 'sankara' stone. Second, it is preposterous to suggest that Indians feast on peculiarities like fried eyeballs, baby snakes and chilled monkey brain for dessert. We have culinary tastes as developed and distinctive as any other country, and the choice of food shown in the film shows Indians to be uncivilised and barbaric. third, the association of Goddess Kali with an evil cult practicing human sacrifices also shows the poor knowledge of filmmakers, who clearly did not know that she represents power.</fullReview>

It seems like Spielberg played on something which he thought was good for American audiences and that is where he mixed up South American traditions into this movie. What is surprising is that the American audience is cool with it and thinks that this is one of the greatest movies ever made. Well, nothing could be more than farther from truth.In fact racial profiling is the only makes sense when the story of Mohammed and Jesus are almost the same and yet America believes that Jesus was right and when the study of both Jesus and Prophet are widely debated.

		<fullReview>Just re-watched, a couple nights after Raiders of the Lost Ark, which does. Actually, if this hadn't been part of a beloved trilogy -- if there was no Raiders and this had been released on its own merits -- I'm thinking box office as well as critical failure; certainly not a 7.6 on IMDb. So "doesn't hold up" probably isn't quite as accurate as "never was very good." This isn't a knock on the action set-pieces possible in the day, which are still fine, actually, but the story, the dialogue, the performances, it's all lacking; the lighthearted is just goofy, the dark is dark but not in any nuanced or interesting way. Just a lot of uninspired or poor decision making here. Where Raiders had a relatively cool heroine, Temple has the shrieking showgirl lost outside the city. Where Raiders went creepy-fun (spiders on the back, snake pit) Temple goes gross-out (snake surprise, insects thick as a carpet). The one scene this movie is really remembered for, the heart scene, is pretty masterful. But it can't atone for the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So...a LOT of people have discarded this movie for not being up to standards of "Raiders"...however I feel that the character of Indy is more developed and Harrison seems more at home in the part this time around, and it lifts the film considerably.I know many of you hard-core fans (to which I count myself) will shake your heads at what I'm about to say...but "Temple" is better than the first in many ways. "Raiders" suffers from not quite knowing which direction to go...should Indy be a tough guy, a nerd, a brooding man who actually considers suicide? It's not quite cohesive.Here we know from the get go that Indy is a not just in it for his own gain but does his thing to save the innocent. This gives him more depth, combined with the relationship he has with Short Round we now see a whole different and fuller character which is a huge step in the right direction.No...it does not have Sallah, Marcus Brody or Marion (who I think is much more annoying than Willi Scott who is SUPPOSED to be annoying, Marion is it unintentionally,) but it does have more fast paced action and a villain who should be awarded the best villain of the decade.</fullReview>

Neggatives are that it didn't lay out anywhere near as much action as the fist one. Then i suppose Spielburg intended for Doom to feel darker than the previous one, and comedy to be given a medium length.

		<shortDescription>Weakest of the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the second movie in the Indiana Jones trilogy.The film opens in 1935 with a cabaret scene reminiscent of the Busby Berkley musicals. The eminent archaeologist Indiana Jones played by Harrison Ford has a meeting with a thug. Ford gets poisoned and the cabaret musical number turns into a free for all as Ford tries to recover a vial of antidote that is being kicked around the nightclub in the m?lée. During all of this he meets the cabaret singer played by Kate Capshaw (director Spielberg's wife.) Through in a 12 year old boy named Short Round. The three of them end up in an Indian village where the children have been abducted and a precious stone has been stolen. Jones agrees to find the stone and the children. This leads him to the Thuggees and Mola Ram the evil high priest who will have the power to rule the world if he possesses all 5 Sankara stones. The main part of the film involves the characters struggling in the Temple of Doom. There are some fights, a very cool chase through the mine shaft in mine cars (the best part of the film and really well done) and a collapsing bridge over a river filled with crocodiles.Made three years after the original, this film should be better than it is. It suffers from a weak heroine in Capshaw and the rather unpleasant tone of the film. Whereas the villains in the first film were bad but not gross, the villains here rip out people's hearts and it's strong subject matter for young viewers. The film does look good on DVD and as the second part of the trilogy is necessary viewing. As a film on its own though it's fairly average and forgettable.</fullReview>

Then, he wrote the story for INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM.First of all, why is it always that in every single country, a white man is superior to all others? Why is it that all the Indians are shown as either poor, desperate villagers who cling to Indy like he is God, snake-eating sickos, and/or as crazy cult members who have no free will of their own?India was the birthplace of mathematics and many of the world's sciences. It had civilization long before the West. The game of chess came from India. Why is it, then, that this film shows India as such a backward place?Disrespect for India aside, this film does not make up for it with any kind of good plot. The wholesome adventure and treasure hunt feeling of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE are gone. Let's also not forget all of the giant insects in the movie that are enough to make you lose your lunch. (I'm not kidding. Centipedes, spiders, and all kinds of creepy crawlers crawl around Kate Capshaw for a good five to seven minutes.)If there is anything at all good about this movie, it's Shorty. That little Chinese kid is awesome. I think he should return in Indiana Jones IV.Overall rating, 3/10.NOTE: Many countries, including India, have banned this film for being overly disrespectful and downright racist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...of a triology. Though, it starts great. The opening scene is on the "Indy level". Tense with some comical additions. And with a well known "Indy melody" on the start of the plane scene.But after that,... Oh my, Steven, you've just missed it this time. Unbelievable plane rescue scene (Hello...007), tasteless dining scene in castle (lack of originality, i guess), unconvincing love &amp; romantic scenes with a "please-show-me-how-to-act" Indy girl and far too long cave scenes. At the end, I got nearly bored...sure there is a roller coaster rail scene, but it's just so unbelievable (like the most of the action scenes in this movie). Not to mention pathetic ending. All in all, is it so bad than? Well, no, not SO bad. It still got some Indy charm (thanks to Harrison) and that saves me, for not giving this movie "under 5 rate", so that's why a hardly6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves much more credit....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin?...I grew up watching the Indiana Jones films and I am a huge fan. No other actor could come close to playing Indiana Jones the way Harrison Ford plays him. Harrison Ford IS Indiana Jones and it is still a little hard to believe that their first choice was Tom Selleck. A lot of credit must go to Steven Spielberg and George Lucas as well. No one can craft these movies the way they have. Raiders of the Lost Ark was in one word "Brilliant!" Three years later Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford teamed up again to make a prequel to Raiders called Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. This was set a year before Raiders and it put Indy in a new environment and in a new situation. I read some of the reviews for Temple of Doom and remember that some people said that it was too dark and violent. It was no more violent than Raiders was and it was supposed to be darker....it was a new movie. It wasn't supposed to be just like Raiders and I guess a lot of people just didn't get that. I even like this film a little bit better than Last Crusade because Last Crusade(although a good film also) had a little too much slap-stick in it for me. I mean when Hitler signed the grail diary and gave it back?....What the hell was that?!! It was hard for me to take the plot of the movie seriously when the bad guys in that film were a joke. The bad guys in Temple of Doom were great. I liked the fact that they were different than the villians in the first film but were still just as great. The plot was just as good and the action was also top notch. Compare it to movies now-a-days and it is far supperior. I even read a review that said Temple of Doom was too much fantasy unlike Raiders. Their is just as much fantasy in the first film as there is in it's two sequels. To some up....Raiders-a great film, Temple of Doom- also a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fast-paced but poorly executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted that the 'Raiders' franchise is built around a certain degree of freneticism, a lot of dashing to and fro, 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' really goes over the top with it and the result is a disjointed, herky-jerky film with a lot of action and very little point. The film just isn't as well put-together as the other two (we'll leave the most recent addition for another day) and plays like a very fast-paced card trick that is meant to distract you from the fact that the magician's act isn't very good in the first place. The plot is part of the problem. It's so insubstantial, it's difficult to even remember as you're watching the film. At least in the other two movies, there was a degree of curiosity on the audience's part as to what powers the Lost Ark might contain, and whether the Holy Grail really existed. In 'Temple of Doom,' I frankly couldn't have cared less whether Indy found the magic stone and returned it to its village. It sounds like something Spielberg and Lucas dreamed up on the set during a coffee break when they realized they needed a plot. If there's a sense of blown opportunity here, it's with the lead female character, Willie. Kate Capshaw is, hands down, the most appealing and fetching of the series' first three leading actresses, and it's just her bad luck that she got stuck in the worst film of the three. The script doesn't give her much to do other than show exasperation, but she shows it about as well as it can be shown, and the fact her character isn't given more to do just reinforces the general air of disappointment one feels with 'Temple of Doom.' One of the best moments in the film is an all-too-brief flirtation between her and Indiana Jones, but like every other bright idea in the movie, it is cut short so we can move on to something else. Short Round (Jonathat Ke Quan), the young Chinese boy who Indy seems to have adopted, is an amusing character and has a few funny lines. In another movie, he might have made more of an impact as well. Here, he's strictly comic relief. The one bit everyone seems to remember from 'Temple of Doom' is the gross-out eating scene in some palace. Raw snakes, giant beetles, and monkey brains (served in the original monkey heads, no less) are consumed with great gusto, while a horrified Kate Capshaw looks on. It's probably the best staged scene in the film. Not much, I know, but with 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,' the pickings are pretty slim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I asked my boss whether his kids thought the Kali scene of torture (where a priest tears a man's heart out of his body) was at all disturbing, he just shrugged and said, "It didn't bother them." That's an indication of how undisturbed we've become when it comes to sensibilities that have been blurred over the years as we see more and more brutality on screen. Nowadays, kids are prone to see such things without causing nightmares--but, hey, the film did get a PG rating for just such excesses of questionable taste.HARRISON FORD is again the man with the dirty fedora and this time his adventures start with a scene in a Shanghai night club where Cole Porter's "Anything Goes" is rendered in Chinese and where we might think we've stumbled into the wrong theater showing the wrong film. It's an extensive sequence and manages to be the best scene in the whole film, funny and wittily inventive. It's also a meeting between Indiana and KATE CAPSHAW, who plays the heroine this time, with frankly too many screaming moments--although she IS funny.The story takes a fast turn with a chase through Shanghai streets and takes many twists and turns before ending up in some kind of religious temple in the Himalayas where the Kali cult is up to no good and missing children are being used as slaves.It's all got that Saturday afternoon serial flavor--just like the first Indiana Jones--only this time the tone is a little darker, especially when dealing with the Kali cult and there's a palace meal that will churn many an adult stomach, even if the kids can take it.In fact, most kids will love TEMPLE OF DOOM--and so will most adults--but be aware it does have some gross moments of highly questionable taste.</fullReview>

Harrison Ford plays the valiant and brave archaeologist turned into a man of action.Kate Capshaw interprets a scream girl who'll have a little romance with Indy.The movie blends adventures action,rip snorting,humor ,tongue in check,is a cinematic roller coaster ride pretty bemused. The motion picture has great loads of action,special effects galore and the usual and magnificent John Williams music.The glimmer and dazzling cinematography is by Douglas Slocombe.The pic is rightly directed by Spielberg.

		<fullReview>Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford have done it again! They've taken the character of Indiana Jones and used him to impress people all over the world with his latest adventure, the journey through the Temple of Doom! I wouldn't say that this is the best Indiana Jones film of the trilogy, but in a way each Indiana Jones film gets more and more entertaining. Indiana, along with two other explorers, lead their way into the Temple of Doom where they must fight for survival! From black magic to tumbling bridges, the Temple of Doom is a film that no one should miss for the world! What impressed me was how Indiana Jones got himself and others out of hostile situations such as booby traps. Those proved to be awe-inspiring. What also impressed me was the brilliant acting of the young actor, Jonathan Ke Quan, who plays Indiana's young assistant and best friend. Indiana faces new villains and meets the lovely young woman, Wilhelmina Scott. The Temple of Doom is an impressive second installment to the famous Indiana Jones trilogy. This film made me want to run off and watch the conclusion of Indiana Jones' journeys. Until I found out that an Indiana Jones 4 was in production, then I realized that his adventures are not over yet. This left me inspired and will amaze audiences everywhere. However, Indiana Jones' adventures still aren't over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers within.As has been pointed out by many previous reviewers, this is definitely the weakest movie in the Indiana Jones-trilogy. My major complaints are as follows:Willie - the heroine of the movie, played by Kate Capshaw - is a very annoying character, especially compared to Marion (Karen Allen), the leading lady in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. Whereas Marion was tough, funny and courageous in addition to being stunningly beautiful, Willie comes across as a bimbo who is merely capable of screaming and whining. This gets tiresome at a very early point in the movie. Indiana's adolescent sidekick, young 'Shorty Round' (Jonathan Ke Quan), certainly has his moments too when it comes to being a nuisance. I was also amazed by the stupidity of the bad guys in the movie. In one of the finishing scenes, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is caught on a rope bridge between two columns of bandits who are approaching from the front and from behind. A least a couple of times, we (the audience) see him lifting his machete, apparently with the intention of cutting the ropes ? and still we see the bandits approach undauntedly even though, in reality, this strategy should be as obvious to them as it is to us.There is also something very iffy about the way foreigners are portrayed in the movie. In 'Raiders', Indy's Egyptian friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) is just as clever and resourceful as Indy himself; in 'The Temple of Doom' all the Asian characters are portrayed as either pathetic victims, or as deranged murderers. Unimaginative and unfulfilling, is the least you can say about this state of affairs.Avoid like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe it or not, "Temple of Doom" was actually my favorite Indiana Jones movie; "Raiders of the Lost Ark" would be next. The movie had several flaws, but all movies do, even the Star Wars series. The reasons I like this movie are: 1) We have a new enemy other than the Nazis; a Hindu cult believed to have been wiped out, who worship the vampire goddess Kali. 2)This movie was non-stop action, unlike the other two, which moved by too slowly. 3)The dinner scene, while disgusting, was hilarious, especially when Willie looked into her bowl of soup and saw...well, I can't spoil it for the people who haven't seen it yet. 4)The mine cart chase was the best part of the movie. 5)The music was excellent. John Williams is the best. Now, for the bad parts of the movie. 1)First of all, the title sounds cheesy. "Temple of Doom?" Spielberg could've come up with something more imaginitive. 2)The first time I saw the part when Mola Ram ripped out that guy's heart, I was shocked. Now, though, it looks fake. Mola Ram's hand moved way too fast when he plunged it through the victim's chest. 3)The maharajah was a wuss and shouldn't have been in the movie in the first (at first, I thought he was a girl!) 4)Willie screamed TOO MUCH; it was funny the first couple of times, but it started to annoy me after the plane crash. All in all, this movie is very good. I hear that a fourth Indy movie is coming out, and it may be about Atlantis. As long as it has Harrison Ford, I'll watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This, I consider not only the best of the Indiana Jones trilogy but the best adventure film of all-time. I thought that the first in the series was ruined with its cheesy one-liners and silly ending of ghosts and goblins flying all over the place, and the pace of the third in the series I found too slow in light of the first two and the sick acts of fornication by Indie and his father with the same woman? Yuck! The "Temple of Doom" film centres around the archaeologist professor who travels through India only to find that magical stones that held a village together were stolen by the members of a temple satanic cult. The film is one of the fastest-paced adventures of all-time as geniuses Steven Spielberg and George Lucas combine forces to come up with a film that never has a dull moment. I was especially impressed with the accuracy in the cultural customs shown of the Indian villagers. (Not to accept a gift - of food - is an insult to them). It is true, believe it or not, that in some parts of the world, in history, monkeys' brains were eaten as shown! (10 out of 10)</fullReview>

His remarks seemed in defence of the movie. Temple of Doom has a different angle on Indy. Here, we see a man who is not after personal gain, but throwing himself into an act of selfless heroism. Edge of your seat excitement is what this movie specialises in and it has it by the cartload. We also have a stunning score by John Williams (Academy Award nominated), fantastic photography by Douglas Slocombe, great performances and uncompromising direction from Steven Spielberg. Indy has never been more battered and beaten than in this film and neither have the exhausted audience. Superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While "Raiders of the Lost Ark" is a thrilling well-directed masterpiece, "Temple of Doom" feels just like a very ordinary sequel. Just like if it was necessary to show Indiana Jones once more, no matter what's inside.Simply said, "Temple of Doom" is a big miss and a big mess. Director Steven Spielberg tries to deliver some good stunts and it works well, but that's almost the only thing that works. However, even the stunts, action sequences and special effects don't always work. So when the main piece doesn't work, it's clearly evident that the rest won't follow.The main problem is the overabundance of freaky bugs, corpses and other things that provokes gross from the audience. It's totally unnecessary and it's not what we want to see. Those things should be in a horror film, not in an adventure film. And those things even interfere onto some moments which could be interesting. The main example is the dinner scene inside the palace. While Indiana Jones, the British general and the Prime Minister chat about the primordial elements of Jones' mission, we have to contemplate the menu: little black snakes coming off from a bigger snake's body, fresh living cockroaches, eyeball soup and monkey brain for dessert. First of all, frankly, would all that stuff be found inside a luxurious maharajah palace? Secondly, it distracts the viewer from the important conversation between Jones and the minister.However, if you find (like me) that the movie is bad, don't blame it on Harrison Ford. Ford and Indiana Jones are two inseparable beings and the actor plays the character with great mastery, emotion and coolness. The lady in distress this time is Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw), but she just doesn't belong into an Indy movie. And was it necessary for Jones to have a little Chinese sidekick? "Of course! It wouldn't be a good movie if not!"For all of its bad characters, unnecessary freaks and highlighted but too easily needed action parts, "Temple of Doom" deserves my lowest regards inside the Indiana Jones trilogy.Rankings: Best: Raiders of the Lost Ark 2nd Best: Indiana Jones and the Lost Crusade Worst: INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a doubt, the Indiana Jones franchise has provided "entertainment" at the movies for at least a couple generations of movie goers. I in fact vividly remember going to the movies to see all 3. Everybody loves an adventure story with a hero, and Indiana Jones is quite an heroic character.That being said, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is atrociously offensive to me, and in my opinion should be offensive to Indians. The movie portrays it's "Indian" characters as poor, unfortunate souls, incapable of helping themselves and utterly dependent upon the help of the outside world through either British bound occupiers, or through the help of our "hero" Indiana Jones.The other Indian characters are portrayed as conniving, devil like creatures who either toil or work in stalactite laden pits and caves with molten lava, mummified prisoners, and "snake surprise eating", chilled monkey brain munching, beetle intestine slurping royalty. The maharajah him or perhaps herself is quite an androgynous character without much of a positive role.I never really realized just how offensive this movie was until I watched it recently. It reminded me of Gone with the Wind, another Hollywood classic that glorifies and romanticizes slavery. I'm sure Hattie McDaniel's relatives are offended by it as well.I don't mean for this review to be spiteful in anyway, and usually I love a good adventure story but I really think this movie is pretty offensive and in my opinion racist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying I own 3 movies and that's my entire library. And yes, all 3 are the Indiana Jones films. I idolized the character growing up and aspired to emulate him in every way. Save for the fear of snakes. Now, Indiana Jones &amp; the Temple of Doom was not the trend setting movie that Raiders of the Lost Ark was. Of course not... it came after. Some say the action was not as intense. I disagree whole-heartedly. I still find Raiders to drag on in parts and to be very slow paced, except for 4 scenes... the opening, the kidnapping, the escape and the climax. The one thing Raiders had over Temple was the climax. But not by much.Temple of Doom was far more "fun." It was genuinely funny &amp; light-hearted to watch at many times. And yet, anyone with even a light case of arachnaphobia, claustrophobia, bogyphobia, pyrophobia acrophobia or a half dozen other phobias were scared to the edge of the seats (or out of the theatre) at various OTHER times. Overall, the action was non-stop with the occasional moment of brevity to lighten the mood and ease the tension before the action took off again. Much like riding up a slope in a mine cart with the anticipation that the scariest ride of a lifetime is coming once you reach the top.And yet, there was a great human side to this movie. Remember, this was the second in a series. And in a well-done series, there must be character development. And one certainly can't argue that we saw many different parts to Indy's character in Temple of Doom than the others. Also keep in mind that this movie was actually a prequel to Raiders so characters. Different time in Indy's life, different things to encounter.Where-as Raiders of the Lost Ark was a slow-paced action-adventure and Indiana Jones &amp; the Last Crusade was a sentimental, human-focused adventure... Temple of Doom combined the best of both worlds for the most enjoyable two hours of the series. If you've never watched an Indiana Jones movie, watch this one first. After all, as far as time-line is concerned, it WAS first!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favourite of the series, easily the darkest, and possibly the funniest and most exciting. Jones travels to India after a dramatic escape from the bad guys, and along with his young friend Short-Round, and dancer Willie Scott they find themselves embroiled in a terrifying adventure. A local village appears to have been cursed when its mystical stones were stolen. The children of the village have also been taken. The village priest believes Jones is a God sent to bring back the kids, stones, and joy, and Jones is soon travelling to a nearby Temple to investigate. He soon uncovers a plot to resurrect an evil God, although the real problem is that Mola Ram, the bad guy is using the children as slaves, killing many and drugging others with what is known as 'the black sleep of Kali Ma'. Indy tries to bring down Mola Ram and save the kids while recovering the stones, but of course this will not be easy, especially after Indy is captured. The film is widely seen as the weakest of the series, perhaps because of the gore, but probably because of the racial undertones. It must be remembered though that the film was set in Colonial Times (or at least when India was still seen as a British Colony), and this sort of thing runs through the series, as well as hundreds of other films. Indy can be seen as the white western man coming to save the helpless East from a tyrannical ruler, with his supposedly superior knowledge and technology proving to be more powerful and useful against their primitive and barbaric ways. However, Lucas and Spielberg are not stupid, they would have been fully aware of these themes, and to an extent they are turned on their heads. Indy succumbs to their powers, and it is Short-Round his young Chinese friend who rescues him. Willie Scott is seen as hollow, materialistic and unable to cope without her Western luxuries. Indy almost experiences a 'King Solomon's Mines' like return to primitive ways, but admittedly is brought back. The film has many exciting set-pieces- the opening chase for diamond and antidote, the cave closing scene, the escape from the plane, the mine-cart chase, and the rope bridge finale are a few. The script again is good with many jokes, and Ford's usual charm is here for all to see. Capshaw spends most of her time screaming, which is what the role demanded, and Indy's side-kick is the best character in the series after Indy himself. He is capable of fighting those bigger than him, often imitating Indy, and is wise beyond his years. Mola Ram is pure evil. There are several scenes which may be scary for young kids- the sacrifices particularly, and there is a fair amount of blood. However, it is enjoyable for all ages, and i continue to find new things now that i didn't see when i was younger. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom is an action adventure that stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones and Kate Capshaw as a nightclub singer named Willie. Indiana also has a Chinese sidekick who's nickname is Short Round. They travel to India in search of the magic stones that were stolen from a Hindu shrine in a village. The village has also had all it's children stolen to work in the mines of villain Mola Ram. Indiana, Willie and Short Round enter the mines to retrieve the stones and rescue the children. There is a Wilhelm Scream in this movie too. When Indiana escapes from the mines he has to cross a river by a suspension bridge.

		<shortDescription>no seriously, where's the Raiders sequel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'saw this last night for the first time. Let's see... there was the cool suspension bridge action........ and yeah that's about it. 'just an awful movie on so many levels, one that breaks all the rules set by Raiders. (My brother's observation, not mine, but an accurate one!) It's absurd where Raiders was exciting and disgusting where Raiders was enjoyable in creepiness and thrills. By far the biggest anchor in the film is Kate Capshaw's character. I defy anyone to find a single sentence she spouts that isn't irritating and / or useless. Indy is a caricature of who he was in Raiders, the gags are lame and then the movie veers wildly into the gross or way too dark and violent. I'm amazed the makers of this one were connected to the first film. Truly, this one's a disappointment not worth wasting hours of your life on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my most favorite movie of all time! I flipped when I got it for my birthday in elementary school. I love everything about this movie. A man, woman, and a child go into the heart of a temple to get some stones and free children. This movie has so much adventure in it that I could watch this movie all day back to back. I love the fight scenes in this movie and the cart scene has got to be my favorite in the whole movie. I think this Indiana Jones movie is the best one yet in the trilogy. The idea of this movie just excites me and intrigues me. Wonderful movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"INDY-SCRIBABLE!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With respect to each and every honest opinion about this disrespectfully dumped-on, yet highly successful blockbuster, it seems that many people out there still judge a motion picture for its kind and not for how it serves that kind. They say this second INDIANA JONES (which was my first, by the way) was dark, gross, violent, or whatever. Well, people, since I dont see anybody judging this adventure artistically, let's not forget that movies are art. They can take more forms than we know, and all they require is our appreciation. Yeah ok, so there are things you cant help but feel uncomfortable with or see as plain stupid, but I'm sure you can surpass that by taking them from a different point of view? at least to feel the joy it brings to others, right? After all, a movie can only make sense if it entertains or interests you, but unfortunately, the simple truth is that many moviegoers are too proud of themselves as discriminating little suckers who think they've seen it all. Suit yourself.I only ramble about this subject because of what I've learned from this very particular movie : beauty is where it's perceived, whether you're young or old; it's just a matter of how much you appreciate it. I saw INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM when I was somewhere between 7 and 8 years old, and even though I can now understand very clearly why it would seem weaker than RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK to most people, I could never call it either better or worse, because of the most passionate memory I have of it.As a wild n' wonder-filled little boy, I fell madly in love with the very first glimpse I caught of it in a preview on TV when two really cool-looking Indian swashbucklers came face to face with this new, fairly muscular hero with a cowboy hat, bullwhip hanging to his belt, dirty white shirt with a fully torn right sleeve, and a scarred unshaved face that greeted them with a one-of-a-kind killer smile. Beautiful! Just beautiful! And with the wild jungles in the morning background, it hit even harder!When I went to see it at a theater with my family, even with my highest expectations, I could never describe how overpowered I became by every single ingredient of this roller-coaster ride from hell. Here's a few: awesome hero, awesome villains, colorful visual dynamics, creepy nightmarish feel, high-spirited sense of humor,`heart-ripping' violence, stunt-filled action, brutal voodoo magic, John Williams' sensational score, not to mention the delicious adventurous flavor of India ( which was a huge part of the magic ) and, of course, those totally disgusting gags that made me laugh like crazy. ( Hey, when you're a 7.5 year-old male watching a fat guy let out a monster belch after sucking the insides of a king-size bug, it'll pretty much make your day too. Heh, heh)I must admit that I've never been totally swept away by my moments with a movie as much as I'd been with this one, and I hope to relive them someday by trying harder to understand and appreciate the art of movies? instead of simply making comments like film critic Leonard Maltin who called my NO#1 favorite movie `headache-inducing'.Well look who's talking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very underrated sequel to the classic film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: While darker than the classic RAIDERS, this in-your-face thrill-ride will leave you breathless. Usually compared to its superior predecessor and often criticized for being not as good, INDIANA JONES &amp; THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is an immensely enjoyable and unfairly maligned sequel that's just as good as the original. How many sequels are like that, in fact, how many sequels even live up to its predecessors. DOOM, with its darker more violent approach, shows the film's aim for difference. For most parts, it succeeded very well, I see no reason why a simple change of pace could go wrong. This is a good and enjoyable sequel, and I'm glad to be pushing it that far.Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones once more who crashes into India after a highly enjoyable Shanghai club brawl. Along for the ride is sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) and noisy Nightclub singer Willie Scott (future Mrs. Spielberg Kate Capshaw). They end up in a village struck by hardship and famine when their magical sacred stones called the Sankara were stolen by an evil Thuggee Cult. Indy and gang end up trying to save the village, as well as fighting against a wily bunch of evil worshipers and an evil cult leader (Amrish Puri). And much like the first film, director Steven Spielberg has tons of fun with special effects and action sequences, and we're guaranteed to join in the fun.The new screenwriters here in DOOM, Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, lack the true edge of the original screenwriters of the first film, Phil Kaufman and Lawrence Kasdan. But the result is still a fun film, a fast-paced excursion filled with dazzling inventiveness and creative imaginations. This is just what made the first film great entertainment, and this is what made this one a terrific sequel to a great original.Followed by INDIANA JONES &amp; THE LAST CRUSADE.Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hokier Than "Raiders," But Still a Good Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hokier and jokier than its predecessor, "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" gives us a pretty good idea of what Steven Spielberg would be like if he were hopped up on amphetamines."Raiders" felt like it was full of non-stop action until you see this movie, which barely pauses to catch its breath. It's not as good as "Raiders," but I always enjoy it. Kate Capshaw is the film's biggest liability -- in the scene where she's being lowered into a fiery pit and Indiana is trying to save her, I always root for the fire. But the film has dazzling set pieces, some of them, like a breakneck race through a mine shaft, that rival or even outdo those in "Raiders."Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the ultimate movie character!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indiana Jones is one the most unique film characters ever created. He is not a superhero, he is not incredibly well built and he does not exhibit Einstein like smarts.However, he does have is the most relentless desire to succeed and never give up. He started that in Raiders of the Lost Ark and he continues it in Temple of Doom. I once saw an interview with Steven Spielberg years after Temple was released. He was being asked about Temple of Doom and he said that when him and George Lucas looked at the screenplay for Temple of Doom Steven turned to George and asked him if they could do all that was written. George turned back to him and said " I have no idea. " But they started filming and when it came to doing what seemed to be the impossible, they somehow managed to do it. Because that is what you get when you put two of the greatest minds in the business today together, success. Reality says that there are limitations to what can be done. Steven and George take that reality and laugh at it. Maybe now a days, some 16 years later, things like the mine care chase and the pit of fire seem like simple things to film but remember this is 1984. Special effects were not as advanced as they are now and to create some of what they did is realy quite incredible. I don't know how long it must have taken to film the mine cart scene but think of difficult and arduos a process that would be. Spielberg will always be the king of motion pictures in my book and films like this helped solidify that title. The man is a genius, he really is. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a fantastic film and it furthers his character. The film isn't just a rehash of the first, it actually expands on the story. And to make it even more fun, it takes place before the events in Raiders do.One of the most entertaining parts of Temple of Doom is Indy's new sidekick named Short Round, Shorty for short. Ke Huy Quan plays shorty with so much energy and he becomes an integral part of the film. He has a few good one liners and his physical acting skills are a perfect match for Harrison Fords. The film starts off much in the same way that Raiders does, with something that really has little to do with the rest of the film. It is here that we are introduced to Indy once again, Willie Scott, the beautiful nightclub singer, Short Round and even to one of Indy's old friends named Mohan, who loses his life abruptly. The reason I mention Mohan is because Marion had a friend named Mohan at her bar in Nepal. I wonder if these two guys were related somehow.After the energy at the beginning of the film it slows down to explain the story and set it up for us. But from the moment Indy and Short Round go into the secret wall in their room, the film never slows down. It is from here that we witness all the things that we now expect from an Indiana Jones movie: boobie traps, evil bad guys, bugs, perilous turns at every corner and of course the bullwhip. Some of the funniest parts in the film are also when Indy and Shorty are stuck in the cavern with the ceiling slowly caving in on them. Willie can hear their screams of help and she has to come and rescue them. She gingerly and slowly walks down the cave and gets to them. As she puts her hand into the hole in the wall to release them, Indy sticks his hand out and says "the other right, the other right, your other right. " and then just before they are about to be crushed he looks at her and with a child like face he says " Willie, we are going to die! " It is such a funny moment that if you haven't seen Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom then you should just for this one part. Temple of Doom is so full of energy and action that it is definitely a film ahead of its time. People complained that the film was too violent and that it wasn't suitable for kids so they actually changed the rating system in the U.S for this movie. PG-13 was born just for Temple of Doom. Interesting piece of trivia there for you.As for the movie itself, Indiana Jones becomes somewhat of a deity to some villagers outside of Shanghai. They have lost their three stones that supposedly bring good luck to the village. They also have their children kidnapped by the Thugees, led by a nasty villain named Mola Rom. He is a human sacrificing menacing man that pulls people's hearts out of their chest just before he lowers them into a hellacious pit of fire as a human sacrifice to Sheeba. Indy is then captured and put under a spell by having to drink some blood. It is here that the movie gets it's PG-13 rating when not only Indy but Short Round are whipped with the cat-o-nine tails. It is quite disturbing and I guess if kids were going to watch the film it would be a bit much for them. Temple of Doom is a great film and it is a great sequel to Raiders and a perfect prequel to Last Crusade. It remembers its roots as it has Indy reaching for his gun in a dangerous situation only to find that it is not there and it creates some of its own new history as there are many breath taking action sequences. I don't know how George and Steven do it but they just keep on entertaining us with movies like this and Star Wars. I sincerely hope they make a fourth installment of the Indiana Jones series. It has been ten years since the last one and that is way too long.</fullReview>

It's extremely well made, and the action is constantly thrilling and exciting, plus Harrison Ford is amazing in this!. The special effects still hold up very strong today, and the plot was really cool, plus i really dug all of the characters!.I was expecting this to be a mediocre film at best, but what i got was a classic (In my opinion) that was just as good as Raiders of The Lost Ark(re watching and re reviewing soon)plus, the bridge sequence is jaw dropping!.This is just as good as Raiders Of The Lost Ark in my opinion, and it's vastly underrated in all aspects!. The Direction is amazing. Steven Spielberg does an amazing job here, with amazing camera work, some amazing shots, incredible shots during the bridge sequence, some cool overhead shots, and he kept the film at a great pace!. The Acting is amazing!. Harrison Ford is AMAZING as always,and is wonderful here, he is amazing in the acting department, had great chemistry with Kate Capshaw and Jonathan Ke Quan, kicked that ass, and we got to see a darker side of Idianna, when he was under there spell, it was pretty cool! (Ford Rules!). Kate Capshaw is good here, she got on my nerves at first, but soon found her likable, and she had great chemistry with Ford. Jonathan Ke Quan is very good here, he is surprisingly likable and funny, and had great chemistry with Ford.Amrish Puri is excellent as the main villain, he is very creepy,interesting, and was extremely menacing. Roy Chiao, had a great bit part in the beginning, wish he had more screen time. Overall this is a fantastic sequel, and just as good as Raiders Of The Lost Ark in my opinion, see it right this instant! ***** out of 5</fullReview>

BUT did anyone else notice that this movie lifted a lot of the ideas for the film, from another movie that came out a year earlier called James Bonds Octopussy?Putting that aside, we don't get great movies like this anymore. I remember seeing this in 1984 on the big screen. A lot of movies lose there appeal as you grow up, but now as a adult I can honestly say this movie is just as appealing now as it was then. Great piece of film making and has something that is missing from today's movies that being Harrison Ford.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't have the same magic as "Raiders," but it still is a fun adventure movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Raiders of the Lost Ark" turned out to be successful as well as consider to be a classic movie, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas teamed up together once again in a sequel that many people considered this to be the darkest of the "Indiana Jones" series, and this was the movie that started to created the PG-13 rating due to how dark and violent the movie turned out to be. The movie is rated PG and it is not the kind of PG movie that kids would watch because it is intense for younger audiences. Heck, the movie has kids being turned into slaves as they kept getting whipped by the bad guys, and you really have a guy taking someone's heart out and having the body burned. Some PG movie, huh? If this was rated R, then I honestly don't know what difference will it make. I guess that is up to you for deciding about this. Speaking of the film's rating, the movie takes place a year before "Raiders" as Indiana Jones along side with his side-kick Short-Round and Willie Scott (Indy's love interest) as they go from Shanghai to India as they come across of poor villagers as they sent him to retrieve the sacred stones, and rescuing their children as they are being used as slaves at a palace called Pankot. Now its up to Indy to put an end of this nightmare before an evil priest named Mola Ram and his army of thugs get their hands on completing the five stones to rule the world. Everyone is split on this movie, which is the same thing when they were split on the fourth movie. I'll review the fourth one someday, but right now my main focus is this movie I am reviewing. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was bad like how everyone feels but as time goes by as I keep watching this movie it starts to grow on me. However, is it as good as "Raiders?" No, not really. Also, it certainly ain't the "The Empire Strikes Back" of the series because "Empire" is a much better movie than this, and I don't have too much to say about. So here is whats good and bad about the movie: Harrison Ford still hasn't gave a bad performance, and he still manage to be on top of things as he continues to be rough, cool, and looking for fortune and glory. He really is good in this movie as he did with the other "Indiana Jones" movies. Amrish Pri is really intimidating in the role as Mola Ram, and something about his looks really does fit to his character. He is definitely a worthy villain, and you can't take your eyes off of him on what he does in this movie. Jonathan Ke Quan plays Short-Round which like Willie Scott everyone has a hard time with him. His accent doesn't bother me, and I honestly really don't find him annoying. I thought he gave a good performance, and really is good sidekick to Indy; he can drive a car, helps out with Indy, and can actually fight like Jackie Chan. Now, for Kate Capshaw, she is not a terrible actress but I do understand how everyone feels when they are annoyed by her character. I'll admit she is pretty useless in this movie, and doesn't do anything much at all except that she whines and complains all the time; there is one part where she punch a bad guy during the mine cart chase, but still she remains to be a damsel in distress throughout the majority of this movie. Her character is not well done, but I can't help but laugh at her when she keeps squealing for Indy and always complain about other things. Her romance with Indy is nothing much to root for, and I will put her character in the "So bad its good" category. So bottom line, not really a well-rounded character like Karen Allen did as Marion Ravenwood, but she is funny to watch. The rest of the acting by the cast is finely done. I know Spielberg considered this to be his least favorite, but I thought he did a fine job on directing this movie as well as Lucas' ideas on doing a sequel to a classic adventure movie The special effects by ILM are well done, but there are some parts that are dated. The action scenes with the physical stunt work are really darn good. I do like the mine cart chase, which it feels like that you are on a roller-coaster. John Williams' score is about as good as what he did with his score in the first one. The movie is well paced, and the cinematography is well-filmed. Also, I do like the locations that our main characters go into. I also really do loved how the temple is designed for the movie. By the way, I do like opening musical number "Anything Goes." So yeah, I really do enjoy this movie, but its nowhere to be as good "Raiders." The story itself is fine for what it is, but its not as intriguing as the first one. I was always invested with the Ark of the Covenant more, than the stones in this movie. All in all, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" doesn't have the same magic as "Raiders," but it still is a fun adventure movie. I am giving it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

The biggest problem I have with this film is the woman played by Kate Kapshaw she is really annoying especially in the beginning. The silliness of the plot notably the voodoo stuff at the end really did not work for me. Nonetheless this movie is entertaining from beginning to end with some good performances most notably by Harisson Ford amazing set and imagery and funny moments.

		<fullReview>This feels like an Indy film, no? It has all those ingredients that made arguably the greatest action thriller of all time with Raiders. Then again, it is darker and more violent, and pushes our characters to these extremes that almost push it out of the pulpy action range that the franchise is built upon. There is still the wisecracking Indy, radiating personality with each sweaty grin, wink and seductive glare. There is still those bits of classic Indy humour; Ford grinning and making his getaway before swinging the door to reveal the villain's name, and him fumbling around with a statue's bust while a bewildered Willie stares at him. And there those wild, exotic and mysterious locations that harbour hidden treasures and lost secrets...well maybe one large location. There's the Karen Allen type female sidekick, full of moxie and unresolved tension and annoying screams...wait. For me, the draw of Indiana Jones is in the multi-level adventure, the mystery behind the treasure hunting and the subsequent search and chase across crazy and wild landscapes and cultures...why else would the graphic of the plane flying around the world from country to country be so iconic? In Temple of Doom, this happens once near the beginning, and then we are mostly stuck in a dark temple for most of the film, battling away terrors and running from minions. For all the thrilling chase and action sequences, it feels a little static, as if they were running around in circles inside a bobby trapped haunted house. The iconic Raiders March somehow manages to shoehorns its way into the action throughout, but it never quite feels like Indy. The other criticism that seems to be pervasive whenever this movie is mentioned is of course the sidekick characters of Willie and Short Round. While Temple may be darker, more graphic and throw even more precious dilemmas for Indy to deal with, these two 'comic relief' types are oddly inappropriate. Capshaw is intriguingly beautiful and intoxicating for about a minute during the opening sequence, and then descends into a whiny, high-pitched damsel in distress for the rest of the two hours. There's none of the greed or ulterior motive of Elsa, or the playful resourcefulness of Marion; she's simply a blonde bombshell constantly in the need of rescue and the designated romance 'doll' who feels the need to shriek at the sight of a cracked nail. Shorty is slightly less insufferable - he scurries from scene to scene and actually manages to assist Indy in his daring, death-defying stunts and exploits. It's his running commentary in broken, simplistic English that is rather grating. It's goofy, juvenile and downright silly at times, and manages to jarringly break up the tension; he runs onto a frail bridge, jumps animatedly up and down and yells "Strong wood! Strong wood!". And of course the next second it must collapse. While it may not be a great Indiana Jones movie like the ones immediately preceding and proceeding, and despite these shortcomings, Temple is still enjoyable. The production design lavishly tells the story of a great palace hidden away in the jungle, and a nightmarish temple full of great horrors like torture cages and mines full of slaves, bathed in an ominous reddish glow. The cinematography eases us into the mystery like an enthusiastic yet cautious archaeologist would, only burdened by the rather distasteful portrayals of the Indian natives; the camera takes tentative steps forward, brushing past vines and leaves to unveil a great weathered stone figure, grotesque in its age and décor, but the moment is offset by the natives exploding into fearful frenzy and fleeing for their lives. Ford sells each predicament so well that we can ignore the others and focus on him, and the danger that he approaches with a boyish, adventurous streak that we hope we possess too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Good as "Raiders" or "Crusade," but Still a Great Adventure Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has often gotten a bad rap, especially around the time of its release. People have criticized this film for being too dark, violent, and disgusting. This may not be as good as the two films it is sandwiched in between, but it is still a lot of fun and another great Indiana Jones adventure.The problem, of course, is that some scenes are way too violent and disturbing. This makes the movie not quite fit for little children. Another thing, Willie really can grate on your nerves at times with her constant whining and screaming.However, the movie makes up for that in many other ways. Harrison Ford is still phenomenal as everyone's favorite adventure hero. Short Round is an adorable side-kick to Indy, and to be fair, Willie wasn't quite as annoying in the second half of the movie.Unlike some people, I actually quite enjoyed the dark tone of the movie. The story was pretty cool, with Indy looking to find the Sankara stones and save the people of the village's children.The action scenes once again deliver. The chase out in Shanghai is exciting, as is when the gang makes it out of the plane and ride in a raft. The mine cart chase was relentless; it was like being on a roller-coaster ride. The bridge scene was also filled with great tension.The scenery in India is really nice and we once again get a rousing music score.This is another classic Indiana Jones adventure. This may be the weakest of the original trilogy, but it's still way better than the fourth film.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and Disturbing yet Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is perhaps one of the darkest films to ever hit the silver screen.It's sole purpose was to create the PG-13 rating.But some elements save it from being a total disaster even though it's pretty dark for a film directed towards a family audience.However,it is commendable as a motion picture.The film opens in 1935, Shanghai, with Willie Scott,the film's female lead played by Kate Capshaw performing "Anything Goes".Indiana Jones arrives donning a White Tux ala Sean Connery in Goldfinger. What follows is a diamond pursuing fiasco and the introduction of Short Round, Indy's sidekick and the film's best supporting character.Even though the opening is the film's best sequence, the scenes in India where Indy meets the villagers and find out about the Sankara stones, which are the plot device, were particularly fine even though the Dinner scene is a nauseous yet hilarious one.The film then loses it's momentum after entering the second act, where we see that the main antagonist, Mola Ram is shown to be in possession of the stones and also the the infamous heart-ripping scene. Although the first hour was great, the second hour falls a bit flat with disturbing scenes of black magic.However,there are some standout sequences such as the cart chase and the bridge scene.There is no lack of humor in the third act.As for the performances, Harrison Ford, as always, was fantastic.Short Round was a great character, who Jonathan Quan played with charm.Willie ,however, wasn't much of a good female lead compared to Marion of the previous film due to the constant screaming but Kate Capshaw gave a good performance.Amrish Puri, as always, was menacing in his role.Overall, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is quite a enjoyable film despite it's flaws provided the Kali Ma sequences are either skipped or watched boldly.It's quite a underrated film and deserves much recognition.Grade-A- Score-8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Officially Steven Spielberg's first sequel, although technically a prequel, as 'Indiana Jones And The Temple of Doom' takes place in 1935, before it's predecessor "Raiders of the Lost Ark" taking place in 1936. Plot In A Paragraph: Indiana Jones is back in action, this time he teams up with a night club singer named Willie Scott and a twelve-year-old boy named Short Round "Shortie". They end up in a small Indian village, where the people believe that evil spirits have taken all their children away after a sacred precious stone was stolen! They also learn about the terror surrounding a booby-trapped temple known as the Temple of Doom! So Indy sets off in his search for "fortune and glory"I loved this movie as a kid, believing as a rule "newer is always better" watching it now on bluray I have very mixed feelings. You could see George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were going for a darker tone ala the second Star Wars movie "Empire Strikes Back". But there are amazingly stupid attempts at slap stick comedy (the giant diamond getting lost amongst the spilt ice, Indy's attempts at getting the antidote,one guard throwing a hammer away and knocking another guard out) that are stupidly out of place. I'll get the bad out of the way first. Some absolutely awful editing, (See Indy fighting the guard on the rock crusher the distance between his head and the stone wheel gets larger between shots.) bad green screen and stunt doubles. As for continuity errors this may well be Spielberg's worst movie, there are so many, I lost count, and my 8 year old son picked some of them up on his first viewing. Whilst attractive Kate Kapshaw is very annoying, some of the things she says and does are ridiculous given the situations. And I'm pretty sure the opening singing and dancing number was so Spielberg could showcase his future wife (they met on this movie) Now that's out of the way...Ford is once again excellent as Indiana Jones, he really got himself in great shape for this instalment, probably the next he looked in the entire franchise. Jonathan Ke Quan (Shortie) is excellent considering this is his film debut. It was no surprise to see him turn up in the Spielberg produced "Goonies" the following year. What is surprising since then he only has eight more acting credits to his name. Amrish Puri is a very good villain as Mola Ram too. The rope bridge and mine cart chase are two excellent scenes that make my Top 10 Indiana Jones moments. The movie seems confused as to what it wants to be, a darker continuation of the first movie, or a kids adventure movie and it falls somewhere in between. I have rated it a generous 8/10, a massive drop from the 10/10 first movie, but it is still a entertaining movie, and my eight year old likes it better than the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous, yet ridiculously entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the most maligned Indiana Jones film until Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but like all films in this series it keeps you entertained from beginning to end. This film also caused quite an uproar with parents when it was first released. But what didn't cause one back in those days? Rumors of children being tortured in it were the greatest cause for alarm, but once the film was actually released, these criticisms seemed to die down quickly. The script is downright silly in places, and even the films darkest moments are too ridiculous to take seriously. For what ever reason, this film is actually a prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Neither storyline has anything to do with one another, so I'm in the dark as to why this was done. Harrison Ford was back and kicking butt, this time in India while battling some kind of Hindu death cult operating out of a spooky palace. It seems this cult had taken a sacred stone and all the children from a nearby village to dig for additional gems and other sacred stones. Along with Jones are a little Asian kid, and a mouthy American singer babe played by the future Mrs. Spielberg. The film is relatively well-paced and full of thrilling moments. The trouble is, none of these characters and situations are in any way plausible.Spielberg and Lucas intended this film to be partly filmed on location in India, but the Indian government refused after reading the script. They claimed the filmmakers hadn't the slightest clue about their culture, and it's hard to argue when you see what they came up with. The biggest exaggeration we see here deals with the cult itself. Thuggee was a real cult responsible for untold thousands of deaths or more for several years. They did not however occupy temples with molten lava or sacrifice victims in lavish ceremonies. Thuggee were traveling thieves who ritualistically strangled fellow travelers and then robbed them. And world domination was probably never on their agenda. When Jones is attacked in his stateroom, this is likely the most accurate depiction in the movie of how a Thug would kill his victim. History aside, the film delivers both the thrills and spectacle we would want from an Indiana Jones film. John Williams broadened his familiar score and improved it by doing so. Ford was injured in the strangulation scene mentioned above and a double had to be used for him in some scenes filmed later. Keep an eye out for Dan Akroyd as a man at the airport in an early scene. Also on hand in support is Phillip Stone, a veteran of Kubrick films Barry Lyndon, The Shining, and A Clockwork Orange. Pat Roach who plays the biggest Thug also had small roles in Barry Lyndon and Clockwork. Small world, isn't it? Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a thrilling movie, but cannot in any way be taken seriously. Keep in mind it was written by the duo that also gave us Howard the Duck! 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TEMPLE OF DOOM! There is a lot of hate for this flick! It's not my favorite but I still have love for it. Harrison Ford rocks as Indiana Jones. The perfect fit! His little sidekick Short Round is actually useful and fun. You can tell Indy cares for this kid. Stinks Willie Scott is so annoying. A damsel in constant distress, squealing and screaming! Being pretty is not enough. Mola Ram was a creepy villain for sure.Indy takes on the Thuggee Cult that has taken captive the children of a small village in India. If Indy gets the sacred Shankara stone back, all will be well. This is definitely a dark episode. A man's heart gets ripped out and children are enslaved. Lots of nasty bugs! There is some fun to be had though in Shanghai and the mine cart chase! The trio also jump out of an airplane on a blowup raft! Indy really gets to use his signature whip here which is a plus! He also has another fight with a huge henchman played by Pat Roach, the same guy who played the huge Nazi that gets shredded by propellers in RAIDERS.TEMPLE OF DOOM is not as good as the other entries but that doesn't mean it's completely terrible. A change up in formula with no Nazis, Russians, or biblical artifacts. Harrison Ford is great as always as Indy. There's plenty of action and some humor. Wish Short Round came back in the other films. Check it out if you like Indiana Jones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what kind of India did Spielberg come to?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Indiana Jones. I loved Raiders and the last crusade as well. I like this film too. But I am disappointed by the way Indians in this film have been portrayed. OK, I get it. The movie is about black magic and sacrifices stuff. But don't get me wrong here, I don't understand where in India(both in past and today) do people eat human eyes in soup? What the hell is that supposed to mean? I am not going to get into these things saying i am offended being an Indian myself.. Well I am more disappointed than getting offended here actually. Nothing else. Remove that stupid scene at the dinner table and the film is golden to me. As per the acting... the characters have played the roles with precision. Ford is phenomenal yet again and the late great Mr. Amrish Puri as Mola Ram is awesome. He breathes fire in this role which fits him to the core and not to mention his famous cackle that made him what he is regarded even today after his death, a legend.Lastly.... Movie is awesome... my take... 6/10 with the dinner scene. and 8/10 without it. All in all a decent watchable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The next filmic installment of Indiana Jones is a little more dark and laden with SFX shots, but it still manages to entertain, if somewhat unbelievable at points.What I mean by this is that "Raiders of the Lost Ark" spared no expense in bringing that film to life. Loads of extras, top notch cinematography, impressive and realistic-well-staged-convincing stunts, and SFX shots that were reserved for the more incredulous sequences that required a bit of detached reality to move the film forward."Temple of Doom" tries to adhere to that, but you can see where costs were cut by using SFX shots verse live staged stunts. Shots that might have otherwise been done on stage or in a controlled environment of somekind on a life size scale, are now a little more prevalent in this film. The plane sequence, large portions of the mine car sequence, and others, tend to detract from the reality of the film. "Raiders of the Lost Ark" presented a convincing reality. "Temple of Doom" strays from that some, and suffers for it."Temple of Doom" is also much darker in terms of theme and overall feel. The particulars of the Hindu religion are never explained, which holds back some of the translation of the story, which is also probably why this production feels a little more over the top; i.e. the scenes had to convey the malevolence of the Thuggee cult, ergo there's lots of energy injected into the performances and staging of scenes. With "Raiders" people pretty much knew who the bad guys were and why. "Temple of Doom", in this regard, had to educate, so to speak, its audience, and so the film is weighed down a bit more.The film also feels a little more low budget than "Raiders" by comparison. How true that is, I don't know, but note the number of SFX shots that could have been live action sequences had the resources been there.Don't get me wrong, I still like the film. I think it's great entertainment, but it veers a little left and right here and there. I can't say I was in love with it when I left the theatre on opening day, unlike its predecessor, but it did offer a kind of "here's another Jones adventure for ya" kind of feel. And seeing Indy do his thing is always kind of fun.How the film might have been improved; show some history of the Thugee cult. Establish history of who they were. Show Victorian era British troops putting them down, and why. Spend the money on crashing a large scale plane, maybe one especially made for the film, actually show it do its thing. Ditto with the water and mine sequence. Show a few more dramatic shots; the Palace, the Jungle, the camp sequence through the use of different lenses. The actors are fine, as is their direction, but the staging of the shots, in particular some, not all, of the Effect's sequences needed some tweaking. In fact, it might be an interesting project to do "special editions" of these films for that purpose alone. Just a thought.All in all fun adventure, if somewhat dark. There was a bit of controversy about some of the more intense scenes and how they effected younger audience, but don't let that stop you from watching the film. However, I would caution that because of some of the violence you may want to keep your preteens either very much warned or away from the movie altogether.Otherwise it's good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed but Fun Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Temple of Doom is often considered the worst of the original trilogy, and some people even consider it the worst of the franchise. It all depends on the person. Me personally, I would say it's probably the weakest of all four, but there is some part of me that really enjoys it.What's the biggest problem with the movie, well I think you can guess. Willie and short round can be unbearably annoying. There are quite a bit of plot holes. It's offensive to the Hindu religion, and there are quite a few boring parts. And some of the special effects haven't stood the test of time.All those are basically problems I mentioned in the first half of the movie. The first half is basically mostly comedy and a poor romance. Yet the second half is a lot of fun with tons of action. And this may make me sound sadistic, but I actually kind of like how dark it gets. Sometimes it would get a little too depressing, but for the most part it just made the villain more evil. And for all it's problems, it's memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as excellent as ROTLR, but still an entertaining follow-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Raiders of the Lost Ark was considered by many fans to become a masterpiece example that defines the classic Hollywood style with a great mixture of action, adventure, comedy, and romance and it became such a huge hit that Steven Spielberg decides to create some sequels to it by making this one here known as "The Temple of Doom".It starts off with Indy and his sidekicks Short Round, a 12-year old boy and Willie, a nightclub singer at Hong Kong landing in India where the people believe that evil spirits have taken all their children away after a sacred precious stone was stolen and they must journey into a booby-trapped temple known as the "Temple of Doom" where an evil cult known as the Thuggee is attempting to rise once more, believing that with the power of all five Sankara stones they can rule the world! Now, it's all up to Indiana to put an end to the Thuggee campaign, rescue the lost children, win the girl and conquer the Temple of Doom.I've heard that lots of people hated this movie for it's racially insensitive portrayal of India, it's much darker tone, it's camp value, and for being much too violent than the first film. Well, sure, Raiders of the Lost Ark was also violent, but the "ripping out someone's heart" scene in the temple halfway through the film was just too gruesome to even top the violence the original had. I'll admit that while the story isn't as well-thought out as the original, that doesn't stop the fact that the two sidekicks are the biggest flaw in the entire movie! Now, I don't hate the actor who later played Data in "The Goonies", but he's annoying here because he shouts every single damn line at the top of his lungs. Willie, however, is much more annoying than Short Round as she contributed nothing to the story other than screaming and complaining which makes her the least compelling females in the franchise.With those flaws aside, it still has some redeeming qualities. The visuals are amazing, the cinematography is the epitome of excellence, the special effects are solid too, and the pacing is very brisk along with some efficient direction from Steven Spielberg. What stands out the most is the acting with Harrison Ford shining at his best with his role as Indy along with some great villains and it's cartoony, but terrific action sequences. The strongest aspect, however, is the music from John Williams and the comedy in some parts of the film.Overall, I understand the fact that people hated this movie, but despite the issues that I've already stated, this is still an entertaining follow-up to a great film if they can get over it's flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I am reading other reviews for this film, I notice people continue to complain about the realism of it, (voodoism, ancient rituals)but come on, you are watching an Indiana Jones movie for crying out loud, where ghosts, booby traps, undead, retrieving religious artifacts not to mention a knight that lives for a thousand years, for the most part have been watched without a question being raised. I'm not a very big fan of the Indiana Jones Trilogy, (Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is entirely out of the question) but I will insist that this is the best of them, especially for an older audience. I especially like the comic relief they had with the boy from Bangkok (Short Round). Go into this film eager for the Classic, adventure packed Indiana Jones that we know and love, not as flawless, politically correct masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amrish Puri performs better than Hollywood actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indiana Jones is a movie made by Hollywood biggies like Steven Spielberg, it is considered one of the best movies of Hollywood by some who have not seen anything outside Hollywood. Amrish Puri playing Mola Ram could be seen outperforming the so called biggies of Hollywood, when the challenge comes their acting is seen as too ordinary with card board expressions. The only emotions seen in the movie are running around, moving all over the place with ropes and guns with the hero in his trademark hat. The only real performer is Amrish Puri with realistic emotions. No wonder Steven Spielberg had to concede &amp; tell to the world of Cinema that Amrish Puri is the best villain of world cinema. It is sheer injustice lesser actors got Oscar &amp; Bafta but the real performer had to be contended with a mediocre film maker's praise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a diamond exchange goes awry and a plane crash-lands in India, Indiana Jones decides to help a fraught village to find it's stolen children and mystical stones.With dated effects and a problematic shoot, Harrison injured his back much of the action was undertaken by veteran stuntman Vic Armstrong, it's still an adequate Indy adventure.Clearly mostly filmed on sound stages it lacks the gritiness of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Characters like Sallah, Ravenwood and Brody are sorely missed and the viewer is quickly forced to fall in love with the new leads, Kate Capshaw and Jonathan Ke Quan. Quan is good fun but the film looses it's edge due to the Goonies actors round house kicks and wise cracks. That said, some of the dialogue shindigs between him and Indy are quite well executed. Capshaw is fine when she's not screaming but is very theatrical.Harrison Ford is again excellent as Indiana Jones and although set before Raiders appears less intelligent when donning the hat and whip, an almost reverse Superman Clark Kent character issues due to Willard Huyck &amp; Gloria Katz screenplay.George Lucas story is decent and incorrectly slated for being dark, but Raiders was and equally dark, brawls, shootouts, ghosts, Nazis' and a poisoned monkey to same a few. If anything there's too much comedy in Temple. However, when Indy is serious, in conversation to the villagers, playing politics, cultural differences and fighting Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) guards it's good sincere fun.Unfortunalty, the script is so unbalanced it doesn't surpass or equal it predecessor, falling short of a classic adventure. That said, the costumes and stunt are great. With John Williams legendary score, an amazing musical number to open the film and some fantastic set pieces Temple of Doom is enjoyable enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Spielberg, what the hell happened here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, the second in Indiana Jones franchise, the famous explorer goes to India, where he will face a strange and dangerous cult that kidnaps children in a nearby village of their temple. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this prequel to the first film has script by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, and keeps Harrison Ford in the title role.See this movie and compare it with the first of the franchise makes you want to ask Spielberg what the hell went wrong. After a film as interesting as "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (which revealed some flaws, but had a very own charm), this one is a real cold shower. Kate Capshaw is a perfect casting error, never managing to overcome the mediocrity. Harrison Ford, although don't embarrassed his character, also doesn't appeared to be properly inspired, making his role without much emotion. For posterity, however, are the scenes of the banquet in the palace, who can start sonorous laughter from any audience. The script is not necessarily interesting, missing movement, the action is very concentrated only in certain sequences. The photograph is bad and boring, colors are too loaded, especially red tones, which is not good, although the visual effects have won an Oscar. The costumes are well imagined and some scenarios as well but the soundtrack brings no surprises or novelties.People say that there is no love like the first, and this is true in the movies: after a movie like "Raiders of the Lost Ark" was very hard not to disappoint the audience, but it would have been easier to please with a smarter script, a more vivid and adventurous story, a less forced photograph and a main actress better and less noisy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom isn't sinking. It isn't crashing! It's just mediocre alright. I have to say, while the movie is very campy, have a darker tone, and takes itself more seriously than it needs to; it's a lot better than the overused CGI mess that was 2008's Indiana Jones &amp; the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Directed by Steven Spielberg, and co-written and product by George Lucas, the movie is the second installment in the Indiana Jones franchise and a prequel to the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark. Set in 1935 India, the movie tells the story of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), who find himself being ask, by a desperate village to find a mystical stone that will help rescue their missing children. He agrees on it, and he goes one on one, with a ruthless Thuggee cult. Can Indiana Jones stop them or will the cult continue to kidnap the children of India for child slavery? Watch the movie to find out! While, this movie is beloved by most Indy fans, the movie is not, without faults. Without spoiling the movie, the movie has some of the silliest scenarios, the stupidest lines, and the most obnoxious characters! Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) has to be one of the most annoying female characters, ever made. I really can do without the force romance between her and Indy. It was bit too much. She's unbearable! She always whinny, complaining and screaming. She never shuts up. I don't know why, the writers for this film, thought this would be funny. Every time, she's b*tch. I want to turn off the film. I really can't stand her, useless damsel of distress persona. Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round, Indiana child sidekick wasn't so bad. I just wish, he didn't shouts almost every single one of his lines. I don't know why Indiana is hanging out with a child, but whatever. I like Amrish Puri as Mola Ram, the villain. He was very sinister. Most of the other supporting cast were alright in their roles. It was cool to see Dan Akyroyd in a small cameo. Most of the characters were a bit too cartoony. The movie was temporarily banned in India due to its offensive representation of their culture and its religion, Hinduism. That dinner scene with the over the top, Indian stereotypes was a bit culturally insensitive. I'll give it a pass, because it's based on the 1939 Gunga Din mixed with 1954's Secret of the Incas and those films was pretty incorrect when it comes to foreign cultures, too. The movie was also criticized for promoting the concept of a white savior rescuing Indians from the clutches of an Indian villain. I don't see anything, wrong with that, because it has Asian characters helping Indy. Like the previous film, the movie has a lot of creepy scenes and visuals. Seeing a guy get his heart rip out his body and then torch was very crazy! Some people might also find the children being slaves, a bit too disturbing. The film got heavy criticism for its violence, but in my opinion, it's not as bad, as Raiders of the Lost Ark in the use of blood and gore. The first film was a large part of the reason the PG-13 rating was created in the US. Another problem of the film is the action. I like most of it. The bridge and mine cart scene were fun, but when it comes to being realistic and logic, it was mostly a miss. The worst had to be the flying raft scene. Its goes way beyond any realm of plausibility. It was a bit distracting. I always, wonder why didn't the pilots just stab, choke or shot them on the airplane. It would had, save them, a lot more time. They conveniently fly them all the way to India, just to jump out of the plane in the middle of nowhere? I guess, they don't care about their cargo, nor the fact, that they jump out of the plane to a snowy wasteland. Let's see, how long, those pilots are able to survive in the mountains. It was stupid. The musical number at the Shanghai nightclub was also jarring. I don't know how a giant soundstage was able to be put in that small restaurant, but that just nit-picky. One of the biggest gap of logic is how this film is supposed to be a prequel to Raiders, but yet none of the characters return, and Indy would still later scoff at the suggestion of magic, despite seeing clear evidence of its existence in this movie. That one is very mind puzzling. Spielberg has stated in his interviews that this film was his least favorite of the Indiana Jones films, and the best thing about it is that he met his future ex-wife, Kate Capshaw while making it. Harrison Ford himself was not entirely comfortable with the film's story and, again, according to some sources, he was not entirely happy with how the film turned out either. I have to agree. I didn't like how Indiana Jones turn to a bad guy, Indiana Jones. I was never a huge fan of those hero possessed trope. It's just downright unpleasant. George Lucas was very depress, when making the film, as he was going through a divorce at the time. Composer John Williams was the only one, that didn't seem like he hate, making the film. His score really shine in this film. His reprised theme song for Indiana Jones is just as catchy today, as it was, when it first came out. It's so memorable. Despite the fact, that most of the film is set in caves, or in sets. The movie did make great use of exotic location, when filming in Sri Lanka. Overall: The movie is ridiculous, yet ridiculously entertaining. It's worth watching, even with the camp factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Once Spielberg Has Got His Facts All Wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg Has Made a Mockery Of The Ancient Civilistion Of India. India was the civilization that invented the wheel and the numeric system we now use in day-to-day life. Their religious system, astronomy and general non-violence to animals are idealistic principals. Hindu's are generally strict vegetarians and only some eat eggs, chicken, fish and goat's meat to supplement their diet. And even those are not strict Hindu's. A Hindu by principle is abstemious and strictly vegetarian.Spielberg shows in the film the royalty of India feasting on beetles and snakes, eating raw monkey brains and drinking soup which has the eyes of some unknown animal.Her he makes a gross mistake - he has confused Hindu's with the Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese/Malaysians. It is they who eat the foods which are tabooed by the Hindu religion. That aside, the film is superb none the less and very imaginative. In fact I think it was Spielberg's first visit to India. Indian cuisine is one of the best in the world and I am sure he must have sampled some. The film star notable Bollywood actor Amrish Puri who has also starred in Richard Attenborough's epic Gandhi. Seth Roshan is also cast in the film and he also starred in Gandhi. Harrison Ford is at his handsomest. Opposite him is the notable actress Cate Capshaw(Black Rain, Just Cause) and the child actor Jonathan Ke Quan(The Goonies Breathing Fire). The plot of the film deals with sacred stones known as Shiva Ling. A Shiva Ling is stolen from a village and Indiana Jones goes to help the villagers. The film opens with Indiana Jones (or Indy) narrowly escapes the clutches of Lao Che, a crime boss in Shanghai. With his eleven-year old Chinese sidekick, Short Round (or Shorty), and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indiana flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unknown to them, is owned by Lao. The pilots leave the plane to crash over the Himalayas, but the trio narrowly manage to escape on an inflatable boat and ride down the slopes into a raging river. They come to Mayapore, a desolate village in northern India, where the poor villagers believe them to have been sent by the Hindu god Shiva and enlist their help to retrieve the sacred Sivalinga stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. See the film to find out what happens next. Similar films: King Solomon's Mines, Allan Quatermain And The Lost City Of Gold, The Jewel Of The Nile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe it or not, some fanboys debate the superiority of Temple of Doom as opposed to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The consensus seems to be that, for all intents and purposes, Temple of Doom is the better picture. Hashing out which one is "better" is certainly a tricky proposition; after all, they contain many of the same elements?as noted in my previous rambling?and are the two Indy films that feature non- Biblical artifacts as MacGuffins.Here's what I think: Temple of Doom is, in fact, a more solidly put together motion picture. On the flip side, I actually enjoy watching Kingdom of the Crystal Skull more than I do the former.But let's focus on the movie in question. Temple of Doom is not Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's that simple. The story isn't as compelling, the romance is duller, and the adventure doesn't have the same sense of urgency that something like the Ark of the Covenant naturally generates. Though there's whip-crackin' aplenty, some of the more hammy scenes (again, this is pre-Crystal Skull) in the entire series rear their ugly faces in this second outing. For me, the worst of the worst is the "card playing" scene which involves, Indy, Willie, and Short Round. They've set up camp for the night in a jungle clearing, and while our protagonist and his sidekick are bickering over hidden cards and underhanded tactics, Willie is darting from one side of the set to the other, screaming her head off as a myriad of creatures converge on their location. It might draw a grin from the most ardent of Indy devotees, but it is, to be perfectly frank, an annoying scene.Then there's the blood brain-washing. Dr. Jones is forced to consume some sort of black magic concoction that causes him to turn into a mindless Mol Ram follower. Amazingly, Short Round discovers that the spell can be broken if Indy is taunted with a white hot torch. Er? what?Okay, so a lot of this movie doesn't make sense, and it doesn't have one-tenth the charm of its predecessor. But it's still vastly entertaining. Oh, and did I mention there's a cameo by Dan Aykroyd?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Temple of Doom:An Obvious Step Down From Raiders Of The Lost Ark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second of the George Lucas/Steven Spielberg Indiana Jones epics is set a year or so before the events in Raiders of the Lost Ark.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is an adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is the second film in the Indiana Jones franchise and prequel to Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. Producer and co-writer George Lucas decided to make the film a prequel as he did not want the Nazis to be the villains again.Arriving in India, Indiana Jones is asked by a desperate village to find a mystical stone. He agrees, stumbling upon a Kali-worshipping thuggee cult practicing child slavery, black magic, and ritual human sacrifice.After a brief brouhaha involving a precious vial and a wild ride down a raging Himalyan river, Indy gets down to the problem at hand: retrieving a precious gem and several kidnapped young boys on behalf of a remote East Indian village. His companions this time around include a dim-bulbed, easily frightened nightclub chanteuse, and a feisty 12-year-old kid named Short Round. Throughout, the plot takes second place to the thrills, which include a harrowing roller-coaster ride in an abandoned mineshaft and Indy's rescue of the heroine from a ritual sacrifice. Set years before the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun.Again you will savor the Indiana Jones schizophrenia: by day a bow-tied, bespectacled archaeologist; by night a resourceful swaggerer, whom Ford brings to life as a modern blend of Bogie and the Duke, with just a glint of misfit psychopathy in his eyes.This is the kind of movie where your date is always grabbing your forearm in a viselike grip, as unbearable excitement unfolds on the screen. After the movie is over, you've had a great time but your arm is black-and-blue for a week.It may be too "dark" for some, but Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom remains an ingenious adventure spectacle that showcases one of Hollywood's finest filmmaking teams in vintage form.It is still a must-see but it is an obvious step down from its stellar predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Aw Shut Up, Willie!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the Indy films, this one is the one I cherish the most from child hood.I was surprised to see it was not on the Top 250, so i set out to buy all three of the classic films so I could view them again. This film was just as enjoyable as I remembered, all except one thing: Kate f*ckin Capshaw. She was campy and completely over-the-top her performance was pathetic and a distraction at times. I simply despised her in comparison to Karen Allen. Karen Allen's character was much more respectable and much better off as a lead actress with enjoyable grit yet undeniable sexiness. All Capshaw does is complain about her broken nails and the like, imagine that. Acknowledging that weak point, Capshaw actually pipes down quite a bit once the story really gets serious. Once you push her aside, you can see how great this film really is.Harrison Ford is just plain great as our hero, and plays the role perfectly. Johnathan Ke Quan starts off all right, but by the end of the film you will embrace him as a great character, and as quite the bad-ass. Despite all the great action, cinematography and excellent score, my favorite scene just happens to be where Short Round and Dr. Jones are playing poker, and even though Willie is making an ass of herself in the background, it's such a great character moment for the two. I just love that scene! And Amrish Puri was a great villain, perhaps not as threatening as Nazis obviously, but all the same very entertaining.And everything else with the film simply falls into place. John William's score is just ominous and exhilarating all at once, and really adds to the atmosphere of every scene. And Spielberg definitely knows how to use the camera, making every tension filled moment mouth-dropping. Excellent pacing and a well-crafted story make it a very satisfying work over all. To many, this is easily the darkest of the trilogy, and perhaps it is, but I rather like it that way. Why sugar coat it?Spielberg supposedly feels ashamed of this one because of this as well. Oh, you mean because without little boys' and girls' mother's approval the film wouldn't be as marketable. Regardless, the film was a box office hit at the time, so why all the negative reviews? not only that, but the first film, basically all three of them equally deserve PG-13 ratings, seeing as all three have pretty intense violence. So, with that out in the open I believe this film is my favorite, and all around a good movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was an okay film, some things I did not like about it though!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the film was okay, except for some things I had seen in the film. Like the scene where Willie is being lowered into the lava pit, I noticed that when she was going down the chains holding the cage were not moving, but she was screaming. I also noticed before she was put into the cage thing that she was wearing a lot of necklaces and big ear rings when put into the cage, that when Mola Ram was coming toward her the necklaces and ear rings had somehow come off of her nothing beautiful was on her besides the thing on her head. Also in this scene I thought that when Mola Ram was coming toward her it looked like he was smiling at her, and he wanted to scare her by pretending to almost rip out her heart. And he laughed when he was calling Indy(now under black sleep of Kali ma)to finish putting the last chain brace on her wrist. I loved all the scenes in the film but the story concept was way off. Like I know Indy, Willie, and Shorty are trying to save a village from a bad mess involving their stones being taken, but when they had gotten to the palace and saw the thuggee ceremony and then captured and then escape with the slave kids and the stones and killing Mola Ram and saving the day. But that really has nothing to do with Indy and the last film the way it was but this is really bad. I hope that the next film is better than this film, because there was so much wrong with this film, I can't think of anything good in this film. I hope that no one watches this film and writes good reviews about it because they need to watch the film over a few times and see the problems for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A trifle overblown, but decent follow-up to a brilliant movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On its own it is a fun yarn, but compared to the brilliant Raiders of the Lost Ark it is a disappointment. The story is rather overblown and not as well thought out, Kate Capshaw's shrill and annoying heroine is one of the least engaging characters in the series and the character of Short Round didn't do much for me either. However, the sets and cinematography once again are fabulous, as is the score. The script has some nice touches, the direction is good and the pacing is brisk. There is also some terrific action especially the wild roller-coaster ride through the Indian Mine, and Harrison Ford is still very engaging as Indy. On the whole, disappointing but it is still pretty decent. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad 2nd Indy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this review I will have reviewed all of the Indy movies on IMDb. For years I had despised this second Indy outing and last week I sat down to rewatch it after a good number of years and to my surprise I ended up enjoying it. TOD is pure excitement from beginning to end,the opening twenty minutes is simply breathtaking and the rope bridge sequence is easily the best thing ever done in an Indiana Jones movie. The plot as it goes involves Indy ending up in an Indian village after almost being killed when his plane crashes. He is accompanied by his sidekick Short Round and a bar singer called Wilhelmina Scott(Spielberg's future wife). Indy is told that a sacred stone has been stolen and that their children have been taken over by evil spirits. So Indy and his two companions go off in he search for the children and the sacred stone. They stay in a Maharajah's palace and later they discover an underground passage which leads them to Mola Ram. What happens after that is a series of exciting chases. Being a huge Bollywood fan the main highlight for me was the casting of Bollywood veteran Amrish Puri. It was his role as Mola Ram that paved a path for him in Bollywood and made him one of Bollywood's best known villains. I will end up saying that whilst TOD has improved quite considerably it is nowhere near as good as Raiders or The Last Crusade. I will rate TOD a 6/10 which is pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks The Soul Of Indy Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the first movie of the Indiana Jones series, Raiders of the Lost Ark, I was pretty much excited to see it's sequel, But the next movie in the offering that came 3 years after the first one, is actually a prequel to the original one. The movie starts in Shanghai and after some initial fight and chase scenes and going through mountains, rivers and crashed planes moves to northern India .The task in hand for Indy this time is to save a poverty, famine struck Indian village by bringing back the missing children of the village and a special "Shiv- Linga" which got stolen by the evil forces of a certain haunted palace. The evil villain behind this is none other than the great Amrish Puri ji who plays his part to perfection (His big eyes and voice help in his portrayal of Mola Ram)This movie had additional thrills and fast paced scenes than the original one. Just because of the success of the first one, Spielberg wanted to fulfill the expectations of Indiana Jones lovers by giving them everything extra. But this is were it lacks the soul which the first movie had. But one thing I will mention, the success of Indiana Jones series lies in the combination of great thrills and comic timings of the actors especially Ford . The lead actress in this movie Capshaw is irritating in certain scenes. The little friend of Indy played by a Chinese guy amazes you with his stunts . Overall, strictly a one time watchRatings : 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated Indiana Jones adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" was the second Indiana Jones film helmed by Steven Spielberg. In it, Jones finds himself in India and sets out in search of a mysterious stone that may be linked to a resurgence of the Thuggee cult.The tone is a bit darker than the first film, which may be one reason why it is not as highly regarded. Another reason may be the choice of Jones's companions this time around.Kate Capshaw (later Mrs. Steven Spielberg) plays a lounge singer who typifies the 'damsel in distress' role while young Jonathon Ke Quan plays 'Short Round', a sort of sidekick for Indy. I don't mind these characters at all but I can see how others might find them irritating.As before, Harrison Ford excels in the lead role and here his character is developed even further. There's not much worth noting in terms of supporting roles but the cast and their performances are uniformly dependable.Spielberg's direction is expertly handled and I think that the film looks better than the first in the series. While there are a few visual effects that don't quite measure up, the overall presentation is attractive. John Williams contributes the score once again, which incorporates the classic theme first heard in the previous film. Again he was rewarded with an Oscar nomination for his work.Overall, I think that this film is a worthy follow-up to "Raiders of the Lost Ark". It is an enjoyable ride and certainly worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven sequel with some scenes unsuitable for children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel (actually a prequel) to the wildly popular 'Raiders' is an extremely uneven film. It begins well with an excellent shootout in a casino. Then follows a long and boring mid-section with Indiana (Harrison Ford) trying to rescue some kids from the clutches of the satanic priest Mola Ram (Amrish Puri). Puri is suitably hammy as the villain but some scenes involving beating hearts are just too yucky for a supposedly family-friendly film. Thankfully a thrilling climax partially redeems the film. Definitely watchable on television or DVD but young children may be grossed out. Beware! Overall 6/10</fullReview>

Additionally, the love interest is a whining blonde, who requires no great cultural misunderstanding to get into scrapes, although Kate Capshaw is excellent.Nonetheless, the action is as slick and witty as before and there's no need to feel short-changed, just less engaged. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We owe this film the PG-13 rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, while it may seem tame to some people today, this was pretty nasty stuff back in 1984 and almost got the dreaded R-rating. Spielberg negotiated for a PG and later negotiated the PG-13 rating which would characterize the Batman films and what have you.We all know the plot: After nearly getting killed at the Club Obi-Wan in Shang Hai, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and his sidekicks Mrs. Spielberg- I mean lounge singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) land in East India and agree to steal back three sacred stones that were stolen from a village now on its last legs. Chaos and mayhem ensues.Many have called it the worst of the Indy trilogy and many have damned it as one of the worst sequels ever made. I don't agree that it's as bad as many people say it is, but I do agree it's not on par with "Raiders of the Lost Ark" or "The Last Crusade", even though it's better than most of today's sequels (Harry Potter &amp; The Chamber of Secrets, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, The Matrix Revolutions, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, etc).Harrison Ford's still a great Indy, but he doesn't feel quite the same here. He feels more like a mercenary and not the dashing archeologist explorer we knew and loved in "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "The Last Crusade". Granted he has to be a little mercenarious in order to get those artifacts, but it bothers us that that's the only side of him we see here, and not the side of him that was just an everyday guy. Yeah, I know, Willie's annoying and wouldn't last in a fight against Marion or Elsa, but I don't like bashing her since so many others have already done it and a character's only as useful as she's written to be. Short Round had his moments.Plenty of stunts, but too much gore for the kiddies. If you're a parent with children, beware. Of course, if Lucas hadn't gotten divorced before writing this, we might have been spared, even if I do respect the need to be as different as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must...kill...Kate Capshaw!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most flawed of the Indiana Jones movies. The main reason is the character is Willie, the most annoying, whining female character I have ever seen in a movie ever. I wanted to duct tape her mouth shut, tie her up, tie her to a really heavy weight, take her out and sink her to the bottom of the ocean. The character is really so annoying you'll want to write death threats to Kate Capshaw.BUT for every annoying thing Willie did, Short Round made up for it. I love that kid! I found him charming and hilarious which is strange because I usually dislike child actors. He is basically there to balance out the annoyance caused by Willie.Indy is of course as lovable and heroic as ever, that goes without saying. Unfortunately this movie doesn't really know where it wants to go. It seems to be on opposite ends, one minute being really hammy and crazy, the other being really dark. In the latter half of the movie it picks up with some great action sequences which make the movie an overall fun experience, not up to par with Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Last Crusade, but a worthwhile classic in the end.Just beware of Kate Capshaw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I miss something? "Temple" seems fine to me...(minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people seem to dislike (in some cases, even hate) the second chapter of the Indiana Jones series. I have to ask them, why is this so?A lot of people seem to harp on Willie Scott as annoying. She's SUPPOSED to be annoying - Indie and Short Round react plenty of times to Willie's screaming and complaining. Not every female on a movie screen has to be an assertive "grrl-power" fighting machine. In fact, I'd wager that many people, male or female, would react the same way to the crazy stuff that happens in "Temple" (hey, fall from a building, get chased by gangsters, get fed monkey brains, and fall from a suspension bridge, and you'll be screaming, too!).The movie moves along at a great pace, has plenty of exciting set-pieces (a wild nightclub fight, a freefall from a plane into a river, a crazy mine car chase, the aforementioned huge suspension bridge, etc.), and certainly "feels" like an Indiana Jones movie. Harrison Ford is in great shape here and has jumped into his character with all the experience of "Raiders". The fighting is more natural and less stilted than "Raiders," and that scene where Indy cuts the bridge is really, really cool.I won't go as far to say that "Temple" is the best of the series (IMHO that honor goes to "Raiders" for its overall originality and plot, as well as for the score), but it's certainly worthy of the Indiana Jones name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half-hearted sequel to classic original....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, I had reservations about any sequel to it, as the film was a complete story in itself and worked pretty much without the need for one. Like BACK TO THE FUTURE (which in spite of having two reasonably entertaining sequels, was good on it's own), INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM had so much to live up to and unfortunately, the result doesn't quite come off. Hopefully, the new DVD version, which reportedly will manage to correct some of the awful matte effects that were so clear to all even in 1984, will do justice and restore the fans' faith in the movie.The initial problem with THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is that it doesn't move through as many locations as the original did. Indiana Jones was meant to be a globe-trotting archaologist and the idea of that is not capitalised on in this.Another problem is that there isn't a villain in the film that matches Paul Freeman in RAIDERS. Roshan Seth and Amrish Puri as Chatta Lal and Mola Ram respectively, don't seem to play the kind of mind games and close conflict discussion games with Ford as well. Ke Huy Quan is another irritating supporting kid and Kate Capshaw doesn't have the gutsiness of Karen Allen.I also felt there was too much straightforward action in one place and not enough suspense. The Temple sequence goes on far too long (although, to be fair, that is the point of the film itself) and I would have preferred to see at least a couple more sequences towards the end of the film.I suppose it is worth doing any sequel, but I hoped it would be better than this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Action Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the Indiana Jones movies and this installment is my least favorite. However, I hate to say the word "least" when 3rd place among the Indiana Jones movies is still way better than almost any other film.Many people seem to dislike this movie because it is not Raiders and it is not Last Crusade. Personally, I applaud Speilberg and Lucas for making each of the films unique, all adding to the many facets of Indiana Jones. For one, if the heroine in Temple of Doom had not been a little spoiled and whiny, she would've either been a boring bystander or a tough Marion Ravenwood-type. Marion was a great character but there was no use rehashing her. I think the Willie Scott character was a great foil for Indy and the two definitely worked well together onscreen.Temple of Doom is an engaging adventure film with one exciting action sequence after another. Like Raiders, Temple starts with a thrilling, nonstop action sequence that lets you know what's in store. The movie continues to deliver with a sinking, spiked ceiling, a mine car chase, and a rope bridge among others. On the lighter side, there is great interaction between Indy and his sidekick, Short Round, as they play cards, and between Indy and heroine, Willie, in the temple. All around, the humor and action combine to make a great movie, even if it is darker than the other two.Definitely worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was younger I felt that Temple of Doom was better than Raiders, with all those special effects and stunts. But now as i look at it, now having greater movie intelligence, I say Raiders was better yet this Indiana film boasts a good time none the less. Indiana Jones, while on his way to Delli, meets night club singer Willie. The two and along with Indie's good friend Short Round, stumble into India and are asked to retrieve the a town's sacred stones from an organization of voodo fighters. The organization posesses 3 of the stones (5 in total, 3 of which were taken from the village) and are using the town's children as slave minors to find the other 2. Featuring a dead on Ford, an incredibly whimpy heroine, and a cool yet sometimes annoying kid side kick, Indiana Jones reviels what type of effects can be created without the use of a computer. all the scenery and action are well done. The main things that weaken this Jones movie is the heroine and the mood of the plot. There's a lot of darkness with some of the bloody sequences but this movie ensures that making a sequal to an incredible blockbuster is possible. I.J.T.D gets 6.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie/ Best Parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely the worst in the series. Harrison's performance was about as hollow as it was in Bladerunner and his sidekicks are absolutely worse! Short Round's character is totally out of place in this story and just because Willie is bigger than Marion doesn't mean she's better.The plot line also has nothing interesting about it. Going after a Shankara Stone doesn't seem that adventurous as the Ark or the Holy Grail.And why in thee world is this a blasted prequel!?However, out of all the Indiana Jones movies this one has the most memorable scenes (here are the SPOILERS). The sacrificial scene where the cult leader rips the guy's heart out is just as fantastic as the boulder scene in Raiders(scarier than I remembered). The sets of the Temple are the best art design work out of any movie of the trilogy and the costumed villains look great too. The mine car scene was classic (even if a bit hokey) and the shakey bridge over the river of crocodiles was cool as well.I don't understand all this talk of the movie being racist just because the enemies are Indian. I have a German friend who thinks the other Indiana Jones films are prejudice. After all, the war has been over a long time now. And any real historian knows that just as many good things came out of Germany as India. And besides, the Thuggee Cult of Kali was also real and a mass-murdering evil which plagued India for over two hundred years taking the lifes of countless numbers of Indian natives. Anyway, watching Harrison Ford beat up accultic Third Worlders is just as exciting as seeing him beat up white-supremisist Nazis. I like the whole Montezuma/Qartez type of adventure.I just want the movie to come out on DVD so I can watch the good parts when I feel like it without having to trudge through the whole thing, because this is not as good as Raiders by a long shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Weakest Indy, But Still A Treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the original is one of the best movies of all time, how exactly do you make a sequel? Spielberg solved this tricky problem in 1984 by making his sequel to Raiders Of The Lost Ark darker, scarier, and more violent than the amazing original. Rather than the fun, serial style of Raiders, Spielberg opts instead for a dark, more horror-influenced film that actually takes place before its predecessor. Harrison Ford once again puts on the dusty old hat for his signature role as Indiana Jones. This time he finds himself in India, when a poor but deeply religious town asks him to track down a missing stone that, according to legend, will bring prosperity back to their community. Adding to the urgency is the fact that all of the small local children have mysteriously disappeared. Joining Indy this time is a pluckish young boy and a whiny damsel-in-distress type. Kate Capshaw brings a good sense of humor to the movie, but unfortunately she could never match Indy's original female sidekick, the brave and intimidating Marion. Indy's advisaries look equally menacing, however. Filling in the Nazi's shoes this time around is an Ancient murderous cult steeped in live human sacrifices. Can Indy defeat the cult and capture the stone? Of course he can, he's an action hero. It's the getting there that's the fun, and in it's final act, this movie offers up enough of it to almost match the first.Unfortunately, it's the shaky start that sets this film several notches below Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Even so, it's an above average film from the action genre, and a must-see for all fans. It's a satisfying movie, even though at the end, you may find yourself wondering, "Didn't Indy have a class to teach or something?"(***/****)</fullReview>

Why would they built a minecart track over a pit of lava? I know they had no regard for the workers, but even evil baddies have "plain common sense." The heat would certainly do something to the sleepers and tracks after long exposure. What were you thinking, Spielburg??Rather watch the other two.

		<fullReview>This Indiana Jones film in an absolute embarrassment, and completely ruins the series' quality as a whole trilogy. The first film is a decent entry that establishes the series as a slight fantasy take on the archaeological profession, but it features some of that annoying Speilberg "cuteness." This second film, however, is drowned in it as Speilberg and Lucas aim for the 5-10 year-olds here. Short Round is a terribly annoying addition to the cast (an attempt to lure younger audiences), and Kate Capshaw is like a second rate Lucy Ricardo. The movie is over the top on comedy and fantasy, but is oddly mixed with extremely dark images and sub-plots (kids used as slaves). This film would be better paired with "The Goonies" rather than the other Indiana Jones films. Anyone who likes "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and hasn't seen any other Indiana Jones film should avoid this one and go straight to "Indiana Jones: And the Last Crusade," which redeemed the series somewhat.</fullReview>

There is a sense that we, the audience, are actually on the same adventure with Indy, going from shanghai to india. This seems very modern, and gives us another dimension to indiana jones' character. He is a cultured person, who travels around the world. and he has friends all over the world. I think that is a great message to kids of all ages. Granted again, this is not as "adult" as the other indy adventures, but this one brings out the kid in all of us. Spielberg wanted to extend the courage and humanity of indiana jones to the children of the world. and I applaud spielberg and lucas for their love of mankind. And who doesnt like some comedy in an adventure movie? i think it makes the movie so much more enjoyable. Whenever i watch the movie, i never get the sense that it is an outdated movie. it always seem new to me. So, please people, open your mind for once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sequel to one of the greatest films of all time is a bit disappointing. There are great special effects, impressive set design, and the memorable mine car chase, but the story is weak, the villains seem stereotypical, and the comedic aspect just doesn't work. It's definitely watchable, but it needed a much better script. 2/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe The Least Of The Trilogy, But Not For The Reasons Stated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is less a comment on the film and more a response to the original review. While I'll agree that the film is the least of the three Indiana Jones movies, as a fan of it, I can tell you that it's not for lack of action. Indeed, what's /most/ interesting about this film is that, completely opposite to the existing review, anyone who sits down and watches it will note that it's a nearly continuous linear path. Every scene in it comes from the scene before. Whereas RAIDERS and THE LAST CRUSADE feature "stops", wherein they deliver exposition, add characters, and most importantly, change locales, this movie opens with the musical number that brings Willie and Short Round together with Indy. The three of them escape. That escape leads their having the famous "monkey brains" dinner to finding the evil temple. They go into the temple and have adventures there. They see the human sacrifice. Indy becomes evil. Everything else happens until they come out of the temple and onto the bridge. The bridge scene occurs. Then the movie ends. In other words, while the opening of RAIDERS takes place in one temple just to introduce Indiana Jones, then we hear about the Ark, then they go after the Ark, then the Ark is moved and they have to change locations again, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is one continuous trip, and thus fascinating on that level. (And the scene where Short Round and Indy are playing cards while Willie is getting attacked by everything in the jungle is /hilarious/.) That said, why does everybody hate this movie? It's GORY. Really gory. And while I'm sure many people would appreciate blood and guts in a gore flick, in an Indiana Jones movie (read: ostensibly for kids, although after reading Grimm's Fairy Tales and RL Stine's GOOSEBUMPS, not to mention attending public school, I can't imagine what kind of wimp kid gets frightened by anything anymore), that's not seen as appropriate, I guess. So on that basis, I too say it's the least of the three because it takes the character in places he was maybe never meant to go. Nonetheless, Hitchcock had a dark side, and it's nice to see, in this movie (along with POLTERGEIST and THE LOST WORLD) that Steven Spielberg has one too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can say that this was the more violent, less "indy" of the indiana jones sagas. I can say that I prefer seeing Indy fighting Nazis and chasing religious artifacts. I can say, for short, that I prefer the other two movies to this one. But I won't say that this movie was bad. It really is ultra-violent, and it has some too childish moments (the table scene, which I remember commenting in kindergarten), but, for however "no" this movie may be, i'll be compelled to shout "yes!". For we are on Spielberg's home territory, and he was doing the thing he liked the most. And I must say that he didn't fail. "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" may be a popcorn movie, but audiences won't forget it after they see it. There are just too damn historical moments for it to pass by: the club obi wan shootout scene behind the gong, the descending ceiling with spikes, the mine-cart sequence, the giant wave, the rope bridge... you name it. I also thought that Indy explored new limits to his sanity, and Harrison Ford show his true potential. The film is finely crafted, John Williams' score is a oscar-nominated must, and we get in touch with a director's ability to become a child for two hours and even so managing to get out of it and do the beautiful and mature "Empire of the Sun". A thrilling experience, to be watched in a light mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As I Remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw Temple of Doom after 16 years, and it was more like a trip to the Cenote of Disappointment. When I first saw this film, I did not know so much about India and Hindu culture as I do today. Now I am able to see that the film's premise is a misconception of the Hindu spiritual order--in fact, it is a struggle to fit that order into a dualism Western audiences would be able to understand. Thus, we have the goddess Kali as the "evil" side and Siva as the "good" side, and a film wandering lost between the two. Hindu thought, however, isn't dualistic. True, Kali tends to be regarded as a darker entity, but she is also looked upon as a mother figure and a protector. Siva is no god of goodness and light--he is both creator and destroyer. Combine these with a representation of the Thuggee cult unlike anything I've ever read about, and I had a film with no substance giving an impression of the Indian subcontinent that is blown way out of proportion. Maybe the film wouldn't be ruined for everyone, but it was for me.</fullReview>

Yes, it's THAT kind of funny! With Willie (Kate Capshaw) screaming at absolutely *everything*(!), Short Round, who's idol is Indie and is always sporting those funny one-liners with his cute accent. And, of course, Harrison Ford, who needs no introduction, even as a comedian. He is hilarious in this flick.  The funniest scene in this movie I'd say is the dinner party, with the interesting food! (Yummy...)  People say this was the worst Indiana Jones movie of the series. I've seen all three and I would say that this is the only movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. I mean, come on, how seriously are you supposed to take someone who calls himself Indiana Jones?  So, instead of being *completely* serious, &lt;&lt;The Temple of Doom&gt;&gt; compromises this for hilarity and even more action than the other two. Check this one out, it's my favorite "Indie".Willie: That's the Mata-Rajah, KID?! Short: Maybe he like older woman. Willie: I hate that elephant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford just didn't have the heart for this one. This movie was BAD. Horrible script, horrible special-FX(although I didn't think harshly on that), and terrible performances (with the exception of Harrison Ford). Kate Capshaw couldn't act out of a paper bag; I found her IRRITATING. Sure, there a few highlights of the film, like the mine-car chase and the "monkey brains", but the negatives outweigh the positives in this one.One of the reasons I also didn't like about it was the fact that it strays away from Indy tradition. There is no religious artifact, no Sallah, no Marcus Brody, and no "wrath-of-God"( for lack of a better term) scene that is usual in Indy lore. Perhaps that is why it is the worst.PS&gt;&gt;&gt; Even without the gore, the movie would still BOMB.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very disappointing "prequel" to the first movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not seen this movie until just this week, and I was thouroghly (?sp) disappointed with it. I love Raiders, and Last Crusade.I understand that Lucas and Spielberg were trying to create a different kind of scenario for Indy, but this was not a very good attempt. The story was not very original, the sets were so so, and the mine car scene was a little dragged out. The gross-our scenes were overly done, even if meant in a campy way. The Kate Capshaw character was whinney and annoying. Personally I liked the Nazi stories better. They were well thought out, and Hey People (for those bashing the use of the Nazi stories) It was the Mid-1930's Nazi's were EVERYWHERE. And especially when talking about artifacts. If any of you know your history Hitler was trying to scour the world for any and all art and historical treasures, so it makes sense that Indy, being an ARCHEOLOGIST, would run into the Nazi faction quite often. That aside, Temple seemed to not know what it wanted to be. The humorous scenes did not mesh well with some of the more serious scenes, and the action seemed contrived. It was too much like one huge chase scene with no real plot in the middle. And there were way too many "cliffhanger" like sequences.I can understand liking this movie to some extent, it is one of those movies to watch when you are bored with nothing else to do. But those who love this movie saw way more than what was really there. As I stated above the plot was weak, the acting (aside from Ford) was weak, and the action sequences were totally contrived. This movie was not terrible, just lukewarm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This much-maligned entry is second only to Raiders in quality. A lot of people rant about the violence, the lack of a strong female heroine, and the overall frivolousness of the film, to which I say BAH!!! Unworthy heathens! Spielberg, who in recent years has come to view the film as a "mistake", was trying for a very strong 30's B-movie feel, and I think he succeeded.(makes me wonder how he views "Always", not to mention "1941". Yes, this is not a film for children, but neither are the other two entries in the series, with their respective images of melting, exploding, and rotting bodies in replete gruesome detail. This is a homage to serials of the 30's, and as such, the plot involving the occult rather than Christian folklore is more than appropriate. Willie Scott, as a heroine, is weak, because Indy retreats to weaker women as a result of his failed relationship with the teenage Marion (when was the last time you studied psychology, Chris?). This film is dark, but it's a comic darkness, as those who are fans of the work of Joe Dante and Sam Raimi will tell you. So, next time you slag on a movie, do the research first!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weakest Of The Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Indiana Jones &amp; The Temple of Doom" is the second movie in the trilogy and a prequel to "Raiders of the Lost Ark". Set in 1935, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), his small sidekick Short Round (Ke Huey Quan) and singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) arrive at a small village in India where sacred stones, called Shankara, have been taken and all of the children have vanished. The village leader tells Indiana that he must go to a deserted palace and free the children and return the stones to the village. At the palace, the trio experience "Snake Surprise" and "Chilled Monkey Brains", bugs, bugs and more bugs, a very scary ritual, a cult known as the Thugee, ripped out hearts and lava pits. This movie is definitely the weakest of the trilogy and gets to be the pits after watching a half hour of it. Granted, some of the action scenes in it are fantastic (Mine car chase, bridge scene and the opening sequence) and the acting by Harrison Ford is well done, this movie is way too violent and dark. I mean, hearts being ripped out of bodies? Not something you would want to show your children. The main villain, Mola Rom, is quite scary too. Very opposite to Paul Freeman's Rene Belloq in "Raiders". Kate Capshaw puts on a rather annoying and snobby performance as Willie. Maybe it would have been best if she was lowered into the lava pit, would have saved us the trouble of hearing her scream her head off for the rest of the film. Good thing Steven Spielberg made up for this mess with "Last Crusade"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NO, Indy, NO!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, people, I KNOW I'm not the only person out there who thinks this movie is terrible. Let me begin with saying that Raiders of the Lost Ark wasn't exactly one of my *favorite* movies, but I thought it was okay. Good enough to see the sequel, anyway, or at least attempt to watch the sequel. My brother and sister were watching this movie and I had nothing to do so I figured--"What the heck?? At least Harrison Ford's in it"--and sat down to watch.First of all, there's the title: "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom." Let's see--yes, Indiana Jones is in it, I guess there certainly is doom, but there really is no "Temple" at all. There's a palace, but no temple. There's your first clue that this movie isn't exactly going to be great.Maybe part of the reason the movie was so bad was because this stupid guy who claimed to be "The Undertaker" would talk in between commercials. Him and his little show, "The Undertaker's Theater of Doom," did not help in making this movie any better. I should have known: stupid people + stupid shows=stupid movies.Actually, compared to some films, Temple of Doom wasn't that bad. But, when you're talking on the scale of Raiders of the Lost Ark, I think Spielberg &amp; Co. could have done better. Remember that great opening scene in Raiders with the Indy and that giant rolling boulder and all? This movie starts out with Kate Capshaw singing in this Shanghai club in what looked like a Rockettes musical! NOT the kind of thing that should be in an Indy movie. And just seeing Harrison Ford in that white tux made me shudder. I'm surprised Ford actually agreed to do some of the stuff he did in this movie.Well, you can pretty much screw the beginning, since it's just like a comedy that isn't funny anyway. I'll just give you an idea of how unrealistic this movie is: Indy, Willie, and Shorty are on this plane with no driver. Just before they're about to crash, they jump off the plane in this inflatable raft and fall a couple thousand feet into the Himilayas before they start sledding down the mountain slope. THEN, they fly off this cliff (complete with Capshaw's annoying screams) and fall another thousand feet or so before landing in these rapids. Gee--what luck--the raft landed right side down all the time!OKAY, I've survived the beginning, but there's still a lot of movie to go. Indy and Friends then go to this palace searching for this stone, risking their lives to help people they hardly know, where there's this completely stupid and unnecessary scene at the dinner table. Then, we get into the scene where Indy finds the secret passage to the Thuggee cult ceremony, he gets possessed, Shorty gets put into this labor force of kids which might as well been a Malaysia Nike Sweatshop, and more annoying screams from Capshaw following. I especially do not like the little voodoo doll of Indy--HELLO, people, this is REAL, not fantasy!After surviving all the crap from those scenes, I am gladdened when a good scene actually comes along--the runaway mine cart scene (I love rollercoasters!!) and the swinging bridge scene. The ending is, well, okay, but I think Indy should have seriously dumped Willie from the start (at least we wouldn't have had to listen to her annoying screams!!). Kate Capshaw is probably a very nice person, but her character is one of the worst damsels in distress onscreen ever.Overall, I did not like this movie. Harrison Ford was bad, Kate Capshaw was terrible (Indy: "Willie, get us outta here, we're gonna die!" Willie: "Hold on, I broke a nail!") and Johnathon Ke Quan was a good actor for such a little guy, but Shorty was sometimes almost as annoying as Willie.Spielberg and Ford could've done better. I'm still trying to decide which movie is worse: "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" or "The Lost World."</fullReview>

A chase scene begins and ends in India. Jones comes across a village whose children have been abducted by the Thugee cult. (Warning: Some of the Thugee rituals should not be seen by young eyes...they are extremely violent.) There's a mine chase scene (good). After that, the climax ends with Jones and company a top a swing bridge (good), but everything in between is cornball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does everything you expect an Indiana Jones film to do, but can't live up to the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the second instalment of the Indiana Jones franchise and the prequel, yes, prequel to the first film. The decision to go for a prequel was an interesting one but didn't affect the film at all as it was a different quest to the first film. That aside, for me this film was very disappointing compared to what the first film accomplished. This felt like it was missing a lot of the elements that the first film managed to use so well. Yes this film did have some comedic moments but not as many as the first film and it did have a little more darker horror like scenes, but i felt that this was missing a lot of the awesome action/adventure sequences that made the first film so iconic. This film failed to deliver in that sense, there was some interesting action sequences but i didn't feel that the adventure was there, and i was pretty disappointed. The plot itself was at times pretty interesting and i was invested in what was going on and at times it dragged on and got predictable. I did like the opening, it had the comedy, action and mystery that i loved from the first Indiana Jones. But following their arrival in India they quickly setup the quest they had to go on but then spent quite a bit of time in the village and on the way to their destination, and it wasn't all that interesting. Similarly later on when the mystery gets revealed, it spends a lot of time inside this location that did not feel like Indiana Jones at all. It was a different environment that i was used to seeing him in and it really wasn't too interesting, some of the action was good though.Harrison Ford still did a really good job as Indiana Jones and he was not the problem with this movie. I was not a huge fan of the supporting cast, Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round was decent, his character was there to play as a sort of sidekick to Indiana and was a pretty likable kid. But, i really didn't like Kate Capshaw as Willie Scott, it was more the character that i didn't enjoy watching because i felt like she really didn't belong, if we had Short Round in the film for some comedic relief, i don't see why we needed Willie, i believe she was just there because the plot later on required her to be. John Williams again did a great job with the score but didn't live up to the first. And that really is the best way to describe this whole film, it did a decent to good job in all the categories but unfortunately fell really short of what the first film accomplished. - 6.8</fullReview>

There's a whole scene dedicated to her freaking out about animals in the jungle... it's incredibly stupid. It seems as if her character has little to no purpose in the story. Really, you could have left her in Shanghai at the beginning of the movie and I bet the movie would actually be a little better. But, putting that aside, it is a very enjoyable movie. Seeing Indy back going on another classic adventure is great fun (The Mine Cart Chase Sequence is one of the best action scenes ever filmed). I still say check it out for some great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Much Happening To No Effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg is right to regret this, his 2nd entry in the Indiana Jones series. Not only does the homage to mid-century matinées continue, but so does the ignorance and xenophobia prevalent in those eras prevail with this movie in a way that was wonderfully absent in the excellent Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Whereas Raiders seems to have an appeal to a much wider audience, Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom aims squarely at the minds and eyes of those that smile during a massacre. The many insulting scenes of worship and later of Indian cuisine are to be taken lightly, only by those who are either not Hindi or Indian. The talent of Spielberg is just not on show here and for him to admit this and then to say that meeting Cate Capshaw was the only light is this mediocre work, explains much, particularly to his own fan-base. The cast suffer too. Cate Capshaw's role and script is second rate and despite Ke Quan's excellent verve, he cannot save this from revealing the laziness involved. All credit to the brilliant Spielberg for admitting as much. More than 20 years on we can see Trey Parker and Matt Stone's Team America. Here there is a film which manages to insult and be self effacing on different cultures at the same time. Lucas and Spielberg are the geeks before the the geeks that followed, but with Temple Of Doom they have more in common with Joel Schumacher and Michael Bay rather than Quentin Tarantino or Steven Soderbergh. Yes, their limitations are there for us to see should we chose to see them and in some cases be insulted by them. But it does also show that time is the strangest thing. The Raiders series have become exactly what they sought to honour and parody. That is for now they are dated dinosaurs which belong on the shelf alongside most of the James Bond series as purveyors of ignorance and cultural indifference. The only saving grace is that they, (Raiders Of The Lost Ark being the exception) are way too dim to have any lasting cinematically historical effect and so thereby save themselves from the 'classic' status afforded films that last the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Anything goes"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's practically accepted as a given nowadays that the sequel to a major blockbuster will be a pale and paltry reflection of the original. After all, this is what happened with Jaws, Rocky, Jurassic Park and many others. But there are just as many sequel success stories out there, in those cases where the filmmakers got the right balance between repeating the successful formula and adding enough new elements to keep the franchise fresh. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom reprises the modern-day swashbuckler hero, the blend of breakneck action and easygoing humour and the nods towards classic Hollywood movies that made Raiders of the Lost Arc the fine work it is. And yet it takes the adventure to a colourful new location, adds some sinister horror elements and makes the comedy that little bit wackier.And of course director Steven Spielberg again displays himself to be a master at this kind of thing. The action sequences are constructed with rapid editing, and getting this right is not as simple as it looks. The director has to make sure each shot can convey what is going on for its brief duration. He must also keep the impression of frantic movement continuous from one shot to another. Hence, when Indy is battling the chunky guard on the conveyor belt, whenever we cut to the Maharajah and his voodoo doll we get the turning waterwheel in the background, just to keep some moving element in an otherwise placid shot. Often, for example during the m?lée at the club in Shanghai, Spielberg uses camera moves that counteract each other, such as moving the camera up in one shot, moving it down in the next, which gives the sequence a punchy feel. But Spielberg is also working hard on atmosphere in the non-action scenes, for example keeping the camera back amid the foliage during the jungle trek, which gives the unnerving impression that our heroes are being watched.If anything, Harrison Ford seems even better in his role as Indy this time around. He just has this smooth and sophisticated manner that makes us trust him. He can pull off the taunting smile at Kate Capshaw when she eats the unappetizing village food without coming across as mean, and can also compromise his dignity for comic effect whenever some enemy catches his character off guard, as when a thug climbs back on board the mine cart. As his sidekick, Jonathan Ke Quan is a great addition, providing some of the best humour with his lovable smart-aleck ways and keenness to get stuck into adventure. There's also a very fine small performance from Indian actor Roshan Seth, who is brilliant at appearing a model of propriety, yet with that hint of something sinister that makes it believable he could turn out to be a secret baddie. Oh and it's great to see Pat Roach in another appearance as a burly ruffian, bringing the appropriate level of menace to the part as well as his physical bulk.But Temple of Doom is not without its flaws. Kate Capshaw's Willie Scott is not a patch on Karen Allen in the first movie. The character is a stereotype, but one that is irritating rather than funny. And while Amrish Puri is certainly very good at looking evil, his character is two-dimensional compared to the complex Belloq of Raiders. Also, many of its comedy sequences are simply off the mark, especially the disgusting foods business at the palace. Yes, this picture falls some way short of its illustrious predecessor, but since that was a near masterpiece, it could hardly be expected to. There is much to love about Temple of Doom ? the disturbing appearance of Thuggee idols in the jungle, the illogical but fun roller-coaster ride, not to mention the tribute to 1930s musical dance sequences that kicks the whole thing off ? a bit of a non-sequitur for an action movie but brilliantly done all the same. It all makes this a worthy follow-up that manages to rise above the usual trashy repetitiveness with which the movie sequel is associated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, I liked it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was watching the "making of" the Indiana Jones series a few days ago. When it came to The Temple of Doom, George Lucas said he intended to make the film a lot darker than the original, in a similar way to how The Empire Strikes Back was the dark second installment in the Star Wars series. Well, he certainly succeeded in making it dark! The Temple of Doom was the first Indy film I saw, and even with no knowledge of the series, its dark tone really struck me as too much for its own good. It's just too bone-chilling and macabre. Even some of the jokes weren't as funny because of the film's overall tone (like the disgusting dinner, for instance).This doesn't mean The Temple of Doom is completely serious. It has its moments of humour, too, mostly provided by the "Indy girl", Willie Scott. Although Marion Ravenwood is certainly the ultimate Indy girl, Willie is a lot of fun. She's an outrageous parody of the traditional "damsel in distress", and just provides a lot of fun comic relief.As for Indy's sidekick, Short Round, I loved the kid! Seriously, at ten, he was more help to Indy than Mutt Williams was in Indy 4! Favourite line? "I'm very little! You cheat very big!" The Temple of Doom is really scary/creepy at times. Those of you who've seen the movie know what I mean.The film certainly has a lot of outlandish chases, stunts, and action. (The mine cart chase is just plain amazing!) Overall, the movie is a lot of fun, but its darkness slightly drags it down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weakest of the lot so far, but still good (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've got to wonder whether Temple of Doom is a reference to Kate Capshaw, as her character in this film is abominable ? she plays a screaming, squealing, pouting tart, a woman who would have most men running for the hills and devoting themselves to a lifetime of man love. But Indiana Jones isn't a mere mortal. He puts up with this silly bint and then later embraces her. I just hope the sex was worth it.Of course, according to Willie Scott (the character Capshaw plays), she's most certainly worth it. In one scene, where Indy and Willie are deciding who's going to swallow their pride and make the first move for a night of sweet, sweet love, she says to herself that she could have been his greatest adventure. Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail kind of pale in comparison to getting between the sheets of some bimbo.But as annoying as she is in this film, maybe Kate Capshaw's character serves some purpose. Without her the film would be pretty grim, as Temple of Doom is unrelentingly dark.The image I always think of when I think of Temple of Doom is of the man having his heart ripped out. Okay, this is a kid's film and a man is having his heart ripped out and he's being sacrificed and then we see the main bad guy laughing as the man's heart beats in his hand and catches fire. This is the stuff of nightmares.Other crazy stuff in this film includes children being whipped by burly psychos, blood being poured down the neck of Indiana Jones via a scary looking skull with a nasty tongue lolling out of it and crocodiles tearing people to shreds. No wonder it prompted the MPAA to create the PG-13 rating.But the darkness isn't a drawback. In fact, the darkness is what saves it. Otherwise it's just kind of silly. And yes, it's meant to be lightweight genre film, but it doesn't have the excitement of Raiders of the Lost Ark or the heart of Last Crusade. So therefore the horror elements are what keep me going back to the film.That being said, even though the action isn't anywhere near as good as the action in Raiders, I do love a couple of the sequences. The scene with the spikes coming from the ceiling is fantastic ? it's full of tension, yet it's also incredibly funny. In particular I like Indy's berating of Willie for not being able to help him properly. In order to save them she has to pull a lever, but because it's full of bugs she's understandably reluctant to do it. So as she dithers we first see Indy shaking his fist at her through a small hole, and then Harrison Ford mugs like crazy for the camera as he says, 'We are going to die.' It's a line delivery that has made me laugh since I was ten.Another very enjoyable sequence is the opening teaser. We see Indy bargaining with some hoods as he tries to sell a valuable antique to them. He eventually makes a sale and then celebrates by having a drink. We then find out that the drink is poisoned and that the vial one of the hoods is holding contains the antidote. First off, I love the silliness of the revolving table. Secondly, it cracks me up that Indy has a sidekick who gets killed in ten seconds. But most of all I love the fact that the villains carry an antidote with them. Surely if you're going to poison someone, you want to keep any antidote about a million miles away. You don't want to give them a chance to live. But no, like fools they bring it along and wave it in Indy's face. Oh, and another thing. I love the fact that one of the hoods gets killed when Indiana Jones spears him with a flaming kebab skewer. Shish kebab anyone? And this leads to the magnificently silly sequence on the plane where the pilots jump out and leave our heroes alone without any parachutes ? I love the way that the pilot, as he's making his way out of the plane as the heroes sleep, cackles to himself and the way that the co-pilot dithers. And then you have the way that Indy and co jump out of an aeroplane on an inflatable dingy, and the way that it doesn't turn over in midair. It's ridiculous and over the top, but it's done with such gusto that you can't help but fall for it (pun not intended).The other action sequences are fun, but they're not quite as good. I mean, during the minecart sequence I'm always thinking to myself, 'why would you build a roller-coaster?' when you're trying to find some scared stones. For some reason, in that sequence, I can't suspend my disbelief. And the bridge sequence is pretty good, too, even though it's far from being the best set-piece. In particular I like the way that Mola Ram sacrifices his own men in a bid to escape ? when he's climbing the broken bridge he ruthlessly rips his men free and feeds them to the crocodiles. What a guy.But on the other hand there are things that annoy. The little Maharaja is prissy beyond belief. My ears bleed every time I hear him say, 'This will never happen again in my kingdom.' And the bug dinner is on the wrong side of stupid.But one tiny thing still pleases me all these years on. Listen to one of the villager's voices ? the underling of the head villager. The man who says, 'They took the stones from here.' It sounds like he's been inhaling helium. Having watched the film loads of times on TV and video, it still fascinates me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from the "let's gross out the audience as much as possible" factor, Kate Capshaw couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Her performance is painful to watch, but not quite as annoying as that obnoxious kid.The raft falling out of the plane scene will likely go down in history as the worst, and most unbelievable "special effect" ever committed to celluloid. Even way back in 1984, that scene (along with several others) was just too stupid to believe."Raiders" was a great flick, and "Last Crusade" was okay. "Temple" just sucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people, particularly Indians, find this film offensive and racist. Admittedly, when I first saw it, I, too, found it such. Accordingly, at the time, I wrote a very harsh and angry review. In retrospect, though, I should have restrained myself. So, in fairness to the film, here is my review of it.This film starts off very well. I particularly liked the introduction of the character of Short Round and I wish I could have seen him in the other Indy films.That being said, the film soon develops into an adventure story that, quite frankly, could have been so much better. The thrills and "treasure hunt" feeling that we feel in "Raiders of the Lost Ark" or in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" is simply not here. The Nazis, also, make for much better villains than the evil priest, whose performance and wickedness are quite laughable. I have a relatively strong stomach when it comes to the gross-out factor. I saw "Seven" without flinching, though, admittedly, it is not the most disturbing movie in the world. However, I should warn those of you with weak stomachs to be careful before watching this film. It seems to go out of its way to increase the gross-out factor, with people eating snakes and monkey brains, another scene that lasts a good 5 to 7 minutes with Kate Capshaw surrounded by giant insects (including centipedes very eager to go up her pants), and a man's beating heart being pulled out his chest.Speaking of which, this film relies much more on the supernatural than the other Indy films. By that, I mean there's the ceremony where the evil priest "magically" opens the guy's chest and pulls out the beating heart (and the man is still alive) and another where the young king uses a voodoo doll against Indy. While the use of the supernatural is interesting, it's a tad bit excessive in this film. The other two do a better job balancing the real with the supernatural.I realize that my entire review here has been how this film does not measure up against the other two, but that's how most of us judge sequels, whether we admit it or not. It's not possible to really be unbiased when watching a sequel because the other films have already set a standard for us to judge it by. So, in relation to the rest of the trilogy, this film is more like an Indy-wannabe than an Indy film. It does not really fit in with the other two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most racist films ever made! (spoiler alert)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg is truly a fascinating character. In the first corner we have "Schindler's List", a film about a man standing in the face of Nazi racism and showing Hitler's cronies the bird. A film about Jewish survival in probably some of the most horrific acts of genocide this planet has ever seen. A film that reminds us just how disgusting and destructive racism can be...And then there is the Temple of Doom in the other corner.First sequence over, Indie escapes with a blond irritant who has an eighties hairstyle I might add not a thirties. Anyway, lets get back to the point. Indie ends up with poor Indian people who ask him to return a stone and worship him like a god. The good old "Oh look white man falls out of the sky in metal bird, let's worship him" trick never fails.So Indie sets out and goes on to face, wait for it, evil Indian people who want to throw the British out of India for good and rule it themselves. Gandhi you bastard. India should remain British because the British know what's best for India, I agree. But these warmongers do not stand up to a fair fight against with their machetes against British machine guns, Oh no old chap. No these Indians use blood and the occult to mind control their fellow Indians to go along with this evil. Come to think of it that is probably the reason Gandhi didn't eat a lot, he didn't want to be turned into a zombie.But all is well when Indy destroys the evil plans with a train ride that was simultaneously being designed as a roller coaster ride and the British soldiers capture those evil Indians...and probably slaughter them (historically seen) but this is after all a kiddies movie.Thank god one single American and two sidekicks have saved the British interests in India. See India is even too incompetent to deal with its own problems, because it will use child labor if the British are not there to save the children.Ice cream for everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After fussing around for too long, this script was slapped together out of material left over from RAIDERS (namely the rubber-raft escape from the plane, and the mine-train chase at the end). The entire middle section of the movie is annoying, especially cheap, dated jokes about the "weird food" people who are not like us eat, and the reliance on the Thuggee cult. But the weaknesses extend beyond that, too. Unlike in the first and third, Indy doesn't have a true quest that stems from his knowledge and love of archaeology. He almost literally stumbles across a village who needs a sacred stone returned, and so he obligingly goes and gets it. The action scenes are excellent, and the scope and scale of the movie are impressive, but overall it just doesn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect example of what these movies are about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been said many times by Lucas and Spielberg, that as kids, they grew-up watching Saturday matinee serials. The whole basis for the "Star Wars" saga, and the "Indiana Jones Trilogy"(soon to be a saga), was to re-create those serials that they as kids, watched and enjoyed. That has not been showed more in a movie by them, than "Temple of Doom". This movie is packed with those "what will the hero do to get out of this one" elements. It's actually a prequel to raiders set in 1935. Everything in this movie is spectacular. It's filled with some of the most memorable moments in the series. The eating scene in the temple is still talked about to this day. The climactic scene on the bridge really brings out those matinee serials, and is great to watch. They set out to make these movies, with memories of being wowed when they were younger, and that explains why I think most younger kids, who watch the "Indy" series like this one more than the others. I remember being younger, and watching this entry in the series with great enjoyment. It was at the time, my favorite in the series. "Raiders" for a younger child, may be too long, to sit through, and too complex for them to understand. This entry is enveloped with plain, action, and shows Indy as a real all American hero. One that younger kids can really root for. As I got older, and became more involved in movies, and becoming aware of things that don't work, and dialogue etc., I understand why some people may have problems with this entry in the saga. BUT, still, after all these years, "Temple of Doom", remains one of my favorite movies of all time. One of my biggest problem with trilogies, is when people do not look at the WHOLE picture. In my opinion, when it comes to trilogies, you need to like them as a whole. Not one by one. To me, it defeats the purpose of a trilogy. The key to a good trilogy, is the first movie. If the first movie is good, then the rest will be. I can understand why people have problems with it. "Raiders" was just one of the most brilliant films in cinema history. And that simply explains why "Indiana Jones" is one of the greatest trilogies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge Indiana Jones fan; I bet I've watched the three films at least a dozen times each. What makes me come back and be thrilled time and time again is the use of imagery, the quality of acting, the thrill of suspense, and the sparking of imagination.This prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark is very similar to The Empire Strikes Back in its tone...they are dark, mysterious, and much more subtle than their counterparts. Doom is a good film, but not anywhere close to Empire or to the other films of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Why? Because it simply was too different from the original. I saw Indiana Jones in two different ways with two different films. Mainly, this is because he had a different female partner...two completely different characters as well. Even more importantly, he was fighting two different enemies, and as a result, it used two different "archeaologoical finds."It also lacked the story development that Raiders had. Raiders' power was its ability to constantly and convincingly bring action to the screen. This film lacked that style, and it hurt itself as a result.Honestly, I found this film too dark as well. Perhaps I'm expecting too much of a "good-feel" out of this film, but that is what this genre is all about, I think.Kate Capshaw did a decent job as Willie, but she at times was way too overdramatic. She was the exception rather than the rule, however. Harrison Ford gave his usual quiet, but awfully convincing performance. Ford's gift as an actor is to not over-emphasize. This film could let him get away with that, but he still chose not to. It made his performance so much better.There were other bright spots...the enemy was well-defined and was well-presented as ominous and completely convincing. In a good-vs.-evil genre, this film made it easy to distinguish between the two. The story itself was very easy to followThe special effects, which were somewhat unrealistic, still added rather than subtracted from the film. The music by John Williams was also excellent. The opening scenes were by far the best of the movie and very classic in style. This movie got your interest immediately. The most important thing: This film is complete entertainment. Not once did I feel bored.This film fulfills its basic function: to entertain, to thrill, and to provoke imagination. In this mode, it is a success. However, compared to the other two Jones films, this film is a bit of a disappointment. But it is guaranteed to be entertaining, and for that reason, I recommend it.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all of the Indiana Jones movies, secretly, this one is the best written. People can claim all they want about it being the worst, but this has the best screenplay. The level of globe-trotting adventure is highest. There is a definite sense of Indiana Jones and his many adventures, ones outside the scope of the trilogy. Beyond that, this one actually has motivated action and a good ending. As much as we may love Raiders of the Lost Ark, the ending peters out. The movie basically sucks after they get to that island and only the last scene redeems it. Watch this movie and Raiders again back to back and ask yourself which one is better and more in keeping with the old timey adventure movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dont really understand how someone can be a true fan of Indiana Jones and not care for this movie. For me personally, it is my favorite of the three, although I do realize Raiders was technically the better film. But Temple of Doom was just a lot more fun for me!The bad guys - Mola Ram, Gangster Lao Che, the Thugee cult, etc - were truly evil in the traditional comic book style, the action was ripped right out of the pages of some 30's pulp fiction and the acting was right on target - lighthearted but dedicated and sincere.I saw this movie when I was about 10 or 11, which probably is why I love it so much. I have great memories of sitting in the theater peeking through my fingers at the images of Mola Ram killing his next victim, or of the amazing mine car chase sequence, or the breath taking plunge on a raft from a crashing airplane. And I dont care what anyone says - Lao Che and the whole restaurant scene at the start of the movie is incredible fun. Spielberg demonstrate here that he has this innate ability of packaging what 14 year old boys like in a movie, and making it so it appeals to a whole population. I grew up idolizing Indiana Jones...I wholeheartedly endorse this film without any reservation for any fan of action films, pulp fiction, or Harrison Ford. I'm just waiting for the DVD release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Temple of Doom may be darker and more violent than the other films, but this what keeps it from being formulaic, like Last Crusade. The fact that Indy goes up against somebody besides the nazis is what seperates this from the other movies and makes it stand out. Also Mola Ram is a much more convincing villain than any other in the series, both Belloch and Donovan rely on the nazis to do pretty much all their dirty work and have absolutely no chance of taking Indy in a one on one knock down dragout brawl. Not only that they both seem to be minions of the nazis rather than actual bad men themselves. Mola Ram not only is the leader of the Thugee but he actually has a chance of beating Indy in a fight. Another thing that makes this movie the best is Harrison Ford's performance. Just the part where he tells Willie that they are about to die is hillarious. The action sequences in this movie are excellent and it is apparent that they took some effort to do. A different and excellent addition to the series</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, first of all, my perceptions of this movie are shadowed by the fact that it was one of my favorites when I was a kid (as in a lot of other posts), if not THE favorite from when I was 8 to 10, so I can't look at it the same way as if I had seen it for the first time as an adult. As an adult, I would have been more aware of a weak script, absence of a good theme, somewhat offensive and stereotypical portrayal of the Indian villiage and of India itself, and filler gross-out material. Watching it recently, I was a little more put off by the one dimensional female sidekick than I was back then. Why? Because a nine year old can sympathize with the kind of squealing, self-absorbed, dependent nature that Willie portrays. Now I just kind of wish she would have "accidentally" taken a fall off a cliff early in the movie. A 3 dimensional character would have shown at least a little development and competance.Nevertheless, a lot of what drew me in as a kid holds true. The action is great, and fun even in repeated viewings. For those who say it's overkill-well, this is Steven Spielberg, not Merchant-Ivory. The scenery (which I'm a sucker for) is well done and along with the fantastic score (one of my favorite of John Williams'), creates a memorable atmosphere. I liked Short Round a lot. And the theme, though not meaningful, was at least different from Raiders, which Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade unfortunately duplicated completely. And it's main character is Indiana Jones, whom Harrison Ford carries off so well (and looks good doing it!) Indiana Jones succeeds so well because he's both a larger than life adventurer who everybody roots for but also has weaknesses enough to keep him from being boring. And the fact that Indy is a different than in Raiders, greener and more inexperienced, emphasizing the fact that this is a PREQUEL, gives me a sense that the screenwriter wasn't a total hack.</fullReview>

The 2 complaints i always hear most often are that Willie was far to annoying and that the movie was to violent. To start off Willie was meant to be a spoiled brat, therefore she is meant to whine and scream and complain a lot, just as the character was written(completely opposite of Marion in Raiders). Send of all Lucas wanted this film to have a new enemy ie. not the nazi's but a thugee cult and i am sorry to tell you people that with something like that you can't have people being all cheerful and happy, just wouldn't look right. I mean its a cult and with cults come violence or if you would rather say a "darker era". the story is great with this movie and fits perfectly as well as the movie having great action scenes. Temple of Doom is overall a classic film and I enjoy it more and more each time i watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This past summer, I was talking to a fellow movie buff friend of mine. It was a little before the Fourth of July weekend. A revival theater in my town was getting ready to show the the entire Indiana Jones trilogy, a day at a time over the course of three days. I told my friend that I was going to see Raiders, but would be busy and couldn't catch the other two. I told him I'd go see all three if I could. "I'd go see the first and third one, if I could," he replied. "What about the second one?", I asked. "Nah. I didn't like it."  I think people just don't understand this movie. Well, maybe they do understand it, but don't appreciate it like I do. I think most people don't like this one because it is not as epic as the others. But I think this movie is fantastic. It's just great. I appreciate this movie because it is most like the old serials and pulp comic books. But unlike those, Indy's not just a one-note character, yet it is still off the wall action and excitement. And while it's not as good as Raiders, it definatly has some scenes that are almost as good. This one also has the best opening sequence of all three. Oh yeah, some of these ideas I've heard for a fourth one sound awful. Indiana Jones and the Saucermen from Mars. One word: Ugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before finding the lost ark, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) was in Shanghai with an ambitious night club singer (Kate Capshaw) and Indiana's partner Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), who's actually just a kid. While escaping from vicious Chinese mobsters, they escape by using a plane but they didn't realized it is the Gangster's airplane. When the two pilots escapes, while they were sleeping. Indy and the two others escaped in time before they get killed in the plane. They also find themselves in India, they are in a remote village... where the villagers children are kidnapped to be slaves at a fortress-like mine. But they find themselves more than they bargain for... when they meet a ruthless cult leader (Roshan Seth) and his men. Who are set to destroy the heroes or turned them into mindless walking souls.Directed by three-time Oscar Winner:Steven Spielberg (E.T. The Extra Terresial, 1941, Sugarland Express) made an truly entertaining prequel to the ever-popular "Raiders of the Lost Art". The prequel is actually my favorite of the four movies. It may be darker and more violent but i think, it is also the most fun. Quan is certainly an standout as Short Round. There's some truly memorable moments, especially the ultimate roller-coaster sequence and the tasteless gross-out supper scene.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Which this DVD is digitally remastered for THX in Superior Sound and Picture Quality. This DVD has no special features expect for the re-issue DVD... just recently. The Box Set from the Bonus DVD does have an documentary about the prequel, four featurettes and trailers. "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" was an big box office success expect that certain film audiences and film critics truly hated it. Also it causes problems with the rating boards (Same goes for "Joe Dante's Gremlins", also Spielberg was one of the executive producers).There's an infamous sequence, when the villain rips-off the beating heart of a powerless victim with the power of black magic but with no blood. There's an familiar scene done two years earlier with the Camp Classic B Movie "Evilspeak" but that movie has done with blood and gore. Although "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is rated PG, it causes later movies to have an rating between PG and R. Which the new rating at the time between PG and R is PG-13. Which PG-13 is a life saver for plenty of different films for the movie studios. "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is certainly one of the most memorable big budget Hollywood movies of the 1980"s and it still looks great today. Screenplay by Willard Hyuck (Howard the Duck) and Gloria Katz (American Graffiti, Radioland Murders). From a Story by George Lucas (THX-1138). Panavision. (**** 1/2 out of *****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak link of the series, but still better than your average action-adventure film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' is the weak link of the famous trilogy (now a quadrology), but overall it is still more interesting than the average adventure movie. There are several films in this genre that are much worse than 'Temple of Doom.'The movie starts unexpectedly, with a musical. But soon thereafter begins a thrilling fight scene and car chase, and hardly lets up from there. While there are points in the movie that are outright disgusting and utterly ridiculous, you have to realize that if 'Temple of Doom' had not had these elements, it wouldn't have made 'The Last Crusade,' an amazing movie, fresh. Had 'Temple' followed the same formula as 'Raiders,' 'Crusade' wouldn't have been as enjoyable.Complaints about Indy's love interest and sidekick seem to be overexaggerated sometimes. Yes, Kate Capshaw's character may scream a bit too often, but she was a different sort of love interest than the tomboyish, tough Marion Ravenwood. Had Capshaw's character been similar to Karen Allen's, then the complaint would have been that Indy's women were becoming too generic. Plus, the whole "he'll be back in five minutes scene" is very funny and well-done. Then you've got Short Round, who some complain to have been far too annoying (see Jeff Vice in his review of 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.') Yes, when Shorty goes Jackie Chan on the Thuggee members, you've got to shake you're head at that. But you've got to enjoy seeing basically the same character that pops up in another one of Spielberg's works, 'The Goonies,' always giving Indy a hard time. When Lucas lets the audience see Dr. Jones from Shorty's perspective, it serves to make the archaeologist more of a hero to depend on.So, 'Temple' is the weak link, what with ripping out of hearts and voodoo dolls, there are the comic moments (Indy not having his gun vs. the swordfighters) that don't quite make up for the overwhelming darker moments, but considering that storywriter George Lucas had been going through a divorce at a time that he wrote it, that's understandable. Overall, there's still a lot to like about the middle part of this trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg vs. Lucas - Lucas wins every time. There's no plot, just a story (see EM Forster - and then .. and then). To engage your audience with this kind of comic-book style, you have to grab them from the outset, and keep hold. Spielberg blows it from frame one with his rather feeble Busby Berkeley pastiche, which sets up a totally wrong set of expectations. This wouldn't matter if what followed had been more efficiently done. Instead, I am forced to notice continuity errors (where did they get their clothes?), longueurs where there should be acceleration, racing action where I could have done with a bit of a slow-down just to catch up ... Having said all that, the movie gripped me to the end. Amongst all the late 20th century directors, Spielberg is the best at doing this. Even at his worst (which this isn't, quite), his visual sense is still unsurpassed. Maybe he needs to finally shed the baleful Lucas influence?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm a teenager and this film still scares the living daylights out of me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Readers, Indiana Jones, following another botched artifact grab, along with Singer Willie Scott and Short Round, winds up in India searching for the legendary Shankara Stones that promise 'Fortune and Glory' to the owner of all five. He is recruited by a village of childless people to retrieve the stones and save their children from the Thuggee Cult who worship the Goddess of Death, Kali, and their cruel master, Mola Ram. The Thuggees are using the stones to brainwash the children and once they have all five they will take over the world. Problem, while attempting to stop them, Indy becomes a Thuggee! Temple of Doom is my least favorite Indiana Jones film. Why? Because it scares the living daylights out of me! The beginning is great. Tons of action, Indy is trying to cure the poison he drank, big car chase through the streets of Hong Kong, some martial arts, the works! Then we come to India and the movie slows down a bit to allow character development, and a few laughs (Like the infamous Dinner scene, that was sheer genius!), but then when they introduce the Thuggees, everything gets horrific. We get the wonderful graphic footage of a man getting his heart ripped out and lives through it only to be lowered into a pit of fire, that's always relaxing. Then Indy gets brainwashed and nearly kills Willie and Shorty on orders from Mola Ram. Then he gets freed and fights a nearly unstoppable slave captain who gets pulled into a crusher and flattened completely. Things get better however with a sweet chase scene in mine carts and a terrifically satisfying final battle on a rope bridge.Harrison Ford is what saves this film. He brings in the usual charm of Indiana Jones and the usual kick-butt personality. The lead actress, Kate Capshaw, is nothing compared to Marion or Elsa. She is just so annoying you seriously want Mola Ram to rip her heart out! Not to say Mola Ram is a great villain. He's nothing also compared to Belloq and Donavon. He just stands around ripping out people's hearts and laughing maniacally. The kid who plays Shorty is interesting but he quickly becomes a royal pain in the posterior with his hi-pitched voice.The good parts of this film is Spielberg's direction and John Williams's score. Anything else goes flying out the window.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment: Indiana Jones and the Overblown Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Temple of Doom is, by some distance, the weakest of the three Indiana Jones films. The plot isn't inherently bad, but the characters are almost all weakly drawn, deeply irritating or both, and the action sequences feel lame.The bad news starts from the first frame. Raiders of the Lost Ark has one of the best opening sequences in cinema history; it establishes Jones as a swashbuckling archaeologist, and also brings in his enmity with Belloq. By contrast, the Temple sequence is embarrassing; is it a musical? Comedy? Parody? Frightening? It tries for all the above, and unsurprisingly just comes across as an awful mish-mash.Not even Jones' character works; he is supposedly exchanging a priceless relic for a fabulous diamond in the opening exchanges. That hardly fits with him being a voraciously acquisitive archaeologist. Had it been him offering the diamond, then it might have worked.Most others have commented on the startling annoyance levels achieved by Kate Capshaw's character, so I won't comment further beyond agreeing with them. But also, there's no on-screen chemistry with Harrison Ford. The first night in Pankot Palace, the two seem to go from barely tolerating each other to being ready to jump into bed with each other, for no discernible reason.From there, the film descends to a non-stop underground action sequence that occupies the rest of the film. This not only tries the audience's patience, but also their credulity; the mine cars chase is, on several levels, impossible. The cars are unpowered, yet get up to high speeds. This is fine, if the track goes steeply downhill, but it looks level. Then, after getting a good headstart, Jones' car is caught by two chasing cars. How the other cars go faster, with all of them relying on gravity, isn't explained. There are two parallel tracks, built across a wide-open chasm of molten lava; why there are two tracks here but not elsewhere, and how the tracks got there, aren't explained. Finally the tracks end, a tidal wave of water punches its way out, and we see they are near the top of a cliff - so the tunnels leading downhill come out high up? And there's a pool of lava in the middle of a cliff? Stop worrying, give up and accept that when they were plotting all this, logical consistency wasn't high on the agenda.You can only imagine the decision-making that went on at the studios. "Raiders has been a huge success - what shall we give 'em in the sequel? More! More stunts! More action! More locations! More gross-out stuff!" Unfortunately, that's all we do get - and all it adds up to, is a deeply unsatisfying pale imitation of one of the best action films of the past few decades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the two other films in the series, Spielberg's gift for narrative film is evident, nicely choreographed action scenes are apparent, and here in his prime Ford remains the quintessential action-hero. Nevertheless, I didn't enjoy this film as much as the other two primarily because the clichéd squeamish female companion and the smart-alecky young Asian sidekick were annoying in the Chewbacca vein (By the way Jar Jar Binks is an absolutely hilarious invention. His Jamaican pigeon English and Stepin Fetchit characterization, while not politically correct, nonetheless elicit many guffaws). Thankfully, The Last Crusade returned the series to greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how many times I have seen the movie but it was a lot, mind you and it definitely won't be the last time as it must be one of the greatest adventuremovies ever made and perhaps the sole sequel that is better than the original, and "Raiders Of The Lost Ark" already was so strong. The movie might soon celebrate its 20th anniversary but it's still the kind of movie you are longing to see in a theatre, the chase on the rollercoaster-minecarwheels for instance!!! The temple of doom is like reliving your childhood with a perfect Harrison Ford who plays the coolest hero a director can have in mind, and some scenes might be a bit overacted you all forgive it as this movie flashes in front of your eyes. Sole bad point is the appearance of Kate Capshaw, you just wish Karen Allen (who was Indy's girl in Raiders Of The Lost Ark) as I cant imagine there will be one adventurer who might be pleased with a woman that only yells, but for the rest one of the best movies I will ever seen in my life!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Temple of Doom is a perfect transition from Lost Ark to the Last Crusade. Every film series needs its dark chapter, which proved to be the dark and unusual Temple of Doom. Harrison Ford was especially good in his role as Jones, being a little more subdued and action oriented compared to the original. While this film is considered the weakest in the series, I'm not one to go against this assumption. However, in most years, a film like Temple of Doom would be better than the garbage that is typically thrown out on a yearly basis. If this film is ever in a midnight showing or something, I'll definitely go for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A farewell to Han Solo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many fans of the Indiana Jones Trilogy do not care for this installment of the series. Most in fact find the first 15-minutes the only enjoyable ones in the whole film, more or less. Temple of doom is dark, hence the name but the first scene is much more than what the average movie-goer can forseen. The film was released in 1984, the year after Episode VI, Return of the Jedi was too released and Harrison Ford was free of his wonderful vest and blaster and all too eager to dawn his own personal favorite character's fedora and whip. Han Solo was a superb character nonetheless but he is no Indiana Jones, the greatest character in the history of cinema. Han Solo would be number three or so, right after Darth Vader and perhaps in a tie with Vito Corrleone and Rhett Butler. In the opening scene of Temple, Indiana is dealing with the villain Lao Che and as Indy is poisoned by the fiend, a good friend from the past comes to aid him. The aiding character, addressed by Indy as "HAN"...Han ends up dying in Indy's arms shortly after he is called an "Old Friend" but before he does past on, he states: "Indy, I have been with you on a great many of adventures but the greatest adventure of all, I go first Indy!" This was George Lucas's and Harrison Ford's clever way of saying farewell to the space pirate from the first most successful film series ever, Indiana being second.Ford was quoted in an interview after the wrap of "Jedi" as to saying he was happy to see that vest go, and also in this 1983 interview he was incredibly excited to play his own cosset of roles, the raiding grave robber, Indiana Jones once again.And if the clue wasn't enough for a true Lucasfilm fan to acknowledge, the Shanghai club at which all this opening madness occurred at was named no other than "THE OBI WAN" the logo illuminating in pink neon behind some of Lao Che's henchmen exiting the club in pursuit of Short Round and the poisoned Indy with his antidote carrier Willie, not willingly along for the ride. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was made to steer clear of the Nazi storyline not Indy fans, most avid film watchers do not understand this concept and the fine line in which cannot be crossed to make a successful sequel, and that is do not have the same story in every sequel - a bad trilogy or film series is a burned out one, one that bleeds together and not formed like perfect jigsaw pieces as say the "Back to Future" trilogy was made to be - one long movie broken up into three acts, each downtime inbetween release dates an intermission if you will. The Indy trilogy is a series of unique and very different adventures in order to thoroughly develop the character and pay homage to the mid 20th century serials, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg grew up idolizing. And true art cannot always be compromising and commercial, a risk was taken and for this Indy fan it fell a little short, one cannot please the perfectionist imaginary but still the picture is quite an epic with incredibly stunning scenes and the reason why the MPAA established a PG-13 rating for future films to come. Fortune and glory kid, fortune and glory...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some spoilers.I saw "Temple of Doom" back when it opened in 1984 for my tenth birthday, and to this day, I've never had more fun at the movies. When it was over, I felt like I had lived it--I watched most of it through my hands! The movie holds up well--it's still a true cliffhanger in every sense of the word. The first scene is an almost homage to James Bond, and it turns into a hilarious riot, followed by a great chase scene through the streets of Shanghai. After that, and a roaring sled down an Indian mountain, we are given a brief rest. We learn about the plight of a small Indian village, and its lost Sankara Stone. I like how this story seems more of a "typical" adventure that Indiana Jones would partake in--he's not saving the world, and nobody but those who know him will probably know that this ever happened. Before the second half of the movie starts, Spielberg gives us glimpses of the shocking and sometimes brutal humor that he will always be associated with; eyeball soup, jungle critters, idols decorated with human remains. Once the second half of the movie begins, you barely have time to catch your breath! It's endless, edge of your seat excitement. All of the villains in this movie are excellent! Lao Che, Chatter Lal, the pesky Maharaja, the thuggies, and Mola Ram make up a totally sinister, bloodthirsty group of bad guys. Indy, Willie, and Short Round also have great chemistry. The humorous brutality of this film gives it its character. You will feel every punch, and the impact of every bone-crunching rock or hammer, while you can't help but laugh ("Short Round, quit foolin' around with that kid!"). Spielberg also does a terrific job with suspense and at scaring us--I jump every time Indy grabs Willie's hand when she tries to bail him out of the trap. We must also thank Michael Kahn's flawless editing. The sets are creatively designed and masterfully constructed, and the music and sound effects add an enormous amount to the mood of this film.While I marvel at the great production values of this movie, I can't finish without stating that TOD will at times have your heart racing (next to your adrenalin). It brings tears to my eyes when Willie tells Indy, "Let's get the Hell outta here!" and Indy replies, "Right. ALL OF US!," and he begins the slave children's crusade. Towards the end of this movie, one might think that we have already seen so many stunts, action sequences, and close calls, that there can be no way that the finale of the film could live up to the rest of it. Then, Spielberg hits us with the mining car chase scene. I have seen the chase scenes in "Bullet," "The French Connection," and "Ronin." In my opinion, TOD has the BEST CHASE SCENE EVER FILMED! I can really say nothing more about it, other than it has to be seen to be believed.Then comes the climax on the bridge, and Spielberg still has more tricks up his sleeve! He succeeds by topping himself over the rest of the movie with possibly the most thrilling stand off ever seen!Roger Ebert claimed that after seeing this movie, you will leave with a "bruised forearm" (from your date gripping it so tightly.) I couldn't agree more. Grade; A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second of the Indiana Jones movies suffers from a trifecta of problems. First, is the "Sophomore Curse" in that the movie had to live up to the legacy of the first of the series... a daunting task if ever there was one!Secondly, this installment of the series just lacks a coherent story and script. The jokes seem more forced, the characters more cardboard, and the the action sequences a little too much over the top, as if to compensate for the movies other failings.Lastly, and most importantly, is the very bad casting of Kate Capshaw (soon to be known as Mrs. Stephen Spielberg) as Indy's romantic interest. There is ZERO screen chemistry here, and Kate Capshaw has to be perhaps the worst actress of this generation (Sondra Locke is perhaps the worst from the prior generation). You just know that the ONLY reason she got this role was her association with Spielberg. Every scene with her in it just doesn't feel right... and she's in just about every scene.Not a terrible movie... but it could have been so much better. As it stands, it's a forgettable bit of fluff that could be left out of the Indiana Jones boxed set with no loss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My fave Indy movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just because I like this movie better than Raiders or Last Crusade doesn't mean I don't like those 2...god no, I love them too...but this one really takes the cake for me, it's one movie (a rare one at that) I never get sick of...you have to go no further than the dinner scene to see why I think..that is my favorite scene in any Indiana Jones movie ever...beats the ending to Raiders and the Holy Grail ending in Last Crusade...because I think it also has a good comedic aspect to it...it's not a COMEDY but you find yourself chuckling a little at it...out of all of them does it have the best plot?? Well no...probably the most basic actually...but wouldn't you say that the temple where Molarum and his disciples worship is probably the most scary place ever seen in any Indy movie?? I sure as hell wouldn't wanna be there, and that makes it more interesting...the only thing I really don't care for in this movie has to be the way ending..once they hit the bridge, it's kinda downhill..but by then luckily there is only 10 minutes left...up till there, it's all good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Temple Of Doom is an action packed Blockbuster!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this at the cinema when i was eight years old. I had not even seen Raiders Of The Lost Ark, i missed that at the cinema which was a shame. But seeing Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom in the cinema was a childhood pleasure that i will remember until the day i die. This film is amazing, even watching this on DVD doesn't quite capture its true entertainment value where it really belongs-the cinema. As I've stated in my review for Raiders, they should have re-released the Indiana Jones Trilogy worldwide just like George Lucas did with Star Wars in 1997. It would have made seeing the later fourth film even more mouth watering.Temple Of Doom has been accused of being 'very dark'. I'm sorry but so was Raiders Of The Lost Ark. ALL the Indiana Jones films have a true element of Darkness running through them. Raiders had the scene where Marion Ravenwood falls into a lair tomb of rotting corpses with snakes coming out of their mouths and The Last Crusade has Elisa Schneider looking on in horror as German Nazis burn every book they can that does not pertain to their Idealogy. Temple Of Doom also has a tremendous sense of humour that has you laughing at the disturbing bits-witness the terror in Indy's face as hes about to be stabbed and squashed by that sinking cave ceiling (one of this films funniest moments) You want to complain about the gore? So was the climax of Raiders! Certain bits of Last Crusade weren't for the faint hearted either. Why don't the Doom merchants (ho ho) just chill out and enjoy this masterpiece? Harrison Ford is fantastic in this. Hes also much more pumped up here in muscle than he was in Raiders. I always loved it how he had that long fight with the huge Thugee supervisor on that Rock conveyor belt, and ended up battered and bruised, shirt torn and looking 100% heroic in the process. When he shouts at Mola Ram (an excellent performance from Amirish Puri) to let Willie and Short Round go, he looks every inch the action hero. The set pieces in this film look real and are absolutely convincing to this day, The Temple Of Doom itself is also one of the most impressive cinematic studio locations i have ever seen.Special mention must go to John Williams for another memorable score. Temple Of Doom also has its own authentic theme just like Raiders and Last Crusade (with Indy's theme tune present in all three films) and its all about fun and adventure. The music playing throughout the Mine cart chase and the suspension bridge helps to thrill the audience even more. This is not only a classic film, it is also one of the greatest films of the 1980s, end of story!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Under-appreciated Adventure Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Temple of Doom is awesome. Yes, awesome. It suffers by comparison with Raiders of the Lost Ark, and, hey, what doesn't? Willie is annoying? That's the idea. He can't meet the same girl every time. Short Round is dead weight? You have to admit, sometimes he's funny. Honestly, I don't know how much more we could realistically want from a summer adventure film. Suave nightclub scene erupting into machine gun fight? Car chase through crowded streets? Plane crash? Waterfall? Evil cultists ripping people's hearts out? Mine car chase? Flooded tunnel? Rope bridge? Check, it's all here.The McGuffin is a little underdeveloped (so were the letters of transit in Casablanca), Indy's hat doesn't always look as good as it does in the other three movies (especially Raiders and Crystal Skull), and all the cliffhangers are stolen from Zorro's Fighting Legion (steal from the best, babe). Whoopty-doo. It's a whip-crackin' good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jumping off the bandwagon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the comments I see regarding Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are negative.Why?I think the answer is obvious: most people couldn't care less because it's the middle child; that is, it doesn't have the force of the first, or the luster of the last. I can't see how anyone could dismiss Temple of Doom as the worst of the series (point of fact, I think Raiders takes this honor, but that's for another Comment).Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom raises more social questions, challenges viewers to experience raw emotions, and casts Dr. Jones in a herioc and human light. Most people, I think, put down Temple because Indiana isn't fighting Nazis - the quintessential cinema badguy - instead he is up against enemies more personally sinister to Indy; sinister in that Mola Ram, the leader, doesn't threaten the Free World but the lives of a small Indian town as well as Indy himself. Indeed, the only misgivings Dr. Jones reveals about the Third Reich is "Nazis; I hate these guys."Everyone complains, "This isn't Indiana Jones!" or "He isn't like that!" Well, with all due respect, how do you know his true character? And more so, who are you to claim knowledge of Indy's moral struggles? Spielberg and Lucas have the only claim to this right. And it was up to them to explore Indiana Jones' motivations, past, and tell a rousing adventure at the same time. They succeeded, naturally, yet many refuse to accept this chapter in Indy's life as legitimate. Temple was supposed to be a *true* adventure; that is, the hero is tested physically, mentally, and spirtually in an environment that is alien and challenging. In Temple we see Indy overcome his most awesome obstacles, not the least of which is the famous "Bridge Standoff."The production quality is higher, the story goes for the jugular, the effects are more polished, Harrison Ford is at his best, we see Dr. Jones in a fight for surival (as well as an *unselfish* quest, read: not for a museum), Indy's weaknessess are revealed, his darkside exposed, and his uncompromising heroism shines in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.As one Indy's last quotes in the movie, he says "Yes, I see [the stone's] power now." Now ask yourself, why do you *really* disapprove of this movie, for it's very few shortcomings or because it's simply not Raiders or Crusade. That's all I ask; you'll Temple so much more if you take it as a rousing adventure with a moral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is far more different than Raiders of the Lost Ark. This time, Indy has new sidekicks, there are new settings, and the biggest one of all: This is a PREQUEL to Raiders of the Lost Ark!After escaping a scheme in Shanghai in 1935, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and his new love interest Willy Scott (Kate Capshaw), and a junior tag along who goes by the name Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan), aboard a jet that ends up crashing and leaving them deserted in India. While there, they are taken to a tribe of poor people and discovering a group of savages from Pancot Palace took the tribe's sacred stones and the children as well.So, the leader of the tribe sends them to Pancot to get the stones and save the children. When they finally arrive at Pancot, they discover a back door in their rooms and so they end up taking on hell of a trip through a hall and tunnels of booby traps, deadly spikes, poisonous insects.After the halls and tunnels, they arrive in a hidden temple that the savages are from. In this temple, they execute any witnesses and they make children slaves. After seeing a local get his heart ripped out (I mean this literally) by a priest in the group, Indiana and Willy and Short Round know that they're all in deep s*** with getting out of that place. They (Indy and the other two) are caught stealing the stones which leads the savages chaining up Indy and making him drink blood that turns him evil. All is bad until Short Round saves both Indiana and Willy from these people.The rest of the movie after all of this is fun and adventure. But, not like Raiders though.Produced by George Lucas (Episode II: Attack of the Clones), and directed by Steven Spielberg (Minority Report), The Temple of Doom is a great sequel that is really worth seeing.Appropriate Ages: 9 &amp; up.*Note: During the filming of this movie, Steven Spielberg began dating Kate Capshaw and that eventually led to them getting married. They are still married to this day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Temple of Doom is the worst of the three original Indiana Jones movies but it's still great. Harrison Ford reprises his role as Indiana Jones. He travels to the Far East to steal the Ankara Stone and rescue a group of enslaved children from an evil cult. The aspect that lowered my rating is the acting. Harrison Ford is great as always but Kate Capshaw is a bit annoying. She screams way too much for my liking. The Chinese boy is not bad. It's just hard to understand him. The action is great. I especially liked the action towards the end. The score by John Williams is once again killer. The cinematography could've been better. Otherwise, this is a great movie in the Jones series. I rate this movie a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, fun, darker second adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the original Indiana Jones movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark, I did not think it was possible to do any better than that, but this "sequel" is every bit as good as the original work.With the addition of "Short Round," a small boy new to the company of Indiana Jones, the producers have given children a new connection with this franchise. It turned out to be a brilliant move, and a wonderful addition which, unfortunately, they did not carry through to the third installment.What struck me most with this work was the depth of research done concerning the Sankara Stones. According to legend, there were five of these stones, taken from what is now referred to as the Sankara Complex, in India. The legend has it just as it is represented in the movie. In the presence of three or more of the stones, you were given an increasingly higher level of power by the Deities. To possess all five, you would be invincible.The Thugee Murder Cult was, and is, real. They have been documented and even associated with the Zodiac killings of the 60-70's, and mentioned, however briefly, in the disappearance of Jon Benet Ramsey.These followers of the dark Goddess of Death, Kali, of the Hindu Pantheon of deities, were known for living dual lives, especially when in other countries where secrecy was an issue. They believe that by sending souls to Kali, their lives here will be uplifted by this dark Goddess, and therefore, they have been known to commit multiple murders, including the annihilation of entire villages throughout India. These practitioners of the Black Kabballah are very real, and were depicted quite well in this production. I was very impressed with the degree of research involved here.This is action from the beginning; adventure through and through. A grand total of ONE slow spot was found here, and that was used to further the character development of Short Round, and show the depth of his relationship with Dr. Jones. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The costumes were wonderfully designed, and were quite authentic in the area of Indian style and dress. I pay attention to set designs and costuming. They can make or break a movie, for me. Rich architectural designs can add so much to a movie, just as unrealistic, plastic-looking "rock" surfaces in the background, can kill the whole mood of the scene. But you have none of those problems with these productions. It appears as though no expense was spared; no scene overlooked. This is a true quality production.Furthermore, the performances were completely believable, even those of the Indian children who were originally cast as extras. Their performances were absolutely wonderful, the story was quite enthralling, and the time just sped by. The only problem I had with this movie is that it was over far too quickly. This attempt was professional in all ways, and is, in my opinion, the very best of this series.This is my favorite of the Indiana Jones run for its dark realism.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>taken on its own, real fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took three viewings. each three years apart, for me to get what Spielberg was trying to do with this film, but once I got it I watched it several times more with complete enjoyment."Raiders of the Lost Ark" is taken directly from the B-movie/serial formats of 1930s Hollywood. In order to accomplish such a pastiche, innovations had to be minor and non-threatening to the original formula being used.With ""Temple", Spielberg decided to break the mold that George Lucas had imposed on him. "Temple" is derived from the "A" grade adventure films of the '30s and '40s, like George Stevens' "Gunga Din" or the Sabu version of "The Jungle Book". This allows Spielberg to interject considerable doses of comic relief; and it also allows him to take innovative risks, most appearing in the final third of the film, like the roller-coaster mining cart ride. Interestingly, Spielberg's introduction of these innovations appears to have been intended to make sure the film appealed to the same audience as did "Raiders", who would be expecting a B-movie pastiche and unlikely to catch the A-movie references of the first two thirds. Unfortunately, while the innovations are fun on their own terms, they actually missed their intended audience, while confusing others (like myself, originally) who thought they were just too 'over-the-top'.But time and proper attention does justice to this film. while not in the same class as "Gunga Din", it is certainly entertaining on its own term - and really must be taken on its own, and not viewed as a sequel to "Raiders". On its own, it is really a witty adult's fantasy with some childish play tossed in for the off-beat, gelling into a loopy but amusing visit to a fictional Orient. To be taken only half-seriously.Quite a bit of real fun here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the trilogy - macabre, action-packed, and exotic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever the atypical one, this has long been my favourite of the trilogy thanks to the fact that I saw it at a young, impressionable age and that its stuck in my heart ever since. Maybe it's the constant stream of action or the numerous macabre and downright horrific aspects of the tale that appealed to me at such a young age, but I still can't see why people are so down on this movie. Sure, there's plenty of unwanted comic relief, some of it stupid, but at least Spielberg still kept the sentimentalism out of his films at this stage. As a roller-coaster ride (literally too, at one point) of special effects and bad guys getting whacked, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is a fantastic popcorn movie and one that can be watched over and over.Harrison Ford had by now settled comfortably into the role of Indy like a glove and puts in an assured, wisecracking, heroic but human performance just like in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK - with the addition that he now has to act "evil" too after getting possessed by evil blood (see, I told you it was horror-tinged) in one scene. Aside from Kate Capshaw, saddled with a hugely grating blonde bimbo sidekick/love interest character, the rest of the cast is made up of either Chinese, Japanese, or Indians, guys who do pretty well with their respective caricatures - particularly impressive is the downright demonic Amrish Puri who glows pure evil as the bad guy Mola Ram. Kudos too to Jonathan Ke Quan as a child sidekick who isn't too annoying (compared to the similar kid in RED SONJA a year later, he's magnificent).The movie jumps from one outlandish action sequence to next, bound together by great locales and hummable tunes. A shoot-out (at the Obi Wan restaurant, a not-so-subtle joke imposed by George Lucas as executive producer) is followed by a jump from a plane on to a dinghy (!), rides through the jungle on elephant back, sacrificial rites in an underground Satanic temple, near death perils, a wild mine cart ride, and finally an outstanding finale on a rope bridge overlooking a crocodile-infested river. The special effects are very good (especially the back/forward projection during the excellent mine cart sequence), and the film enjoys plenty of in-jokes like references to the first movie (Indy's run from a flood instead of a giant stone ball, his attempt to defeat two skilled swordsman in a same manner as he did previously only to be thwarted).The horror elements include a gruesome banquet (consisting of sheep's eyeball soup, boiled beetles, snake, and monkey brains - a great highlight as a kid), mouldering corpses, creepy-crawlies, hearts being ripped out, human sacrifice, and voodoo, and also a perfect death for the chief baddie as he gets torn apart by crocs. Plus all the near-death escapes from falling ceilings and spikes in the same style as the first movie. The body count is huge, with dozens of bad guys snuffing it in one way or another, it's amazing that this was PG when a similar film like COMMANDO was strictly 18. A third film, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, followed five years later and added Sean Connery to the brew with reduced success - this is as perfect a brain switch-off blockbuster movie as you are likely to get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Temple of Doom was criticized by critics at the time for racism and lacking the magic of the first ,but the truth is that it is great. The setting is original ,the characters are interesting ,with the Short Round stealing the show and the action was great ,with amazing comedic timing as well. So I think today everyone see that for the flick has a strong fan base and it is seen as organic part of the Idiana Jones trilogy ( Crystal Skull don't count, if you mention it ,I will scarifies you to Kali!).As I wrote for the character I want to center to Short Round, the kid plays very well and he is at times saves Indi himself, so he is a bad ass before he hits puberty! The other great about him is that we see that Indianna is more than a kick ass professor, for we see here an amazing father son relationship between this two character show a kinder side of Jones which makes him more human and when danger is up on them you want them to succeed and also the fact they both can hold their ground on their on makes them even more awesome. So together a a force to be record with, think Batman and Robin if it was good!!The setting for the flick is the Indian jungle where all of snakes call home and we all know ,who doctor Jones feels about these reptiles!! The story has to say the truth some elements of the white savior and some wrong stereotypes about Indian culture ,but it makes up for it with great dialogue ,some twist to the formula and of course to music. For real I seriously believe that Spielberg want to see how far could go and not been call a racist, well if the final product it that and not Kingdom of the Heavens then fine by me.In short is better the the Raiders of the Lost Ark ,no but still is a good Indianna Jones movie and is really good so I think critics at the time were to politically correct and had zero taste in action flicks. Definitely a awesome action film , which has also a cult status!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom a terrible follow-up to Raiders of the Lost Ark? Or is it a dark comedic adventure so controversially violent that it spurred the creation of the PG- 13 rating? Somehow it's all of that and more. From the opening lush theatrical Mandarin version of "Anything Goes," all the way to the chopping of the rope bridge, there's never a dull moment, even if it all seems so woefully wrong.But why did it have to be a prequel? And can't we fight Nazis whenever we want? Not all Indians eat snakes, bugs, eyes, and monkey brains, do they? What is the true nature of the relationship between Indy and Short Round?Pankot Palace is surely glad this is 1935, and not 2016, when they would be totally ruined by bad Yelp reviews. And how do you make the Blood of Kali? Is it anything like making Blood Juice? If it sends you to the darkness of being a zombie, why does a torch to the belly cure you?How exactly does a Shankara stone protect a village? If three stones glow with diamonds, what would a combination of two, four, or five Shankara stones do? Why would five stones represent "fortune and glory" when they are full of diamonds? Wouldn't three at least represent "fortune"? What is the marginal benefit of adding each stone? How close do they have to be to each other to trigger their magical powers? Do five Shankara stones have more power than one crystal skull? How long can you live without your heart?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many think that this is the worst one in the trilogy(Fourth one does not even exist for me). I think all the 3 Indiana Jones movies are equally good.Temple of Doom has great action scenes. This is how you are supposed to film action. It is a shame that they rarely make action movies like this nowadays. Indiana Jones movies good example of creating suspense. The hero is vulnerable. Jones has to go through punches and knives. Even though you know that character of Indiana is going to be fine in the end, you are on the edge of your seat when see he is getting tortured. Temple of Doom is filmed in beautiful locations and the John Williams' score is also phenomenal as always. Temple of Doom is also funny in my opinion. Many people don't like Willie, but i don't mind her. I think she is funny most of the time. Maybe her character goes over the top sometimes.Harrison Ford's performance is good again. All the other actors too do their jobs fairly well. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is great adventure and action movie. It's important part of the cinematic history. In my opinion it is one of the best sequels of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the darkest adventure movies ever - but also one of the most exhilarating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exhilarating is certainly the word for the darkest of the Indiana Jones adventures. It's surely one of the fastest cut movies of its time - particularly in the second half, and there are many many ingenious moments. I will never forget seeing this on the cinema - it was like being at a football match, people were cheering at the screen. Ah for the days of 1984.Temple of Doom kind of does that to you.There are, however, many people out there who don't like this movie. "Weak plot" "Too dark" "Annoying sidekicks" etc. I respect these opinions but I just have to differ. Temple is a great movie; Raiders was basically a riff on Clark Gable/Spencer Tracey adventure movies of the 30s: this one is more like the Tarzan and The Leopard Woman style movies of the early 40s, with Indy battling a sacrificial cult (the cult of Kali, no less) in India.You have to admit it's very different from Raiders, and Lucas and Spielberg deserve credit for not just punching out a cookie cutter sequel. There are many fantastic highlights - the mine car chase, the rock crusher scene, the deadly spiked chamber - wow does this movie thrill and startle! Harrison Ford is terrific again as Jones; personally I don't find Short Round and Willie as irritating as some; it's a matter of taste I suppose.To sum up: lightning-paced and perhaps too dark for some, this is a fantastic adventure movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg expertly anchors a roller-coast journey for Indy and company</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally catching up with the second instalment of INDIANA JONES franchise from the very first time, over three decades, it surprisingly doesn't feel dated, on the premise that if one can disregard its shameless exploitation and derision of the exotic Indian culture (cuisine) and religious belief, which has become a normalcy for the ever-avaricious industry.After an efficient prologue in Shanghai 1935, where a deal routinely goes awry between Jones (Ford) and the local crime boss Lao Che (Chiao), he is dumped airborne (thanks to a ridiculously fanciful utilisation of an inflatable raft) from a crashing plane to Northern India with his sidekick, a 11-year-old Chinese boy Short Round (Quan) and a saucy night club singer Wille Scott (Capshaw), whom he just met. Contrary to the present trend of globe-trotting in the adventurous blockbusters, Spielberg sticks to a simple plan for the trio, which is to retrieve a sacred Sivalinga stone stolen from a destitute village, by the evil forces dwell in the nearby Pankot Palace, lead by the high priest Mola Ram (Puri), who possesses 3 of the five Sankara stones (the Silvalinga one included), conducts the human-sacrifice ritual to the goddess Kali (which is a huge blasphemy towards Hindus), also exploits child labor to mine for another two stones.Spielberg expertly anchors a roller-coast journey for Indy and company, once the trio enter the secret channel inside Willie's room, booby traps, mind-controlling potion and a man's heart being ripped out the body while still remains alive, rather a grisly image for a PG picture, it is also a plot device doesn't get further explanation in the thrilling cat-and-mouse chase, which unfortunately backfires when Scott is put in the same fate but her heart is wondrously exempt from such a gruesome treatment, thanks to the inattentive script-writing. Then come the famous chase scenes on a mine cart, still a thrilling ride even we have already seen a more grandiose upgrade in THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY (2012). Finally, a face-off on a rope bridge with crocodiles waiting for their quarries to fall from the sky, all the set pieces mesh together adequately, so as a whole, it is a valid commodity produced with the cutting-edge technology in its era.Ford is a charming chap in his utter prime, an omnipotent hero image with vast appeal, he can fight vigorously, banter casually, and seduce effortlessly. Capshaw, the future Ms. Spielberg, is typified as an impudent, priggish and whiny westerner dragged into a foreign country, waiting to be astonished by the exotica and scream from the top of her lungs, a cheesy eye candy serves as Indy's love interest and a laughing stock, which prompts one wonder why in general, there is rarely any recommendable female characters among all Spielberg's works? Jonathan Ke Quan , sports a fluent American English, but supposedly a Chinese boy from Shanghai, is literally the game- changer in the film, it is him who miraculously comes to Indy's rescue not once but twice in the crunch (no matter how inane it is) and never retreat from the front-line (even though it is hard to buy his posturing kung-fu deftness), together with Ford, they clink a strong father-and-son rapport, he should be the bona-fide successor of Indy's legacy and audacity, far more qualified than Shia LaBeouf in the dismal INDIANA JONES AND KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL (2008, 6/10), his real blood heir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid outing, though more of its time than its predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People getting their hearts ripped out, weird Indians eating monkey brains and live snakes, caves full of insects, riding elephants through the jungle aaaaaand a music number! It's fair to say this second film in the Indiana Jones franchise (chronologically the first) has everything you would expect from an 80s adventure film. It took the franchise in a new direction and tried to show us how Indy went from being a cynical, somewhat greedy archaeologist to the more principled and less jaded character we know from the first film.Temple of Doom opens with a music number in Shanghai as Indy attempts to finalise a business negotiation with an Asian gangster named Che Lao. In a portent of things to come, the music number is Anything Goes, which is certainly true of this film, though in the most fun way possible. Lao betrays Indy by poisoning him, and Indy is forced to run around looking for antidote, shoot his way out with help from his young friend Shorty and taking the nightclub singer Willie hostage. The three escape a plane crash in an inflatable dinghy and end up in an Indian village, where they learn the village is suffering a curse and their children have been stolen along with some magic stones. Indy has a theory, that the children have been kidnapped by the Thuggee cult, who are thought to be dormant and so sets off to find the Prime Minister of Pankot.For the next twenty minutes, you'd be excused for thinking you are watching a sequel to Romancing the Stone as our intrepid heroes trek through the jungle, having encounters with snakes, elephants and various other jungle animals. They eventually get to the castle, Indy is told his Thuggee theory is daft by both the Prime Minister and child Maharajah. In the meantime Willie is stuck in a scene from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, sitting around a macabre table with people eating chilled monkey brains fresh from the skull, snake surprise (they're alive!) and eyeball soup.After some assassins try to kill Indy, we actually find ourselves in an Indiana Jones movie for a little while as Indy and Shorty stumble upon a hidden chamber and try to find their way through. They get stuck and Willie has to come and save them (he shouts "We are going to Die!!" giving the distributors a sound grab that was used in every trailer) and then they end up in the Temple.Once the film gets to the Temple, that's where we stay till right near the end. The Temple is kind of like a more colorful version of the chamber from the 1930s Boris Karloff film The Mummy, but kind of reminds of the sacrifice scene in King Kong as well. The final showdown happens on a rope bridge and is reminiscent of the ending to "The Man Who Would Be King" (another great adventure movie that is well worth checking out).In this we kind of see Indy change from a fairly greedy man chasing fortune and glory and not believing in mysticism to a character closer to the one we see in Raiders. Harrison Ford gives another excellent and committed performance. Of the other cast Amrish Puri, as Mola Ram, the leader of the evil cult, is a great villain, though a little hammy, the ham is appropriate. Kate Capshaw who played Willie went on to marry the director. She is OK, but many fans didn't like her screaming damsel character. Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round is OK, but like Willie, only appears to be there to meet what was seen as a requirement at that time. A child side kick.So Temple of Doom is a really good example of 80s adventure film making, just check out this and Young Sherlock Holmes, Or Romancing the Stone/ Jewel of the Nile or the Goonies. You can tell they are the same vintage. However, Ford is so good in this and the action scenes are done so well, and a lot of care is taken with effects. For a kid growing up in the 80s, this movie was "where it's at," to a greater degree than any of the other Indy films. Looking back now it's considerably more dated than Raiders or Last Crusade, but it's still a lot of fun. A wonderful example of a prime vintage, overflowing with nostalgia. While Raiders harked back to Saturday matinée fun, this one encapsulated what it took to be an action adventure film in the 1980s. And it works a treat. Another classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"......Too Much, Too Fast......."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>COMING AS THE sequel for the first George Lucas/Steven Spielberg collaboration in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981), a lot was expected from this second INDIANA JONES entry. Perhaps there was too much anticipation; as sequels traditionally seldom please.WITH THE PRODUCTION of this picture, perhaps the production team had this in mind and hence overcompensated; if only just a trifle. The truly grossly sacrificial scenes, the extremely gruesome and plentiful cult tribesman and especially the lengthy, over-extended "rollercoaster" ride in the temple are all fine and negative example of the old saying that "Less is More!" PERSONALLY SPEAKING, WE found that runaway coaster to be dizzying, blurring and even nauseating. It produced a sort of psychosomatic motion/sea sickness in us; which detracted from the rest of the picture and even a DOGFATHER CARTOON that followed.OTHER THAN THE inclusion of Professor Jones and Company's saving the day, the plot seems awfully familiar. This sort of representation of an evil twist on THE PIED PIPER OF HAMLIN plot line had been done before. The independent Producer/Director Frank Ferrin had given us SABAKA (Frank Ferrin Productions/United Artists, 1954) a full 27 years prior. It featured a mystery of disappearing village children, the victims of an evil cult.* PERHAPS THIS IDEA resonated from the deep recesses of someone's mind, quite subconsciously of course, and served for the central theme of this Film's plot. We would never think to imply that there is any case of plagiarism.PEOPLE OF THE high caliber of Mr. Lucas and Mr. Spielberg &amp; Associates are far above such behaviour! NOTE: * This truly "B" Movie production of SABAKA (1954) was filmed by the same crew that brought us the GUNGA &amp; RAMA Elephant Boy adventures that were a regular feature on THE SMILIN' ED McCONNEL BUSTER BROWN TV Show. The same actors (Nino Marcel, Lou Krugman and Vito Scotti) appeared as the same characters. In addition, we had Boris Karloff (top billing), Reginald Denny, Victor Jory, June Foray and Lawrence Dobkin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An Indiana Jones movie represents a fine example of the spirit of adventure on screen. A seemingly irresistible genre for majority of audiences. This sequel thrives of it's predecessor, for example, it can be as, if not more ludicrous and still work.Indiana Jones personifies our interpretations of an action/adventure hero being a blend of an spontaneous, relentless, wise - guy with just the right amount of luck you can't help but root for. Of course, Indy always has to have fellow personalities to bounce off, making you root for the guy more. Temple of Doom gives "Raiders" fans more of what they want, and however mixed the reviews, you cant deny they pulled out all the stops on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this the best part of the series? I'm not sure, but in any case its beginning is, in my opinion, the best sequence to be found in all "Indiana Jones" movies. These first 20 minutes or so, from the Shanghai club to the plane crash, are pure music in moving pictures - they feel like one elegant, smooth motion. There are more spectacular parts in this and the other Indy movies, but this sequence of events shines with a perfect, mesmerizing pace. It's all quite nonsensical; Indiana Jones movies certainly never will be lauded for intellectual subtlety and depth, but they are still very good entertainment - and especially the first 20 minutes of "Temple of Doom" in their unstoppable forward motion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spectacular first fifteen minutes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At bottom line, in my opinion, the first duty of any movie is to entertain. Director Steven Spielberg, obviously, thought so too. "Indiana Jones &amp; The Temple Of Doom" is by no means a perfect movie but it does start with a hell of a bang. Spielberg's homage to Busby Berkeley with the "Anything Goes" dance sequence is as entertaining a start to a movie as you will ever see. To anyone that loves movies, you can tell from watching any of his movies that Mr. Spielberg loved the escapist entertainment he got from his boyhood of watching endless hours of movies. It was this, more than anything else, that motivated him to want to become a film director. By his own admission, there are failures in IJATTOD such as the banquet at Pankot Palace. The kids &amp; plenty of adults found the menu of chilled monkey brains etc. off-putting to say the least. The performance of leading lady Kate Capshaw, whom Mr. Spielberg later married, was a bit over-the-top &amp; somewhat irritating. The action which later takes place in the temple of doom itself, bathed in a red fiery light, is also somewhat dark, gloomy &amp; depressing. This film is far from dull but of the trilogy of Indiana Jones movies, this one definitely takes third place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The darks side of the indiana jones series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the Temple of Doom more than I can count; I just never tire of seeing Dr. Jones trying to stop the Kali priest (Mola Ram) from ripping out his heart.The movie has wonderful visual effects from the heart removal scene where Mola Ram removes the heart of the human sacrifice and we behold the beating heart in his hand while the individual is still alive, then the heart catches fire as the sacrifice is lowed into a fiery death hole. That scene is a huge high for me.The Kali-Ma slave blood ritual, where Jones is forced to ingest blood so as to be a Kali-Ma slave, I believe that was the low for me in this flick, from his zombie behavior back to his normality seemed to wishy-washy for me.Although its initial release faced heavy criticism for the intense violence, child slavery, black magic, and the ritual human sacrifice depicted in the movie, but as time went by it has become a critical acclaim, holding an 85% approval rating in Rotten Tomatoes.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was done in 1984 and it is the second film in the Indiana Jones franchise. Although it was done 3 years after Raiders of the Lost Ark the timing of the events were set to be a year before Raiders of the Lost Ark, making Temple of Doom a prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark as temple of doom was set in 1935 while Raiders of the Lost Ark was set in 1936 and The Last Crusade was set in 1938.The movie plot has our protagonist Jones team up with Short Round (a Chinese, eleven year old sidekick) and also at Indy's side is a night club singer named Wilhelmina "Willie" Scott. Together the 3 of them find themselves being persuaded to go save a village from destruction and help recover their Sankara stones, which was the source of the village's good fortune.The children of the village have all been taken and used for labor for the cause of Mola Ram (a demonic Thuggee priest) who uses the kids to search for the remaining Sankara stones so as to bring the rise of Kali who will then rule the world.The movie was a financial success but many attributed the movie's dark side to be as a result of the breakups that both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were facing at that time.The movie too has faced criticism in India for its inappropriate portrayal of the goddess Kali who in this movie is portrayed as evil. Also the food being served when Indy, Short Round and Willie were at the palace was seen as culturally inappropriate (baby snakes, eyeball soup, beetles and chilled monkey brains) are not cuisines in the Indian diets.It won Best Visual Effect in the Academy Awards.All I can say is that this is a movie I have come to love and accept as a classic and a most see in the Jones series.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adventure With Fortune and Glory in India</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg, Lucas and Ford are back with a fun sequel that, like the first movie, is loaded with action, adventure, energy, humour and some romance. 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' is also the most criticized of the trilogy (I'm excluding the fourth movie) one of the main reasons being the portrayal of India, Indians and Hinduism. The film was shot in Sri Lanka is India refused to give permission.However, if one can overlook this side, then you're in for an awesome cinematic adventure. Like the prequel, here too there is an excellent balance between and combination of genres.The pacing and editing are so superb that you feel involved and don't find yourself checking the time on your watch. The special effects, art direction, cinematography (especially in the final wagon sequence) and sound design are first rate.Harrison Ford does it once again proving that Indiana Jones was meant for him to play. But what make this film additionally memorable are his two new sidekicks Willie and Short Round who provide fantastic comic relief. Sexy Kate Capshaw and young Jonathan de Quan are spot on. Both are outstanding and perhaps among the most memorable sidekicks in film. It's nice to see the late Amrish Puri outside his usual comfort zone proving to Hollywood that no one can play badass like him.To sum it up, this is non-stop, action packed, energy-filled adventure at its best. Fortune and glory, kid. Fortune and glory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After "Raiders of the Lost Ark," Spielberg, Lucas, and the gang had a hard act to follow. They generally delivered with this prequel, taking Indy through a thrilling roller-coaster ride (or a mine-card ride as the case may be) of an adventure. There are still lots of great fights, great chases, and even more memorable setpieces and sequences, and even more comedy. Yep, this film is still a blast! The story never really felt that strong to me, especially when compared to its predecessor and successor. It does have merits though; this is a figurative journey to Hell, and it gets pretty darn dark and wicked at times. The whole heart-ripping scene is what gave birth to the PG-13 rating in the first place. My only complaint about all this is that it contrasts way too much with the silly comedy scattered throughout, breaking up any sense of foreboding.Otherwise, the story is serviceable, at the least. It has tight pacing and a consistent flow (even if the transition from the opening scenes to the main story is a little screwy). Some of the action scenes get pretty absurd and unrealistic, but I find most of these faults forgivable. In the end, it's still a fun story that's well-told and with a group of likable characters.The film has fine photography, with plenty of good camera angles and quality lighting. Acting is great; Harrison Ford is still the man, Kate Capshaw (aside from being a bit annoying) plays her part perfectly, Jonathan Ke Quan is lovable as Short Round, Amrish Puri is perfect as the villain (probably the best villain in the series). Writing is great, production value is great, and the music is great.Given the bizarre mix of comedy and dark subject matter, I'd probably recommend this one more as a rental.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

I wanna talk about Short Round, I loved that kid. He was so funny, I really liked his character. Willie Scott, she was annoying at first, but she grows on you. Indiana Jones is easily the best character, and he should be, he's awesome. People don't like it because it's different, that's a dumb reason, this movie is awesome. It's a great time, so much fun and full of action and great acting, spectacular movie, I HIGHLY recommend if you haven't yet seen it, if you have, I hope you agree with me.

Fighting assassins, going through an under ground temple, falling into trance, freeing the slaves, escaping from the crocodile infested river , risking their lives and saving children and the stones. The thrilling rides is endless. I loved it. Back in 1984, this movie- for me, was extremely entertaining. It started a fad. I watched it recently with my friends and we all loved it.

		<shortDescription>The divine comedy (DVD)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This novel from Dante is appropriate with Indy2 because they share the same journey underground to meet hell.I heard critics didn't like it as well as women rights associations. But why? First, so many sequels are just such a repeat of the first than they become remake (Terminator, Ghosbusters, Back to the future,...). Here, you go to desert to jungle, to Judaism to Hindouism. Since i watched it in family at screen nearly 30 years ago, this movie remains a great meeting with this ancestral but unknown civilization.Then, they say that this movie isn't fit to kids because of the violence notably against kids. Well, my opinion is the same as watching wrestling games: the over the top violence is educative to prepare their future adult world of injustice and isn't gratuitous because it infused with a taste of morality as well: Here, as soon as the kids are in danger or pain, Indy or Short Hand don't want to leave them! Also, they said that Scott is a foolish, weak woman, who kept screaming or whining in opposition to the strong, fearless man! Well, it's a comedy not a social study! The healthy concept of laughing is based upon suffering (it's not me who lives this terrible situation) thus every thing funny can blame someone! But I admit that it's the only movie where Indy was truly a loser (after he has drunk the potion) and it was painful to see it like this, going into the dark side (a future Vader?).Nonetheless, Spielberg, Lucas, Ford and Williams give us again a historic, exotic, funny, dynamic, spiritual action / adventure and I thank them as the village chief!</fullReview>

It actually feels like a completely different Indy altogether. And that's not only to the fact that this is more serious, rumor stating that this movie along with Gremlins might have pushed rating boundaries in the US (forcing the MPAA to come up with the PG-13 rating). In the UK it only got released in a slightly cut version (PG).Apart from that it almost plays entirely in one location (something completely unusual for an Indy movie). But it also has the trademarks of course (snakes to name but one). It feels a bit darker than the other, but does not subtract the humor completely. A weird mixture that works for some people, but puts quite a few people off too. Overall I did like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically very accomplished but too mean-spirited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The decision to darken the tone doesn't entirely work for this film.Set several years before Raiders of the Lost Ark, the focus of this story takes place in India (but shot in Sri Lanka and Elstree Studios), presumably to have a different set of villains from the previous film. The film's opening credit sequence is unnecessary self-indulgence, and is totally out of place in terms of the subsequent story. However, the following scene in club Obi-Wan (really subtle I know) is very clever and works extremely well, putting Indiana Jones in the situation totally consistent to what we saw in the previous film. The action is ingenious and exciting. The following sequences in the streets of Shanghai and aboard a plane over Asia work well and set up the story well. However, the role of the gold-digging nightclub singer Willie Scott (played by future Mrs Spielberg Kate Capshaw) is an unfortunate miscalculation and I found totally annoying throughout the film, and makes it hard to sympathise with the predicaments the character gets into. In fact, I go through the film wondering if the character had been killed whether it would have bothered the audience at all? This is indicative of a broader problem in the film. The view of making the second film in the series darker in tone is not in itself an issue (see Empire Strikes Back as an example of how that approach can work), but the problem the film has is that there is insufficient development of the characters to make you care about the predicaments they get into. The focus of the story seems to be how far the film-makers can grow to gross-out the audience and not get an adult rating, and as a result the film feels more like blatant audience manipulation rather than genuine entertainment. I felt that what might have been an interesting script by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz become focused towards set pieces and gross out moments, that is would appeal to the more obvious audience manipulation phase that both director Stephen Spielberg and executive producer George Lucas seemed to be going through at the time. Even the villains of the piece are not sufficiently fleshed out in this film, and as a viewer I felt much less involved in the story.I found few of the characters in the film at all memorable. Harrison Ford's portrayal of Indiana Jones this time around is more understated, but since the character is given little development or anything of interest to do except react to the events the character is not as engaging this time around. Background characters are genuinely unmemorable or annoying (Willie Scott). The only character in the film I was drawn to was Indy's sidekick Short Round, who was very well played by child actor turned stunt co-ordinator Jonathan Ke Quan. While the character's background and connection to Indy is never clearly explained, his character generates some sympathy and I found when his he is directly contributing to the story, the film became more interesting and involving. The only aspects of the film that are genuinely appealing are the impressive technical achievements within the action sequences. These include a series of accomplished live action sequences that take place in a mine, and on a rope bridge. ILM's Oscar winning visual effects work, led by Oscar winner and ILM veteran Dennis Muren (already an Oscar winner for Empire Strikes Back, ET and Return of the Jedi, and would go on to collect more awards for T2 and Jurassic Park) is more subtle in this film, but culminates in a terrifically staged mine car chase sequence , which is the film's highlight, demonstrating flawless editing (Spielberg's regular Michael Kahn) between live action and miniature elements. However I was still surprised that the film won an Academy Award for visual effects as I felt more interesting and pioneering work had been done on Ghostbusters and 2010 that year. There is a witty homage to David Lean in terms of how some of the jungle plain sequences are shot, with an epic and wide scope to them. John Williams's score is as usual very accomplished. However it accentuates the mean spirited tone of the film and lacks the heart of Raiders of the Lost Ark, again making the audience less involved with the characters in the story. Mention also has to go to miniature supervisor Lorne Peterson's work on this film and George Gibb's live action effects work. Peterson has gone on to be a very successful miniature builder for Hollywood films, and Gibbs would win a second Oscar for his on-set work on Who Framed Roger Rabbit and work on a large body of high profile films subsequently. Douglas Slocombe's photography is impressive, ably assisted by some effective Steadicam work at the film's climax, and Eliot Scott's production design work evokes the time period very well. Overall an impressively well made but distant and uninvolving story marred by self indulgent, blatant and unsubtle audience manipulation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Temple of Doom opens with a big musical number? classic Hollywood style?with nightclub cabaret singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) belting out 'Anything Goes' in Cantonese whilst a troupe of synchronised tap-dancers do their thing around her. It's an apt choice of song, because 'Anything Goes' is clearly Steven Spielberg's mantra for this prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark.The director has definitely gone 'all out' in an effort to top the amazing action sequences of Indiana's first cinematic adventure, and more than often the results are truly breathtaking. However, as Spielberg is prone to doing from time to time, he occasionally takes matters a tad too far, with one or two particular scenes being seriously over the top, even for a lightweight, big-budget popcorn adventure flick; this, combined with Indy's undeniably irritating sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), screaming love interest Scott, and a story hampered by maudlin sentimentality (a common Spielberg trait), means that Temple of Doom is a less satisfying ride overall than its predecessor.The good bits, however, still qualify the film as an unmissable piece of 80s action entertainment: I love the exotic banquet scene?it's just so delightfully disgusting; the sacrifice to Kali is nice and nasty (make sure you check out the uncut version for the full heart removal); the mine-cart chase is outstanding?easily the most exhilarating sequence of all the Indy films (although that jump through mid-air is one of those incredibly OTT moments I was referring to earlier); and the rope-bridge finale is spectacular (as is Capshaw, who totally rocks the 'soaking wet Indian princess' look).7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was a genuinely exciting movie. I can't count the number of times that I had a smile on my face while I was watching it. It was filled with the kinds of moments where I was worried for the fates of our heroes and wondering how in the world they would survive the terrible danger that they were in. From the memorable and complicated intro, to the happy ending, I was having a very good time. The tone of Temple of Doom is very different from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There are a few very dark scenes that I never expected to see before I watched the movie. Short Round and Willie made excellent comrades for Indy, and turned out to be much more than the annoying sidekicks that I was expecting. Overall, I found it to be funnier, more enthralling, and more exciting that the first Indiana Jones movie ever was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sure its not Raiders or Crusade but its still a lively and fun adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this is the weakest entry to date in the Indiana Jones series it is still a rollicking adventure film that see's George Lucas and Steven Spielberg flexing their creative movie making muscles,clearly relishing the opportunity to go dark and creepy.I loved the film as a kid,sure it scared the heck out of me but i knew Indy was going to prevail so loved it all the more.John Williams' music is fantastic in this film,he is brilliant at expanding on his themes and adding motifs, i could listen to his work all day and he doesn't disappoint here.Harrison Ford puts a lot of energy into his performance but the chemistry he had with Karen Allen isn't fulfilled the same way with Kate Capshaw who seems to scream her way through the entire film.In all this film should be viewed with a pinch of salt.Spielberg and Lucas were inspired by trashy afternoon matinée films and have delivered that on a grand scale here, to the naysayers i say just embrace it,accept its not Raiders and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the first film was a missed oppurtunity. Woah, make that twice now. Last time it was some great action ideas interspersed with some overly talky boredom. Here even the action can't save it. It's so implausibly conceived that most of the time you're rolling your eyes and screaming at the screen. Riverrafts dropped from airplanes, that land on snow, that slide down mountains, and off cliffs, and into rivers and...enough already. After that is the worst part though: nearly an hour of non-action!! The story this time is laid out idiotically as Ford *happens* into his new adventure! The riverraft has left him in India where some tribe needs help getting a statue back and missing children returned. "Ah, what the hell" is Ford's approach as he takes on a near-death inducing hunt for said statue. What it does is lead him to some temple, where he blabs with some officials, attends the most disgusting dinner this side of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, plays stupid sexual games with Capshaw, before FINALLY finding himself in the final showdown. Photographed in deep reds, is a sacrificial sequence underground where Ford is nearly killed, posessed, and then rescues his co-stars, culminating in a chaotic miner's car chase. This leads to a tidal-wave, a suspension bridge, a totally unconvincing, controversial heart-rip scene etc. All of these are good ideas, but carried off so crazily, plus a lot of it being victim of bad blue-screen. Throw in two of the most migraine-hammering co-horts in Capshaw and Quan, and you've got one hell of a quease-fest. Even reliable Williams lays on FAR too many times the Indy theme, where Ford snaps to, stares determined at some bad guy, then starts laying into him. I enjoyed the suspension bridge stuff, but it's hardly enough to erase such problems as Capshaw's blabbermouthed love-interest (how Speilberg could leave in that scene where she's reacting like a cartoon character to various jungle noises at night I'll never know!) or Quan's insipid brat. One user here hilariously pointed out Quan's repetitively stupid "That's funny ha ha ha that's funny ha ha ha" near the end of the film. I almost had the whole library staring at me as I broke up reading that, cuz it was so true!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The PG-13 rating was created, in part, to account for movies like this that are more violent than a straight "PG" would indicate. However, this movie has inexplicably not been re-rated to PG-13 since its release. Be forewarned that it contains dark scenes and intensely violent imagery (a man getting his heart ripped out while still alive then getting lowered into lava). This film would obviously get a PG-13 rating today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg's famous trilogies (Back To The Future, Star Wars --prior to the release of Episode I, and the Indiana Jones trilogy)always seemed to follow a trend of having the middle one darkerin tone than the other two, and IJATTOD is no exception. This timeIndy, his child friend Short Round (Ke Huy Quan -- wonder whathe's doing now?) and singer love interest Willie Scott (KateCapshaw) come across a village in India where the theft of sacredSankara stones has cast a dark shadow on its inhabitants, whoare starving and have had their children stolen to help theThuggee cult, headed by Mola Ram (Amrish Puri), to dig in themines underneath a nearby palace for the remaining Sankarastones. It's up to our three friends to foil their plans and rescue thechildren.While this is slightly inferior to Raiders Of The Lost Ark and IndianaJones And The Last Crusade, it is still a (literally at one point)rollercoaster ride of mayhem, with some great gags breaking thedarkness later on. Admittedly some found Willie's whiningannoying, but unlike Marion Ravenwood in Raiders, Willie's a high- society singer who simply is not used to outdoors, which made forsome great mishaps. Also, according to Empire magazine, hercharacter was a 'sly parody' of the cliché of squealing blondesrather than just another one.It was interesting to hear Dan Aykroyd speaking with a British voice(he played Weber in a short role as our heroic trio boarded theaeroplane at the start).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This, the second installment in the Indiana Jones films, is not quite as great as the other two ? so people tend to not give it the credit it is due: it is still a good film.The story is a bit muddy but the action and effects make up for it.Probably one of the grossest food scenes in any movie is in this film.Cate Kapshaw, as Wilhelmina `Willie' Scott, does little more than scream and mess things up for Indiana. She is there primarily as a foil for the action.`Short Round' (Ke Huy Quan) is a better foil and plot device though? He moves the action and facilitates the story as needed. Ke Huy Quan (now billed as Jonathan Ke Quan) has not made a film since 1992's `Encino Man' ? he is a good actor and it would be nice to see him on the screen again.This installment has what is arguably the best cinematography in the trilogy: there are astounding views of mountains, sheer cliffs hanging over rivers and magnificent interiors.John Williams score is definitely weaker than most of his work ? the only memorable piece of music in the film is in the opening number ? which is by Cole Porter.While this is not the best of the Indiana Jones movies, when it is compared to other action/adventure films, it still is one of the better ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this film originally came out, it was blasted by critics for being either too violent, too dark or lacking the spark and drive that made Raiders of the Lost Ark an instant classic.While I admit that it isn't as good as Raiders, most sequels aren't as good as the original (with a few exceptions.) But time has been kind to this film and it's clear to me now that the filmmakers intentions were to make a totally different type of film than Raiders. Did they succeed? For the most part yes.It is true that this film is pretty violent at times but a lot of people forget that Raiders had people getting shot in the head, and that it featured a finale in which people's heads melted and exploded in vivid detail. (Those were the days when a PG rating would let you get away with stuff like that!) So in retrospect Temple of Doom doesn't go quite as far as people claimed it did (though the scene where the man's heart is ripped out of his chest is a bit too much for young children).It is a darker film as well, but it is also a prequel to Raiders. Indiana Jones was a bit rough around his adventuring edges in this film since he hadn't quite had the experience yet. There are some claustrophobic scenes to be sure and the scene where he is drugged is definitely chilling.And even though it might lack that spark of originality that Raiders had in spades, it actually has a certain character all it's own. The comedic elements are more in your face, but when the film takes it's dark turn in the middle, those comic moments really help lighten up the film and are most welcome. On the downside the editing is a bit choppy in places and the film tries a little bit too hard at times to top the original, but it doesn't hurt the film that much. The opening set piece is fantastic and the film does take a bit to get going after that, but once it does it is a rousing crowed pleaser to the very end (love that mine cart chase!). the good points definitely outweigh the bad.Worth a second look if you didn't like it the first time.Rating:8</fullReview>

At the beginning of Raiders, Indy tells Marcus Brody that he doesn't believe in the supernatural, yet this movie takes place a year earlier, and my guess would be that after witnessing what he witnessed in this film, he'd believe 100%. Was it a goof, or were they trying to pull a fast one? Other than that, not a bad film. Kate Capshaw's Willie is a riot, and though not as edge-of-your-seat as Raiders, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is definitely a worthy sequel.

		<shortDescription>If adventure has a name . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This "prequel" is often compared unfavorably to the original "Raiders." The ratings on this site bear that out - "Raiders" is in the top fifteen of all time, whereas this movie doesn't come close to the top 250. In box office receipts as well, Raiders outscored Temple of Doom, although the latter was still a monster hit. In my mind, the two films are very different and thus comparing them is like comparing the proverbial apples and oranges."Raiders" set a new standard in action, with incredible set-pieces (the opening sequence, the truck chase, etc.). Indiana Jones was a remarkable hero, with a great look (of all directors, of course Spielberg would define the character primarily visually - the trademark fedora, leather jacket, and bullwhip). He was laconic and very masculine, and yet those great Harrison Ford double-takes made him also human, not an indestructible Rambo. The tone of "Raiders" was serious, although there are wonderful individual moments of humor (the torture device that becomes a coat hanger, the swinging mirror that smashes Indy in the chin)."Temple of Doom" has a different tone from the very beginning. To my mind, the ambition here was lower. "Raiders" was meant to be the greatest action/adventure of all time (and it probably is). I don't think either Spielberg or Lucas wanted to top that for the second film, so they tried for something different. Maybe Spielberg was inspired by the staggering success he had achieved with "E.T.," which was the "smallest" movie he had made since his debut in "Sugarland Express." "Temple of Doom" thus ended up more of an old-fashioned action-comedy.This time around, what's at stake is not the possibility that Hitler will obtain a super-weapon but something much smaller - the fate of a small village in rural India. We never really believe Mola Ram's claim that when the Thugees obtain the five Sankara stones, they will overthrow all the world's religions. The stakes here are important, but smaller and more human. This movie seems like just one of many Indiana Jones adventures, not THE adventure of his lifetime (which "Raiders" presumably was). This doesn't make it better or worse than Raiders, just different. It's more like a James Bond movie in that we know for sure this particular villain isn't going to have the wherewithal to do our hero in, as bleak as things might look at times.Freed from some of the weight of the first film, Spielberg just seems to be having a blast here. Indy's character was kept mysterious in the first film. But here it's a lot of fun to see new sides to him. He's a father-figure to Short Round, and their parent-child relationship adds a lot of depth to this movie. Willie Scott, although annoying at times, also brings out a new side to Indy - the lover. He gets a chance to be romantic, flirtatious, and seductive, and although many would probably disagree, I love the "palace slave" scene. (I love even more the last scene of the movie, with Indy's bullwhip and Short Round covering his eyes - hopelessly romantic.) Willie may be a more wimpy heroine than Marion Ravenwood, but I would submit that the relationship between Indy and Willie is more interesting than Indy-Marion - it gets more time and attention in the movie. Perhaps credit for that should go to co-screenwriter Gloria Katz, who broke into the otherwise all-male Indy filmmaking ranks for this movie only.No doubt the "temple of doom" sequence is too dark (and too long), perhaps even more so after the mostly light romantic comedy that precedes it. We see a man's heart pulled out of his chest, we see Indy and Shorty (and several child-slaves) brutally whipped, and we see Willie nearly made a living human sacrifice in a pit of molten lava. All this could have and should have been toned down, made less excessive with a few alterations and trims. But, in my view, it doesn't keep "Temple of Doom" from being an entertaining and enjoyable film. Not better than Raiders, just different. My opinion? The weakest of the series is the third.</fullReview>

So far I don't think anyone has said anything about Roshan Seth, but I liked his character a lot, it was some good acting. Plus the chant "Kalima!

		<fullReview>There's at times a sense that Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is very frantic with the storytelling and trying to rush things along in order to get you to be entertained and excited. It seems like the way the story is set into motion isn't really developed fully. In spite of that, the movie manages to top some of its own action sequences and stunts. There are possibly various sequences from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom to pick from throughout that can supply some suspense. Although Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is able to maintain interest, there's a feeling at times that movies may be giving out too much of a certain thing. For example, there's a particular character's trait of whining throughout. Early on, it feels like some type of comic relief, but after a while, it can get pretty annoying and/or redundant. What helps the movie is its sense of humor which can help offset or add another perspective some of the gross-out gags. It can also offset some areas of dialog which seems too corny to be taken seriously e.g. the lines "Indy, I love you!" and "Please come back to us!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although he still directs with the same power and style that he has always held steadily in his grip, Steven Spielberg doesn't quite capture the same magic in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom that he transfixed on and illuminated in the original Raiders of the Lost Ark. Despite it not being quite the calibur of its predecessor, The Temple of Doom is still an exciting and fun adventure with a familiar and already well-loved hero.Here our story begins with a madcap, high-wire sequence in which we're reintroduced to Indiana, his profession, and what he does best. We also meet Short Round, a young Asian boy who works for Indy, and a showgirl named Willie Scott who's gotten caught up in Dr.Jones' latest escapade. After a crazy scene involving a plummeting airplane and a flying inflatable raft, Indiana and his two compadres get involved in the problems of the local people, involving the brutal Thugee cult and a trio of mysterious and magical stones.Harrison Ford is once again great as Indiana Jones, but who doesn't fare too well here is Kate Capshaw as Willie. Unlike the strong-willed Marion, Willie is simply the bumbling comic relief, which not only makes for a poor character in the first place, but the fact that Capshaw as no comic talent whatsoever makes it even worse. The true break-out talent here is John Ke Quan as Short Round, Indy's buddy. Quan has great comedic timing, and his smart-mouthed, choppy-English Short Round is probably one of the best child performances ever. Who would have thought that giving Indiana Jones a kid sidekick would acually be a good idea?What does make Temple of Doom stand-out is its gory, extremely well-done action scenes, from thrilling mine cart chases to a fantastic stand-off on a stretching, collapsing bridge. This is what you are really come away remembering from this film.While it doesn't live up to its brother ROTLA, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a good-time for all, and if you're a fan of the original, you'll definately get a kick out of it.I give The Temple of Doom an 7 out of 10, and I'd recommend it to any fan of high-adventure and people who loved the original Raiders of the Lost Ark</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindless, stomach flu-inducing carnival ride that is actually quite good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start out by saying that the Indiana Jones movies are great. It's a shame they aren't being made anymore. Like the Star Wars, Batman, and James Bond films, they provide all the action/adventure of the old-time Saturday morning serials and combine that with excellent music, rollicking humor, and intelligent and funny characters. But INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is probably the worst of the trilogy. Not that that's a bad thing, since RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was astounding and THE LAST CRUSADE was absolutely perfect. TEMPLE OF DOOM is just a mediocre thrill ride of a movie that tries hard to be a crowd-pleaser and ultimately succeeds. The plot feels a little iffy. The movie's set in 1935 and therefore has no familiar Nazis for Indy to fight, just scheming Chinese gangsters and bloodthirsty devil worshippers. It's not that these villains aren't threatening or fun to watch; they just start to seem trite after a while, just dumb foes for Indy to kill/injure/humiliate. And Indy and his friends aren't on some momentous quest this time. Instead of searching for the Ark of the Covenant or a cup that gives eternal life, Indy finds himself on a rather mundane mission to save a large group of Indian children who have been enslaved by the devil worshippers. There are no deep theological or intellectual musings this time around, no ironic twists to the nature of the mission, just Indy saving a bunch of cute kids from stereotypical villains. Still, the story works because Spielberg doesn't take the plot too seriously. The special effects are spectacular (definitely better than in RAIDERS) and the humor and adventure sequences are top-notch. But I have to give a low rating to Indy's two sidekicks in this movie. A young Chinese actor puts in a likable performance as Short Round ("Shorty"), a precocious little boy who keeps the andrenaline flow of the movie going. While he is cute and you just love him, his performance is laughably over-the-top at times. And even worse is Indy's other sidekick, a lounge singer (played by Kate Capshaw) whom Indy and Shorty join up with by virtue of complete accident. Capshaw's character contributes absolutely nothing to the plot except scenes where she is screaming, complaining, or is nearly killed by the villains. I'm sure the movie could have been made without her. Despite its flaws, the movie is a great diversion for older kids and teenagers (younger kids won't like this because of its bloody and often cult-related scenes of violence). It's not as great as RAIDERS or CRUSADE, but it's the little things about it (the hilariously grotesque banquet, the toboggan ride, the exhilirating mine ride, the rickety suspension bridge, etc.) that make the film fun. See it and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

First of all I will point out the negative things Willie is just an annoying character she is just the opposite of Marion from "Raiders" she just whines to much. Sallah is missed in this one we have to settle for Short Round who isn't bad but he is no Sallah. I miss Indy duking it out with the Nazi's the villains in this one just aren't as menacing.The good things about this movie are that it is very entertaining despite lacking the action and charm that made "Raiders" great the movie was never boring.The set design are just awesome on this movie everything looks good and very realistic on screen.

The other thing I don't like about this movie is it is not as believeable as the other two (sure they are adventure movies, which plots are almost fanasty), but some of the scenes just are a bit too deep in fantasy.But it is a good movie.

Some evil guy holding a guy's heart, watching it beat faster and faster, then seeing it catch on fire as the body of the man burns, while the evil guy is going "Bwhahahahaha", that might scare a kid, it scared the crap out of me when I was 9 or 10. Anyway, the second Indy movie has its flaws. Willie (Kate Capshaw) is the dumbest actor in this movie, her acting sucks, and she is too annoying. It is pretty decent, but not as good as "Raiders" or "The Last Crusade". I do like the horror, the humor, the adventure and everything else. For that I give The Temple of Doom a 7/10. Rated PG (yeah right) for violence, horror, gore, and language. Fine for kids who can handle it, for you parents, my mom got the heebie-geebies from this movie, so be careful. Go see it.</fullReview>

I was not disappointed by it, except perhaps for the annoying Kate Capshaw and the addition of child sidekick, Short Round, but the fast-paced story and SFX really made up for it.This film also stands as the first to bear the rating, PG-13, or more quaintly named "Spielberg 13", referring to director Steven Spielberg's pleas with the MPAA to not give the film an R rating, which might sound certain death among his target audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well an Oscar Award and rating of around 8/10 on IMDb. This has to be a masterpiece. It was a masterpiece indeed. Every society has its own stereotypes but America is leader of them all. And sadly people do believe in what movies show.I mean come on: Indians, irrespective of whatever time the director has referred to, in this movie, never eat snakes, beetle, crabs, eye-ball soup and frozen monkey brains. I do not know about other societies but in India, a large percentage of population is vegetarian. Oops! I guess in next movie Spielberg will show them eating mud and leaves.And I do not understand the reason why people try to ridicule some religion even when they don't know what it stands for. This was one of the most racist, ill-informed, pathetic piece of crap I've ever come across. This movie is primary example of why rest of the world hates America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film opened, it caused some controversy, and the PG-13 rating was created for films that were not quite suitable for the younger crowd. It was an interesting decision, and most of the times it works. "Doom" has a couple of very intense images, one of which involves a human sacrifice, but for the most part, it's not problematic.Indiana goes back chronologically, and during one of his escapades in India, he feels he must go and liberate some children who have been slaved in one of the palaces. There are legends, tales, and rumors, but it doesn't hit the audience or Indy, until one of the kids makes an appearance, and Indiana immediately reacts to the mistreatment of the people in the village. Some people might raise a few concerns about the humor in the first third of the film, and to be truthful, it's not meant to offend. It's a take off of the adventures films of the 30's, and some of the slapstick is pretty funny. The jungle scene, the bug chamber scene, and the dinner scene are classic examples of Spielberg's adept hand at comedy. Oh, yes there is the yuck factor, but how else can you make the adventure entertaining. I'd prefer this to some of the rancid and overdone use of vulgarity one finds in contemporary films."Raiders" made everything in the serials fresh again, and the heart- stopping adventures of Indiana surely couldn't be topped. Remember the boulder, the car chases, the snakes? Well, here we have the bugs, the plane ride, the roller coaster ride, the fights, and they're quite fun to watch. In fact, some of them might be even more exciting than the original's."Doom" should get credit for being able to keep things sort of fresh, for taking us to another setting, on another wild and fantastic ride, and for adding another chapter to the wonderful world of Indiana Jones. We read about adventures and cliffhangers in exotic locations before the graphic novels became the home of psychologically impaired characters. The turmoil was outside the soul. Nothing again that dark knight, but sometimes we just want to be transported to a place we don't see all the time and feel like a little kid whose world is still open to wonder and the new.It's been a long time, and we might not see this character again; however there is a good chance there might be another Peter Jackson, another Spielberg, another J.J. Abrams, people with the ability to dream, imagine, and most importantly, make a way to present those dreams to us in some type of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indiana Jones and Temple of Doom is the second film chronologically but most don't know it is the prequel to Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. This film is probably the most exciting and best Indiana Jones film of the franchise. There are entertaining scenes, jokes and acting. This definitely is one of the more comical ones including the scene where Short round is driving the car. The film ends with the village people earning back their fortune with the magical stones. Its 7.6 on this website is fair and I don't see that I myself could give it a more reasonable score. And so ends my review on the best Indiana Jones film to date, in my opinion anyway!You can view the further Indiana Jones reviews written by me.

		<fullReview>Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom is a brilliant movie with a great storyline,action,humor and a terrific cast.I think Harrison Ford is a fantastic actor,a lot people consider his role as Han Solo in the original Star Wars series to be his greatest role,which he did do a great job with,but I preferred him as Indiana Jones,this is his greatest role in any of his movies.Like Ford said when they where talking about Shia LeBeouf replacing him as the new Indiana Jones 'no,thats my hat,Shia can get his own hat,I own that hat'.A lot of people say The Temple Of Doom didn't live up to Raiders,but I think it was brilliant,although not exactly as good as Raiders,still a terrific sequel.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) returns along with his new partner Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and his new young friend Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) as they a given a misson by a poor village to find a mystical stone.While searching for the stone they stumble upon a cult,plotting a terrible plan in an ancient palace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" (1984), the second film in the Indiana Jones four movie series, is perhaps the best.After a great opening sequence, with tongue firmly in the cheek, the film starts proper, with Indiana Jones arriving in India and asked by a desperate village to find a mystical stone. He agrees, stumbling upon a Kali Thuggee religious cult plotting child slavery, black magic and ritual human sacrifice. It's much darker and scarier than the other films, with quite a lot of brutality thrown in. But the movie is great fun, with Harrison Ford at the top of his game and a handful or so of great fight and action scenes that garb you by the throat and never let go. For what it's worth, it's my favourite Indiana Jones movie along with "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My FAVORITE Indiana Jones film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very rarely do I enjoy a sequel more than an original, but this is a rare case where I totally prefer a sequel (actually prequel). Steven Spielberg's INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM(1984) is one of the most purely enjoyable movie-watching experiences I've ever had! An amazingly "original" opening musical number in the Chinese nightclub that introduces the film with the classic tune "Anything Goes" is sung by the flick's heroine. The amazing part is that you don't have to like musicals to like this wonderfully choreographed sequence. It's an appropriate tune, too, because in this movie, ANYTHING GOES!Temple of Doom is full of nonstop chills and thrills, has an ever-present comic and screwball mood and tone, and one of the most over-the-top, juicy villains you'll ever lay eyes on! While "Raiders of the Lost Ark" has moments where it slows down to the point of being rather tedious, TOD is never boring. It doesn't slow down at all. It may be convoluted as hell (and Raiders wasn't?), but it actually doesn't take itself seriously as both Raiders and The Last Crusade, which to me was more a detriment than a plus for those films. TOD is 100% pure entertainment. Spielberg generates a high amount of humor from perfectly placed and timed doses of John Williams magnificent score, which furiously moves along with the plot.Harrison Ford is not really amongst my favorite stars, but I totally love his work in this. I like the fact that Indy is solely in the Far East (China and India) in this one and there aren't those stunted scenes of him at that boring university in the first and third movie. It allows for him to be all action, all the time. THIS is the film that highlights all the best aspects of Indy: swashbuckling, funny, ambitious, charming.Ford is ably supported by Kate Capshaw (as singer Willie, who sung the opening tune) and Ke Huy Quan (as Indy's sidekick Short Round). I get the sense that Willie and Short Round are thought of as annoying characters, but for the tone of this film, their over-the-topness is totally necessary. The flick wouldn't be as funny without them. Willie is the perfect sexual foil for Indy in a movie like this. She's a total FEMALE, always concerned with her makeup, looks, clothes, and Capshaw makes the most of a role with rather limited range potential. She's funny, sexy, and, thankfully...agile! Quan's Short Round is a very original character, a kid that has a monster role in a blockbuster flick and without him, this flick doesn't work, especially with the childlike elements that permeate the film. Even kids of today would love Short Round the way kids in 1984 did when this film came out.TOD has a pure escapist tone and feel to it that simply makes it a MOVIE and not so much a FILM. The Thugee cult stuff is crazy as all get out, but somehow, Spielberg makes it highly scary, tense, and apocalyptic. Really extraordinary that the dichotomy of comedy and horror mix to perfection in this film. One of Spielberg's most underrated accomplishments as a director. The finale is a literal roller-coaster ride. "Raiders" actually ended on a whimper. TOD is a bona fide winner all on it's own, prequel or sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Sequel, I mean PREQUEL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Temple of Doom may be a sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark from a certain perspective, but in reality, it is a prequel to the blockbuster classic, if you look at the date in the very beginning. But anyway, The Temple of Doom is a masterpiece, with great action, great story, and great special effects. The sound of a lightsaber can be heard in one of the scenes, but I will leave that job to you.Harrison Ford is back in the role of Indy, and now has two sidekicks, the reluctant Willie Scott, and the rebellious child, Short Round. We are also introduced to a new villain, Mola Ram, a heart-ripping, Indian talking priest of the Thuggee cult. Some of the great action scenes in this film are the Shanghai chase, the apartment fight, and of course, that legendary mine cart chase.Overall,it's a great film to watch. A lot of people come up with a lot of things to nit pick about this film, but to me, it all comes down to a fun little blacksheep of the Indiana Jones series. So grab your monkey brain and your bullwhip and join the fun!</fullReview>

Several reviewers have accused TOD of being the "weak sister." They aren't close...they aren't even a horse race. In spite of some silly and over the top scenes with a chase through the crowded streets of Singapore and an escape from an airplane using a life raft, TOD manages to keep things in check. No such luck with KOTCS, which relies on many more extreme situations that are depicted using excruciatingly poor CGI.Plus, there are no aliens in TOD. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Past...Revisited All Over Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In anticipation of the May 22 release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I decided to reacquaint myself with the Indy franchise. Like millions of other kids at the time, Raiders blew my mind. I still remember walking out of the theater with my folks, me boldly declaring "that was the best film I've ever seen." Best, as in, better than Star Wars, better than Empire Strikes back, better than everything I had seen up until that point in my life. I've had a lot of love affairs with a lot of great movies since then, but Raiders still holds a place somewhere in my top 100 films of all time.About a month ago I sat down to Raiders and considering how many times I have seen this movie over the years, it wasn't holding my interest like it once did. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood, so I shut it down at about the halfway point. Don't get me wrong, I still love and respect this movie, I just don't feel the need to see it one more time. In defense of other films in my top 100, I maintain an insatiable appetite for many other: Goodfellas, Heat, Kings of the Road, Godfather 1 &amp; 2, Pickup on South Street, almost any Kubrick film, No Country For Old Men and so on. Maybe this is a sign that the fourth installment of Indy might be the biggest letdown of my summer. I'm hoping Iron Man isn't.Today I watched The Temple of Doom, unlike Raiders, something I haven't seen in a very long time. From the opening frame, this movie announces it's bigger, bolder, more colorful, cornier, louder and equally exciting. It's not like Raiders was subtle, but it did manage to let you catch your breath more than once -- TOD does not. I'm sure Spielberg and Co. felt the need to one up Raiders and in doing so they made the decision to cram in as much action in this sequel as they could, right up until the (literal) roller coaster ride climax.Here today gone tomorrow smart ass kid of the month Jonathan Ke Quan plays Short Round, Indy's sidekick and even 20+ years after I first saw this movie, the kid is a standout. Kate Capshaw convincingly plays the cloyingly sassy love interest Willie, and despite her being competent throughout, I can't help but think the best career move she ever made was becoming the Spielberg family matriarch.No, this movie never manages to outdo Raiders, but it is still a fun, mindless romp that pays homage to golden age Hollywood movie-making. Next up: The Last Crusade.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Temple of Doom was better than Raiders, and ten times better than The Last Crusade. When I first saw Raiders, I thought it was interesting, maybe 'cause I saw it from a different point of view. The teaser and trailers for the film and a documentary I saw on the History Channel about the Ark tell me to rewatch it, and I will. I wonder if Kingdom of the Crystal Skull's gonna be better than this.I thought Temple of Doom was real fun, and it was thrilling, and it never ever got boring. When it wasn't exciting, it was funny, and I like that. This is one example of things I look for when I watch a film. One scene that I love is where Willie falls off a elephant, cryin' and moans about life in Shanghai. That was really funny. She reminds me of how I used to be before I moved to the Virgin Islands, 'cause I was in for one helluva culture shock. Indy was really good here, and my favorite character is Mola Ram from the Thugee."You... don't believe me...? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become... a true believer!"I thought the content in here was pushin' it a bit, 'cause it was rated PG and the stuff like the human sacrifice was a little over-the-top for young'uns.Great stuff, Steven and George, so more power to ya!</fullReview>

So I wasn't to surprised he cheated at cards or tried to fight like Harrison Ford.This had everything you could have fun with. The poison drink, the abandonment of the airplane, the weird stones, crazy human sacrifice rituals. Why does drinking blood induce somebody in a zombie-like trance? I suppose it has something to do with the rituals, but it never was fully explained. But, hey, it was fun to watch.Some parts, like the fighting in the mines, was over the top. How long of a rail line is that? Seemed improbable for such a long chase. But then again, many things in the movie were over-the-top.In conclusion, its not a bad film. But certainly not the best from this era. But Jonathan Ke Quan (Short Round) will always be remembered now. Mr. Jones! "B"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indian Jones(Harrison Ford) is back again! This time, he travels to India where he need to find some stones to bring back to a dying village. In the first part of the movie, he's in Shanghai, China making a deal that goes awry. Indie was given a slow-acting poison; his friend was killed when the cork-popping distraction; he stabbed his killer with the sword dinner; and all this shooting caused a lot of mayhem in the club. He meets Willie(Kate Capshaw), who is a very prissy, and whiny little woman. Then there's Indie's side-kick Short Round(Jonathan Ke Quan) who is very dependent and confident in his friend. They go through danger like a hot knife through butter. The action was all there in the movie, also there was some comedy in-between. The dinner scene was a hoot. The food they had was a major freak out for Willie, she told the guy she had bugs already, for lunch. The cult scene was disturbing. The leader rips out the heart of a victim, very blood-curdling. The rest is all there, and it's great all the way. Few changes were made from the first, the action was never lost. I enjoyed this movie very well! 4.5 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, when we talk about 80's action movies we have to remember about simple things like: they were always as fantastic as Alice in Wonderland, they usually never research for anything before write a screenplay, there was always a blond yummy lady and the hero was always supposed to be funny. That were the THINGS about an 80's action movie.I read a lot of reviews here talking about the Indian culture and the disrespect for it by the writers. Someone here said that "voodoo dolls" never was a part of Indian culture. Well, but it was a part of a lot of people's mind for ages before the movie mainly for American people. The writers just took all this foreign myth to create all that nonsense about demons and voodoo dolls in Indian culture. I totally agree that it was a huge mistake do that if we were talking about a modern action movie, but we're not! At that time people never believed what the movie was talking about and they never thought if indians really loved demons or not for a very simple reason: PEOPLE WAS NEVER TOOKING MOVIES TOO SERIOUSLY AT THAT TIME!!! At that time people was just trying to get some fun and f*ck the plot. That was all about.About Willie Scott being an annoying character, I do not believe that. I really believe that Spielberg just made her as woman should be for the 80's. In the beginning of the movie she's an artist, she's a woman living in fashion and money and everything about diamonds, and at the end of the movie she's a very totally different kind of woman and that is what was happening to women at that time. The other reason that I love her character is that she is the opposite side of Marion, and mixing Marion and Willie, we get Elsa Schneider, the fabulous, adventurous and villain character of Last Crusade.But I really believe that Temple Of Doom is the worst edited movie of the series. There are a lot of editing and continuity errors.But, anyway, it's a very entertaining movie and an example of action and fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a handful of sequels are as good as their originals: The Empire Strikes Back, Spiderman 2, and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.Doom manages not just to have all the fun and suspense of Raiders, and maintain the tone of that film, but also to be worlds apart and establish it's own, unrelated brilliance. In many ways it is a better film, with Harrison Ford settling comfortably into the role, and Spielberg coming to a forte of his action direction skills, though it never quite manages the classic nature of Raiders.But consider these scenes: The Club Obi-Wan brawl, the street chase, the escape by plane/dinghy, dinner at Pankot Palace, the catacombs, the heart-ripping scene, the spike ceiling room, Indy's conversion, the mine cart chase, and the bridge finale... just a few examples of the brilliance of the film.Admittedly it features a dry patch following the terrific opening, and Kate Capshaw's performance as Willie Scott has definitely polarised audiences, but this film is as fun as you'll ever see, and continues the proud tradition of Indiana Jones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different Indi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Radiers of The Last Ark I checked out Temple of Doom wanting to see Indiana Jones foiling the evil plans of Nazis and rescuing another ancient treasure. Well this movie was a little bit different than Raiders. Indiana in the first film would stop at nothing to get the ark and it showed him as a dare taker, someone who has his choices but must face the facts. In Doom, Indiana seems like a version of James Bond in the jungle. Take the first scene for example, spoilers: Indi is clad in a tuxedo in a small bar club. He takes ransom for a valuable jewel from some evil mafia men and they poison his drink, sounds familiar. Indi must defeat the men in a club brawl fight for the antidote and save the stone while he is dodging bullets behind a gong, picking up a singer, and falling into his car which is being driven by a ten year old partner. Sounds to me like Spielberg and Lucas needed some more inspiration. We soon find Indi needing to find some sacred stone for this old tribe who have lost all their children. No ancient treasure in sight...huh! We soon find ourselves being driven into an ancient cult of sacrifice and blood, that's not Indiana Jones!So we have him chasing after stones, being possessed, free children slaves from voodoo and rock mining, fighting over a rope bridge (the best part of the whole show), and trying to find his way back home. I enjoyed myself to this movie as the creators tried to reuse famous scenes from the first film, like the snake pit. They transformed the infamous snake pit scene into this new and dark hallway of bugs scene! I give this film a 7 out of 10. Good story, good acting, good things placed everywhere but this film just feels different. It's not the real Indiana Jones, he just seems different. You'll still get a kick out of this film though, enjoy!</fullReview>

Especially the treatment of the slaves and Mola Ram taking out hearts and things made me flinch badly. Also, seeing the children as slaves almost made me lower my rating of the movie.But I still love the small homage to Raiders and Star wars near the end of the movie.

		<shortDescription>Generally considered the weakest of the Indiana Jones movies, still an impressive adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Temple of Doom' is part of the DVD set of Indiana Jones movies. It sets up nicely in a far-away nightclub, and the ensuing action results in Indy, the little boy, and the singer (Kate Capshaw) departing on the big adventure which is the meat of the movie. While it is an impressive movie in total, I always have a bit of difficulty watching the middle part, which involves a type of witchcraft, and mostly takes place in fire-lit caves underground. Kate Capshaw's character is also hard to take much of the time, with her almost constant screaming and other histrionics. However, the beginning and ending salvage the movie for me, making it a worthy part of the Indiana Jones Trilogy. The DVD is, as we expect, masterful, both in picture quality and 5.1 surround sound. The "extras" for all three movies are contained on the 4th disk in the collection.SPOILERS, for my own benefit, quit reading, OK?? As Indy and his sidekicks escape the nightclub, and wave goodbye to their nemesis, closing the plane's door, we see it is the plane of the nemesis, who has ordered the pilots to dump fuel over the mountains, bail out, and let the plane crash with the passengers. But Indy wraps the three of them in a yellow inflatable raft, they jump, the raft inflates in the air, they land on snow slopes, coast down to water, find themselves in India, a remote village with no children, they get recruited to retrieve a powerful religious icon that had been stolen, go to palace, have a disgusting meal of insects, eyeball soup, and chilled monkey brains for dessert. Eventually Indy finds the underground caverns where the children of the remote village are enslaved to dig for two lost icons, Indy eventually frees them, returning them to their village. In a scene on a rope bridge, the bad guys fall to the river below to be eaten by crocs. Indy and the singer fall in love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark but still very entertaining movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of the Indiana Jones movie are very well known for their very high entertainment level. "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is no exception despite the dark undertone of the movie.Granted, that after "Raiders of the Lost Ark" this movie might seem a little bit of a disappointment but that means in no way that this is a bad movie. Not at all.Still for some reason this movie is lacking the "Indy" feeling for me that both "Raiders" and "The Last Crusade" have. Maybe it is because of the absence of Denholm Elliot, John Rhys-Davies or maybe there isn't enough comedy, or maybe it is because of the fact that the movie mostly takes place at one place instead of over the entire world, or maybe it is because of the lack of a main villain, or the lack of stereotype Nazi's? Who knows but fact is that out of the so far three made Indy movies this is the worst.Spielberg still knows to create some memorable scene's, out of the three Indy movies this one might very well have the most memorable scene's. The opening dancing number, the dinner scene, the ritual scene's, the mine car chase, the famous bridge ending. Still the movie isn't the most popular probably due to the dark undertone of it. Further more I have to add that it's a shame that some of the scene's are highly unrealistic even for an adventure movie.The cast is fine. Harrison Ford really seemed to feel comfortable in his Indiana Jones outfit. Ke Huy Quan plays surprising good, mostly his types of character are annoying but he pulls of very well and the way his almost father/son like relationship with Indiana Jones is portrayed is done very well in a typical Spielberg kind of way. Kate Capshaw might not be the best Indy girl but she still provides some comical relief at times. Another actor that deserves credit is Amrish Puri as Mola Ram who has become one of the most memorable villains in movie history probably due to his weird looking appearance.Despite its darkness still one of the most entertaining movies ever made.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt so dissappointed by other's comments on this movie, that I had to stick up for it. I guess in terms of plot this movie doesn't quite hold up to the other two, but damn, I mean the action more than whoops that out of the scope! Temple of Doom is the classic action movie, probably only second to Aliens (1986)! No matter how many times I watch it, it never gets old... Indiana goes KRAKATOA on the Thugee cult along with the whiny (but charming) Willie and the little martial-arts skilled Shortround! From the mine car chase to the rope bridge scene...i just.... oh I'd better just go watch it!NOT TO BE MISSED! 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the most thrilling films EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is generally considered the weakest of the 'Jones' trilogy. I think this is not true. It's the best. It may not have as strong a plot as the other two but for sheer excitement it tops them hands down. Temple Of Doom is a pure adrenalin rush,a thrilling ride that if made now would still be more exciting than most of the action movies released today.Most of the criticisms do not,under analysis,hold up. The film DOES have a much simpler plot {deliberately reminiscent of 30s matinée actioners} and it IS mostly set in,after the first half hour,one location but that is because Lucas and Spielberg wanted to not repeat Raiders {as they did somewhat with Last Crusade} but do something different. The film IS exhausting,but intentionally so. And yes,the film IS dark and brutal,but this gives it a powerful edge. Also,this is the only one that ends with some great Indy action, rather than Acts Of God.Opening with a superbly choreographed brawl in a night club followed by an amazing raft ride down a mountain,the film than slows down a little until our protagonists get to the Temple where we see an incredible dinner sequence that is a masterpiece of dark humour as the guests are given increasingly 'unusual'food. The next section of the film is indeed quite frightening,and perhaps scenes like a heart being pulled out and children being beaten are a little excessive,but this film sets out to be a roller-coaster ride,and all roller-coaster rides seem kind of scary and dangerous in places. The remainder of the film is pure nonstop action,the highlights being a heartstopping mine car chase and a collapsing bridge.In between all this there IS plenty of humour,particularly in the relationship between Indy and his young companion Short Round,and while Kate Capshaw's heroine does scream a lot,surely that is a plausible reaction to being covered in bugs,offered as a human sacrifice and hanging off a falling rope bridge? Harrison Ford gives his best and toughest performance as Indy while John Williams provides another great score.Exhilarating entertainment,the best of the three films and rarely bettered of it's kind. Be warned though that the UK DVD release is cut!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More entertaining at least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> I never found Raiders of the Lost Ark very good. It wasn't very entertaining for me and the acting was bad. everyone seemed to shout and overact with the exception of John Rys-Davies. This one was more enjoyable from an entertainment perspective, and the acting is much better, but the adventure isn't as good and the sound of a woman screaming at the top of her lungs every five minutes is just too irritating for one to take. But still, Indiana Jones is still able to combine a fantasy-like adventure with a belief we hold to be true. Where most search for something made up, the makers of the series search for something said to be real. This is really the only good thing the series has to offer anyway. </fullReview>

This prequel to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK finds the legendary achaeologist in India, where he must recover a mysterious stone and save hundreds of children from an evil cult. Though far from excellent (the violence is a bit gritty and Kate Capshaw's role is quite silly), this movie has some bright moments including a mine cart chase.

		<fullReview>INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984) ***1/2 Harrison Ford, Kate Capshaw, Ke Huy Quon. Excellent thrill-seeking blockbuster "prequel" to "Raiders of the Lost Ark" with intrepid archaeologist Indiana Jones out to rescue kidnapped children from an evil zealot dabbling in black magic with a mysterious and powerful rock also to be reclaimed. Heart-stopping stunts and chock full of action sequences highlight this inventive and at times graphic adventure yarn (a heart being yanked from a still living dude (!) ) Ford is in top form as the highly likable professor-turned-hero as is his charge de campe Short Round (who kicks some serious butt) and "Screaming Mimi" Capshaw (at the time the-soon-to-be-Mrs. Steven Spielberg). Best bit: the roller coaster ride through a dibilitating mine shaft! Waycool. Look for Dan Aykroyd with a cameo in the beginning hustling Indy &amp; Co. to a getaway plane. Executive produced by George Lucas. **This too was one of the first PG-13 films ever. Directed with devious glee by Steven Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Indiana Jones adventure isn't quite as good as the others but it's still fantastic. Harrison Ford is again excellent as Indi, but sadly Indi has some slightly annoying sidekicks with him this time! I much prefered Marion in Raiders to Willie in this one as a Indi's female companion (just like James Bond there has to be one!), and Short Round is there strictly to please the kids, like a lot of Spielberg films. I do remember I absolutely loved this film as an 11 year old watching it in the cinema, but as an adult it doesn't compare to Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Last Crusade. The minecart chase is still fantastic though, as isthe direction by Spielberg.</fullReview>

Of course if Harrison Ford is in the movie it should be always good. These adventure movie cannot be compared. Trust me ive seen almost every copy cat.

This prequel, however, is a completely different story. It completely makes up for the bad parts of "Raiders," and boasts better special effects and a much faster pace. However, if you have a weak stomach I recommend you watch this one with caution.!!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!After making a deal with the Chinese mafia, Dr. Indiana Jones flees to India to get back to his University. Along for the ride are his sidekick Short-Round and a singer he rescued from a horrible death back in China. They come across a village where the people ask them to go to a palace to recover a sacred stone and save the children of the village. Not long after their arrival, they experience some unspeakable things. Will they survive and grant the wishes of the villagers?

It's easy to know who the bad guys are in RAIDERS and CRUSADE: they're Nazis! And come on; they're satan-worshiping cultists, it doesn't take a genius to know their BAD GUYS! This movie definitly requires more brains, and more heart, than the other Indys. Some excellent scenes: the mine-cart chase; Indy's brawl between the Head Slavemaster; cutting the bridge; and the classic opening sequence.

It has more humor than the other movies in this trilogy and I think that's a refreshing thing rather than a hinderance. An adventure movie doesn't have to be all straight forward, after all it is a fantasy and we all know that. A humorous interlude doesn't kill you, especially the humor in my all time favorite scene in an Indiana Jones movie. Which one is that??? Well it's the dinner scene...you can't go wrong with the guy swallowing live snakes, and the eyeball soup. that's classic cinema!! The people who cite all the inaccuries of the Hindu religion portrayed here need to realize something...and that is that this is NOT supposed to be based on a true story.

The character of Indiana Jones is further developed in this film, it shows that Indy is not just a greedy obtainer of antiquities.

However, getting back to Temple, i don't understand how you couldn't like this one. It's a non stop thrill ride from start to finish, which is packed with laughs, gruesome scenes, horrific dinners and misterious cult ceremonies. Whoever starts watching it, is guaranteed not to stick his eyes off the screen until the end. Although it doesn't top Raiders, it sure is better The Last Crusade(which is a lame ripoff from it).

		<fullReview>"Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom" is a terrfic movie and is a lot of fun to watch. Set in 1935, this would technically be a "prequel" to "Raiders Of The Lost Ark", not a sequel."Temple Of Doom" is a different movie than "Raiders". Indiana Jones is more reactionary. He spends little time actually being an archeologist. Instead, he has to help a tribe of natives get back a sacred stone that had been stolen by a cult. Sure, there are some intense sequences involving the ordeal Jones goes through to become part of the cult. This was the first movie to get the "PG-13" rating. It is the intensity of the cult scenes that earned the film this rating.Steven Spielberg himself lobbied for the PG-13 rating. He knew the film would lose a lot of money if it carried an "R".I do not recommend this one for young children. However, for someone who might be looking for a thrilling adventure, I do recommend it. Leave your brain at the door, and prepare to have fun. Hang on, the ride is a thrill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the few films that i have voted a 10 on this site. After such a high standard of quality that was set by that film, the sequel had a lot going against it from the get-go.While i will agree with people that this film is real dark (maybe too dark) at times and is very chaotic during the action sequences (more of a fault of poor editing.)the film does have some good qualities sprinkled throughout.The opening sequence in the diner is well done and the scene where the characters are sliding down the hill side on the raft is intense. the outdoor locations are exotic and well shot but once the movie goes into the caverns it gets claustrophobic, dark and repetitious. not until the end of the movie, when it goes back outside does it let back up.the acting is solid enough, though the characters are thinner than in Raiders, and the filmmakers intentions are evident. they just didn't quite pull it off.nowhere near a classic, but it has it's moments.rating:7 </fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Temple of Doom' is an okay movie when it stands on it's own. But when compared to 'Raiders' and 'Last Crusade,' it is bad. To me, 'Temple of Doom' is much darker than 'Raiders' and 'Last Crusade.' The story deals with Indiana Jones agreeing to retrieve a sacred stone for the people of an Indian village, ho believe their children have been taken by evil spirits. With a night club singer and a 12 year old named Short Round, Indiana goes off to find the stone. He of course finds the stone, but in possession of a cult. Indiana has to fight the cult and stop their plans, save the children and get the stone back. Now that's an okay story but a lot of the movie is dark and not as fun as the other movies. 'Temple of Doom' is not the worst movie ever made, but is certainly the worst Indiana Jones movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the worst of the trilogy, it had good action scenes and a lot of laughs but the plot was weak. Although good effort went into this movie it could have had a better plot. The next movie was redeeming. This may have been a weak movie, but in some scenes kept me on the edge of my seat.</fullReview>

He had the Sankara Stones where I felt he should still be learning about the temple. This definitely disappointed me; as did the morbid violence. Sigh</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Karen Allen in the first film was the tomboy cum strongwilled woman whom Indy fell for years before. Allison Doody in the third film was the treacherous nazi femme fatale with divided loyalties. Kate Capshaw in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is the ultimate damsel in distress, the pampered and shallow showgirl who is thrust into a world far away from the material comforts she enjoys as an exiled American Singer in 1930's Shanghai. From the opening Busby Berkeley-like production number (brilliant in its glittering tribute to Ginger Rogers/Ruby Keeler pictures of the mid thirties) it is obvious her character is going to be the screaming mimi designed to get on the audiences as well as Indy's nerves. People miss the point that every nuance of her performance is intentional and not a result of any bad acting on the behalf of Miss Capshaw. That all said, this is easily the best installment of The Indiana Jones Trilogy, the only one that attempts pure 1930's adventure with elements from a host of 1930's films set in exotic locales and borrowing its plot mostly from the greatest adventure film ever made, 1939's "Gunga Din". The dark and mystical nature of this film's story makes it a welcome change from the other two film's heavy biblical quests. "Raiders of the Lost Ark" was original and magnificent in that regard but a return to that territory in "Last Crusade" left the filmmakers reaching. For the pure Indiana Jones experience it is "Temple of Doom" all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it the best of the bunch? That depends on your tastes. I loved it because it was a bit more gruesome than the other two films. As always there was lots of action and the effects are even better this time round, Ford is great although Capshaw is a bit of a let down as Indy's lady.Heaps of fun for kids and adults alike.

		<shortDescription>Did The Writers Even Know Anything About India?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A highly anticipated prequel to its vastly successful predecessor, the second film in the Indiana Jones franchise takes the right approach of heading into a darker territory but unfortunately comes off as a rather lackluster film suffering from a dumbed down narrative, terrible performances &amp; not to mention its contribution to the racist stereotyping of Indians in Western society.Set one year before the events of the Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom presents the famous archaeologist adventurer fleeing from Shanghai &amp; crash-landing in India where he is asked by desperate villagers to retrieve a mystical stone and stumbles upon a secret cult practicing child slavery, black magic &amp; ritual human sacrifices.The direction by Steven Spielberg has its moments of brilliance in the action sequences even if they end up being a tad too over-the-top but as far as drama goes, that emotional connection between its characters &amp; viewers which this director has been able to pull off so well in many of his works is completely lacking. The script doesn't provide a consistent flow to the story too &amp; ends up making along a lot of things as the story progresses.The depiction of India, its cuisines, Hinduism &amp; its gods isn't just entirely inaccurate but also downright insulting. It tries to be funny about it but these things only come off as racist &amp; offensive. Cinematography carries the vibrant energy of its previous chapter, editing leaves little room to breathe &amp; even John Williams' score doesn't bring anything new to the adventure.Coming to the performances, Harrison Ford reprises his role of Indiana Jones &amp; does a commendable job. The kid who played his sidekick was annoying as hell &amp; should've been thrown off a cliff. Kate Capshaw is in as a damsel-in-distress who did nothing but scream, Amrish Puri plays the main antagonist &amp; hams his way through while the rest of the cast ends up exaggerating way more than required.On an overall scale, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom has too less to offer and even though its set design, visual effects &amp; other elements look pretty dated, it remains an insipid cinematic experience. I was very much poised to hate it as the story progressed but the impressive mine cart chase sequence in the end managed to rescue it from a complete disaster in my eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies I never get tired of watching. It's got great music, lots of action and a battle between good and evil that for once doesn't involves Nazis.It's also got a 'darker' theme, with some blood and gore that's as chilling as it was the first time I saw it. I can understand they invented the PG-13 rating for this movie (as I learned from one of the other reviews). Most of the action takes place in India, in a remote palace brought mysteriously to live after decades. It's a shame we don't get to learn more about some of the back story of the place where the main part of the movie takes place, as it's a interesting but disturbing environment for Indy to explore. It certainly feels more isolated and with that, more dangerous than the environments of the other movies.In short, don't let the naysayers turn you down on this movie; they really don't make these 80's action flicks like they used to!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most refreshing thing about Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the fact that this is not a retread of Raiders of the Lost Ark . Let's face it, there are some acts you just can't follow. How do you follow one of the biggest popcorn movies in cinema history, an adventure so spectacular that it earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and has become part of our common language? In lesser hands, this second adventure might have been a repeat of the same formula trotted out with nothing new to discover. But Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are not lesser hands. They have used their collective imaginations to create something special and even in trying to follow-up a grand adventure like Raiders you can feel that they wanted to try something new. Temple of Doom is not Raiders. It is a red-blooded adventure that moves with a life and energy all its own.This isn't even a sequel, it actually takes place a year before his search for the lost ark, though it never makes predictions or allusions. Like the pulp novel adventures that inspired it, this is simply another adventure in the travels of Indiana Jones. The familiar elements are all there, even a plucky kid at his side, an Asian boy called Short Round who acts as a sort-of moral compass. It is always in the tradition of these stories that a sidekick is necessary, usually a non-American who gets the hero out of trouble. And of course, there's a love interest, this time an American entertainer named Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) whose function in the plot is to be dragged along and occasionally rescued.The movie hurtles these characters from one damn thing to another. Temple of Doom is in the tradition of great movie adventures in which the plot is stew of craziness encompassing all manner of chases, fights, shoot-outs, hedonistic cults, mystic artifacts, booby traps, gross-outs, a diabolical plot to take over the world, and the always reliable scene in which the hero is hanging from a cliff by his fingernails. The movie never denies us any of these things, nor does it make them standard or boring. It has just as much urgency as the earlier film, but not in dealing with the Nazis becoming all-powerful. Here the plot is a little more personal, but no less diabolical.This adventure is a little darker, meaner. The earlier film was a grand, globe-trotting adventure featuring Indiana as a man sent on a mission to keep the Nazis from ruling the world. Here, Indiana kind of backs into the plot. It's not his mission, but he takes it anyway, landing in India via a plane crash he finds himself in a small village desolated by the theft of an ancient stone with magical properties. The earlier film traveled the world; this one takes Indy down, down, down into the deep chasms of a forgotten Hindu temple where ritual sacrifices include ripping out your heart before tossing you into a pit of lava. The prize is a sacred stone that was stolen from a humble Indian village. The stone is no Ark of the Covenant, but when it lights up, it's pretty impressive.In fact, the whole production looks impressive. The temple where the human sacrifices are held glows with a fiery redness, as if it was one level up from Hell itself (there's an indication that it actually is). The caverns beneath the earth, where the children work as slave, actually looks like an underground cavern, not a theme park attraction.Spielberg and his writing team have also done a good job of keeping their lead character consistent. One of the great things about Indiana Jones is his vulnerability. He is intelligent and fallible, always pushing forward, heedless of the danger. He's not just a peg to move around the plot. He's interesting, and we like him, even when he's taken into darker territory. The same cannot be said, I'm afraid, for the film's chief weakness, Indy's leading lady. Raiders gave us Marion, a tough talking gutsy broad who greeted our hero with a clip to the jaw. Here we get Willie Scott, an American nightclub singer whose chief characteristic is that she whines and screams a lot. Kate Capshaw is a good actress with a winning smile, but she's given a bad role. A little of her goes a long way.Even still, the movie is a grand adventure, breathless, fast-moving and a great deal of fun. If it doesn't measure up, then it's only because of the adventure that preceded it. You can't fault Lucas and Spielberg for not measuring up, nor can you fault their desire to mine this territory again.**** (of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a great follow-up to one of the most relentlessly nonstop action pictures ever made, with a virtuoso series of climactic sequences that must last an hour and never stop for a second. It's a roller-coaster ride, a visual extravaganza, a technical triumph, and a whole lot of fun. And it's not simply a retread of "Raiders of the Lost Ark," It works in a different way, and borrows from different traditions.People often mistake this movie for a sequel. It is actually a prequel. However, I feel like this should've been a sequel because gone are Marion and Sallah. In their places: Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and Short Round (Ke Huy Quan). They're all fine, but they're not characters I would like to get involved with or be around with.With all apologies to Ms. Capshaw, who obviously appealed strongly to the director, she's no Karen Allen. Any chemistry between her and Ford is accidental and incidental. As a love interest, she's a bust. Her role is therefore to scream a lot, get into trouble from which she needs to be rescued, and annoy the hell out of viewers who are tired of this sort of comedic damsel in distress act. It might be acceptable if it was more amusing and less tedious.However, there are some positive aspects to the film that I enjoy. The set design, art direction, special effects, and sound effects inside this underground Hades are among the most impressive achievements in the film. The mine cart scene is so exhilarating and exciting. Also, Mola Ram is intimidating and serves as a great villain due to his voodoo magic, and his his presence. "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" makes no apologies for being exactly what it is: Exhilarating, manic, wildly imaginative escapism. A few of the new characters I couldn't handle, but as is, it's a great movie. It has some great action, and a great villain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the best film in the series is Raiders is a movie perfect adventure has a great script , great soundtrack , the performances are high level ( for all involved ) and direction is superb.For me , it had to be an Oscar for best film at the time.Now, I have to clarify something else, like I said , the best movie Raiders of the saga , because it is perfect ( the opening of the Golden Idol truck or persecution are Jewels for the history of cinema) , but I have to say that Indiana Jones movie I've seen more times - By far - and entertains and amuses me all , it is certainly " The Temple of Doom ."Why? Because it has a mixture of action, adventure , and humor excellent in its proper place, is a movie where Indiana is not a archaeologist who seeks to unearth "pigs " or search idols , is the story of how a man , a cursed sect defies the confines India. How helping others without personal gain , not looking " Fortune and Glory " sought to destroy the Thuggie sect, get sacred stone to restore peace to the Indian village and save all enslaved children of hell itself on Earth. Indiana Jones confronts them , and again beating the odds, achieving your goal so heroic .Persecution in the mine , the end of the suspension bridge , fighting with Thuggie in giant rock crushing tape ... everything is superb , leaves you breathless , you want more and more, while listening to "Slave Children Crusade " , seeing a Dr Jones with torn shirt, an enviable physical , machete and whip in hand ...I think many of the stories in comics " heroic " Indy that created were inspired by this movie , as Indiana passes being a legendary archaeologist to be a superhero with many weaknesses , human but very cunning and bravery.Finally, an entire roller-coaster of emotions and action scenes today day are already legendary , culminating tape first Entertainment level .So I said , for me, the adventure movie ( and Indy) more I have seen all by far the most fun and me and entertains .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anything Goes?Down and Fast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, if I ever want to make it in Hollywood or get into (the movie business type of) bed with Steven Spielberg, I better not say the following?and I am resisting?but I can't help it: Kate Capshaw nearly destroyed the Indiana Jones franchise.Let the flood gates open?She was AWFUL! She was the Jar-Jar of Indy's adventures. She was the Cousin Oliver of the series. She was comic relief no one asked for.Dr. Jones's second episode: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom wasn't great to begin with, heck, it's 50 steps below the original masterpiece, Raiders of the Lost Ark, but let's add in the most annoying female lead/sidekick since Sylvester Stallone shouted: Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot!Too harsh? And I love(d) Estelle Getty ? a great and golden girl.Fine, forgetting the "Willie" (Mrs. Spielberg's character), the movie is all-but a cartoon adventure and contains more "family" orientated scenes than the deeper first installment. And yet, they also thought it would be a good idea to throw in enough grotesque segments to further the "PG-13" movement. Eh. Make up your mind.Also, with the enormous success of Raiders, they decided it was an appropriate time to tone down the special effects and budget. Huh? Where Raiders contained one unbelievable scene of FX ? the finale of claymation ? Tempe of Doom contained dozens of more laugh-out-loud scenes, including, but not limited to: water pouring out of the side of the mountain and the little, tiny dolls in the "roller coaster" scene on the tracks. (Side Note: That happened to be one of my favorite scenes in the film, though I have to look away when the characters appears as toys instead of humans.)Let's fast forward a bit, leap frogging over the enormously superior follow-up/make-up third installment and realize, even though how much of a letdown this film was, it could be worse: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ? the long-overdue sequel few asked for and those who did regretted it.That leads me to wonder: was this movie a complete waste, as it all-but indicates above? Honestly, no. In addition to the always-excellent score by John Williams, the opening was grand ? I absolutely loved the number the aforementioned disappointment Kate sang: "Anything Goes." I liked the gun vs. sword follow-up gag, even though this is a prequel ? still, it was a nice homage. And believe it or not, even "Short-Round" (Jonathan Ke Quan) was a needed and real comic relief?especially when Willie was such a dud.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) gets dropped (LITERALLY) into an adventure involving an evil man's quest for 5 glowing stones to, well, what else? to RULE THE WORLD. You see, just one magic stone can harvest and flourish an entire village, but that, along with all the children have been stolen to find the two final stones in order to complete world dominance.That's a quick synopsis. And another reason I didn't care for this movie all that much ? aside from the bad aftertaste you'll get if you watch the first two simultaneously. I liked (in Part One, Three and Four) the fact that Indy does his research and willingly goes on a trek for (insert human or artifact here) VS simply crash landing into a "mission."After that wonderful opening I mentioned, Indy's escape plane he took when he's chased by greedy business men crashes and the Stone-Less tribe begs him to find the Stone to return the tribe to greatness. OH, and to possibly bring back the kidnapped offspring. If he has the time.It's a weak excuse to get Indy into action. And it's even more unbelievable on how Willie "has" to tag along. But, be that as it may, it still has some fun action/adventure sequences such as Short Round and Indy being trapped when Scream-Queen Willie is "bugged" out by having to, oh, I don't know, rescue them.This movie is literally for kids, namely ones that don't appreciate the first masterpiece and the excellent follow-up (only #3, The Last Crusade, that is.) It's a live action cartoon adventure that's best served with no-Indiana Jones knowledge prior to going in. It's like watching Die Hard 2: Die Harder before you explore John McClane's excellent other adventures.Side Note: Since this doesn't have to do with the quality of the film, I'm mentioning it here: One of my all time favorite video games growing up was the Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom arcade game. I played it constantly, alongside Tron. And I played the Indy game before I actually saw the movie. So it got me pumped for the score, and the quotes, such as "We walk from here" and whatever the bad guy says. So, now, when I watch the movie, I do get a nice sense of nostalgia when I heard the score and lines. Unfortunately, that doesn't make a better movie, but it sure as heck reminds me of a simpler and fun time of my life.</fullReview>

Like, entering the life to a puppet, sixth sense of the old man etc.Many of the Indians (in the interior part) still have this kind of magic and they have some sort of sixth sense (like the one in the movie who directs Indiana Jones to the palace). It was a real adventure. We would never come across such places even if we surf the internet or look through the tourist guide. But it is real. It is there in India.The movie is excellent and a keeps us close to the edge of the seat. Awesome movie. I rate 10/10.</fullReview>

The pace is just right, there's some wonderful edge-of-the-seat set pieces, the action is gritty and there are moments of true horror.Kate Capshaw's "Willie" Scott remains my favourite Indy female.

		<fullReview>It was definitely Indiana Jones week in my home, as I watched the original three films, several episodes of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, and on Thursday (I really couldn't wait) the new Indy film. I was actually not an Indy fanatic before this week. I like all the movies, but have only seen Raiders in recent years, a few times. Temple of Doom I haven't seen all the way through for over a decade, I'd guess. The same probably goes for The Last Crusade. After reacquainting myself with the series, I have to put myself in the company of the fanboys. I loved the original series to death. Yes, even Temple of Doom. This was certainly my favorite of the trilogy when I was a kid, probably because it aired a lot on HBO and I saw it the most often. And I have to say, I almost agree with that still. Temple of Doom is probably the least perfect of the trilogy, but Spielberg is at his absolute best in his direction. I think the film has many of the most memorable moments of the series. Everything that happens in the titular temple is fantastic, the Thuggee ceremony, the fight on the conveyor belt and the mine cart chase. And the climactic battle on the rope bridge (which I never knew before was not a special effect). And the booby trap with the spikes in the ceiling and the floor, which contains my favorite Indiana Jones moment (Harrison Ford's facial expression when he tells Willie Scott that "We are going to die!"), and the infamous dinner with the eyeball soup, live baby snakes and, for dessert, chilled monkey brains. I understand the criticisms of racism in the film, but I think the complaints are exaggerated. Maybe Spielberg and George Lucas didn't need to be so nostalgic about Kipling and Gunga Din. It certainly isn't very politically correct, even in 1984. But I don't think the depictions of the Chinese and Indian characters, most of whom are villains, do much to demean entire races. I mean, I was a kid when I first saw this, so, if anyone was going to be aversely influenced by the supposed racism it would have been me. I knew these people were fictional characters, and that even if people like them existed, this didn't represent everyone who looks like them, and even the few it might represent were long since lost in time. These movies are so pulpy, it's hard to take them at all seriously. And as bug-eyed and crazy as the Eastern characters are, the three Western characters are all wildly exaggerated as well. You don't hear many British people bitching that Captain Blumburtt made all British people look stuffy and colonialist. And in all honesty, I would rather spend an evening with Mola Ram than I would with Willie Scott! Oh, I totally agree with anybody who would say that Kate Capshaw is absolutely intolerable throughout the picture, shrieking and whining endlessly. The movie needs a woman, for sure ? I think the "five minutes" sequence is one of the best parts of the movie, and Willie eating the apple in Indy's hand is one of a hundred images from the film seared in my mind. But they needed to tone her down, and a lot. On the other hand, I'm a big fan of Short Round, as well as Ke Huy Quan's other famous performance from The Goonies. Come on, everyone when I was a kid wanted to be Short Round (and I distinctly remember wanting to go as Data from The Goonies one Halloween). He was a kid who got to tag along with Indiana Jones! He even saves Indy's life not once, but twice, and, watching it this time, I was sincerely moved by the scene where Short Round brings Indy back to his senses and the two embrace. I really want to know what Indy did with him in the other movies (as Temple of Doom is chronologically Indy's first adventure, at least as far as the movies go).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second film in the "Jones" saga titled "The Temple of Doom" is clearly a darker and more violent film than the original "Raiders" in fact some say it's a prequel as it's set one year in 1935 before "The Lost Ark" took place. Yet the storyline is totally different as the films clearly have no connection. However one thing is for certain with the team up again of Lucas and Spielberg the action and direction of fast paced thrills is a given joy. And Harrison Ford's performance as "Indy" is at it's peak best again.This time Indy has a sidekick a young boy Short Round(Jonathan Quan)also a new love interest for Jones when he meets a club singer Willie(Kate Capshaw who would be Spielberg's future wife)the trio go on a high flying adventure from the Himalayas to a fast chasing mine shaft car ride in a fortress in India. Many scenes are spine tingling as much of the film is blended with violence and voodoo that's a lot to put up with just to find a crystal stone! Overall still a good film that keeps you on the edge of your seat just like "Raiders of the Lost Ark".</fullReview>

And guess what? It's absolutely fantastic.With a darker and often more gruesome tone, Temple of Doom leads Dr. Jones from a brawl in a Shanghai bar to a mystical village in India where he learns from the local people that an evil man has stolen their sacred stone and their children. Indy will of course be on the quest to save them.A relentless ride of excitement for 2 hours of entertainment of the highest calibre and also, bugs, insects, corpses, snakes, elephants and the whole thing that we have learned to love about Indiana Jones.A signature film and definitely one of the greatest adventures of all time, by possibly the greatest director of all time.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved it!! i had seen this a while ago and thought it wasn't as good as raiders and crusade, but i watched it again last night and was engrossed! Its a different theme from the Nazis and mythical objects in Foreign countries but its worth watching. Its interesting to see Indy and the crew in a different country and the partnership between all three of them is great better then the partnership in Raiders and Crusade. The film was dark mysterious and devil like and was quite spooky in places such as the scene where Indy and the crew exit the spike chamber and walk into the red tunnel where they hear the chanting of the sacrifice that freaked me out. The tension in this film was heartstopping and gave the feeling of ' whats coming next'. The plot is that Indy has done some diamond deal in Shanghai and a fight breaks out and Indy is pursued in a car and then goes onto a plane which happens to belong to his enemy. The pilots bail out in mid flight leaving Indy Shortie and Willie to die in the crash but no ones going to die with Indy around so they jump out on a raft and sail down a icy slope off a cliff into a river which could be pretty dangerous as they could be crocodiles or anything which could tear a little raft like that to shreds!!. Anyway they reach a village where the villages beg for them to rescue the stones and their children in Pankot palace. They all set off and reach the palace. After a dinner of snakes beetles and eyeball soup they head to their rooms and thats where the adventure starts down a dark dank dingy creepy passage that leads to hell on earth the secret temple of the thugee cults a crazed group of Indians who worship Kali lead by Mola Ram a crazed high priest who perform graphic sacrifices. Indy decides that he will get the stones and is caught along with Willey and Shortie and is tranced to become one of them he soons snaps out and they attempt to escape in a mine car chase to a ledge 100 feet a river filled with crocodiles after freeing the enslaved children, the final showdown is on a rope bridge Indy has no alternative but to cut the bridge sending the Thugees to the crocodiles who are eagerley awaiting feeding time and have an extra treat as Mola Ram ends up for dessert.

I find it more fun and lively then the other's despite having less character and story. The pace remains thrilling throughout, and the set-pieces simply continue to outshine their predecessor's with reckless glee.The essence of Indiana's second (but chronologically first) adventure may have been simplified, goofed on, and put through some kind of morbid angle, but the overall experience and pacing yielded an escapist film that even goes further to bring us along for the ride when being viewed for the first time at such a young age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second Indiana Jones installment is like a long, fun thrill ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It might just be the mine cart chase sequence at the end, but in reality that scene seems to sum up "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" quite accurately: a theme park ride. When the film was over, I wanted to go to Disneyland to ride the Indiana Jones ride.Harrison Ford stars once again as Hollywood's greatest adventure hero, Indiana Jones, in a film that serves as a prequel to "Raiders of the Lost Ark." In this film, Indy is finishing a job in Shanghai, with the help of his young sidekick Short Round, that goes awry and gets him stuck toting about a singer Willie (Kate Capshaw). On the plane ride out of the East, the three find they've been tricked and crash land in India, where they are sucked into a quest to retrieve an artifact from a hidden temple.The plot is pretty much garbage: all it does is allow for Indiana to fight against a crazy possessed tribe of Indians which means different sets and costumes, but it moves from one suspenseful scene to the next with bits of ridiculous comedy in between and proves to be all together quite fun. You find yourself constantly wondering how Indy will get out of the next death trap, waiting for the next gross insect or dead body to be found, and watching what cool move Indy will pull out of his sleeve next. It's great, quality entertainment. You don't care about the plot after awhile, you just want to see cool action scenes and the stunts in this film are awesome.Kate Capshaw gets a bit annoying in most of her scenes, but at least what happens to her is funny. There is something amusing about an elephant smacking her with his trunk over and over again as she has a normal conversation with Indy. Ford, however, is just as great as ever. Even though Jones spends most of 95% of the time as the adventurer and not the professor in this film, he is so much more human than most action heroes because he's not always getting out of every situation himself and he gets beat up pretty bad. Ford is great at being both humble and cool."Temple of Doom" ends up being a non-stop thrill ride, which is all it needs to be. All the things that made "Raiders" a great film get priority in this film, so it spends less time caring about the bizarre plot and more time testing the physical limits of Harrison Ford's body. While it may not be the strongest in the collection, it certainly holds its own and is not an Indiana Jones film to be passed on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Not as great as Raiders of the lost ark and more darker then Raiders of the lost Ark. But this movie consistently delivers the thrills chills and action that the movie going audience wanted from a sequel to Raiders. The Darker theme does tend to put off some people. Which is understandable given that sacrifices and child stealing is not your normal them for a action film. But Lucas and Spielberg and Ford make it work they play to the films strengths and the movie is made that much better for it. Kate Capshaw however is not the unusual Damsel in distress and at times her Willie Scott can be annoying but I guess it's because Lucas and Spielberg wanted to create a new heroine for Indy who would be I guess a little Wimpy. But Willie does grow on you by the movie's end. My biggest question at the movie's end is what does Happen to Short Round? They actually created a dynamic here that works and it makes you care about this kid and as a result I want to see further adventures of Indiana Jones and Short Round. I saw this movie when it was first released and it became one of my favorites and now 24 years later it's still one of my all time favorites. A worthy Prequel and a even more worthy story of..INDIANA JONES...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is back for the first time in this prequel to the original blockbuster "Raiders of the Lost Ark". None of the magic has been diminished in the least, as Indiana's 1935 adventures take him from gangster trouble in Hong Kong, to freeing enslaved children in India. All with his new love interest, Willie (Kate Capshaw) and orphaned kid sidekick, Short Round along for the ride. This second movie of the trilogy is every bit as great and thrilling as the first and when "The Last Crusade" came along half a decade late, they would form to make quite possibly the greatest trilogy EVER. And trust my, folks, I'm not one prone to mindless hyperbole.My Grade: A DVD-Rom content: an exclusive web link to get picture galleries, a PC game demo, and Raiders Animatic: Opening the Ark</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More of the same brand of witty dialogue, charismatic acting, and awesome action that made the first one such an exhilarating ride. Harrison Ford, like Sean Connery, is just eternally entertaining no matter what he does (at least in the Jones series.) Some people find Kate Capshaw's character annoying, but I think she's refreshing about-face from Karen Allen in the first film and even if her character is often grating, she's at least a well-drawn character and effectively acted. Short-Round's good fun and Mola Ram (the bad guy) remains one of cinema's most effective villains. Absolutely mesmerizing. The "Welcome" moment when he faces the good guys on the bridge at the end is absolute magic. I feel like this movie suffered from comparison to Raiders, because there really is no reason to dislike it. It's very entertaining and competently acted and scripted. My only complaint is it feels rushed ... nowhere near as fleshed out and complete as the first film. Much remains unexplained or is just briefly touched on, and it could have benefited from Sallah and Marcus. Aside from that, an uncommonly good action movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most anticipated sequel of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With perhaps the exception of The Empire Strikes Back also a dark film. To its critics I say nothing could compare to the originals either Raiders or Star Wars no matter what Lucas or Spielberg could do. That is a simple and undeniable fact and there is no getting around that no matter what people think. That point aside it was a OK movie I would not have had Kate Capshaw play her character the way she did though her voice is so damn annoying it's not cute or funny in any way she screams like she is getting ass raped by King Kong. Other than that the film moves along at a fast pace and there is enough humor included to offset the sadistic torture and people being burned alive with their hearts pulled out. For those of you who haven't seen it I'm not making this up I don't think little kids should watch this even though I did and I didn't set my house on fire or blow up the neighbor's cat. To conclude it was not the best film or even the best remake but it was decent enough to watch more than once. Followed by the Last Crusade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BEST OF THE BUNCH... yes, it's better than Raiders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so both Speilberg and Harrison Ford have both expressed that they think this one is to violent and dark. But it's also the most adventurous. I was only 7 years old when I saw this film 4 times in the theater in 1984.... and I feel like that 7 year old each time I watch it again. My favorite part of Raiders of the Lost Ark was the opening sequence... and although the rest of the film was excellent, it never lived up to that opening scene.... In Temple of Doom the whole film is like that opening scene in Raiders... you barely have time to breathe it's so adventure-packed. From the great James Bond style opening scene, to the river-raft out the plane. From the Mine Car Chase, to the Bridge scene (by far my favorite in all the Indiana Jones films). Sure this film is the most exploitive... but it also, BY FAR, the funnest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but doesn't have the fast flow of Raiders.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a pretty good movie, but unlike its predecessor it doesn't have the fast flow to it. Raiders goes by quick, while this one has boring parts. All the action in this one takes place in the beginning or the end with not much in the middle, but a few scenes to chuckle at. It starts great with a nightclub fight and a great plane crash sequence. Here Indiana meets Kate Capshaw's character. They end up in India I think along with Indiana's sidekick. They run into a village and go to some fort or castle where a kid is king to get this stone that was stolen from the village. There they encounter a strange cult that sacrifices people into some lava pit and the head guy there can pull people's heart out. They also use the village's children as slaves in the mine there. This leads to mine car chases and a very good battle on a bridge. All in all though this one just seems to run a bit to long, as it doesn't have as good of pacing as "Raiders of the Lost Ark" did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as good as Raiders of the lost ark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I begin. I just saw this movie again a half an hour ago and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. I saw "Raiders" the previous week and remembered what a good movie it is (9/10), but my childhood memories of the Indianan Jones series were all from this one. Maybe this shows that this movie is probably best digestible for the kids. But don't get me wrong!The opening scene in the restaurant is very entertaining untill Jones jumps into a car driven by a 10 year old boy. From then on the movie takes an enormous step backwards portraying unnecessary stupidness and comic relief that only an eight year old will find satisfactory. "Raiders" was a gem compared to this superficial excuse of an adventure movie. There are so many stupid mistakes and unbelievable action parts that you can't help but think that you're probably watching one of the most disappointing Spielberg movies ever. Indiana grows a beard over night (during the flight) and the woman calls him "Indie" (how does she even know his friends call him that)the second day as if they had known each other since eternity. But don't get me started on the female part of this movie just yet, I'll come back to her later.Anyway, after an amazing and extremely believable (NOT!!) rescue from the plane the plot part of the movie starts to formulate. Ooooops, did I say plot, believe me when I say that you have a better chance of finding a plot in a Levis jeans commercial. But let's put that aside for the moment and concentrate on the rest of the movie. The boy, serving as a comic relief succeeds in some parts but is annoying in more. Ford is good as usual, doing many parts of his acting merely with his eyes. And they can be really powerful. But the woman, oh Lord, the woman is the icing on a cake to this fiasco of shere unintelligent entertainment. Because that is what this movie really is. You have to completely switch off the part of your brain that directs reason. Well, they reach a castle surrounded by enormous blood-sucking vampires that are nervously flying across the screen for the next few minutes. And the movie reaches its high point of stupidness with the infamous "feast" at the dinner table. After that the romantic part of the movie comes to life, and boy is it believable. Yeah, and Kate Capshaw got the part because of her talent. There was some talent involved, but it as hell wasn't acting. She's almost as bad in this movie as Sharon Stone was in "King Solomone's Mines", which by the way was the B-rate movie answer to the Indiana Jones movie, shamelessly copying them in every aspect and not even bothering to hide it. Her character is so annoying and isn't funny at all. When she poured perfume on the elephant's head I wished I could meet the writer of this movie and get Clockwork Orange on his ass.But after the romance comes one of the scarriest scenes in movie history (to me that is since I can't stand bugs). There are some huge and horrible bugs crawling onto the characters making me shiver even as I am writing this review. Now that's what I call horror. And that's where the movie suddenly becomes enjoyable and the nostalgic sense of it's predecessor comes to life. Apart from the scene where Mola Ram rips the guy's heart out of his chest which then magically heals, the movie goes from terrible to very entertaining. Highly action packed scenes take you for a ride of a life, like the one on the bridge. Pure genius, to cut the ropes. The effects, both in the tunnel and on the bridge are exceptionally well done for that time and if Spielberg played his cards right in the first half I'd be praising this movie right now. But just to let you know that the good part of the movie was there purely by chance the film makers decided to end the movie with a lesson learned for Indie:"Yes, now I see the power of the stone". Now that's deep.Ha. This is a movie that could have easily been better that the first one, but lacks everything to do so. There's not even a new theme, or even the dark one from the first movie. To enjoy it you have to be either a kid or completely ignore the connection with "Raiders". 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has not aged well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Temple of Doom again after all these years was probably not a good idea. Apart from the final chase sequence, which is brilliant, I am not quite sure what I saw in this movie in the first place. It starts with a ridiculously over-the-top and quite illogical sequence set in Shanghai, aka Macau (why would a gangster bother to offer Indy a genuine poison antidote when he has no intention of giving it to him? For that matter, if he finds Indy so useful as a supplier of valuable artifacts, why kill him?), followed by one of the most absurd Hollywood clichés ever, when a plane with an empty fuel tank hits a wall and bursts into flame. After that, it doesn't get much better, with many more clichés and the excruciatingly bad performance by Kate Capshaw (though, to be fair to her, who could possibly perform well with such appalling lines?) Then the grotesque absurdity of a man pulling out another man's heart with his bare hand (apparently without encountering a ribcage on the way) and the heartless victim continuing to scream for a couple of minutes before being lowered into a cliché burning pit.The only reason I kept watching was knowing that the chase sequence was coming up - and even that wasn't as good as I remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best adventure movies you'll ever see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: **** out of ****Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom has caught a LOT of flack over the years since its first release. It's hard to say whether or not the criticism has died down a bit; the movie sure does seem to have its fan base. Admittedly, not all the stated faults are unfair or have no justification; this is indeed the most flawed of the Indiana Jones adventures. But as such, a deeply flawed Jones outing is still likely more fun than the next dozen summer blockbusters you're likely to see all year long.Set in 1935 (meaning this is a prequel to Raiders), Harrison Ford once again stars as our titular hero, this time in a Chinese nightclub, making a trade for a valuable diamond. Things don't go as planned and an all-out brawl ensues, finally resulting in Jones, singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw), and kid sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) on the run from a Chinese gang. They eventually take off on a plane carrying poultry cargo, but the pilots happen to work for the leader of that gang Jones had the run in with.Thus, Jones and his two partners are stuck in India, where they arrive at a devastated village. Investigating further, Jones decides to head to Pankot Palace, which seems to be the source of the problem. There he discovers the renewed Thugee Cult, bent on world domination with the complete collection of the Sankara Stones. Just what these stones will do...the movie doesn't specify. But this all leads to Indiana Jones kicking butt, and lots of it, too.The somewhat lukewarm response Temple of Doom initially received wasn't surprising. As the sequel to (at the time) the greatest action movie in existence, there's a lot to live up to. I, for one, was not disappointed. The movie promised a breathless thrill ride and it delivered one. And where else are you going to see elaborate booby traps and exotic settings?Temple of Doom's first half is sensationally entertaining, actually about the equal of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The movie's opening action sequence is a knockout, and the scenes afterward find the right touch of creepiness to make for an intriguing story. It only gets better when they reach Pankot Palace, as we witness the classic dinner scene, truly funny romantic interaction between Jones and Willie, and a spike-filled booby trap scene that is alternately suspenseful and hilarious, thanks to Ford's dead-on reaction ("We are going to Die!").It's the second half that isn't as successful. Once Jones actually encounters the Thuggee Cult, things get rather unpleasant. The sight of children being whipped stops the fun to a dead halt, and there's a fairly graphic depiction of a man whose heart is removed...by hand. These scenes are also set underground, which makes for a very grimy and dark setting, not necessarily the best for an adventure movie.But thankfully, things pick up significantly for the final half-hour, which is arguably the most exciting extended action sequence of the whole trilogy. It all begins with thrilling fistfights and whip-swinging, then turns to a roller-coaster ride on a minecart, then concludes on a shaky bridge overlooking a river full of alligators. The action is wildly thrilling and breathtaking, featuring awesome stunts and brilliant cinematography (particularly during the minecart chase). There's also one shot which features Jones standing poised right before he knocks out a villain (off-screen) that's probably the coolest single scene in the whole series.Interestingly enough, Temple of Doom happens to be the only Jones film that ends on an action sequence; in this case, we get four. How can anyone complain about that, especially considering just how damned entertaining these action scenes are? Yeah, there are a few implausibly silly moments, especially the scene where Willie and Short Round cross an entire bridge without noticing the villain on the other side. But such contrivances are forgivable given just how viscerally exciting the movie is.John Williams' score nicely reuses the Raiders march theme to great effect. The other themes in the score are nicely done, a fitting match to the movie's tone and pacing. The special effects and production values are mostly excellent, only the imposition of the alligators at the end is slightly unconvincing. Otherwise, the movie looks like it could have just been released for the first time yesterday.Where Temple of Doom definitely improves over Raiders is the humor quotient, which is a few notches higher in quantity and quality here. Harrison Ford's performance contributes highly to this factor, just note his reaction to a threat off-screen (you'll know what I'm talking about, it's the scene right after he dispatches of two swordfighters). I think we're all in agreement when we say no one else could have played this role half as well as Ford. It's the part he was born for, and he's absolutely terrific. As for Kate Capshaw, she can be loud and annoying, but I actually prefer her over Karen Allen, if only because she and Ford have better chemistry together.At any rate, The Temple of Doom is still great fun, and certainly superior to any bit of escapist entertainment Hollywood's churned out the past several months. Apparently, Spielberg didn't much like this film, so The Last Crusade was his atonement. He didn't need to apologize, but it's nice to see his apology wound up being the best action film I've ever seen. By the way, has anybody else wondered how Indiana Jones managed to retrieve his brown coat (which was left in the cave) and still get ahead of the children at the end?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is tempting to apply the term "cartoony" to Temple of Doom, but that would be an insult to cartoons. Mechanical and uninspired, it succeeded in being half-baked and stale at the same time. Sequels, made to reduce financial risk, degrade both the film maker and audience. The prominently marketed yet forgettable "two scimitar warriors" scene is a microcosm of our dying culture's futile struggle to replicate Originality.The interminable "suspended lava cage" scene is perhaps the low point of Mr. Spielberg's career. I was appalled to see the *same overhead shot* repeated a dozen times as Ms. Capshaw screamed with every rise and fall. To convey fear, I would have used a simple close-up of her eyes.

This results in a car chase through the streets, then in the sky, before a crash landing in poverty stricken India that results in him going off on a quest to find a mystical stone that was stolen from a village. But Indy's got some excess baggage coming along for the ride, in the shape of an un-co-operative, moody lounge dancer (Kate Capshaw) and a really bratty Japanese kid he saved from the streets.With the 'classic' original film coming out two years before I was born and the sequels just ending up sort of floating by the by, the Indiana Jones films ended up being ones I ended up getting into later in life. But having seen the original all the way for the first time last night, and now giving the sequel a go tonight, I could see what kind of films they were meant to be, with it copying the original's style of 'opening in the action.' They are real 'boys own' films, all about the flash and spectacle, but what flash and spectacle. This sequel boasts some truly terrific, brilliantly filmed action sequences that couldn't fail to satisfy the most demanding of action fans. You'd have to see them to believe them.As for the performances, Ford just does his usual grumbling tough guy act, Kapshaw just waves her arms about and shrieks a lot, in a role that looks pretty degrading and beneath her for roles she'd do later in her career and the bratty kid is, well, really bratty. Don't expect much in the way of depth, but if you want grand spectacle and adventure, you've definitely come to the right place. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) is very bashed and hate it. I can not believe it! It was my first film since I watched as a child and I con not believe that those people are bashing this film and saying The Last Crusade is superior film to this one?! If you think that, than don't watch Indiana Jones films at all!!!!!! I think Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is very decent action, classic adventure flick. It is a decent and a worthy sequel to superior film Raiders of The Lost Ark (1984) from beginning till end. It is my second favorite film alongside with Raiders of the Lost Ark. The first film will always be the best one in the series, but this film isn't bad either!! Raiders of the Lost Ark is rated:PG and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is also rated PG and I think it is a great, Entertain not boring f, but fast paced Action Adventure flick. By the MPAA Rating:is PG-13 nut in USA and other country's is Rated PG! So is PG!!! Yes the film has a flaws and mistakes, so what? Tell me any film that doesn't have a mistakes and errors in it? This film along side with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) that are very underrated and bashed for their credits for it! If you don't like this film, than you don't like Indiana Jones or any other film? What is your problem with this film? Seriously! Though not as spectacular as Raiders but boy is it entertaining I love Indy in this movie I love short round and I love the darker tone. It has a lot of Action in this film, yes a lot! It is a prequel that starts one year earlier before Raiders started. I love Raiders a lot, but for Me it'll always be Temple of Doom, that was the first Indy film I ever saw as a kid, and I liked how different it was from all the others, it was kind of like a horror film and it also had the best action out of all of them, Last crusade was good primarily because of Sean Connery, but it was too similar to Raiders for my taste. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) It is the second installment in the Indiana Jones franchise and a prequel to the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark A Classic a very Underrated sequel in the series. I know I should choose The Last Crusade but The Temple of Doom was the first movie I ever saw in the Indiana Jones series. It Is a prequel movie to Raiders of Lost Ark (1981) but still a classic sequel. Very hated and poorly ranted from their fans, Everyone choose The Last Crusade but no one choose this movie. So I choose Raiders of the lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom over Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Hate me all you want, the fact is Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is very Underrated classic sequel from the 80's after a highly success of the first film Raiders of the Lost Ark. Both of the movies are rated PG while the Last Crusade and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull both of the films are rated PG-13 so thanks a lot. This film also won 1 Academy Awards including for best visual effects and Best Music, Original Score John Williams.When Raiders became a box office smash, no doubt Indy would be back. Bur how do George Lucas and Steven Spielberg top themselves with a worthy follow-up? They don't. They go the unheard-of prequel route. Yep Temple of Doom takes place a few years before Raiders as we learn a little about Indy's fear of snakes and his quest to save the Ankara stones from (yep I'll say it) Doom! Inserting Kate Capshaw and a Goonie (Short Round) into the mix was bizarre all on its own as Temple of Doom brought a "dark side" of Indy that left many fans annoyed but nonetheless entertained. Set in 1935, a professor, archaeologist, and legendary hero by the name of Indiana Jones is back in action in his newest adventure. After arriving in India, Indiana Jones is asked by a desperate village to find a mystical stone. He agrees, and stumbles upon a secret cult plotting a terrible plan in the catacombs of an ancient palace.Temple of Doom feels the most like a complete movie, flowing from start to finish, chock full of genuine humor, great action, and has a horror/supernatural vibe that feels more authentic than the spiritual elements of both Raiders and Crusade.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a 1984 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is the second installment in the Indiana Jones franchise and a prequel to the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark.10/10 Grade: A Studio: Paramount Pictures, Lucas film Starring: Harrison Ford, Kate Capshaw, Jonathan Ke Quan, Amrish Puri, Roshan Seth, Philip Stone Director: Steven Spielberg Producer: Robert Watts Screenplay: Willard Huyck, Gloria Katz Story: George Lucas Rated: PG Running Time: 1 Hr. 58 Mins.

		<shortDescription>Indy's back in what I consider good form in a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Temple of Doom, an Indiana Jones widely criticised for being too dark and just not as good as the others, but for me this is a worthy entry. Not only is Indy on good form, Spielberg is also on great form and together it creates a movie that is entertaining and enjoyable. The film also may not have as much adventure as say Raiders or Last Crusade but in any case it is good fun and an addition I don't mind.Harrison Ford continues to be in good shape for the films, he doesn't do any worse than he did in Raiders, maybe there is a little less action from him but in any case his humour and adventurous spirit is acted out well. Kate Capshaw as Willie is well, quite a bit annoying, I mean the acting isn't bad(but not great really) it is just the constant screaming and moaning can really get on your nerves. The addition of the young man that is Short Round(Jonathan Ke Quan) is a good one, some may argue he is a little annoying which he can be but he creates a certain lighter tone among the more dark things going on.No matter what Spielberg may think of this movie, I for one found it to be well done by him and one that should be a movie to be proud of. Without Lawrence Kasdan you may think the script would be poor and not a good example of writing in Indiana Jones movies, but for me Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz create something that is fine, not perfect by any means but it at least forms a nice basis for the entire picture.Don't get me wrong here, Temple of Doom can have its fairly dull moments and points maybe of negativity. The pacing of the film is just a little off, sometimes you can have all out action then none at all and even the thrills disappear then reappear out of nowhere, this is truly a film that moves fast and slow in its story. Of course with just under two hours of a movie you can't just sit around all of the time but I admit I found the middle parts to be slightly duller than say the beginning and end but all in all it is a solidly put together piece.One thing I found this movie is underrated for is actually the darkness it holds, sure people then and some people even now find it a little too dark but in truth I feel that is what makes it different. Of course the film is not realistic(I mean come on) but what it does do is bring a more realistic kind of tone to if what was going on were real, this is how it would be done, with blood and all. I personally didn't find it too dark, I admit like others also think that the treatment of Indian culture and faith is not exactly spot on here although I never found it to be overly horrible, just maybe don't claim Indians eat monkey heads and snakes for their dinner. Overall I enjoyed this and I would come back to it no doubt, as mentioned maybe not as good as say Raiders or Last Crusade but in any case it is an adventure and a half anyway. I think if you consider yourself a fan of adventure and for some reason you haven't seen this movie yet, then I would say go find it and see it, it's the kind of fun we are used to from Indiana Jones and added in is some new characters and new villains too. Funny, thrilling and all together a very watchable movie, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a movie that should be watched and shouldn't be hated as much as some do, plain and simply this movie for me personally, is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indiana Jones strikes back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before "Raiders", Spielberg already dreamed of making a movie on James Bond style (a beautiful and intelligent man who knows how to fight and conquer women around the world), with the help of George Lucas not only he did something much better and at one point similar. At least until his great (and underrated) sequel that is "Temple of Doom".On the first part of the film Spielberg not only realizes his dream of putting something similar to James Bond, but his dream of making a musical. As soon in the first scene of the film, there is a beautiful choreographed musical number with the beautiful Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) as the singer, Indi's new girl in the movie. Also in the first scenes of the movie we see our hero Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in a beautiful white suit with a flower in his chest drinking Martini (almost an American James Bond), but suddenly all gets crooked and a beautiful ass kicking begins in the bar, and Indi ends up escaping and unwittingly with the beautiful and dumb Willie with the help of the small "Short Round" (Jonathan Ke Quan) in a wild car chase. Later we already see our badass teacher with the cowboy hat and whip on the waist just leaving another job half done poorly, with their new partner and the irritating Willie complaining about her "kidnapping", returning home. But thanks to another huge scene, Indi and his friends end up finding themselves in India (no, not Indi origins story) and finds himself in a situation to find a strange artifact that can save a poor village suffering from drought and famine, but the mission will lead our hero in the bowels of an evil and violent place.Many complain of the movie to be much darker and violent than its predecessor (all thanks to Luke influence of his masterpiece that was "Empire Strikes Back", also a sequel), and perhaps due to some dialog flaws it doesn't reach the foots of the masterpiece that was "Raiders", but thanks to Spielberg the film keeps all the beautiful rhythm of its predecessor, thanks to Spielberg and his stylish direction that improves as ever.The film follows with a beautiful rhythm (the movie's pacing of time here is far more superior than its predecessor) everything flows perfectly from the spectacular action scenes (including another classic persecution in the trilogy) the script sometimes fails in dialogs but flows with a beautiful, intelligent and humorous narrative. Even with the film at the end gets a touch dark and violent tone, but it is exactly when our hero is coming into the lair of the evil, the film from the start thanks to Willie character has a humorous comic relief (and if you ever wondered how the blonde jokes started, it was thanks to this film).And Spielberg gets a great evolution in his direction giving the film superb action scenes from start to finish, in technical aspects Spielberg's films never disappoint, especially that which shows one of the best teams to build a Hollywood film.While not reaching the feet of his predecessor, "Temple" keeps the beautiful rhythm that made " Raiders" a masterpiece, bringing the franchise to a new level that may be disturbing to some (but all Spielberg's films always differed much) just gives new strength to our unforgettable hero Indiana Jones and his excellent film.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So just because a movie's tone gets darker from its original it gets hate???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a great and extremely fun movie which I was a little disappointed when giving it a 9. I enjoyed the story, the characters, loved the visuals, the battles and the music was breath-taking however I thought the villain wasn't as great as it could've been. To me 'Temple of Doom' clearly shows how much greater a villain can be produced by this franchise. However, at first, I was skeptical about watching this due to the bashing this film receives I honestly still don't get why its bashed. To be fair, I love this as much as the first and actually...Even more! This film was extremely dark, intense, action packed and hilarious. The film follows the tale of our one or two heroes and our damsel in distress. Indy sets off to a palace in India by the name of Pankota Palace to return a lost stone that belonged to a poor village which was responsible for the loss of all their children and their protection from danger. At Pankota Palace, a whole lot of trouble and comedy and action ensues... How can anyone not love this movie. Its a lot funnier than the first. Willy is stupid yet hilarious and there's something about her that doesn't make her the Jar Jar. Shorty was such a cool little kid and I just loved him. Besides, the kid who played him had such amazing chemistry with Harrison Ford and I connected and really loved him. The battle scenes in the movie were done better than in the first in general but 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' has the truck chase action scene that cannot be topped.This movie is extremely action packed, suspenseful, hilarious, emotional, down right frightening and just brilliant. Every aspect of the first film that was great is just as great to me in this second installment in what is easily one of my favorite sequels of all time. The new John Williams soundtrack is extremely brilliantly done, the story is very fascinating and honestly, I prefer this over its original- which to me says a lot! I can conclude here that everything I loved about 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is to me, done better in a darker, funnier, more intense and frightening sequel...which is surprisingly enough a prequel!?! Definitely a must see and definitely a must ignore critics film. You will truly miss a lot of fun watching this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of 1984 !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1984 was considered one of the best summers or yrs. ever for films .With underrated films like The last starfighter, Buckaroo Banzai, Night of the comet etc... Along with popular films like purple rain, karate kid, star trek III, romancing the stone,The Terminator &amp; Then there are the blockbusters Beverly hills cop, Gremlins, Ghostbusters &amp; Indiana Jones &amp; the temple of doom . &amp; of course the Oscar films . Despite the flaws of Indy II .It was the best film of 1984 &amp; one of the best sequels or(prequels) ever made . Along with gremlins, Indy II was the reason for the PG-13 rating, because of it's dark tone . Though still entertaining at a breakneck pace providing a unforgettable adventure that has over the years gained a better reputation than when it was released. Not many action adventure films even today could match 1984's Indiana Jones &amp; The Temple Of Doom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than it's reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before 2008 rolled around, Temple of Doom was considered the weakest of the Indiana Jones movies. Though I personally prefer it to Last Crusade (Raiders is far and ahead the best), I'll admit it's inferior from a critical standpoint. For one thing its McGuffin the Sankara Stones, are not as fully realized as the Holy Grail or the Lost Ark. The Ark consumed a platoon of Nazis in fiery wrath. The Grail healed Indy's father and can give eternal life to anyone who drinks from it. The stones start on fire when Jones recites an incantation. When, at the end of the film, Indy says he now understands the power of the stones we do not share in that understanding. Another problem in the film is Willie Scott, Jones' love interest, whose incessant screaming gets annoying after a while. There's also some badly written dialogue. In many scenes people talk over each other, I realize this happens in real life but on film, frankly, it's distracting. Despite all this the film is well made overall. The action scenes are quite exciting, though sloppier than in Raiders. The characters all develop and change through the course of the movie. Indy goes from being glory seeking treasure hunter to becoming a wiser, better man at the end of the film, where he gives the last remaining stone to the villagers. Short Round, Indy's sidekick in this film, actually saves him on multiple occasions, making him more than just another person to get Indy into trouble. Willie changes from a spoiled, rich singer, to smarter more caring person. She also grows closer to Indy and Short Round over the course of the film. Finally, the villain, Mola Ram is appropriately over the top, albeit rather two dimensional. John Williams score is, as always, outstanding.Temple of Doom is a fun throwback to old pulp adventure films from the 30's. Overall, despite being the weakest of the first three Indiana Jones movies, Temple of Doom is a solid adventure film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indiana Jones is one of the of the best action/adventure film series in the history of cinema. Steven Spielberg yet again is in the directors seat. This movie is a prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Unlike the other movies in the series, this one is set mostly in one place and is darker and more serious. This movie starts out with Indy in a restaurant in China and he escapes with a dancer and a young Chinese boy in a plane and then they go to India. Once their, Indy is charged with recovering the magical stones to a village that has been swept with drought and the children have gone missing. The scenes that really made me cringe are the dinner scene, when Willie reaches for a lever to stop the spikes from crushing Indy and Short and when Mola Rom rips out a guys heart. But nonetheless, I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Indians don't eat monkey brains for dessert.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opens with an overweight oriental man naked above the waist swinging a mallet against a giant gong. Overlaying the gong is the text: A Lucasfilm Ltd. Production, as he strikes the gong three times, and the film begins. Now that's humor! It sets the tone for the rest of the movie, which, although pretending to be scary and dark, is perhaps the funniest of the Indiana Jones movies. Oh, if you don't get the joke, your not a real film buff.Next we see a hot babe singing in Chinese, French and English, with tons of chorus girls. This is Shanghai in 1935. Spielberg did another film set in Shanghai in 1941, and actually filmed in Shanghai: Empire of the Sun. It was essentially a British colony back then, until the Japanese invaded.And who is that hot babe singing Cole Porter's "Anything Goes"? Kate Capshaw? Never heard of her. Oh, sorry, Mrs. Spielberg.If you look up the lyrics to "Anything Goes," one of the most notorious American pop songs, you will see why it was better sung in Mandarin, considering this is a children's movie. The song is more a comment on 1930s Shanghai than the subsequent action, or lack of it, for Indiana Jones is a gentleman. I thought the way Indy gets dragged into his latest adventure in India, starting from a ritzy nightclub in Shanghai, was clever. The scenes of child slave labor inside a cave have a primeval resonance, but are not as scary as they look, at least to an adult. It's more camp, which is OK.The Indian government was reluctant to allow the movie to be filmed in India. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Harrison Ford, what's to agree to? Oh, a bribe. Either the government ministers were stupid, corrupt, or, more likely, both. When was the last time you met an Indian government official with a sense of humor? About as rare as a TSA inspector who can take a joke.Not good for India's image. Racist stereotypes, according to one reviewer here, and according to the Indian government, which originally banned the film. (Yeah, here we go again, the old "Americans are racists" because of some Hollywood movie.) In my opinion, anyone who forms opinions about the real world based on an Indiana Jones movie, especially this one, which is pure fantasy, is delusional and beyond hope. Like we're going to think that all Indians make daily human sacrifices and eat monkey brains for dessert, though they do look tasty. Someone doesn't have a sense of humor.There is one element of truth: there were Thuggees, who robbed travelers and had a secret society with a religious element, which is not unusual, as everyone in India (except Indiana, despite his name) has some religious angle; India may have as many religious sects as France has cheeses.Jonathan Ke Quan does a great job. It always amazes me how anyone can play a starring role in their very first film, especially a kid. This is a fun film, but is probably scarier for kids than adults. I wasn't going to write a review, until I saw the nonsense that had been posted. If you haven't seen this and you like good movies, you will enjoy it, as long as you don't take it too seriously. For kids 15 and under, I would rate this a 9 or 10. BTW, if you don't get the opening, watch a Rank Organization film, such as "The Lady Killers," or at least the first two minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disaster saved by a wonderful setting and a selection of memorable thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second installment in the Indiana Jones series and prequel to "Raiders of the Lost Ark" has as many pros as it does cons. The action sequences are much more explosive and thrilling, but this outing doesn't seem to have a heart (no pun intended). It was thrilling for the sake of being thrilling, with very little relevance to the story. Annoyingly no other reprising characters aside from Ford, who is still the awesome archaeologist, on an adventure to return a sacred precious stone that was stolen from a village that believes evil spirits have taken their children away from them. You can see where this story tries to prevent itself from falling after slipping on a banana peel, right? And its self-awareness of the dreadfully annoying love interest (Capshaw) and sidekick (Ke Quan) doesn't pay off in any way. From the start, the film is doomed (again, no pun intended) during the opening credits playing over a corny Capshaw performing Cole Porter's 1934 classic "Anything Goes", its presence in this film unnecessary in every single form. But this film is saved by the beautiful setting of Indian, and a ritual scene about an hour into the film which caused so much controversy that the MPAA created PG-13!** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Save me Indiana, your our only hope!' comes the eternal line from this Lucas classic. Dr Jones has been in 19th Century China for the weekend in search the famed Diamond of Chung ?Sh- g'Argolarath. After an exciting chase through downtown somewhere Indy and his trusty companion Skid-Mark escape to a plane. Unbeknownst to them though, the plane belongs to Hitler and they are in for ein bumpy ride. Also unbeknownst to them, they know that Willy Fog- an ex of Indianopolis has stowed away on the plane also as well. Once the pilots have reached 300 feet (known in nautical terms as Terminal Velocity) they parachute out leaving the trio to plummet to their deaths. Indy and Diddy-Kong search the plane but unfortunately find there are only 'four more parachutes!' As there are four parachutes and 3 people this proves to be too confusing a mathemagical conundrum for them and they crash into the earth, dead.Awaking in the afterlife they find that they are stranded in a crazy nether region full of 'vampiric' bats and Induans. Dr. Johns sees this as a valuable archaeological study- if he can somehow bring himself back to life with some proof of this city of the afterlife then he will be a millionaire. Indy, Willy, and Side-Kick find a mountain village where all the children have been kidnapped or eaten by an evil sect of demons. They stole some precious God stones from the village elders and have been powerful freaks ever since. They plead with Indy to rescue the children and the stones, and in return they will send the gang back to Earth in time for supper. Soon they find themselves in a palace type fortress full of lovely food such as Monkey's filled with snakes, snakes filled with monkeys, monkey's filled with skunkies, and of course staples. Everything looks normal, or as normal as it can be for being a unique tomb of the abnormal. They investigate further and find a slave trade, murder, torture, and humane sacrifice. The main bad guy is called Kal Yer Ma and he delights in his demonic vestal rites, puling out hearts at will and hypnotising people at a glance. He throws Willy into a volcano, turns Mindy into a slave, and only Kick-Start can save the day.Suffice to say all this is very funny and excitement. There are the usual jokes, fights, and chases- the best being the mine cart ride where Diddy Kong keeps being stretched across the tracks. A fat guy gets crushed by a fat stone, spikes come out of ceilings, spiders and crabs and beasties crawl everywhere, and the finale is a big fight and chase in a tank across a rope bridge over a pit of croc infested lava. All in all this is the best Indymania film and I would suggest that you watch it with your eyes. Open.Best Scene: Trying to spot Dan Akroyd's cameo in the film; look very closely in the scene with the bugs- he is dressed as a giant woodlouse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indiana Jones and the temple of doom is by far the weakest in the series. It's disgusting, deranged, and wicked. But that doesn't make it a bad film. I know it's the worst. But I still really like it for many reasons. I like it because for years, I never knew it was a prequel. Come on, I find that as sort of a surprise. I also like it because like with the Bond film Live and let die, it stands out from the series. I also like it because Harrison ford returns.I also like it because Steven Spielberg's wife Kate Capshaw is in it. I don't like it because it's gross. People get there hearts ripped out, they eat monkey brains, they walk through a ton of bugs. Also,I don't like how they're kidnapping the starving children. It's just a disturbing film at times. Back to the likes. There are tons of spectacular action scenes, like when they are in the mine and it's flooding. That may be my favorite part in the film. This film is very original, i'll give it that. But it didn't have what the other films had. I still really enjoyed Indiana Jones and the temple of doom, But it isn't a Raiders of the lost ark or Last Crusade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a second look, 25 years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be brief. When I saw Temple of Doom in the theater in 1984, there were a few things in it that just plain ruined it for me, and made it a big letdown as the much-anticipated follow-up to the greatness the was Raiders. Certain things in the movie were just too *unbeleiveably* hokey, unabashedly ludicrous. Sure, I know, it was a movie, more Saturday matinée escape-ism from Spielberg and Lucas, recapturing their boyhood wonder at the old adventure serials. But some things in this movie simply took my willing suspension of disbelief, kicked it in the tenders, defecated on it, and then laughed at me. I'm not talking about small petty things like the numerous ways they found to make Kate Capshaw shriek and whine every 5 minutes. I'm talking about the deal-breakers, like the cushy ski-landing of the air-raft on a snowy slope, after plummeting through countless seconds of sky (and shrieking). I'm talking about the bafflement of somebody inexplicably surviving the sight of their own beating heart being ripped from their own chest, only to be plunged (still conscious and screaming) into a pit of lava several long (heartless) seconds later. I'm talking about physics-defying mine-cart jumps between broken rails at breakneck speeds, carts landing again and again with perfect precision on target rails that could only be hit with the aid of divine intervention. That crap... would never happen. Because it *couldn't* happen. So what if it was just a movie. You pushed my wiling suspension of disbelief too far. You... abused it. And this sequel/prequel was nothing more than an exploitative cash-in. I could almost see them saying "Oh boy, the audiences will just *love* this part!" Phleh...Well, somehow during that first viewing, I missed the significance of that village elder saying that Shiva had sent Indy to bring back the stolen children. And that was a key point. A *plot* point, that brings it all together. Watching 25 years later, I get it. Yeah, the guy without the heart, that was just a black magic illusion, representative of the forces of evil. But the falling raft salvation? The mine-cart landings, well... those things actually *were* divine intervention. Indy is the good guy, and unseen supernatural forces of good were helping him the whole way. Just... think about it. Let's just say that I appreciate this movie a lot more now than I did then. It's a lot better than I had thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inconsistent yet vastly entertaining and intriguingly experimental adventure romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is anything worse for a film than living up to the expectations of a rapturously received predecessor, it is attempting to remain valid amidst a shroud of cultural degradation and dismissal. Sadly, legendary director Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom proved subject to both. Riding on the heels of the enormously successful Raiders of the Lost Ark, Spielberg's sequel remains frequently ignored or ridiculed amongst the rest of the series as "the bad one" (now arguably superseded by critical scorn towards recent Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) or (justifiably) "the one too scary for kids". Nonetheless, such an unfavourable reputation appears a case of years of cultural referencing overshadowing the film itself, as Temple of Doom manages to not only hold its own against (if not outright match up to) the first and third Jones films in terms of shameless fun factor, but also offers enough intriguingly unique elements to make it well worth repeat viewings, despite initial skepticism.While the singular most common sequel clause is to "go darker", Spielberg paradoxically embraces both this maxim and its polar opposite. Just as often as Temple of Doom unsettles with its disturbingly intense, harrowing and painfully topical subject matter (child abduction and slavery and satanic cult worship somewhat step up the "MacGuffin" stakes...) and vicious violence, Spielberg opts for extremely broad, often juvenile humour, as if in a rushed attempt to cancel out both extremes and arrive at a happy medium. Instead, the two tonal opposites only serve to enunciate the excesses of both, making the picture feel inconsistent and lacking a clear demographic (just as children would flinch from seeing a heart ripped from a body, adults would only groan at animal and gross-out food jokes). But somehow Spielberg manages to rein in the entire picture short of becoming a chaotic mess and retains his winning flair for compelling, unavoidably enjoyable storytelling enough to wrangle a supremely entertaining film out of it. The film maintains such a rapid pace and with such enthusiasm that its audience is more or less forced to resign to the delirious fun factor of it all.In fact, in some odd way, the hectic tonal imbalances feel somewhat fitting for what appears to be in many ways Spielberg's most whimsical entry into the Jones series, exercising an uncommonly cheeky wit and madcap exuberance. Forgoing the usual slow, expository sequences at Jones' university, the film begins with an exquisitely self-referential bang, subverting viewer expectations by opening with a 1930s style musical number in favour of a jungle chase and paying homage to the franchise's inspiration with a superb James Bond spoof. And the pace hardly slows afterwards, displacing the action to sumptuously scenic (allegedly) India, and providing a seemingly endless supply of chases, scares and exhilarating fights. And while the cheese factor remains strong, seemingly flaunting its myriad of clichéd circumstances rather than attempting to conceal them, the film's unabashedly tongue in cheek exuberance makes it exceedingly difficult not to warm to, making the film just as likely to evoke cheers from every audience member regardless of age or cinematic cynicism. Spielberg also continues his apparent experimental streak by infusing the film with an uncommonly sturdy technical foundation. While the film's predecessor and successor often demonstrated cheerfully clunky technical work so as to not distract from the breathless adventure in store, it is easy to overlook how surprisingly technically proficient Temple of Doom is. Normally innocuous, Spielberg's cameras move fluidly, often quite artistically and incessantly, whether breathlessly zooming down vertical surfaces to amplify the tension to uncomfortable levels or utilising cold hard close ups to punctuate claustrophobic unease with gleeful, unhinged energy and vitality. Similarly, Spielberg demonstrates a fantastic use of dramatic lighting, casting gaping shadows over seedy antagonists and a dramatic dull glow over the most hopeless of sequences, amplifying the infectious emotional component with hard worn ease. It of course goes without saying that John Williams' triumphantly grandiose musical score lifts the film's quality exponentially, maintaining that even at its darkest moments the film remains an Indiana Jones film, and thus larger than life and near impossible to dislike. As such, the majority of the film's more glaring errors in judgement lie on the performance front. While Harrison Ford remains near charismatic perfection rekindling the immortal Indiana Jones figure, his discomfort during the film's sillier bits is visible. Nonetheless, Ford is also given the chance to flex dramatic muscles as the film darkens, including a transition into entranced evil akin to a drug withdrawal scene, made extremely difficult watching by Ford's gritty dedication to the performance. As such, given the film's exceptional central performance, it is the characters left for Jones to play off of which dampen the film's enjoyment factor. In fact, the majority of the blame can be devoted to Kate Capshaw's legendarily embarrassing damsel in distress rendition, a wasted mess of excruciating screams, whining and bungled comic relief moments. And while similar infamy has been bestowed upon Jonathan Ke Quan's 'Short Round', surprisingly he manages to mostly supersede racial stereotyping and an irritating amount of screen presence with an admirable charisma and charm (though a fair amount of overdone comic schtick prevails nonetheless). Thankfully, Amrish Puri makes an utterly horrifying and gruesomely memorable antagonist as the sinister cult leader, perfectly mixing a wide eyed, maniacal cackle with a disturbingly level headed, darkly suave charm.While potentially alienating to those more familiar with the series' more consistent family friendly tone, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is spilling over with enough fun, frights and laughs to make it a near irresistible watch. Reputation aside, the film is a joyful watch worth experiencing by all. -8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In November 1989, I saw the film, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, released on video-tape, for the first time.(In July 1989, I saw the film, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, on the Big Screen for the first time.) I have seen all of the first three "Indiana Jones" films: Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989).The stories of the bull-whip cracking adventurer-archaeologist, Indiana Jones, also known as Henry Jones, Junior, are, of course, all fiction.In real-life, an incredibly masculine man who was named after his father would not, instead, adopt a pretty feminine name. And the name of their dog at that! In the film, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Professor Henry Jones (played by Sean Connery) said, "We named the dog Indiana!" His son (played by Harrison Ford) was named Henry Jones, Junior; he had instead adopted the name of their dog - Indiana. He liked it better. Dr. Henry Jones, Junior, had a lot of fond memories of that dog.In real-life, an incredibly masculine man like Dr. Henry Jones, Junior, would not want to be known by a pretty feminine name such as Indiana.In Edith Newbold Wharton's novel, The Custom of the Country (1913), a young American woman named Indiana Frusk marries James J. Rolliver.The Australian actress Indiana Evans (born 1990) starred as Matilda Hunter on the Channel 7 soap opera, Home and Away, which screens on Southern Cross Television at 7.00 p.m. on weeknights in Tasmania."Indiana" is strictly a girl's name, just like a pink dress is strictly a girl's garment.Here is a short list of girls' names which end with the Latin feminine suffix: -iana.Adriana, Ariana, Briana, Christiana, Cynthiana, Cypriana, Diana, Doriana, Dulciana, Eliana, Emiliana, Fabiana, Feliciana, Georgiana, Giana, Giuliana, Gloriana, Graziana, Hadriana, Indiana, Juliana, Kariana,Katiana, Kristiana, Liana, Liliana, Louisiana, Luciana, Marciana, Mariana, Nelliana, Octaviana, Oriana, Poinciana, Quiana, Rhiana, Riana, Sebastiana, Siana, Susiana, Tatiana, Tiana, Uriana, Variana, Viridiana, Vitaliana, Viviana, Xyliana, Yuliana, Ziana.There are, of course, a lot more girls' names which end with the Latin feminine suffix: -iana.Here is a short list of girls' names which end with the Latin feminine suffix: -ina.Adina, Alvina, Angelina, Argentina, Ballina, Benjamina, Bertina, Bettina, Carolina, Christina, Colina, Davina, Dina, Edina, Edwina, Emelina, Ervina, Faina, Felina, Galina, Georgina, Gina, Halina, Idalina, Irina, Irmina, Irvina, Jacobina, Jamesina, Janina, Justina, Karina, Katerina, Katrina, Kristina, Larina, Lina, Lucina, Marina, Martina, Melvina, Messina, Nina, Odina, Oldina, Orlina, Paulina, Petrina, Philina, Quentina, Quintina, Regina, Rina, Robina, Rosina, Sabina, Sabrina, Sandina, Selina, Termina, Thomasina, Tina, Umina, Ursina, Valentina, Varina, Vina, Wilhelmina, Xylina, Yemina, Zabrina, Zarina, Zina.There are, of course, a lot more girls' names which end with the Latin feminine suffix: -ina.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A prequel sequel? Maybe... huh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there really a need to review it? I mean after all, it wasn't nearly as interesting or compelling as the original or the sequels.Sure the supernatural aspect of pulling a beating heart out is cool, but not quite like the wrath of God tearing ass on a Nazi platoon.Indy didn't need a sidekick in the form of Batman's Asian 'Robin', nor the typical screaming broad (Sorry Mrs. Spielberg)...While the film's opening gave a glimmer of retro type adventure films of the Saturday matinée variety... it didn't quite happen.Well, it's a prequel, so maybe just categorize it under the 'Adventures of Young Indiana Jones' and leave it on the same shelf.Kinda' like Superman III &amp; IV (ask Warner Bros.), just pretend it didn't happen and move on the the next sequel...

		<fullReview>'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)' has always been the black sheep of the Indiana Jones family. Indeed, it is noticeably darker in tone and humour than the two Nazi-themed adventures on either side, and the premise of the Shankara Stones is admittedly far less glorious than the Ark of the Covenant or the Holy Grail. Nevertheless, the film is to be enjoyed purely for its success as a blockbuster popcorn picture, and few movies can match 'The Temple of Doom' for its adrenaline-charged action and unashamedly-campy sense of fun. Following the phenomenal success of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981),' director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas collaborated once more to bring the second chapter of Harrison Ford's rugged, whip-cracking archaeologist's globe-trotting adventures. Set in 1935, the film is actually a prequel to the original, and takes place almost exclusively in the dark, unchartered depths of India, where primitive holy rituals are still worryingly prevalent, despite the current British occupation.Unlike its two successors, which resurrected popular characters from the first film, 'The Temple of Doom' features only Harrison Ford reprising his role. Young Asian-American Ke Huy Quan is introduced as Indy's pint-sized but very useful sidekick, Short Round, an orphan picked up on the streets of Shanghai. Kate Capshaw, as the prequel's answer to Karen Allen, is severely lacking, though she's quite tolerable in the moments when she's not screaming her lungs out; director Steven Spielberg, who would later marry Capshaw, was evidently blissfully unaware of how annoying her voice could become after even a brief period of time. Nevertheless, Indy's love-hate relationship with Willie Scott provides some key moments of humour, particularly when the pair are in their respective rooms trying simultaneously to justify both their love and hate towards one another. The film's primary villain is an bald, intimidating thug named Mola Ram (Amrish Puri), a sadistic Thuggee high priest with a sinister grin. By collecting the five lost Shankara Stones and offering human sacrifices, he hopes to honour the great deity, Kali.Detractors of the series' most recent instalment, 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008),' have gone to great lengths to decry the sheer absurdity of some of the action sequences. These critics have apparently overlooked the fact that 'The Temple of Doom' contains its own share of ridiculous moments, but, as it is all presented to us with such campish enthusiasm, we are quite willing to accept the story's occasional outlandish quirks. Inflatable rafts falling from light aircraft, warm monkey brains for dessert, bizarre sacrificial rituals involving the removal of a man's heart - it all adds to the pulp feel of the 1930s adventure serials on which Indiana Jones is based. The visuals effects - designed by Dennis Muren, Michael J. McAlister, Lorne Peterson and George Gibbs - still hold up exceedingly well after more than twenty years, and secured the film's only Oscar, from just two nominations. The initial critical response was mixed, and remains so today, but many have come to appreciate Spielberg's film for being such a rollicking good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indiana Jones' adventure in India.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Steven Spielberg and the imagination of George Lucas are back at work again. This time a little toward the darker side with level of gore and violence on the rise. Daredevil archaeologist Indiana Jones(Harrison Ford)travels to India in search of the legendary Ankara Stone. In tow are a winsome gold-digger named "Willie"(Kate Capshaw)and a young street kid Short Round(Ke Huy Quan). All three provide their share of comic relief. The mystical stone will give a desperate village needed protection again and in the bargain stumbles into the hideaway catacombs of an ancient palace where a secret cult is forcing kidnapped children into slave labor. Indy to the rescue and enough adventure to please his fans ten times over. Outstanding John Williams musical score. Also in the cast: Amirish Puri, Roshan Seth, Philip Tan, David Yip, Philip Stone and Dan Aykroyd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A year before the events "Raiders of the Lost Ark", Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is in Shanghai enjoying an evening of entertainment and making a deal on trying to get a Chinese artifact from a Chinese mob. But after a bad deal as they try to kill him, he escapes with a spoiled night club singer named Willie Scott (Kate Chapshaw) and a young Chinese boy named Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) on a plane that crash lands in the Himalyas. They get stranded in the jungles of India, where the villager's children have been taken by a cult of thug-gees and stolen some precious stones that are sacred to them. Indy and his two companions go to the palace of a young prince where they discover that the Thugee cult live underground of the palace including a witch doctor named Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) who has the village's children and the stones as Indy must try to get them back.Considered the black sheep of the Indiana Jones Trilogy, this entertaining and quite dark installment is quite underrated. Steven Spielburg directs again and George Lucas made the story and produced this, fans have often scorn this installment because of the annoying Kate Chapshaw and some of the out of place humor including Short Round. Yes i know Willie was a pain in the butt but Short Round did provided some good laughs, i like how they use some darkness like the bug area which would creep out even the people that are spooked of insects. There is a lot of action and tension that will keep the viewer on the edge of their seat and there's also some dark stuff like the infamous heart ripping sequence which disgusted parents when it came out and caused the MPAA to create the "PG-13" rating that year.Despite some of the flaws of this movie, there's some good memorable action sequences like the mine cart ride sequence and the climax which are smashing. Although it's not as good as the first and third movies nor as fun as the recent movie but it's still a very good if bleak installment.</fullReview>

Steven Spielberg)After landing in India with his sidekick Short Round (Ke Quan) and a kidnapped American singer, Willie Scott (Capshaw), Indiana Jones (Ford) is sent by a village to recover a mysterious stone. Whilst searching for it, he stumbles across the stones in use by a cult, headed by Mola Ram (Puri). Behind this cult, he discovers another hideous truth; the village's children being order to constantly work.Whilst it suffers from the dark direction it has taken, Temple of Doom is still highly enjoyable and a worthy inclusion in the Indy series.

		<shortDescription>Good not great prequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are expecting this to be a sequel, you will be disappointed. This is a prequel to Raiders of the lost ark. Temple takes place in 1935. Raiders takes place in 1936. Well, I have review the first and fourth one. I might as well review all of them. This is my least favorite of the 4 movies, but that does not mean that it is bad. 1 thing I don't like about the movie is short round. But Short Round is better then Jar Jar. This is the movie that inspired the PG-13 rating. It is true. This film was controversial with parents because there is a scene where you can see a man's heart being ripped out. This film is known as the straw that broke the parents back. Steven Spielberg said whenever he saw a child in the movie theatre, He would cover his eyes when it showed the heart rip scene. Well, it is a good not great film. So I recommend it. My least favorite of the 4 movies, though. My overall rating is 7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A required, but controversial, sequel to the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film may not have lived up its expectations after the release of Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it explored the darkened depths of cultures and archaeological artifacts, which is a subject that would have been met at some point by an archaeological adventurer. The film certainly has its strengths, including the opening musical number by Kate Capshaw followed by the confrontation of Lao Che by Indiana Jones in the style of film noir and also the car chase in the city of Shanghai that follows shortly afterwards. The water raft scene down the Himalayan Mountains was also highly packed full of adrenaline and well shot. The most powerful moment in the film, and even throughout the whole trilogy, is the arrival of the three at the village of which the Sankara Stone was taken, as we learn the suffering that it has caused the villagers, who are fighting for survival and mourning over the fact that the Kali took their children. Then we have the excellent cinematography of the Indian jungle, which were actually filmed in Sri Lanka. The set building of the Indian temple deserves appraisal, as well as the insect cave and the booby trapped room of spiked ceilings and floor. Then there is the mesmerising set of the Kali temple with the lava pit that gave the film its dark atmosphere. Ultimately, the mine tunnel chase was the greatest triumph of the film that, quite literally, takes the audience on a roller-coaster of a ride. Moreover, the rope bridge scene deserves great appraisal, bringing both excitement and suspense to the film as it reached its ending.The overall acting was adequate, Ford does well in picking up from where he left off as Indiana Jones. However, with this film he did well to represent more the suffering that Jones has to be put through. What was particularly spectacular was the way he was able to undertake the transformation from good to evil after drinking the blood of the Kali. He also did well to undertake much of the action scenes considering that he slipped a disc during filming. Kate Capshaw was outstanding in the opening dance number and did well as playing the damsel in distress throughout the rest of the course of the film. Although she was knocked by feminists by her performance throughout the film. This performance was understandable, as she plays a city girl who is plunged into the Indian jungle full of deadly predators and she is also exposed to the dark black magic of the Kali, which is not usually encountered on a daily basis. Jonathan Key-Quan also was outstanding in his role, some of the lines he delivered were absolutely hilarious and the action sequences and the choreography he completely mastered. Moreover, he gains full sympathy from the audience when struck by Jones and when he is sent to work with all the other slaves. Amrish Puri played an outstanding villain, as his psychically and acting made him absolutely terrifying. Moreover, he was the reason why the film was so dark. Overall, this film lacked the magic of Raiders, but this was because its theme dealt with much darker concepts. Although the darkened theme created controversy, this separates it from the rest of the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite dark, that's true, but also an irresistible ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though there is debate over whether Star Wars was directly planned as a trilogy (or two, as it turned out), the fact that Harrison Ford signed to play Indiana Jones in three films before the first had even been completed indicates George Lucas and Steven Spielberg wanted to do more with the character even if Raiders of the Lost Ark hadn't been the most successful film of 1981 (although that helps a lot as well). For the second installment, Lucas decided to try the same trick he'd used on The Empire Strikes Back: make it darker and more mature than the first film, and you might get better reviews and make more money. He was proved wrong in both cases (The Temple of Doom was "only" the third most seen picture of 1984, and Roger Ebert aside critics weren't that enthusiastic, especially regarding the violence), but like the underrated The Godfather: Part III the second Indiana Jones movie is well overdue a re-evaluation: while not exactly a masterpiece like Raiders, for one small reason, it gets very close, and never ceases to entertain.As a matter of fact, one might argue the opening of Doom is even better than the prologue of Raiders, on account of the sequence depicting Indy at his best: always in trouble, often near death, but never willing to surrender - even with poison flowing in his veins. The extravagant beginning is set in Hong Kong, at a club called Obi-Wan (in-jokes - can't get enough of them). Indiana is there to acquire a diamond, but ends up getting poisoned instead, having no other choice but to run for his life (after stealing the antidote, of course) and get the hell out of there with the help of his kid sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan). Unfortunately, he also brings the obnoxious night club singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) with him, and she has a tendency to moan a lot. For a number of reasons, the three wind up in India, where the inhabitants of a village ask them to retrieve a mysterious stone. Given his experience with the Ark of the Covenant, Indy should know better; instead, he accepts to find the stone, risking his life as he comes face to face with one of the most macabre cults ever invented by man.The cult in question, and various scenes featuring its most gruesome traditions, originally upset critics and parents alike, who found the storyline too dark for the genre and unsuitable for children (the film was, and still is, rated PG). Alongside Gremlins, Temple of Doom prompted endless discussions that eventually gave birth to the PG-13 rating, which has been given to every Indiana Jones-like action film ever since (apart from the Disney-produced National Treasure). A lot of fans protested too, finding the material excessively violent. But look past the occasional strong scene and you'll find a near perfect popcorn movie that is constantly fun and exciting, from the spectacular start to the breathtaking climax. There isn't a dull moment in the whole film, even in the more "relaxed" bits, courtesy of great chemistry between an always likable Ford and the wonderful Quan. Capshaw is a bit of a problem: she isn't a bad actress (the countless screaming scenes not considered), but she simply doesn't have the appropriate charisma that made Karen Allen an "Indy girl" to die for. To paraphrase Short Round: "No time for love, Dr. Jones!". However, lambasting her because of her relationship with the director is unfair and also unjustified: there was no favoritism involved in her casting - she didn't start dating, and eventually marry, Spielberg until after filming was over.In the end, all I can say is if you like Indiana Jones, you will find a way to enjoy Temple of Doom. If it doesn't convince you after the first viewing, give it another try. I did, and as always I was eventually won over by the man in the hat and his marvelous adventures: he just happens to have that power.9,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many fall into the trap of rating this film based on the first film. You can't do that. This whole franchise was intended to be a serial adventure and like with any serial adventure, each one is going to bring in different elements. Here, we have a pre-Raiders Indy searching for his fortune and glory. Through the course of the film, Indy becomes the archaeologist we come to meet in Raiders.The darkness of the tone is a sticking point with many, but I for one welcome this change. I thought the inclusion of Shortround, Indy's young sidekick, was a perfect light balance to the darkness. Their chemistry is great. Kate Capeshaw takes a lot of criticism of how Willie is a damsel and I think it is unwarranted. She was no Marion Ravenwood. Don't look at her as Marion. Like Indy's immature quest for fortune and glory, the women in his life at this point were not yet the strong and independent type.The stunts are top notch with the mine cart chase becoming a blueprint for many rollercoasters that were designed throughout the rest of the decade. On any given day, any of the Indy films could be listed as my favorite. This one has a lot of action that is still to this day heart-racing, even after multiple, multiple viewings.Great stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May be the weakest, but it still delivers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I was scared of it. It was because of the sacrificial scene where Mola Ram rips a sacrificial victim's still beating heart out of his chest. What scared me about it was that it was where the victim actually saw his own heart in the guy's hand and he actually saw his own chest wound heal. Then when they lowered him down into the "hot pit," and when he and his own heart combust in flames, that's where I just lost it. I was basically traumatized from it. I couldn't watch it again.But what I did like was some of the humor between Indiana Jones, Willie Scott, and Short Round. They did a good job with it. The action sequences were pretty good as well, even though some of them involved torture and black magic (the voodoo doll I have to admit is pretty freaky). Still, the one that was etched in all of our minds is the sacrificial scene. You can't get any scarier than that. Spielberg once again proves that he can make a horror movie.But, even though it's the weakest and some of it won't appeal to you, don't let it spoil your enjoyment of the film. Enjoy it for what it is, regardless of the scares. You might enjoy it and you might not enjoy it. I personally like it better than I did when I first saw it. It's still delivers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harrison Ford (Star Wars) reprises his role as the sophisticated archaeologist Indiana Jones in Steven Spielberg's action adventure.Indiana Jones is ordered to go and collect a sacred stone from a mysterious temple and is accompanied by Willie Scott (Capshaw) and Short Round (Ke Quan).Filled with brilliant action sequences, sharp characters and exciting settings the second film of the Indiana Jones series is a brilliant action adventure, justifying the genre beautifully.Ford portrays the hero brilliantly with a sharp and intelligent wit, his nerve under pressure and more so for his lines. Indiana Jones is one of my favourite characters of all time because of these qualities.Jones is juxtaposed with singer Willie Scott, a spoilt and supposedly sophisticated professional who learns the life of an adventure in very intriguing circumstances. Having this character allows viewers to see the difference between the high life and the poor life, which is also a very touching point to the film.Willie comes from a very classy background and when arriving in the dilapidated town, its shocking to see how she react and is very touching and audiences will sympathize with the residents of the town.Her character is very funny though, watch out for the elephant scenes.One of the greatest child roles I've ever seen, Ke Quan gives a funny and classy role as Short Round. His catchphrases and attitude towards situations are great and extremely enjoyable.The main reason this film is so brilliant is because of the situations Indy and his companions find themselves in, including planes, rope bridges, boat rides and other death defying situations. Its an astonishing mixture of action, adventure and a thrilling ride.The settings also make the film stunning, none more so than one of the final scenes which makes it one of the best action adventures of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indy still impressive here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I rank Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom as the weakest in the series, it still packs a great punch as a great action and adventure movie. We pick up in China where Indy is negotiating for a diamond in exchange for the ashes of an old dead Oriental leader to a ruthless Gangster, Lao Che. There, he meets Willy (Kate Capshaw), a night dancer. After a chase, a fight, and poisoning, he barely escapes with her and makes his way to the local airport. They escape with the aid of Short Round (Ke Hu Quan), a young Chinese boy who drives them to the airport. He, Willie and Shortie are able to escape on a plane. Little do they known that Lao Che owns the plane. The pilots sneak off just before dumping the fuel. They escape only as Indiana Jones can ... on an inflatable raft. As they slide down the mountains into the river, they find themselves in India. Coming to a village, they find it is stripped of its vegetation and children. The leaders believe the misfortune is caused by the loss of the sacred stone. Indy thinks someone at the Pankot Palace believes their stone to be lost Shankara Stones, magical ones that were given from the Hindu God, Shiva. He thinks someone has resurrected the old Thugee cult which has led to the disappearance of the stone and the village children. As Dr. Jones and his friends search the castle, they accidentally stumble on a Thugee ritual. The Shankara Stones are there. The Thugee Priest, Mola Ram has found three of them, and uses the children as slave labor to find the other two stones. His hope is that Kali, the Thugee Goddess, will gain power to cast down the God of the Jews, Muslims, and Christians. Indy, Shortie, and Willie are all captured then must escape. This leads to spectacular stunts, well-paced fights, and unrelenting action in the tradition of old Saturday morning serials. I did find a few flaws with the movie. It is darker and more violent than its predecessor. This black eye led to the formation of the PG-13 rating. It is also stagnant, staying in one location as opposed to traversing more continents. It also pushes the envelope of dopey side-kicks. Short Round is one of those second bananas that you might love and hate. As a kid, he does have charm, wit, and humor ... something all side-kicks need. He is also an Achillie Heal, often triggering traps and stumbling around. He can fight too well, he is too smart, and is very convenient. The downside is that he is a kid and was used solely for the purpose of getting kids to this movie. A couple of scenes also really defy the odds. The raft out of the plane scene (which was actually done by stunt men), while entertaining seemed implausible. The other when their mine car jumped the chasm also strained believability. Finally, this one does not have the magic awe of the Ark of the Covenenat or the Holy Grail. It is not mysterious and does not appeal to the wonder of an audience. It does appeal, though, to tension. The scenes are grafted wondrously to keep your attention, and keep you on the edge of your seat. We cringe seeing Indy, Shortie and Willie barely escape death numerous times ... an in inventive ways. I liked the mine car chase because of the variation. Spielberg not only used the cars behind each other, but with them side-to-side, with one above the other, and in other variations. The bridge scene was also enjoyable, frightening, and believable for someone with no options. Some people did not like Kate Capshaw in this one. I thought she did well. She was the ditsy blonde who screamed and kicked. She was the one needed in the bug chamber because Marian would have reached in there. She also had the sex appeal needed for the role. Finally, I liked the villain in this one a lot better. In Raiders, except for Toht, the villains were nothing more than cardboard cutouts. Belloq was nothing more than a nemesis or adversary instead of a true vicious villain. Then, you hated the Nazies simply because they were Nazis. Mola Rom, on the other hand, was someone Indy chose to engage. He was evil. He exuded it. He made it real, and frightening. And the idea that the Thugee Cult was a real cult at one time is also frightening. In any case, this one should not be overlooked. It's not the best of Indy, but it is far from being bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand why some people don't like "Temple of Doom." While the plot is excellent, it's very, very different from "Raiders of the Lost Ark." It's darker. It's gorier. It's scarier. And it has that obnoxious kid, as well as Kate Capshaw. (She is terrible!) But if you're just willing to give it a chance, it doesn't disappoint nearly that much. Set mostly in the Indian Himalayas, "TOD" centers on Indy's quest to recover sacred stones for an impoverished village from a sinister High Priest (Amrish Puri) and his fanatical cult, the Thuggees. But the Thuggees have also captured another treasure from the little village: the children! Only Indiana Jones can get them back, with the help of a prissy, whiny, spoiled nightclub singer (Capshaw) and the aforementioned obnoxious kid, Indy's Shanghai-born sidekick Short Round (who does, admittedly, have some great moments). It's another great "Indy" movie, and the thrills (The bug room! The spike chamber! The heart-stopping mine car chase!) top even those from "Raiders." I believe people are far too hard on this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'll agree that it wasn't as good as Raiders or Crusade but it wasn't one of the worst films ever. So a guy's heart gets ripped out? Big deal? But that moment is my favorite moment in the whole film.It doesn't recollect the humor or suspense of Raiders, but who could not laugh at Short Round's remarks? Especially when Short Round says: "He no nuts, he's crazy!" And it was stereotypical at parts, (espically the natives), but it worked better then it did in High School Musical for example. And the 'Indy, didn't make it... oh look, INDY MADE IT!' would be used in Crusade and the fourth one. But no matter how bad people may think it is, this is still a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If adventure has a name, it must be Indiana Jones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring:Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones Kate Capshaw as Wilhelmina "Willie" Scott Jonathan Ke Quan as Short RoundPlot: A year before the events of Raiders. Indy, a nightclub singer and a twelve year old wind up in a small Indian village. The villagers believe that evil spirits have taken their children away after a sacred stone was stolen. Indy agrees to locate the stone for them and soon winds up in a terrifying world of child slavery and a bizarre cult.This was one of the first movies I've ever seen, and given it's more graphic and disturbing nature than it's predecessor, I'm thinking maybe this is one of the reasons I've always been geared towards horror. It's fairly tame in retrospect, but at one point this was called Temple of Death. Either way I didn't care about the scary stuff growing up or now. It was Indiana Jones I wanted to see, beating up the bad guys and saving the day, like he always does. And that's what we get in this sequel.First off, Harrison Ford doesn't get nearly enough respect as I believe he should. He's a very charismatic guy and could sleepwalk through these roles but always seems to bring the goods. He does it again here as Jones, stealing the show(even if it is HIS show). He never fails to entertain and this is one of those times. The other two main stars of the cast..well they don't quite hold their end of the bargain. Which is okay because Ford carries it enough for everyone, but Kate Capshaw is kind of annoying, and don't get me started on Short Round. He's really annoying at times, and other times he does get some good lines in("No time for Love, Dr. Jones!)Besides Ford, what did I like? Well the cleverness of the script, as to be expected with these movies. Lots of quips from Indy("Nothing shocks me. I'm a scientist."), callbacks to Raiders, and the chemistry with all the characters works, even if I feel that Willie and Short Round aren't up to par. The adventure is off the scale and the special effects are superb. And as always, John Williams provides the excellent score we've come to expect from him.This movie is not the weaker Jones movie, as some tend to argue(I believe that goes to Last Crusade). It's a very fun movie, the good kind of summer blockbuster fare. Hopefully you've seen this, but if you haven't give it a try and I'm sure you'll have a blast.Rating: ***1/2 of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not in the same class as Raiders of the Lost Ark, this prequel is still an enjoyable and rousing romp through serial/cliffhanger territory and remains the most underrated of the current Indiana Jones trilogy. Adventurer-archaeologist Indiana Jones barely escapes with his life from the opening adventure with blowsy nightclub singer Willie Scott and street urchin Short Round in tow. After an airplane mishap, they find themselves stranded in India and coerced into searching for sacred stones being used by a Thuggee cult.If anything, this entry seems more exotic than its predecessor. While the screenplay does not have the intelligence of Raiders and is all too willing to sacrifice believability for thrills, then one must also admit that the film is paced like a speeding bullet and it is only after it concludes that anyone is really given the breathing space to notice its flaws. The all-stops-out roller-coaster thrill ride which keeps attempting to top itself is well within keeping to the genre to which it pays its respects.Technically the film is very much at the same level as Raiders, although there were a few visual effects that could have used touching up. The Thuggee cult of India is an interesting choice of villains and Amrish Puri's malevolent priest Mola Ram is rather intimidating. Ford virtually owns the Indiana Jones role by now and has the audience's support and willingness to go along on another adventure almost immediately. Although I really miss Karen Allen for this outing, I don't find Kate Capshaw at all the detriment that many insist. I credit director Spielberg and producer Lucas for trying a completely different route and presenting us with a daffy prima donna with a hilariously shrill scream that cannot cope with bugs or dirt and suddenly finds herself thrust into an adventure that includes all that and more. Ke Huy Quan is also quite effective, if overused, as Short Round. He seems to help move the plot forward without falling into the aren't I cute school of child acting. My largest complaint is that in the second half when Capshaw's character starts becoming more reliable they should have transferred some of Quan's proactive action scenes to her. As it stands, Quan does increasingly ridiculous fight scenes, which could have easily gone to making the female lead more accessible.At the end of the day, it is a worthy prequel and deserves its spot in the pantheon of action films. I find it a more rewarding viewing experience than the third film in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The prequel to Raider of the Lost Ark, and more darker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is taken place 1 year before Raiders of the Lost Ark.Indy is in China where he meets a Mob boss at a restaurant who'll trade him an artifact for money. It was a simple enough trade for Indy. Soon he finds out that the mob boss won't let him leave so easily. So with a battle in a restaurant and being accompanied by a singer, they both managed to escape the restaurant and go through a car chase. With the help of Shorty a Chinese Kid that Indy found trying to pick pocket him sometime ago.The trio escaped from China and eventually ended up in some part of India. Thye meet a tribes man who's tribe is suffering from a curse that's been brought up. Which has to do with one of the existing stones that have mysterious powers. Their prized stone was stolen and all the village's children by a witch craft worshiping group. The village has shortage of livestock and helpless in getting their stone and children back.Indy is put up to a job in rescuing the tribe's children and stone. Only this will be one dangerous and tough job to accomplish.This Indiana Jones movie is alright but not bad. Just it's different from the original and has more violence and torture scenes than the first one. It might not be for everyone, I suggest borrowing it and see it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst of the trilogy but still a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom the worst of the Indiana Jones trilogy but still a great film. Again directed by genius Steven Spielberg with master storyteller George Lucas, this outing is a great adventure that begins in the Far East of 1935 Shanghai China and then goes onto the main adventure in India. While Harrison Ford does another great job as the title character, with a great supporting role by Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round, this time around there's a wimpy heroine - Kate Capshaw as Willie Scott. While she can be funny in her role, and she was funny at certain moments in the film, she is for the most part annoying. Again, it's only a slight weakness in this otherwise great film. And of course, a great score yet again by the master composer John Williams! Oh, look out for the very hilarious bug scene in the cave, the eye-popping palace dinner scene, the great mine car chase finale, and a cameo by Dan Aykroyd! An 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why i think people should watch this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indiana Jones I would definitely suggest that other people watch this film in fact I think that all other people should watch it. The story is great because it's filled with lots of sweet action. This movie also gives Harrison Ford, who is a great actor, a great character. But you might want to watch the other Indiana Jones movies first.I remember watching this movie when I was just a little kid and loving it I didn't really remember any of the story line or anything I just remember watching it and then last summer while I was fishing on my dads fishing boat we went to blockbusters and bought a bunch of used movies. One of the films that I chose was Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. I must have watched that movie over a dozen times last summer on the boat. And now I see why I liked it so much.The story in this movie is awesome Indiana Jones goes into an evil palace and has to steal back a sacred stone from a human sacrificing cult and free the children of the surrounding villages who have been kidnapped for manual labor. Its great it has all kinds of really cool parts in it. There are so many instances of good action in this movie it is hard to pick a few that give a good representation of just how great it is. One of my favorite parts of the movie was when Jones Shorty and Willy jump out of a crashing plane and use an inflatable life raft to cushion there fall and then sled down a mountain in it. Another part that I really liked was when the evil priest puts his hand in the slaves chest and rips his heart out that is awesome. The fight that he has with the huge slave driver down in the mines underneath the palace is great.I think that one reason that I like Harrison Ford so much is he has gotten in some great films like Apocalypse Now and American Graffiti but he has also had some pretty awesome roles to play when you think about it. I mean the guy played Han Solo in the star wars movies and Rick Deckard in Blade Runner. I think that is pretty good for any guy but he also plays Indiana Jones and I cant think of anyone that could do it better. Ford is perfect for it if you think about it Jones and Solo are pretty similar characters and Ford plays the adventurer He is pretty much a normal looking guy physically he might be a little bit more fit than the average guy but he is not some supper ripped Vin Diesel or The Rock type. So its cool you get the feeling that he's a real person but he is still a bad ass because he's smart and tough. Not tough like he can go pick guys up and throw them around but tough like he can take a lot of abuse.The only thing that I would say to someone if they asked me if they should watch it is that they should watch the other ones first. The movies stories do not depend on each other at all but the character of Indiana Jones is set up a lot more in The Search for the Holy Grail and somewhat in Raiders of the Last Arc. Temple of Doom sort of just jumps straight into the story where as The search for the holy grail does a really good job of setting up Indiana Jones by giving a excerpt from his child hood and showing how Indiana is driven by the same ideals and goals.This is probably one of my top ten favorite films of all time and everyone needs to have seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indiana Jones is one of George Lucas's most famous characters (next to Luke) and one of the most beloved cult characters to ever appear on films. Jones made his first appearance as the star of Raiders of the Lost Ark. However, I found Raiders of the Lost Ark confusing, boring, and hard to hear. However, Temple of Doom changed my look on the famous archaeologist. Indiana Jones: Temple of Doom is a totally different film from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indiana Jones: Temple of Doom features a great adventure/fantasy story with remarkable characters, such as Indiana Jones the archaeologist, Winnie the spoiled rich girl, a crazy guy who rips peoples hearts out, a little kids with voodoo dolls and (most importantly) Short Round (nicknamed by Indy) the little Chinese kid who helps Mr. Jones on his quest. This cult (in my opinion) is quite enjoyable and much more fun and exciting than Raiders of the Lost Ark.Note: Short Round is a very funny character! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Action!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was shown on Swedish TV3 last night, and although I don't like the quantity of commercials that channel like to rip up a movie with, I thought I wanted to see this movie because I've been very much into Hinduism lately and I remember that this movie was set in a Kali temple. Last time I saw it was '92 or something, and I also remember getting really frightened by some scenes, but now when I've been forged with movies like Bad Taste and Urotsukidoji, I thought I was ready to see this movie again. Right I was! As always in a Spielberg movie, there has to be a girl for the hero alongside all the action. I thought she could've been cut out of the script, all she does is scream when she gets frightened (and that's quite often, given that the major part of this movie is set in India where there's a lot of scary stuff in the eyes of an American girl) and complains about how awful everything is in India since she's used to living at hotels and drinking champagne in limousines and so on.The action itself is FUN! Not in the Chuck Norris/Steven Segall sense, where the hero is taking out so many enemies it becomes laughable, but in the sense that there is a lot of innovative ways that the hero uses environment and equipment to take out enemies or defend himself.Also, I am pleased to state that there are no socio-religious errors in the Hindu parts of the movie, Spielberg for once seems to have gotten all the facts right! I give this movie 8 out of 10, and I think that's fair given that I write this comment in 2002 and some of the visual effects leave a lot to wish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really enjoyed Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom, Great Movie..but doesn't quite match up to the original or the one after it. This is also a prequel being set a year before Raiders, so i watch them chronologically. Being Temple of Doom, Raiders and Then Last Crusade. Once again Harrison Ford does a great job as our Favorite Adventurer Indiana Jones, there is also a new Indy girl Willie Scott Played by Kate Capshaw who played the character great...but the character itself annoyed the hell out of me. Ke Huy Quan who Played Indiana Jones little sidekick Short round was cool and funny, and he played him perfectly..though i would have loved Marion Ravenwood to be back as the Indy girl. The Villain Mola ram played by Amrish Puri is my most favorite Villain out of the Whole series, great actor he is. The only thing that disappointing me was that it probably went to dark, and the story was a little disappointing...but other than that it's a great movie and adventure.Some of my favorite scenes are the River raft scene, The Heart scene, the scene where Indy verses the Giant Thuggee, The mine cart scene and The Bridge scene.Great movie but can never match up to the brilliance of Raiders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's still Indiana Jones, but it could be better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones is one of my favorite actions heroes, he is a great character, so naturally any film with him should be good. This Indiana Jones movie was still pretty good, but the others are much better. For one thing, this is a major motion picture with Steven Spielberg as the director, but it has some of the worst special effects I have ever seen. The scene when the airplane crashes into the mountain and they slide down the snow on the raft, the airplane crash is so fake and it's obviously a movie screen behind them when they are going down the mountain. It seems like its really low budget, but its a sequel to a major motion picture and Spielberg so it can't be. The plot is OK but not as good as the other films. Still, this film is definitely worth checking out if you like the other Joneses, it has some cool characters and great actions scenes, like the very beginning in the club and the mine cart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is surprising, that people grade "The Temple of Doom" lower than the first movie "Raiders of the lost Ark". It's not like they have huge differences.They both are adventure films, extremely well made, which make you sit on the edge of your seat. Only difference here is, that Indy is in India, trying to locate stolen sacred stones. No Nazis anywhere. Maybe it was people who think, that it's okay to stereotype all Germans as Nazis, who gave "Temple of Doom" lower grade. I don't know. But what I know, is that I like the flick. From beginning to the end. It's just non stop flow of action and romance.But anyway, Harrison Ford returns in the role of Indiana Jones, famous archaeologist. This time he has a sidekick, young Chinese boy Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) and pretty, but vain club singer Willi (KateCapshaw). Place of action is India and the main baddie is a Kali cult leader Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) who can literally rip your heart out with his bare hand.Spielberg does good directing as usual and ILM has done great job with special effects. Tough as the film is quite old the special effects scenes are quite visible, but I don't really think it's a bad thing for this type of movie: if anything it brings more sense of old time charm.Music by John Williams is again something forth to mention, his sound track follows the moods of the film perfectly adding tension or breaking it when necessary.I dare to say this is as good, or even a tad better in some places than the "Raiders", but then again, I like them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Steven Spielberg, Writter George Lucas and star Harrison Ford are back for the second amazing adventure, filled with great comedy and amazing special effects. Temple of Doom is fantastic, also starring Kate Capshaw whom would become Spielberg's wife in the future and introducing Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round! This awesome film gets my fullest Recommendation.Eminent archaeologist Indiana Jones is back in his 2nd adventure, this time to tackle the great terror surrounding the mysterious Temple of Doom. After crash landing in India, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and companions Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) and Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) end up in a small distressed village where the residents claim a dark power has stolen their precious stone... and their children! Agreeing to assist the village, Indiana and friends make their way to a nearby palace and inquire further into the strange happenings. Assuring Indiana he has no idea what he's talking about, prime minister Chatter Lal offers them to spend the night in the palace. However, it is that evening that Indiana discovers a secret passage into a booby-trapped temple and stumbles onto something he thought was long extinct. It seems the age old cut of Thuggee cult is attempting to rise once more, believing that with the power of the five Sankara stones they can rule the world. Now, it's up to Indiana to put a stop to the Thuggee campaign, rescue the lost children, win the girl and conquer the Temple of Doom.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is the second of the Indiana Jones trilogy to be released, but it, time wise, is a prequel to the box-office hit, "Raiders of the Lost Ark." It does have some very exciting moments, and some fantastic adventure scenes, but the theme is very dark, and very foreboding. Steven Spielberg uses some of the ideas from the first film, but has to let the film settle to its own heights and its depths of gloom. That puts the viewing public on alert that they may want to avoid the film, if there is a taste of uneasiness or faint heart, as this film, quite literally, pulls the heart from its natural place.Indy has just managed to finish one adventure, confronts the gangster/owner of a Shanghai nightclub for payment, and barely escapes the club with his life, but not before a brawl, a vial of poison, and its antidote are fought over, and machine guns fire all over the populace of the club. Next spot is India, and Indy learns of a mysterious cult of the macabre that has been resurrected and is tormenting the nearby villagers, forcing the children of the villages to work under inhumane conditions to find some glowing stones that are supposed to give the owners supreme power and domination over the other countries of the world. After a bunch of wild adventures, including one wild ride in the caverns of the underground mines, Indy and his crew of cohorts manage to save their skins and outwit the evil Thuggee cult.Hold on to your seats as this film grabs one from the beginning, and the tension seldom lets up. 8/10. but not meant for the young viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In retrospect, not as good a film as once thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the summer of 1984 one Saturday tea-time, when I was 9, my young brothers and I were taken to see the event movie of that year, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.Thrilling, horrifying and funny in equal measure, we came out of that cinema having had the best film experience of our young lives up to that point. That we had managed to see the film despite the furore over the controversial rating and dark material (even Spielberg at the time stated that he would not let his young children watch the film), only added to our thrill. For months afterwards, we would mimic the whip-cracking main character and exciting set-pieces in the playground at school.In retrospect though, and having seen the film for the first time in 8 years and on a pristine DVD transfer, the film is not the classic I had once esteemed it to be. Disjointed and with little plot, it has not worn as well as Raiders or Last Crusade. Temple of Doom, in fact, is little more than a series of set-pieces with no thought to character development. The main bad guy does not show up until the final third of the film, the special effects (mine-car chase and bridge sequence are major gripes) have dated, the editing is twitchy (check out Mola Rams 'trap door escape' from Indy in the temple) and the ending ridiculously trite ("Yes, I understand its power now").Not that the film doesn't have its merits, the opening Busby Berkely inspired musical dance number at the Shanghai nightclub, along with its subsequent brawl sequence, is a triumph of flair and bravura. The booby-trapped and insect infested room sequence too is a masterclass in both suspense and comedy timing.However, I have still rated this film 8 because of the effect it had on me at the time of its release and throughout the VHS era. It also remains ten times more enjoyable than most summer blockbusters of recent years and ensured that we got to see Last Crusade, which was a welcome return to whip-cracking form.</fullReview>

And Willie she was the most annoying character with her screaming and crying, that i wished shedid fall into that pit of lava. Shortround was OK but sometimes got a little annoying, and the story was pretty crummy. I mean Indy said he didn't believe in magic and he goes aftermagical stones.

		<shortDescription>Weakest Story in the Series, but is Still Exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom does not have as interesting a story asRaiders of the Lost Ark or Last Crusade, but it is a very exciting picture that should leave you on the edge of your seat. Steven Spielberg proved himselfmany times that he is the best director at entertaining his viewers and Temple of Doom continues the great ride started by Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark. It is not a deep picture with any philosophical message, but is just a fun, almostmindless adventure about Indiana Jones battling a religious cult who wants to take over the world. The plot is simple, clear, and not convoluted but it might be too small. Raiders of the Lost Ark had an interesting story surrounding thepowerful Ark of the Covenant and the battle between the sexes with Indy andMarion including their coming together after a painful history was well written and fun. Temple of Doom deals with Indiana Jones seeking magic rocks, whichis not as fascinating as the ark in the first picture or the Holy Grail in the third movie; the relationship between Indy and Willy is fine and the spoiled rich girl going into a dirty land of danger and lots of bugs is amusing but Marion inRaiders is more serious and I feel closer to that character. Temple of Doom is not as concerned about story as the other two, and more than any other Indiana Jones movie it wants you to just have fun and enjoy the excitement. HarrisonFord is good in adventures like Star Wars and Indiana Jones, and his reactions including facial expressions towards frightening situations like being around dangerous snakes, booby traps, and collapsing bridges are well acted andaffective. The underground lair where the cult does most of their activities is a great set design and Spielberg and Lucas invented all sorts of original andinteresting action scenes to fit with the settings and locations. The main strength in Temple of Doom is that it does not copy Raiders and feels different in its action scenes and their relation to the locations, and the makers have created all new dangerous situations to put their hero into that are nothing like those Indy faced in the previous film. Like all the films from Spielberg and Lucas, Temple of Doom is a thrilling picture and even though it is not remembered for its story and plot like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Last Crusade, it does not fail to be a great action movie. ***1/2 (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie made me sick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" are two of my favorite films. The casting, the screenplay, the stories, the character development, the comic elements, and the action were all perfect. For the time in which they were made, the special effects were superb.But "Temple of Doom" short-changed all those elements. This movie made me sick-- literally. The whole purpose of this film seemed to be how much can we gross out this audience. I can take stepping on snakes, bugs, and rats, but the "delicacies" at the dinner table were a bit too much.The Kali cult's heart ripping and blood drinking scenes were not only offensive, they were nauseating. Barf bags should have been issued with the tickets. This is the only movie where I got so sick to my stomach that I regretted not walking out and demanding my money back.I recently bought the boxed set of DVDs, which is delightful. But I refuse to see "Temple" ever again. Heck, maybe I'll sell it on eBay.Incidentally, I found out from the "Making of" documentaries with French subtitles that "Temple of Doom" is entitled "Le temple maudit", meaning literally, the cursed temple. I definitely agree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt the worst in the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Raiders is a masterpiece and so Last Crusade. But this movie is a disgrace to the trilogy, let me tell you why.Indy´s girl, Willie is the most annoying bad excuse for a sidekick i have ever seen. She is crying, screaming and whining like a sissy the whole movie. That little boy is even more annoying, he looks so fake, what a terrible actor this kid is...and the sequence where he was beating the crap out of 10 adult men is so stupid i almost laughed, actually i didnt know whether to laugh or cry. He also somehow always manages to ruin touching scenes with his stupid lines, same goes for the funny scenes, we dont actually need this brat to scream "haha this is funny funny haha" whenever a joke is told. The only thing that saves this movie from being absolutely terrible is Indy, who never fails and the awesome stunts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pinnacle of Pulp Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the story may not be as sophisticated as The Last Crusade, Temple of Doom is a superior Indiana Jones film. It's not quite Raiders, but Temple shares a visceral energy that Crusade lacks. Indiana Jones is a lean, mean, ass-kicking machine in this flick. When he slugs the first Thuggee before liberating the slave children, sending him sliding across the gravel, I could just cry, it's that good.Short Round is an excellent sidekick, and Spielberg superbly mines the mock father-son relationship between this character and Indiana Jones in the film's scarce but effective heartwarming scenes. I'm in the minority here, but I think Kate Capshaw is great as the the effervescent Willie Scott. Who says all female characters have to be fearless, ass-bashing kung fu masters or briefcase-toting lawyers? Willie is *supposed* to get on your nerves.The production is lavish, from the Shanghai nightclub dance number to the gorgeous Indian palace. John Williams' score doesn't have a single dull note, and is an undeniable masterpiece. Sadly, it was criticized for being over the top, like the other aspects of the film.The Temple of Doom serves as a pinnacle of pulp fantasy. Cinematically, it's better than Crusade, which isn't to say Crusade is bad, it's very very good. But it lacks a certain Spielbergian vitality that's on display here.Quite simply, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is one of the most deftly crafted adventure films, ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course it's not as good as Raiders or The Last Crusade, but in no way is this movie a disappointment. And, it definitely doesn't tarnish the trilogy as a whole. Many complain that it's too unrealistic, and they are correct. The story of Indiana Jones is suppose to be unbelievable at times, much like a comic book. The fantastic element is part of the appeal. If you try to examine the film making instead of enjoying the entertainment you are missing the point. It's not that kind of movie. And, before you disrespect an Indiana Jones movie take a look at the most recent action films, like Triple X. What a joke!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Spielberg, Do not make sequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is Steven Spielberg's worst film. Well, perhaps HOOK is Spielbergs worst movie, or maybe THE LOST WORLD. Here's a directer whose imagination can make us laugh, cry, or be thrilled, sometimes all in the same movie. Yet brings to every sequel a feeling of claustrophobia mixed with unexpected boredom. I include HOOK here not only because it was a complete mess, but because it is, indeed, a sequel. Like all of Spielberg's sequels, INDY 2 takes place largely indoors. The first scenes (unlike the terrific RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC) show INDY in a nightclub, then he continues to the backseat of a car, and then boards an airplane, all at night! Likewise, both HOOK and LOST WORLD were filmed largely indoors, and in stuffy, nighttime scenes that seem to be shot in a studio. HOOK's Never-neverland never looked like it was really outside, even (or especially!) when the scenes took place in the daytime. But back to INDY 2. During the all too short journey to the TEMPLE, there is absolutely no character development, nor is there any progression of the plot. Indy was not assigned to this job, nor does he need to bring along Willie Scott at all. Indy knows nothing about her, and this is still true by the end of the movie. Once the film enters the TEMPLE, there are very few scenes where daylight can be seen. There is even a scene near the end, where the slave-children run out of their prison into the courtyard, and they have to shield their eyes from the sun. The audience has to do this too! In an adventure film, there should not be such a scene. Anyway, I still respect Mr. Spielberg's work, and I love many of his movies. Minority Report was a delight, as were his earlier Sci Fi movies. His historical films like Private Ryan and Amistad were also well made, as was, of course, Schindler's Liste.So, my message to Spielberg is this: You don't need the money anymore, so make movies that are original and good. Stick to your guns, like you did with JAWS II-IV, and avoid making pointless sequels that don't live up to the originals, and keep breaking new ground. It's what the fans want.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two reasons to watch this movie...Harrison Ford and the swinging bridge scene. Harrison Ford as Indy is fantastic, and even this poor sequel can't dampen his talent and screen presence. The chase sequence leading up to the bridge isn't bad, but by that point I was so annoyed at this film I just wanted it to end. The kid, Short-Round, and the 'love interest' played by Kate Capshaw are so irritating, I was praying that they would be sacrificed to save this film. Capshaw's character spends the entire film whining, and this coupled with the obnoxious kid and mediocre plot make this film a complete disappointment.If you want a great couple of hours, watch Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade back to back with Raiders of the Lost Ark, and leave Temple of Doom on the shelf collecting dust where it belongs.</fullReview>

This film does have good moments especially the stunning opening at the appropriately named Obi Wan Club and a few thrilling moments during the end but suffers too much by it's childish nature with the dreadful characters of Short Round and Willie Scott.The creators thought they were making a much darker and scarier movie than Raiders but were too afraid of going all the way the result is a bit disappointing considering the potential this film had.

It's 1935 and this time around he's paired with an American lounge singer (Capshaw) and a young Chinese orphan as he travels to India to help the inhabitants of a destitute village retrieve a powerful sacred rock. This puts him into conflict with a brutal, underground cult that worships a sinister god with deadly human sacrifices. Not as awe-inspiring as the original?in fact much darker with a penchant for gross-out gags?but it's swift and energetic with enough roller coaster action scenes to make it fun.

His head is about a foot away from the crusher, then after the knife is pulled from the voodoo doll, he is suddenly about 20 feet away. He wasn't saved by Short Round, he was saved by the editor. It's like a Monty Python movie. Another example: the fight with those two thugs on the mountain. It appears Indy has whipped that sword right over the side, but then, lo and behold, he has the sword in his hand. And don't get me started on that ridiculous bridge scene. This movie scared me when I was a kid, but as I've aged I've found it one of Spielberg's sloppiest films. And its poorly written. Doesn't live up to the greatness of Raiders of the Lost Ark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action, no obvious errors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was shown on Swedish TV3 last night, and although I don't like the quantity of commercials that channel like to rip up a movie with, I thought I wanted to see this movie because I've been very much into Hinduism lately and I remember that this movie was set in a Kali temple. Last time I saw it was '92 or something, and I also remember getting really frightened by some scenes, but now when I've been forged with movies like Bad Taste and Urotsukidoji, I thought I was ready to see this movie again. Right I was!As always in a Spielberg movie, there has to be a girl for the hero alongside all the action. I thought she could've been cut out of the script, all she does is scream when she gets frightened (and that's quite often, given that the major part of this movie is set in India where there's a lot of scary stuff in the eyes of an american girl) and complains about how awful everything is in India since she's used to living at hotels and drinking champagne in limousines and so on.The action itself is FUN! Not in the Chuck Norris/Steven Segall sense, where the hero is taking out so many enemies it becomes laughable, but in the sense that there is a lot of innovative ways that the hero uses environment and equipment to take out enemies or defend himself.Also, I am pleased to state that there are no socio-religious errors in the Hindu parts of the movie, Spielberg for once seems to have gotten all the facts right!I give this movie 8 out of 10, and I think that's fair given that I write this comment in 2002 and some of the visual effects leave a lot to wish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the Indiana Jones movies are extremely entertaining, but if I had to choose one that's not quite on a par with the others, it would have to be the middle film, Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom. Not that it's a bad movie by any means -- it's more entertaining than 3/4 of the movies out there. It's just that the other two are so amazingly entertaining that this one pales a bit in comparison. The fact that it looks like a retread of Gunga Din, and the fact that there are no nasty Nazis present also detract from the proceedings. We meet our archaologist friend Indy (Harrison Ford) in a Chinese nightclub where the American cabaret singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) is singing. After narrowly escaping death thanks to the help of Indy's young friend Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan), they find themselves trekking across India in order to find a missing magical stone that have been stolen from the guru of the village of Chattar Lal (Roshan Seth). They are also looking for the children of that particular village, who, they find out later, have all been stolen and put into child slavery by the evil Mola Ram (Amrish Puri). Of course there's a big showdown, in which hearts are torn out of chests, monkey's eyeballs are served as a main course, bridges holding a hundred people collapse, and Indiana temporarily becomes a bad guy. Everything turns out right in the end, though. There's no doubt that Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom is very amusing. It has some great moments: funny gross-out jokes, an amusement park-type ride through a coal mine, and perilous situations taken from old comic books. But the fact remains that it seems as if the cast is going through the motions in this one. Unlike the other two films, Temple Of Doom seems to forgo characterization and plot development in favor of action sequences that don't necessarily feature as much exciting action as in its predecessor. Nevertheless, Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom is a very enjoyable film, and definitely worth a rental to bring you back to being a kid again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second Indiana Jones adventure in the "Indiana Jones" saga. This time, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) unexpectedly winds up in India after a minor conflict with a mob in China. In India, Indy stumbles upon a village where the people claim that evil has abducted their sacred stone and their children. Despite the untold dangers that Indy might confront this time around, he agrees to help. With the help of his young sidekick, Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) and a frantic, nature-hating woman named Willie (Kate Capshaw), Indy must defeat the secretive and deadly Thuggie cult, who sacrifice humans to satisfy their blood-thirsty goddess, and retrieve both the village children and sacred stone.This is my first - and only - Indiana Jones adventure. And although my brother owns "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "The Last Crusade", I never really brought myself to even watch those two. I find the "The Temple of Doom" adventure quite amusing: ** First of all, you have one frantic character played by Kate Capshaw who totally flips out over the "disgusting" side of the great outdoors in India. And of course, she learns that nature is nothing compared to almost having your heart torn out and being thrown into a pit of fire! *lol*  ** Not only did I get a real kick out of Willie, but I also got a kick out of Indy's side-kick, Short Round. Perhaps one of the best parts in the movie is when Short Round saves his hero from a deadly voodoo doll (of him) with a jewel dagger stabbed in it's back as Indy tries to defeat one huge, scary-looking Thuggie. And of course, here's Short Round pinning down the voodoo doll keeper, throwing endless punches at his face. And then camera angle turns...there's Indy doing the same thing to the Thuggie. **grin** :) ** Harrison Ford - one of the greatest actors in Hollywood - looked mighty cute! :) And as always, our hero finds himself in near-death experiences...such as almost having his heart being torn out by the Thuggie priest Mola Ram (played by Amrish Puri), get washed up by a huge tidal wave of water, etc. etc.Not to mention, "Indiana Jones And the Temple of Doom" also features non-stop action and adventure! Bloody-thirsty worshippers, an ambitious and fearless hero, a frantic woman, and cute little side kick makes this Indy adventure 100% fun w/ non-stop action! :)"He no nuts, he's crazy!" Short Round says. Well...at least he's not fearful...or boring! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Breathless Modern Gunga Din, with the River Kwai's Sky Filled with Flocking Bats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This chef d'oeuvre is one of the most unremittingly nonstop action films ever made, with an expert succession of climactic sequences. It's a roller-coaster ride---at one point very literally---a visual extravaganza, a technical coup and masses of exuberant pleasure. And yet it was made when ambitious filmmakers and imaginative audiences still had that odd idea that one of the points of editing is to clarify why one shot follows another, or why various shots happen in the arrangement that they do. Because Spielberg and Lucas' adventures templates were shaped from magic into commodity from then to now, today's moviegoers are instead blunted by duration-centered sequences comprising slapdash, heedless jumbles of graceless shots. We see one special effect then another, and we're supposed to be appreciative that we've been shown two special effects, despite that there is nothing and no one on screen to care about except the magnitude of the spectacle.Spielberg and Lucas didn't equate building on Raiders by simply making everything bigger and louder. The energy of storytelling imagination is put forth double-time. It works in its own way, and makes use of from different conventions from different eras. Right off the bat, Indy is in a Shanghai nightclub stand-off with gangsters. He escapes in the nick of time, taking along a blonde nightclub gang moll and convoyed by his loyal young helper, Short Round. Their escape leads them into a string of adventures: A flight over the Himalayas, a stunning flee from a crashing plane and a chance encounter with a village leader who implores Indy to find and retrieve the village's beloved stone which vanished with all of the village's children. Indy and Willie barely get to turn in for the night before the movie's second half starts with a mind-blowing chain of escapades involving the hellish mines underneath the palace.Befittingly to the purely fairy-tale tone of this epic adventure, Spielberg and Lucas stuck to a make-believe India, not the real one. The Thuggee cult is maybe at least as predisposed to Africa as India, what with the Maharajah's voodoo doll, the shrunken head on Mola Ram's headdress, and the "black sleep of Kali," caused by drinking blood and cured by burning one's flesh. Power of invention? Certainly. Just like that outrageous runaway mine chase. Short Round's no 1D token either. The kid cheats at cards, but it takes nothing less than Indy under Mola Ram's Superman 3-style spell to bring tears to his eyes.Moments like the collapsing bridge, the mine cart ride, and the cave full of bugs are as awe-inspiring or more so than anything in the first film. The set design, art direction, special effects and sound effects that create this subterranean hell are among the most striking realizations in the entire lineage of summer blockbusters. As dozens of small children toil on chain gangs, the vile maharajah keeps them in thrall by employing the menacing command of the mislaid gemstone and its two counterparts. Indy and company behold in wonder, and then Indy endeavors to steal it back. Some of the film's most indelible set pieces now occur: Human sacrifices are lowered into a yawning volcano in a cage, creepy ceremonies are honored and there's a chase in the mine's cavernous railway. As Indy and company race in the small unmanageable mine car, the thugs are behind, ahead, above, below and alongside them, and the scene will throttle you and leave you almost physically winded. And it's perhaps more than any other action sequence liable for the ever-present simile of summer movies as roller-coaster rides.Temple of Doom is not only as hypnotizing as I recalled, but it stands up to my cynical cinephile eyes every single smidgen as well as it did to the bulging eyes of my childhood. Temple of Doom make no excuses for being precisely what it is: Invigorating, frenzied, violently creative escapism. No regrets are needed. This is the most willfully electrifying, wacky, passionate adventure movie since even before Raiders, and a very small handful after. It's quite an event. It leaves you reeling with a juvenile smile.This is the uncommon genre film that accomplishes a voodoo of populist and formalistic fascination, warranting the true label of "classic" by selling unadulterated pop delight so self-possessed that our more mature filmic sensibilities embrace it. To snub these films is a subject of taste, but to criticize them would be coarse and misunderstanding of their beeline approach. Whether or not it's on par with Swan Lake or a Rembrandt portrait is possibly disputable, but I don't want to meet the person that doesn't admit it's a superlative, enrapturing entertainment. The movie also gives us the one Indiana Jones baddie in the entire series to outsmart him, Lao Che. And he's excellent. The opening scene at Club Obi Wan is nothing short of immortal, both for opening the movie with a totally unreal Busby Berkeley homage in Chinese, and zeroes in on a shimmering blue antidote and a diamond, but mainly the blue antidote.Let's also not overlook John Williams firing on all deep-rooted, ineradicable cylinders with the score, unquestionably one of his best. The Short Round and Temple of Doom themes are up there with those of Darth Vader and Jurassic Park. Together with the spike chamber, elephants, old village sage, "vampire" bats, the silencer proxied by popping champagne corks, the literal cliffhanger on the rope bridge, Indy's Superman III moments?it's deliriously magnificent. In this movie, really, "Anything Goes."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An adventure movie at his finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Temple of doom has gotten a lot of critic for not living up to its prequel. Well, usually when we get a sequel, it tends to be a flawed continuation on the original. And one might think, because of the critic, that this is the case here.Don't be fooled, because it isn't. IJ:TOD was the first Indiana film I ever saw. The story was original, like all IJ movies, so it stands on its own perfectly. Maybe because of the fact I saw it first, I consider it the best installment. Or maybe because it reminded me of a mature 'The Goonies', especially with the cave chase. Jones, Short Round, Willie, and Mola Ram are all beautifully portrayed, whereas the maharajah, captain Blumburt, and the Japanese crime-lord are given marginal roles. The story, like the Goonies, and frankly all IJ movies, is very basic and honest: find the treasure to help the poor, before the bad guys find it and use it for evil. At the end of the day, it's Indiana's unique character that makes this movie stand out. Therefore, this movie, like all other Indiana's, is a winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strangely enough, I found this movie to be even better than 'Raiders', which had some dragging moments where my attention slipped a bit. This movie, from start to finish, was filled with action-packed scenes, but not so much that it felt too busy. I don't need to go on forever, so I'm just going to hit some key points: 1. Willie Scott must go.Seriously. From the moment she was introduced to the moment the credits rolled, I couldn't stand her. I was practically screaming with indignation when Indy wound up with her. She had no respect for other cultures, had no guts at all, let out a high-pitched scream every thirty seconds, and the only useful thing she did was pull a lever or something. I spent the entire movie waiting for her to do something helpful so that perhaps I could maybe half-like her, but that moment never came. She spent the entire climax fight locked up in a cage or screaming bloody murder in a mine cart. She made me want to puke in Shorty's hat. Ugh. Marion was so much better.2. On the other hand, Short Round was an enrapturing character whom I fell in love with in the first ten minutes of his appearance. The scene where he and Jones were bickering over a poker game in Chinese was amusing, and his accented English was pretty cute. And, unlike Willie Scott, he helped out quite a bit in various circumstances. His relationship with Indy was rather touching, and when he was begging Indy to snap out of his trance or whatever with his 'you're my best friend, I love you' speech, it was kind of like an 'ohhhhh!' moment. I wish he'd come back for another movie.3. Despite my intense dislike for Willie, the 'nocturnal activities' scene was rather amusing, as well as the 'five minutes' thing afterward. :-) 4. In 'Raiders', the only supernatural thing we saw was when the Ark was opened. This movie was chock-full of it, with glowing magic rocks and some guy getting his heart ripped out and still being alive, voodoo dolls, etc. It gave the movie a different flavor. I'm not sure if I liked it or not, but it was definitely not the type of fantasy you see nowadays.5. It's kind of unsettling that none of the movies have no real connection to each other (no returning characters but Indy, no references to past events, etc.) I think we need some connecting link to tie all the movies together or something. I mean, if Indy said something about Willie in 'Raiders', that might give the two movies more of a connection, like they're all part of the same series, which they are. All the movies just seem kind of disconnected. But maybe that's just me.6. What exactly was the point of the brawl in the nightclub, aside from picking up Willie? I have yet to figure out why that took twenty minutes of movie time...That's about it. The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars was because of Willie. Excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, yet..... weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have brought the first three parts of the Indiana Jones series after typing a scathing review on the fourth part. In this movie, Indy travels to, or rather crashes into my hometown India and his quest for the holy Sivalinga continues. I am not going into the details of it and cut it short right here.Harrison, in this particular film, was just about okay. His acting was fit for the role but sometimes, especially in the possessed scene, he shows some weird acting. I don't blame him completely any foreigner would find it a bit hard to mouth Indian Sanskrit words and chant them in their odd way. He looked kinda funny in this scene, as if he would burst out laughing, not handling the absurdity of the situation. The actress, unlike the opinions of many others, was liked my me. She did what she had to do and I didn't find her annoying. She provided some of the laughs. Short something too was a good actor but I found his high-pitched shrill irritating sometimes. Amrish Puri, as the Indian bad guy, wasn't at his best as I found him to be much more sinister in the Indian movie, Mr.India where he played the role of famous Dr.Mogambo. It was mainly because most of his dialogs were in English and he wasn't able to express them so well. I do not think this film is racist; I think that the producers/script writers of the movie haven't got the accurate or even somewhat correct information about India. I have never watched people gulping snakes or the matter, any creepy crawly creature in my country. It is only during extreme calamities like famine that poor people consume rats. It was somewhat embarrassing for me to watch Indian actors not retaliating to the role they are portraying. And I found it worse when the Chinese boy watched it with disgust. The camera work was very shoddy. I found the work to be very poor. I know it is India, but that doesn't mean you get ugly cameras. The first part looked much newer than this one. The story kicked off extremely well till it reached India. Then it moved on, not leaving much impression behind. I haven't seen such huge insects, especially tarantulas in India. Tarantualas are very uncommon in the country. The action was good and some of the action scenes were taken well but then it became too indianized. If you watch some of the bollywood movies, you would see that the action sequences aren't much different from the foreign ones. Why to get voodoo witch practices into India? Ding Dong, hear the bell: India is not Hogwarts or some magical island! Its a normal country and even was normal seventy years before. Everything looked very old. I felt as if I was watching a C-grade flick sometimes. If it wasn't entertaining, the ratings would've dropped to 4, but as it was, I am going to go with a 6. Indy ain't that good in Hindi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Abode Of Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For his second go around as two fisted archaeologist Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford was in China and had to beat a hasty retreat out of there with the lovely Kate Capshaw and his young sidekick Jonathan LeQuan as Short Round. Capshaw proves to be utterly useless in a crisis, but Indy has good reason to be glad he bought the little guy along.The plane he scrammed out of China on crashes in a remote part of India and Ford and his companions find themselves in a desolate and unhappy village. Two blue rocks said to have mystical power were stolen from the village idol saluting the Hindu god Shiva and someone like an eastern Pied Piper has taken all the children away. Rumor has it that the maharajah's palace has become an abode of evil. Specifically the Thugee strangulation cult which you will all remember from the RKO classic Gunga Din has revived.When Jones finally discovers what's going on and who's behind it, the last hour of the film is literally non-stop action. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is one of those wonderful films that has no message, doesn't pretend to have a message, but is just made for entertainment purposes only. It also has it share of comedy, usually from Kate Capshaw. The scene in the maharajah's palace where all those exotic delicacies are brought out and positively nauseating the audience and Kate Capshaw is hilarious. Her reactions are worth the price of renting or buying the DVD alone.The Indiana Jones eighties trilogy is currently being run on a lot of stations because of the release of the new Indiana Jones film. The Temple of Doom is certainly something not to be missed by fans of the fighting archaeologist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good As The Original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in 1935, Indiana Jones teams up with a night club singer and a twelve-year-old boy as they end up in an Indian small distressed village, where the people believe that evil spirits have taken all their children away after a sacred precious stone was stolen! They also discovered the great mysterious terror surrounding a booby-trapped temple known as the Temple of Doom! Thuggee is beginning to attempt to rise once more, believing that with the power of all five Sankara stones they can rule the world! Now, it's all up to Indiana to put an end to the Thuggee campaign, rescue the lost children, win the girl, and conquer the Temple of Doom.Right from the beginning, you'll know that this sequel will be bigger and much grander than the first film. The visuals in here are fantastic, not to mention the action scenes, and the light humor throughout the film! This is surly as entertaining and as good as it's predecessor.Now, I really enjoyed this film. I loved it from beginning to end. In here, you'll find it to be more or less darker and more or less lighter than the original. I don't know what to say about that, though. This is obviously the most disgusting in the trilogy and well, you'll see why when you see the movie.The sidekicks in here are a bit weird. One is an Asian kid, played by Jonathan Ke Quan, who well, doesn't seem to fit in the movie but you won't mind it when he shoots jokes at every scene he's in. The other is played by Kate Capshaw, who also provide a lot of laughs and eye candy.Apart from that, the set pieces in here are bigger and better. The special effects are done really well. When watching this film, don't expect logical sense. There are some scenes that are just random and out of place but just go along with it. Other than that, buy the movie and enjoy the ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superbly Exciting and Hilarious Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why Temple of Doom has received so much negative feedback. Yes, it's the third best film in the series (only being better than Crystal Skull). The plot is wafer-thin and the artifact that Indy is after is easily the least interesting in the entire series. However, the real question is; who cares? Doom is still an exhilarating, brilliantly paced and extremely funny instalment which is worthy of the name Indiana Jones.Many people have accused Doom of being too dark and sadistic. Although it is darker and nastier than Raiders of the Lost Ark, I don't think that it has much, if any impact on the film's entertainment value. This is Steven Spielberg at his most OTT direction, and he directs Doom with a masterful yet effectively childish skill. It feels like Spielberg became a kid whilst making this film, crafting Doom upon his child-like instincts. His awe beautifully comes across to the audience, whilst also providing continual support for the cast and crew.Seeing as Raiders re-invented the action genre, it is fair to say that there were high expectations concerning the quality of the action sequences in Doom. Thankfully, they don't disappoint. The opening is unexpected, tense and superbly chaotic, and as with Raiders, the action doesn't let up from that point. There is also the terrific highlight of an excellent mine-car chase, which is packed full of danger, energy and literally unforeseen twists.Also on par with the fantastic direction and action set-pieces are the script and performances. As with Raiders, the script is intelligently written, with more than a healthy dose of action and adventure and some terrific humour (the dinner scene is grotesque yet uncontrollably hysterical). The script also reveals an intriguingly dark side to Dr. Jones which wasn't shown in Raiders, with the opening sequence and his brief stint as a zombie servant once again showing that Indy is a flawed and imperfect character. It also reminds us that that's what made us adore him so much in the first place.The performances are brilliant. Harrison Ford once again excels as Dr. Jones, bringing more depth and unpredictability to his character. Ford is Indiana Jones, and no one else can capture the essence and personality of the character like he can. As Indy's sidekick Short Round, Jonathan Ke Quan is energetic, funny and utterly endearing. He also gets some of the script's best lines, such as when he says "Indy, I love you" before smacking him with a torch to wake him from a manipulative trance.As Indy's love interest Willie Scott (no, that is not a joke), Kate Capshaw will either come across as a hilariously funny actress in a fish-out-of-water role, or the biggest mistake ever made in the franchise. Personally, I would go for the former. Capshaw's Willie is hysterically out of her depth, especially in the scene when she is trying to seduce Indy after he has almost been throttled to death. However, the character also grows throughout the story, transforming from a wailing drama queen into someone who is actually useful. Finally, in the role of the villain Mola Ram, Amrish Puri is pure perfection. He is extremely scary, skin-crawling, chilling and possibly the best all-out bad guy that Indy has ever faced. After Puri's brilliantly villainous actions, the comeuppance awaiting him is extremely satisfying.Technically, the film is dazzling. John Williams infuses his original, iconic score with more magnificent music, which is suitably dangerous, seductive and gripping. The editing by Michael Kahn is just as, if not more impressive than Raiders, once again throwing us from thrill to excellent thrill with just the right amount of time for character development. Also, the sets are brilliantly designed, and fully capture the flavour of the series whilst also standing out on their own. Finally, the stunts are magnificently orchestrated, and make the action seem all the more real.Overall, Doom isn't the best film of the Indiana Jones series. But it is still an exceptional piece of entertainment, with fantastic action, a game cast, an intelligent script and uncontrollably energetic direction by Steven Spielberg, whilst being firmly backed up by a top-notch technical crew. It is a brilliant addition to a wonderful series, and doesn't deserve the amount of negative feedback that it has endured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome flick for wit and fast paced action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Karthik Narayan)George Lucas's dream superhero appears in yet another thriller of a movie. This is the second movie in the sequel to "Raiders of the Lost Ark". This movie series has enthralled and enamored audiences worldwide for its breakneck speed of action, comedy and witty dialogues all packed in a short, crisp way.Harrison Ford has his slick ways and punny ways of doing things, living life dangerously in the fast lane as Indiana Jones. This time, Indy lands himself a beautiful lead-actress for that touch of glamour (frankly, it wasn't required at all). As they meet, they go through dangers that lurk in the shadows and they are chased all the way to India. There, they meet a prince en route to their quest for a sacred stone and the missing children of a nearby village, and confront his witchdoctor, who salvage* Ma Kali's blessings through human sacrifices. Amrish Puri has given a brilliant performance as Mola Ram ? he looks fierce and fits the bill as a witchdoctor in India. I guess some people outperform themselves in certain roles ? Amrish Puri's Mola Ram will go down in history as one of the finest villains ever. There is one scene (amongst many others) where he exclaims: "Kali Ma protects us! We are her children! We pledge our devotion to her with an offering of flesh... and blood!" ? this scared the wits out of me!The little prince provides a dangerous proposition for the viewers ? whether to admonish his brash and evil acts or to adopt his cute looks. Indiana's little sidekick Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) steals our hearts with his acting.There are some moments when Indians are shown in poor light ? this is where Lucas really stumps us, after all that hype of his adopting Hinduism for his Star Wars sagas. Maybe he was making amends later in Star Wars! But he could have done away with those morbid scenes, and surely, there was no need for the lead actress at all.Tantric, mystic and terrific scenes smolder each one of us in terror and delight of fine cinema, sans modern moments of cell phones and weapons of mass destruction. Here man faces man in dark moments of hypnotism. The special effects are awesome, and that too for a movie made in the timeline of the early 1980s (1984 to be exact)Sacrilege to those who cannot stick to this storyline! You are doomed to be glued to your seats in this gripping tale of dripping sweat and blood and the final triumph of good over bad</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indiana Jones's Greatest Adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many Indiana Jones fans often view Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom as the worst film out of the Indiana Jones trilogy, but I must say that it has always been my favorite.Temple of Doom begins in Shanghai, China, with our favorite archaeologist already swinging punches. In Shanghai Indy attends a nightclub, here he trades the ruthless gangster, Lao Che, an ancient Chinese artifact for a priceless diamond. Of course one thing leads to another and Indy gets poisoned by Lao Che and gets in a big fight against him and his gang for the poison's antidote. In the end Indy gets the antidote and gets cured, he also gets a new love interest when he sort of kidnaps Willie Scott, Lao Che's girlfriend who was the singer at the nightclub, we also meet Indy's pint sized sidekick Short Round. The three end up boarding a plane intended for Delhi in India, but on the way there the pilots, who work for Lao Che, abandon the plane and dump the fuel. Indy, Willie, and Short Round narrowly escape the plane before it crashes and they end up in a small, rural Indian village. Here the village elder describes to Indy that the town's children have been kidnapped by the evil thuggee cult, and that an ancient town artifact, one of the ancient Sankara Stones, has been stolen. Indy accepts the duty of retrieving the Sankara Stone for the village and rescuing their children from the thuggee cult.The first thing that most immediately note about this film is how much darker it is than any other Indiana Jones adventure, but I feel that the darker atmosphere just makes Indy that much more exciting to watch. The film is once more superbly directed by the great Steven Spielberg, and the script by American Graffiti scribes, Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, is flawless; just like Raiders it balances the comedy in perfectly with the action and drama. As well the acting is great, Harrison Ford is back in the hat of Indiana Jones and I simply think he was born to play this role. Also John Williams is back once more and delivers another fine score that sells each scene perfectly. All of the other production values are all top notch, in particular the cinematography and art direction.As I mentioned earlier this is the darkest Indiana Jones adventure produced thus far, and for that reason alone many do not like it, majority of fans seem to flock to the more comedic and light hearted third film, but as I have stated previously, this is my favorite Indy adventure so far. First, even though it is a dark film it still has much comedy, majority of it coming in the hilarious banter between Short Round and Indiana Jones. The action is also probably the most exciting action in any of the Indy films, the mine car chase at the end is truly like a roller coaster ride. One of the things this particular Indiana Jones adventure did for me though, that none of the others really did, was it created actual suspense, when Indy is turned to the dark side by the cult it is truly frightening, as well the scene when the man's heart is ripped out is very terrifying, but yet it is one of the finest scenes of the film, showing how truly heartless and evil the thuggee cult is.All in all it is a truly fun and exciting Indiana Jones adventure, and is my favorite Indy film of them all. It is the darkest Indy film, but is also the most fun. One thing to note though, this film is pretty rough for the younger Indiana Jones fans.Temple of Doom gets a flawless 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may not have been better then Raiders but it was still a good adventure. I have been watching the Indiana Jones films in time for the latest release "Kingdom of the crystal skull". I had never seen a Indiana Jones film until a couple of days ago. I have to say i have been having a great time.This time around it focuses more on its humor and comedy then the great adventure that we were blessed with in the first Indiana movie. Which is a real shame. It had less then a quarter of the adventure that Raiders had.Indiana Jones was great but his sidekick and lady were annoying at times. After seeing Raiders of the Lost Ark i didn't think Jones needed a sidekick but this is a prequel and he was mostly there just for laughs. Jones sidekick comes in the form of a small Chinese kid. He has some good lines and the kid who played him was a good actor. But it seems he weighs Indiana down at times. Now to the lady. Again not as good as Marion Ravenwood from the first one. She can be really whinny and is always getting Jones and his sidekick in trouble.The films opens in a Shanghai restaurant where we see Indiana Jones in a James Bond look. Here he meets and flees with a singer called Willie Scott. Along with Willie and his sidekick shorty they accidentally board a plane owned by the bad guy. The pilots leave the plane while there flying and the gang crash in Indian village where the villagers ask Jones to go to the Temple of Doom and take some stones and save the villagers children. The story was good and well told.The only thing that was better then the original was the visual effects but they don't make up for the rest of the movie.I still recommend this but don't expect it to be better than the original. Next on my list The last crusade.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1981 Spielberg/Lucas collaboration 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a cinema milestone. Not only is it a throwback to the old serials of the 20s and 30s, but it's one of those films that keeps finding new fans every generation. It was George Lucas himself who came up with the character of Indiana Jones and three adventures to be made into films. In 1984 the second of those adventures hit the big screen. It too was a major hit, but unlike the first film it got some mixed feelings from some viewers. Most of the same ingredients are here, but one thing was very different: The tone. Whereas 'Raiders' is a more lighthearted romp, this prequel has a more sinister mood. But speaking personally, I wasn't bothered by this at all. In fact, I feel it's a nice change of pace.Pros: A tense, exciting opening sequence. Lots of beautiful scenery and locations, like the palace. Plenty of the humor and gags the series is known for. Gorgeous cinematography. John Williams, composer for 'Raiders,' returns with an equally good score. Solid performances. Very nice, detailed costumes and sets. Moves at a good pace from start to finish. Has a darker tone than the others, which you'll either like or not. Personally I dig it. More than enough thrills and chills. Good special effects. Some cool actions scenes and set pieces.Cons: Really gotta suspend your disbelief at times. Though I like the darker feel, it does take a little away from the fun factor.Final thoughts: What is, at the very least, one of the greatest adventure movies of all time, was followed by an equally awesome prequel. It's got action, danger, romance, comedy, and anything else you could ask for in a film of this kind. If only all films could be as enjoyable as these.My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually I dislike kids fooling around in action movies. But here I give up. To me this adventure flick is certainly the best Indiana Jones movie and perhaps even the best action/adventure/thriller movie. It never lets a viewer doze off. A shoot-out in some China restaurant swiftly turns into a car-chase, the car-chase transforms into a psychotic aircraft catastrophe, the aircraft catastrophe gets right to a dinner-table with monkey brains, stuffed snakes, "delicious" insects and what-not, the dinner-table rapidly meets an assassination scene, the assassination scene ends in a secret passage swarmed with the crawling creatures and spiked ceiling that is getting lower and lower, then there is a macabre occult episode, child abuse, mass hysteria and escape, insane railway ride, grisly deaths of the baddies, alligators, ...phew - that's nearly all. That is a kind of content for a few adventure flicks, isn't it? But no, Mr Stephen Spielberg stuffs it all in one movie. The right choice. It looks great.Warning! If you are accustomed to usual TV serials (so beloved by housewives) and simple "sexy" down-to-earth talkative entertainment (like "Anshlag"), you will probably get a headache in no time when watching this movie. For a mouldy brain of a modern TV-buff the pace of this one is too speedy. It's not a kind of chewing-gum suspense fantasy adventure - it's a kind of run-while-you-still-can adventure.The choice of the actors could not be better. Actually, this film has greatly affected my evaluation of "Star Wars" and "Blade Runner". I wished Mr Harrison Ford had not appeared in those productions because he made a perfect Indiana Jones. It happens now and then that one role has a destructive influence on some actor. This is a pure example. I see him in "Blade Runner" and cannot treat the project seriously (though I try really hard). I see him in "Star Wars" and cannot get rid of his image in a cowboy hat with a whip in his hand. And no thriller with him as the leading star can lure me into watching. No way. He is the sarcastic archaeologist, period.As to the other two Indiana Jones movies, I enjoy the first one (a good "entrance" of the hero) but dislike the third instalment (a weak diminuendo with pathetic father-and-son relations, in my humble opinion).What else to say? It's a wild ride. The critically-acclaimed "E.T." is boring and unimpressive to me, there is often something wrong with his other movies too (too much sentimentality and self-importance, maybe), but this one is a must-have. Simply outstanding. At least now I know that Mr Steven Spielberg can direct a solid piece of entertainment and keep "fortissimo" from the opening shots till the very last ones.A definite 10 out of 10. Thanks for attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Indy Adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harrison Ford is back as Indiana Jones in his first sequel to to the original Indiana Jones movie, "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Jones teams up with nightclub singer "Willie" Scott (Kate Capshaw) and twelve-year-old Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan), and they journey to an Indian village where the people believe that evil spirits abducted their children after a sacred stone was stolen. In the mix is Mola Ram (Amrish Puri), who wants all the stones to create a superpower. George Lucas, Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz provided a great story and screenplay that made this film a thrilling adventure that includes boobie-traps, mine-cart rides and black magic. Action is in abundance here, from the Shanghai car-chase involving Indy and Chinese gangsters to the battle royale involving Indy and the slave-traders. This film is more exotic and danger-filled than the other films in the trilogy, which makes it my favorite and one that will provide you with non-stop entertainment. Steven Spielberg did a great job directing, keeping the plot's momentum fast-paced, and John Williams provided a marvelous music score, giving us catchy themes for the mine-cart chase and the iconic Indiana Jones theme, which would be forever recognizable in the cinema world. Indiana Jones had great chemistry with Willie Scott, and a touching friendship with Short Round, providing a nice balance of romance and drama in this adventurous film. I especially liked Kate Capshaw's hilarious role - the parts where she gets thrown off by an elephant and where she skirmishes at the food served in the Indian Castle were classic and provided a nice touch of comedy. Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round gave a feisty and comical performance, yelling at Indy and Willie when danger is near. Amrish Puri makes a dark and frightening villain, and Harrison Ford as Indy gave us another action-packed, whip-cracking and dramatic performance. Great fun here. Not to be missed.Grade A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>prefer this one to the first movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why people say this film is not as good as Raiders and last Crusade, they are out of their minds. For one thing, the film is jam packed with amazing stunts in particular when Indy, Willy and Short Round realise there is no one flying the plane and they are going to crash and they end up falling out of the plane in an inflatable boat and they go over cliffs. The Stunt men definitely deserved recognition for putting their lives in jeopardy to carry out these awe inspiring stunts that I wouldn't have the courage to do.The magic is still in the film, as I have mentioned the stunts are out of this world, there is still romance and action that keeps the audience gripped. The heroine Willy (Kate Capshaw) is different from Marion in the first film as she is a night club singer who is pampered and spoilt. I love the chemistry between her and Indy, they sizzle together. They have a type of love/hate relationship going on.Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) is very funny and has me in floods of laughter, he has some of the best lines. He looks up to Indy and they have a father/son relationship which is sweet to watch. He is just a brilliant little actor.On the whole, it is worthy of being part of the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pulp Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most repeated mistake that critics make when discussing this film is judging it by modern day standards. Under those criteria, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is extremely sexist with Capshaw as the helpless and annoying damsel in distress. It is racist with the negatively, stereotypical portrayal of Jonathan Ke Quan as the pickpocket Chinese orphan. While we are at it, this movie makes countless errors in continuity and logic throughout the entire 118 minutes.Instead of judging Temple of Doom by modern day standards, we should appreciate the film for what it is: A true, heartfelt throwback to the classic titles of Pulp magazines. In the same vain as Doc Savage, Indiana Jones is a "Man of Bronze," who travels the world in search of adventure and danger. He does not feel pain for longer than 30 seconds; can punch a guy unconscious with one blow; and though outwardly conceited, maintains saintly compassion for those around him. In other words, he is totally unreal. But that is, in my opinion, the allure of the character.It is obvious, if you know the history and mythology of the Pulp stories that Temple of Doom was made as a means to pay homage to the great writers like Walter B. Gibson, Edwin Burkhilder and Lester Dent. In addition to these people, the second Indy flick makes many comical references to other Lucas and Spielberg films. For example, the name of the bar at the beginning of the film is called Club Obi Wan. All of these gags set the movie up as a treat to all the members in the audience who shared in on the mysterious of Pulp magazine stories that Lucas did as a kid.Bearing all this in mind, I loved Temple of Doom and believe it is one of the best attempts in recent years to recapture that adventurous spirit that was created back in the early 20th century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSEven though this film is not as good as Raiders, this is still a nice little adventure flick. It is about Indy, Short Round, and singer Willy going to India and finding out that they have to help free the children from the Thugee. This film has a much darker tone than Raiders or Crusade, but I kind of like dark films, such as Dead Man's Chest, or The Empire Strikes Back. I also find the person getting his heart ripped out was a little gruesome for a PG film, but still, they hadn't made PG-13 yet and I don't think they would have made it R. Overall, this is a great adventure film and should not be missed if your an adventure lover. Also, I wish Sallah was in this.9/10Recommended Films: Raiders of the Lost Ark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is in my opinion the best of the trilogy but my opinion is bias because I like horror films more than the average action film. Yes, it's not the most pleasant of the trilogy but it is the most horror-based which is why I think it works. It's probably easier to compare to other archeology-based horrors like the Mummy or Horrors of India.But than again, Raiders of the Lost Ark is darker considering the lack of humor. I just like the whole trilogy, but I prefer this one over the others, because that's just me. If want black humor, this is the best one. If you want drama and straight-up adventure, watch Raiders, and if you want light-hearted adventure watch the Last Crusade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crackerjack Prequel To Raiders Of The Lost Ark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a hair-raising encounter with a Chinese gangster, adventurer Indiana Jones, accompanied by a reluctant nightclub singer and a diminutive assistant, is tasked to recover a sacred stone stolen from a remote village by an evil Indian religious cult.The sequel (though it's set a year earlier) to Raiders Of The Lost Ark, like most sequels, is not nearly as good as the original, but is still an extremely enjoyable escapist action movie. What lets it down a little I think is the script, which is quite ponderous in places when it should be zinging, and never really livens the characters up too much. There are some wonderful sequences however - the opening dance-number and free-for-all in the Shanghai nightclub is terrific, there's a great jump-out-of-a-plane gag, a fabulous gross-out meal of snakes, bugs and monkeys, and the last half-hour, involving a mine-cart chase, a flood and a rope-bridge sequence gives the movie a crash-bang-wallop ending. John Williams' music, George Gibbs' brilliant mechanical effects and particularly Elliot Scott's eye-popping sets (the Thugee's secret chamber and underground mine is an astounding piece of production design) all contribute to a great looking film. The cast all give it their best amid the frenetic fury but the characters are often too one-dimensional - Indy is a bit dour and noble, Willie (Capshaw) is funny but one-note, and none of the villains are given anything interesting to say (an unforgivable crime). Minor gripes aside though, this is still fantastic entertainment by anyone's standards, and the Sri Lanka locations add to the visual splendour. Ripping stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many scenes in this movie that are so well executed and conceived that it's almost hard to believe they're all in one movie. Jumping out of the airplane with the raft, the cave of bugs, the wild mine cart ride, and of course one of the greatest movie endings-the fight on the bridge.The new sidekick Short-round in this movie can be annoying, but Indiana is so awesome that short-round's crappiness is made up by Indiana's awesomeness.Some complain about how depressing and violent this film is. Frankly, despite the heart scene, I think it's just as violent as The Lost Ark. It is a little harsher, due to the slavery stuff, but it makes the ending all the greater when the children are set free.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary WILD ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Temple of Doom it's a hell of a movie no matter what the people said. It's more exciting, funnier, and more impressive than the first one.Yes, it's violent, but is not as bloody as `Raiders' is. Temple of doom deserves a lot more than it has, because is a non-stopping action sequel, in which you can't move from your seat while you are watching it; this movie moves, and moves, making you feel the real meaning of what an action movie means.The plot of the movie is real interesting, is by far nothing like raiders, it's a complete new adventure and situation. It's the search of a sacred rock which has been stolen from a village, and is used to worship an evil god: Kali. Following the adventure with Indiana J. is Short Round, and the singer Willie Scott.The cast is great, I can't understand why Kate (Willie) was criticized for her acting, her performance is just one of the most funny that I have seen in a female character: the way she complains about everything, the screams, her originality makes me laugh every time I watch this movie, besides for me she is the most beautiful of the three Indiana's girls. The villain Mola Ram is really creepy, I remembered that when I was a kid this guy really scared me just by seeing him laugh.CONTAIN SPOILERSThe action sequences, despite of being very unrealistic, are just impressive and make you feel the excitement through all your body: The plane crash sequence, the scene when Indiana and Short R. are trapped and Willie with all the insects tries to save them, the mine chase (For me this is one of the most impressive and exciting action sequence that I have ever seen in my life), and the falling bridge sequence.OK, I have to admit that some sequences are a little bit disturbing even diabolic, but `Raiders' it is exactly the same, just try to remember and think about it:RAIDERS: -In the first scene when Indiana is looking for the idol and the Latin guy who says `Adios se?or' is killed by the trap and you can see the blades crossing his body and head, and Indiana says: `Adios Estupido'. -In the Marion's bar scene you can see very clearly how Indiana shots into a guy's head, and the head burst into blood. -In the Cairo sequence, again you can see how Indiana shots a guy in his chest and again in the head of the guy who was driving the truck with dynamite. -In the plane fight sequence all the sequence is too violent: punches, bites, even a guy killed by the propellers of the plane, and in a moment you can see the cockpit of the plane soak in blood. -In the car chase sequence you can see how Indiana really hates Nazis: gun shots, punches, even he murder a guy running over him with the truck. -And for the last you can see how several Nazis soldiers are killed by a mystique force, including two guys melting in a very bloody way concluding with a guy who is burning, to finally see how his head explode. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE THAT PEOPLE SAY THAT TEMPLE OF DOOM IS THE LESS GOOD OF THE THREE BECAUSE IT'S TOO VIOLENT.`Temple of Doom' rocks???? (as well as the other two Indiana Jones movies), is by far one of the best action movies ever, so open your mind, relax and tight your seat belt for the wildest ride of your life.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why has this film gotten such a bad rep in the Indiana Jones trilogy? I think it's loads better than "Crusade". It's trying to do something different.Yes, Kate Capshaw's a little too whiny, in hindsight. (Is Allison Doody any better?) But I saw this in the theater when I was a kid and I responded to it a lot more strongly than I did to "Raiders". Looking back on it, I realize it's much more of a children's film. The cartoony woman. The wise-cracking child sidekick of Short-Round (my childhood idol).The opening musical number? Followed by Indy in a tuxedo? And the big chase for the antidote/diamond? You don't get much better than that, anywhere. Nobody's coming up with that much imagination anymore.And Indy's really FIGHTING for something here. The sight of all those children running free at the end? It's exultant.It's disheartening to hear Spielberg/Lucas downplay this one. I think it's a really special one. I know it's slightly more special because I grew up with it, but I really hope kids find this one in years to come...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to agree with another commenter who said "Worst of the Trilogy". The first and the last films were both much better than this one. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom has the poorest acting (by pretty much everyone) and the poorest story of the three. The film tries to rely on grossing the viewer out (eyeball soup, etc.) instead of keeping us entertained as the first (and third) did. The other two films kept the viewer on the edge of his seat for the entire rollicking film. There is very little rollicking in this film at all. This one should possibly be in the Drama genre rather than Action. Altogether a poor addition to the Indiana Jones saga. I gave it a 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As deserving in 'Indy lore' as its predecessor and successor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched The Temple of Doom when I was seven and loved it. Maybe that's why I still love it today. However, every time I look on the internet I see people who seem to think that The second Indiana Jones story is somehow sub-standard to Raiders and Last Crusade (notice how I don't even mention Crystal Skull - which I reasonably enjoyed too).I disagree. I'd say the main difference between Temple and what went before and (directly) afterwards is the lack of a military presence and some good ol' fashioned Nazi-bashing. Instead, the action largely takes place in one setting (i.e. the Temple of Doom itself) and there's no mention of Marcus or Indy's other professors. Therefore, apparently this goes some way to distance itself from the others, making it appear like more of a 'stand-alone' movie. Plus, and maybe you don't know this, it's also (technically) a prequel to Raiders, taking place before the first film.Also, be prepared for lots of screaming. Indy is accompanied by a female sidekick called Willie who does little else but cry out for help throughout the whole film. Some people have even likened her performance of that of Jar-Jar Binks in how much she irritates the viewer.However, I ignore all these points and simply love it for a good old-fashioned tongue-in-cheek (slightly) action romp. Harrison Ford is as good as ever and the music adds to the effect and gets your heart racing every time Indy's 'theme' comes on.Yes, it may be slightly out on a limb if you compare it to Raiders and the Last Crusade, but don't treat it any differently. Does anyone really think Indiana Jones ONLY fights the Nazis? There are plenty of bad guys around the world who need a good whipping! Temple of Doom is as awesome now as when I watched it as a kid.Yah-boo to the poo-pooers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indian Jones and Temple of Doom. In this second installment of cult Indiana Jones series enigmatic Harrison Ford accidentally arrives in India, is asked by a desperate village to find a mystical stone. He agrees, and stumbles upon a secret cult plotting a terrible plan in the catacombs of an ancient palace. The movie is darkest one in this fun and adventure series with lots of haunting background score, images and sequences of torture such as taking a live heart out of a alive man. Being set in India, there are many Indian characters, two of them played by known names like Amrish Puri and Roshan Seth. The movie has a small canvas compared to other Indy movies but there is relentless action and adventure that does not allow you to move your eyes from the screen. It is a must watch for Indiana Jones fans and must try for adventure movie lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harrison Ford returns as everybody's favourite archaeologist, Indiana Jones, in this prequel to the 1981 smash hit movie.Set in 1935 (one year before "Raiders"), this adventure follows Indy to India as he finds himself in an ancient palace fighting an evil cult who are growing powerful because of some sacred stones said to have mystical powers.George Lucas is again script writer here but his story is a lot weaker than the original. "Temple of Doom" goes way over the top and is too heavy handed on the occult. Lucas has also packed the story with more action this time, which whilst being very entertaining, allows the plot to suffer.The cast do well again, with Harrison Ford supported by wicked Amrish Puri and Roshan Seth, prissy heroine Kate Capshaw (as Willie Scott) and newcomer Ke Huy Quan as side kick Short Round. The movie is technically good once more, with John Williams providing another effective score. Sadly though this second instalment couldn't fill its predecessor's giant shoes, and remains an inferior, far fetched romp whose roller coaster plot and action keeps its audience well entertained, though perhaps disbelieving.Thursday, December 30, 1993 - Astor Theatre</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Temple of Doom isn't a bad movie but not a good one either.It lacks the excitement and momentum of its predecessor and successor.As commented by fellow users, it would have made a huge difference on the perception of Indians if Spielberg could have been kind enough to add that one dialogue in the banquet scene, 'what kind of people are these?.a real Hindu would never touch meat?.'. Whether it's an act of mistaken editing or a result of his disappointment that his movie E.T lost to the Best Movie Oscar to Gandhi ? it's a big MISTAKE. Even the ritual scenes involving Amrish Puri could've been explained as not common in India. Yes, India had more Snake Charmers, Black Magicians, Witch-Hunters in 1935 than it did now. But, these two sequences create a fallacy that Indians (rural folk, especially) are not better than Barbarians.Movies are more capable than what their makers think they are. One of the major contributors towards stereotyping is movies. It has been creating false notions about races and cultures ? the victims in most cases being Asians and Blacks.</fullReview>

I am not from India, yet I found myself offended and ashamed that American movie makers would create such horrible stuff.The lead female character was a screaming ninny.

		<fullReview>Indiana Jones travels to India to plunder the country of a few of its precious religious artifacts.The story starts off as Jones has just looted a sacred Chinese crypt and is trying to sell the remains of a dead emperor to a violent gangster. Jones plays hardball during the negotiations, seeking to maximize his grave-desecrating profits. At one point, he even threatens to maim a helpless showgirl to strengthen his bargaining position. The gangsters try to calm Jones with some harmless poison, and he responds by rudely trashing the entire nightclub. Jones escapes and, with the help of his Asian boy-slave Short Round, kidnaps the showgirl. The casting is adequate here. Ke Huy Quan and most of the other supporting characters are genuinely funny. Kate Kapshaw (the director's girlfriend) fits perfectly as the vacuous, superficial showgirl hack. She's the only actor in the entire picture who doesn't seem to recognize that she is in a B-movie. And I can't believe George Lucas made the only female character shallow and stupid. I just can't believe it. After a pilot mix-up in their plane, Jones and Showgirl don't even TRY saving the airplane, instead bailing out with Short Round after stealing a raft. Jones, Showgirl, and Short Round are rescued by some poor Indian villagers, who freely give up what little food they have to the strangers. Jones responds by doubting Sheba's divine providence and spitting in the face of their religion. The villagers need Jones' help because they claim a local Thugee cult has kidnapped their children. Jones agrees to help the second he finds out there might be some precious artifacts involved. The trio travel to the palace of the Maharaja, where they promptly insult and embarrass the young ruler so much that he seeks solace in the local Thugee cult, which by an amazing coincidence happens to have their temple hidden below his palace. Jones and company promptly break into the Thugee temple, desecrating the sacred site with glee. But they aren't content to merely steal and plunder. Jones even interrupts their mining operation. He notices the working conditions aren't quite as plush as an American office, so he violently attacks the mine supervisors. Jones and his cohorts are finally detained. The friendly Thugee leader insists on sharing a local drink with Jones as a peace gesture. This time, Jones literally spits in the face of their time-honored religion. Fast forward a few days. Jones has reconciled with the Thugees and joined their little church group. But it seems his American influence is still with him as he is now apparently abusing drugs and constantly in a stupor. Showgirl also seems to have made amends with the Thugees, even apparently agreeing to help them with their quaint lava ritual. Meanwhile, Short Round is unhappy with his new full-time job in the Thugee mines. Instead of discussing his problems with management, he ruins some company equipment (shackles and chains) and wanders off without even clocking out. Adding insult to injury, he then steals a torch, interrupts the holy Thugee ceremony, and tries to torch the cult's newest member, Indiana Jones. Not wanting to get torched again by Short Round, Jones joins him AGAIN in kidnapping Showgirl. Back to the mines, where Jones' cohorts join him in inciting labor unrest, resulting in a violent riot. They escape, but not before stealing some priceless religious stones and a mine cart from the luckless Thugees. The benevolent Thugee priest and his altar boys confront the Jones gang on a local bridge and plead for the return of their precious religious relics. Jones responds by ruining the bridge, feeding the altar boys to some crocodiles, killing the priest, and tossing all but one of the relics. The British army even shows up to slaughter some of the locals and save the white-skinned plunderers. Even after ruining the local magic-rock-digging industry and putting all of the young workers out of jobs, Jones is still greeted as a hero when he returns to the Indian village. I don't get it.</fullReview>

They land in India where they are befriended by a tribe. Jones is sent to reclaim a sacred stone that was stolen by a cult that uses their children as slaves. From there it is exhilarating action, nail-biting roller-coaster ride through a mine shaft, and an unstable bridge hovering over crocodiles. Steven Spielberg outdoes himself with tremendous action and production. Ford is terrific as Jones while Kate Capshaw provides humour as a nightclub dancer suddenly thrown into danger and a less glamorous lifestyle. Jonathan Ke Quan plays an adventurous boy who is Indy's intelligent and resourceful sidekick. Amrish Puri as the cult leader makes for a vicious villain who at one point has Jones under trance. Roshan Seth plays the Prime Minister who also worships the cult leader. Pointless graphic violence ill marketed yet still a fun free spirited thrill ride. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent second film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always hard to do a sequel. Often film makers try to up the ante, do the exact same things that made the first film so successful, but often this means that the movie loses all novelty and the film manages to capture the magic of the first one. Also, it's always hard to continue the story believably if the first one was made to be a standalone film.Luckily some films succeed. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom knows exactly what things to keep and what things to change. We still have Indiana Jones being the gruff knight in dented armor that captured our interest the first time around, but this time his quest is radically different, though it still contains all the excitement, adventure, mythology and high octane action a great film requires. Instead of fighting Nazis to prevent their world domination, we follow Indy around a few years before the events of the first film - an excellent choice - as he tries to protect and help the innocent in rural India. A very different environment, but just as rich in lore and history.What we end up getting is the darkest one of all the Indiana Jones films, which has earned the film some naysayers, but I think it's fitting. Indiana Jones was never about the invincibility of its hero or the brightness of the world, so it's fitting that not all of Indy's adventures are about triumph and merry fistfights.And yeah, Kate Capshaw as Willie is not Marion by any means, which is a minus. And yes, Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) can be annoying to some people, making this the weakest film of the original trilogy, but it's still one of the best adventure films ever made and a great sequel by any definition of the word. You've all seen it already, but go ahead, see it again. Like every film in the trilogy, it's great fun no matter how many times you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe there are people who think this is the worst Indiana Jones movie, because this to me is neck and neck with Raiders if it weren't for Willie. Yes Willie is really annoying, but why does that make a movie bad? Didn't the director and screenwriter(s) do their job if you hate a character they purposefully made annoying? Why they made her annoying is another story and I'm not completely sure why. Maybe it was because in Raiders Indy needed Marion's help, so in this they changed it so it was Willie who needed Indy. I don't know. But this is one of my favorite movies and had a lot of fun watching it, everything is incredibly well made. Short Round was cute and wasn't an annoying kid who was just there because they wanted to appeal to kids (ok that might be part of it, but honestly who the hell cares), and had great chemistry together. The action scenes are phenomenally directed by the one and only Steven Spielberg. The score is of course excellent, Harrison Ford is good although maybe not as good as he was in Raiders, and screenplay has a great story and dialogue. The script isn't as good as Raiders, but not every writer is Lawrence Kasdan. Now I know I have pointed out a lot of things that aren't as good as Raiders, but just because they are not as good as a masterpiece, does not mean it isn't great. So my only problem with this is Willie, but that does not change my rating of a 10. But that does mean I won't call this a masterpiece like Raiders is, but this is a near masterpiece. I seem to be one of the few who loved this as much as Raiders, buy if you haven't seen any of the Indy movies give them a watch because they're a lot of fun, and make you feel like a kid again (except Crystal Skull).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second installment of the Indiana Jones franchise is one of those films I thought was beloved for many years, until the advent of the internet when I discovered it gets a lot of stick. So hold onto yo potatoes, it's time for a controversial review of unpopular opinion.I'll begin my defense with discussing the movie's two not so beloved characters. First up, Short Round. I love this character for several reasons; the first is the endearing relationship he has with Indiana Jones. Unlike Indy's other companions, Short Round idolizes Indy. The moment in which Indy places Short Round's cap on his head after freeing him from the Thuggee cult's spell, perfectly sums up their relationship, and it gets me every time. Short Round saves Indy's life on multiple occasions; In fact sometimes I wonder how he's even still alive without him. In comparison to a more beloved character in the series, Henry Jones senior, who almost gets Indy killed on a number of occasions, thus rendering the criticism of Short Round being a hindrance to Indy invalid. But I hear you say, Short Round has an annoying voice? So I guess a high pitched voice renders a character's personality, vulnerability and character arc void? Short Round is like a kid's fantasy, what's cooler than getting to be Indiana Jones' sidekick? Who wouldn't want to be Short Round? Well I'd rather be Indy himself, but being Short Round is the next best thing.But how do I defend Willie?! I've never found the character of Willie to be annoying, and I believe one of the reasons for this is that she is punished for her selfish actions throughout the film. Her character is supposed to be unlikable and the movie is fully aware of this by making her get her comeuppance. During the movie her character matures, she shows concern for Indy and Short Round during the later portion of the film and even punches bad guys during the mine cart chase, a far cry from her earlier self. I love this trio of characters, so yeah, what are you going to do about it?!It might seem odd to start an Indiana Jones movie with a musical number, but as it captures the 1930's setting and exotic tone of the series it manages to work. This is my favourite opening scene in the series, of course I love musical numbers, and this is one of the greatest spectacles of song and dance ever put on screen.Temple of Doom is too juvenile? You say juvenile like it's a bad thing. I like all the weird creepy stuff, the bugs, the monkey brains, hearts being ripped out of people's chests; it's repulsive in the best sense of the word. But Temple of Doom isn't a stupid film. No one ever seems to mention Indy's character arc of overcoming his selfish streak. During the first half of the film he is only concerned with obtaining his 'fortune and glory'. Even after visiting the baron village, obtaining the Sankara Stones for his own personal gain remains his only objective. It's not until he sees his own eyes the children in slave labour that he changes his way.Also why is the raft scene a constant source of criticism? I can understand hoe Indy surviving a nuclear explosion inside a fridge went too far, but the raft scene is perfect sort of implausible B- movie type moment that doesn't go too far to the point of absurdity. The second half of Temple of Doom is one huge roller coaster ride, with the mine cart chase being an actual roller coaster ride. The movie throws so many classic b-movie thrills, a room with a descending spiked roof, a conveyor belt with a crushing roller at the end, a scene atop of a rope bridge. After the trio escape from metaphorical hell, the final kiss between Indy and Willie is one of the most satisfying in all of cinema.But let's get into the real serious stuff, the film's portrayal of Hinduism. I don't claim to be an expert on Hinduism, but I'll attempt to the best of my ability to defend this most controversial aspect of the film. The villains of Temple of Doom, The Thuggee, were a cult who resided in Indiana over several hundred who would strangle travelers and steal their belongings (hence the origin of the term 'thug'). The Thuggee where followers of the Hindu Goddess Kali, however in Hinduism, Kali is not an evil entity, but rather the goddess of time, change and energy. As what The Thuggee believes is not what Kahali stands for, it makes the villains more interesting as they religious extremists, desecrating a faith for their own selfish gain, such as The Westro Baptist Church to Christianity or Isis to Islam. I believe the filmmaker's are aware of this, as evident in the scene towards the end of the film on the dangling rope bridge, Just before Indy sends Mola Ram to his death, he utters "You betrayed Kali!". The more I look into it, selfishness seems to be a recurring theme in Temple of Doom.When a film is labelled for apparent racism, I think to myself was there malicious intent behind it? I'm not one for defending the Star Wars prequels, but did George Lucas create Jar Jar Binks because he has a prejudice against African Americans and/or Caribbean peoples, or is it an innocent oversight? In the case of Temple of Doom, the filmmakers where simply taking inspiration from another film, 1939's Gunga Din, which features The Thuggee as the central villain, and of scenes in Temple of Doom pay homage to.I consider Temple of Doom to be no less worthy a film than Raiders or Last Crusade. For you see my opinion is always correct, expect for the times when I am wrong, which is never.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indiana Jones 2 (which precedes Raiders Of The Lost Ark chronologically) is as much fun as its predecessor, notwithstanding the major irritation of screaming love interest Willie (Kate "Mrs Spielberg" Capshaw) or the minor irritation of kid sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan).After a terrific opening sequence combining knockabout action with a musical production number, our heroes bail out of an aeroplane in a rubber raft (pay attention, those who decried Crystal Skull for unbelievability) and fall foul of an Indian cult who are using child slaves in a mine.There's not much of a plot, but there doesn't need to be. There is much action, including several terrific set pieces, constant jeopardy, and that quality which so often fails to make it into films - fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harrison Ford, Kate Capshaw and Jonathan Quan star in Steven Spielberg's 1984 adventure prequel. Archaeologist, Indiana Jones searches for ancient stones &amp; children taken from an Indian village. This prequel takes place in 1935 with Indiana Jones (Ford) escaping a Shanghai nightclub brawl with young sidekick, Short Round (Quan) and loud-mouth singer, Willie Scott (Capshaw). After surviving a plane crash, they land in India where they're asked by the natives to go to a Palace nearby to search for their missing ancient stones &amp; children. They head to the palace discovering that an evil Thuggee cult is using the children as slaves. Indiana and his friends become prisoners, but soon escape retrieving the stones and freeing the children. I've always liked this film and think it's very underrated. I recommend this good adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frightening to Small Children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, the second part in the "Jones" trilogy, is a great one, nonetheless, but has many scary moments and probably frightening to small children. I first saw this movie when i was eleven years old. It was freaky then, too (definitely a sign). I don't like it as much as the others, so i don't watch it as frequently. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom stars our returning hero, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford, who else). This time he is joined by our screeching heroine, Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw), lucky us, and sweet and friendly Short Round. After narrowly escaping danger, the trio race off and secretly board a plane, which they don't know actually belongs to a Chinese gangster- whom they were running from. The two pilots are told to jump off in India, so Indy, Willie and Short Round find themselves in a ruined village. They come across an elder who pleads for their help, and they journey deep inside a castle, and end up in the Temple of Doom -- hence the name. This particular movie am i truly not found of, yet some may disagree. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, although many people will not approve of it. My comment I feel is not to rude or uncalled for. Many thought that this was a fabulous show when it came out, then came to their senses of how remarkable it is in its crude manner (no offense, Steven). You may read my comment, watch the movie, vice versa, and agree with me or not. I personally feel that this is definitely not the best of Lucas' and Spielberg's work, but, hey, there's always 1989.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst Indiana Jones film out of the three movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Raiders Of The Lost Ark. I loved The Last Crusade more, and was sad to see it end. I refuse to call this a classic like the other two, because it isn't. First of all, this movie is too dark for an Indiana Jones film. The scene where the guys heart was pulled out was unnecessary, and the scene with the alligators. This film should've been more like the third movie, less darkness, and more thrills. The acting is the worst of the three movies. Kate Caphsaw annoyed the hell out of me, and every time she screamed I wanted to reach through the screen and choke the life out her. The kid was annoying too, but not as much as her. Hell, even Harrison Ford looked like he was bored in this movie, and wasn't feeling the excitement when working with Sean Connery in the third movie. Do yourself a favor folks, skip this movie and go straight to The Last Crusade, because it is a much better film than this poor excuse of a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The darkest of the trilogy. "Temple of Doom" is a great action-adventure film unsuitable for younger children or the weak of heart. **** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This prequel to "Raiders of the Lost Ark" may be a bit excessive in terms of gore and gross-out scenes, but it still is a great cinematic rollar-coaster ride. In fact, fans of the horror or supernatural genre would probably prefer this to "Raiders" because of its darkness. Critics found it too dark without an ounce of fun, but they are wrong. "Temple of Doom", while lacking the class of its predecessor, matches it when it comes to pure visceral thrills. Like "Raiders", not only does its inspiration come from the serials of the 30's and 40's, but from the James Bond films as well.The opening pays homage to old Hollywood musicals and to Bond when Indy enters the scene in tux and all. He speaks to Chinese gangsters in their native tongue and then a masterful overextended action scene ensues. When all is said and done, Indy, his sidekick and love interest find themselves in India. A village has been destroyed by a centuries-old cult who want to rule the world. They ask Indy to rescue their children and a special stone that contains superpowers. Of course, he goes along with the plan and finds himself in some scary places. The cult, lead by an evil priest named Mola Ram, offers human sacrifices to their demonic god, Kali-Ma. In the following intense scenes, Ram removes the heart of a victim, who then perishes in a lake of fire, all set to some creepy chanting. Indy is taken prisoner, tortured and then drinks the blood of the Kali. He becomes a "Thugee", a zombie-like member of the cult, for a short while. Miraculously, he is saved from the "black sleep" and decides to save the day.The mine cart sequence is the most breathtaking set piece of the film. It is followed by our heroes outrunning gallons of overspilled water only to have to walk a long rope bridge. The climax finds Indy in a showdown with Mola Ram and his cult members on it. Overall, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is exhilarating entertainment. It may not be for everyone and may not be the great film that "Raiders" was, but it is a great action film on its own merits. Watch it and you'll see for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Someone make her shut up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is certainly the worst in the series. Let's see why:1. Annoying child tag-ons: undoubtedly plopped in by Lucas to gain favor by parent organizations and approved by Spielberg because he knows Kids=Money (see ET).2. Annoying Heroine: Whereas Karen Allen in "Raiders" was a Hawksian type that had no compunction about punching, bludgeoning, or blasting her way out of a scrape, Kate Capshaw is an annoyance. All she does is scream, and scream, and whine. When she does throw a punch, it's for laughs. How insulting to the character of Jones.3. Poor set design. I'm serious, the Temple of Doom looks like a Saturday Morning Fantasy crew put it together (in other words, it looks cheap because it is cheap) unlike the simplicity of such "Raiders" pieces as the Well of Souls.4. Emphasis on Plot. "Raiders" didn't need a plot. Heck, it didn't even need character development. Unfortunately, Spielberg gets too concerned in making a movie that follows standard storytelling guidelines that ruins the fun.5. Poor Score and FX. I know, I know. Trying to top the score in "Raiders" is like trying to repaint the Sistine Chapel, but even musical genius John Williams could've assembled a better score than this! Also, most of the Special Effects were totally awful (Mola Ram falling off the bridge in particular) and the sounds were mostly a remix of the ones in "Raiders" with a few other Lucasfilm ear-catchers thrown in for good measure.Overall, this really really stinks. 2 out of 5 stars. Go back to "Raiders" for a better experience.</fullReview>

These we the audience know about, might even care about. Chasing after a pack of magic emeralds in some enormous Indian temple, complete with gobs of bugs, whips and slaves, just doesn't cut it.I would give this a---*** outta **** rating, decent action and etc, but compared to the other two, not as good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is by far the weakest film of the trilogy for a few reasons.First and foremost, the screenplay is just awful. It seems Lucas and Spielberg thought they could emulate the success of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" by putting together a bunch of action sequences in disguise of an actual story. The dialog is terrible, especially from Kate Capshaw and Jonathan Ke Quan (Willie Scott and Short Round, respectively--two of the worst character names of all time).There is absolutely no chemistry between Capshaw and Ford. One of the reasons the first one worked so well was because of the romance between the two lead characters. "Indiana Jones and Temple of Doom" falls flat in this area.Sure, there are a few good action sequences, but even they don't match up to those in "Raiders of the Lost Ark". "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is another example of the typical Hollywood blockbuster--some flashy special effects and action sequences thrown together to make a quick buck. And that's unfortunate, considering the quality of the other two in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Some Light, The Best Indiana Jones Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will always find Indiana Jones the best hero in all of film. I have several movies and a TV show to back up my claim. Nothing will change my statement. For a long time, this was my favourite Indiana Jones movie. My opinion on this has changed. I still love it for the same reasons I always have, but in some ways, this is not the best one.As Indiana Jones' first adventure, he, a nightclub singer (Capshaw), and Chinese orphan (Quan) attempt to scurry away from some shady business men in a deal-gone-wrong. After being set up by their pilots and escaping from their plane right before crashing, the trio realize they in India. They learn about a rock that holds the power to a poor village and their children that are in slavery. They then make their way to a richer area in India to retrieve the rock and free the kids, where they come across horrors that they will likely not escape. While Cate Capshaw is a good actress, her character sucks. All she does is whine in bitch throughout the whole movie that is bound to annoy some viewers. I was after a while. While Short Round is a funny little character, I could understand why some of the harsher critics would find him annoying too. There are some moments that are very unrealistic, even more than the others. But they are done so well, why complain? But what I would say the biggest flaw this movie has is having the least complex story of all four movies. Crystal Skull is the worst movie that tried to have a complex story that wound up being too confusing. They should have taken the safe way out by having a lenient story like this. Come to think about it, a simple story isn't much of a flaw when looked at alone, just when compared to the others. This is the reason I would not call this the best Indiana Jones movie anymore. However, I still do think that this one does the best job in showing Indy at his strongest and why he is film's best hero. Upon entering the temple, horrors from demonic and evil rituals are unleashed, making it the scariest in the series. There is lots at stake with certain death, making you wonder if anybody can make it. Knowing Indiana Jones, you know he will find a way. In the others, he fights Nazis with little horror involved. This makes for a change in filming and more for Indy at his most heroic. This is why I think that this has the best action and adventure bits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great adventure but questionable morality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, as compared to the previous one, we progress backward from 1936 to 1935. We move across the universe from Egypt to China and India. The team is reinforced with a nice little but strong Chinese boy. The film is absolutely packed with suspense and action, and yet the film is also packed with all kinds of interesting questions though it does not provide us with all the answers, far from it. At the beginning we have the Chinese mafia of this time but the film forgets to explain that this Chinese mafia is the result of the Opium war or wars, of the control of China by the English and other western countries, and that this mafia will be quite happy with the Japanese some years later. This quite one-sided vision seems to support the idea that in China the mafia controls everything, the police, the bars, drugs and opium, the government, you name it you have it. Then in India that poor Indiana discovers and dismantles a terroristic and fascist small potentate that imposes an extreme vision of Hinduism based on human sacrifice (God knows Spielberg makes us shiver in front of this horror), the legend of five miraculous stones that would give the Indians their power back against the English, the colonizing power, and these believers have to exploit children in mines in the worst possible way and with the most unimaginable violence (God knows Spielberg insists on the inhumanity of this crime against civilization). But this seems to imply that this Hinduism is producing that kind of sectarian and dictatorial vision and action. These people must be barbarians and that is purely racist somewhere (it is true Bush will come later with his war on terror that is implying the same thing about another religion), whereas the enlightened Americans are bringing freedom (God it is so true in Iraq and Afghanistan). These people eat insects, spiders and the fresh brain of monkeys, snakes and all kinds of nice juicy animals of that type. But the worst part is the role and function of the English in all that. Their representative is sharing these beautiful banquets with the local maharajah who is a child. Then they come nearly at the end to save the day that is mostly saved anyway, and they don't even use their guns because they use Indian soldiers to do the shooting. What's more these English-loving Indian soldiers have blue turbans, whereas the barbaric slave owners and exploiters have mainly red uniforms and turbans. These red and blue are not gratuitous. But no answer again and we cannot say that the worst violence and the worst massacres in India were done by turbaned Hindu extremists but rather by the very British colonizers. This film purports for the people who don't know history, which means the majority of the audience, that the evil of this world is not the colonizing western powers but extremist Hindus and Chinese Mafiosi. That is at least an extreme lie and an unacceptable disguise, not for truth that does not exist on such subjects, but for the slightest possible objectivity. Entertaining cannot mean conveying racist and western-centered prejudices. I am sure that Spielberg can do better and has done better than that.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The self described- darkest of the series finds Indiana Jones in India uncovering a sinister scheme by the Thuggees: an evil cult who worship the goddess Kali with human sacrifices and have enslaved a remote villages children in a fortress-like mine.Temple of Doom could have easily just been a sort of rehash of Raiders, but Spielberg and Lucas choose instead to make a whole different film. In essence, Temple of Doom is really much more of a horror film, and it seems to be much more of a challenging movie than any of the other two of the series.The first thing that strikes me personally, about the film is the fact that it somehow is rated PG. This is a film, which features a supernatural ritual of removing a person?s heart, people being lowered into a pit of lava, weird voodoo dolls, etc. Literally, this film really freaks the hell out of me. Especially, the whole sequence where Indy is forced to drink the "blood of Kali Ma", and he basically becomes one of them.One main thing, I liked about the film, is that it had an entertaining opening, with Indiana Jones in a Shanghai nightclub attempting to trade the remains of Nurhaci for a large diamond with a gangster named Lao Che. It was quite a thrill. The bridge scene at the end is just a classic.However, I really just cannot stand Kate Capshaw in this film, as the reluctant night club singer, Willie Scott. ?The biggest trouble with her is the noise.? I think that would be an under-statement, all she does throughout the whole film is scream and whine. One sure way, to gain a headache.</fullReview>

The main derision that I have heard is that the stunts are too unrealistic, but honestly, all of the Indy stunts are like that. In Raiders of the Lost Ark, when Indy climbs under the truck, the stunts there were more unrealistic than any other. The storyline was fairly solid as was the acting. As for the villains, many of the antagonists minions were pretty weak I agree, but no less weak than the minions of the other Indy movies. As for the antagonist Mola Ram, he was definitely one of the best villains of the three movies. The only thing I really didn't like is how narrow-minded some of the Indian Culture was portrayed to be. I myself have been to India numerous times, and I can guarantee that no one there eats live snakes or monkey brains. Other than that, I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indiana Jones and the Racist Stereotype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The eighties were probably the golden age of the sequel, and after the immense success of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" it was inevitable that there would be at least one more entry in the Indiana Jones franchise. Strictly speaking, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is a prequel rather than a sequel, being set in 1935 whereas "Raiders" was set in 1936. Some, in fact, have claimed that this was the first film ever to be described as a prequel and have credited its producer George Lucas with inventing the term, but this is not correct. It would appear that the word was first used in the 1950s and was widely used in the seventies to describe films such as "The Godfather Part II" and "Butch and Sundance: The Early Days".Like the other episodes in the franchise there is an opening action scene which bears only a slight connection with the rest of the film. In this case the opening scene is set in Shanghai, where Indiana narrowly escapes from an evil gangster and flees on a plane. After surviving a plane crash in the Himalayas, he makes his way into India, then under British rule, together with his two companions, a nightclub singer named Willie Scott and a young Chinese boy called Short Round. Willie, it should be noted, is a woman. In the cast list she is officially listed as "Wilhelmina", but the only explanation given in the film for her masculine praenomen is "It's a stage name". (Apparently, the character was actually named after Steven Spielberg's dog)."Temple of Doom" is the only film in the original Indiana Jones trilogy in which the Nazis are not the villains. The main action mostly takes place in an underground temple controlled by the Thuggee religious cult, devotees of the goddess Kali, and tells how Indy thwarts the evil designs of the said cult, aided by a certain amount of help from Short Round, but none at all from Willie who spends most of the film screaming at the top of her voice.The film was highly controversial in India, the country in which most of the action is supposedly set, and the Indian government refused permission for it to be shot in their country. (The Indian scenes were actually filmed in Sri Lanka). Lawrence Kasdan, who had written the script for "Raiders", refused the offer to do the same for "Temple of Doom" because he disliked the storyline, which he described as "ugly and mean-spirited". Although I am not normally an advocate of political correctness, I have to admit that Kasdan and the Indian critics were right.Spielberg and Lucas have stated that the franchise was inspired by the film serials of the thirties and forties. Unfortunately, "Temple of Doom" also appears to have been inspired by some of the more reprehensible political and racial attitudes of that era. The Indian characters are all depicted either as evil or as weak and helpless, in need of protection from a gallant white hero. It is the sort of film about India that some B-movie producer might have churned out fifty years earlier, except that in 1934 the white hero would probably have been a dashing British officer rather than an American archaeologist. Racial stereotypes do not end with the Indians; the fiendish Chinese gangsters in the opening scene seem to be direct descendants of Boris Karloff's Fu Manchu.The film also gives a very misleading idea of Hinduism; any viewer not previously aware of the tenets of that religion would come to the conclusion that its practices include child slavery, black magic and human sacrifice. None of these, of course, form any part of Hinduism, and were not even practised by the Thugs. Indeed, many historians have disputed that Thuggee was a religious cult at all. Not all Thugs were worshippers of Kali; there were even some who were Muslims or Sikhs, not Hindus at all. Whatever their ostensible faith, the Thugs were motivated by greed rather than religious fanaticism, and they bore more resemblance to organised crime gangs than to a religious sect.Quite apart from its racist attitudes, there were other things I disliked about the film. It is notably darker than the other two episodes in the original trilogy, both in the literal sense- much of the action takes place in an underground cavern- and in the metaphorical, lacking their lightness of touch, sense of adventure and devil-may-care spirit. Kate Capshaw's Willie, always whining when she is not screaming, is one of the most annoying heroines in the history of the cinema, not a patch on Karen Allen's feisty Marion from "Raiders" or Alison Doody's seductively menacing Elsa from "The Last Crusade". (Capshaw- obviously forgiven for her dreadful performance- later became the second Mrs Spielberg.).Steven Spielberg later admitted that he wasn't happy with "Temple of Doom" at all, and he certainly had good cause to be dissatisfied. He has sometimes been described as the man who makes B-movies on an A-movie budget. This is perhaps unfair when one considers that he has made serious films as good as "Schindler's List", but there is a measure of truth in it as far as his adventure blockbusters are concerned. With "Temple of Doom" he appears to have spent an A-movie budget and ended up with a C-movie. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failure of the film in uneven, schizophrenic tone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to write a comment on this film for two reasons: I very distinctly remember this movie when my father took me and my younger brother to see the movie in the darkened screening room at the semi-rundown first-run theatre when I was five years old -- it's the first movie I vividly remember seeing -- and the recent viewing on DVD rental left a bitter taste as a near-disaster film in terms of weirdly uneven tone that mark it as the black sheep of the Indiana Jones franchise.It's not the dark elements of the movie that bother me. That's really fine with me. It's the strange, shrill and manic tone of the film that didn't strike the right chord with me in terms of aesthetic movie experience. I'm sure Mr. Spielberg understands this from the point of view of the dismayed audience, hence why he consider the film not very good in spite of association with George Lucas in production, which is pretty humble for an A-list director. The writing, production design and acting, except for the irritating Kate Capshaw, is good, with visual effects (despite obvious camp-art fakery) the best merit of the movie.Alternating between physical comedy and dark elements make for a jarringly uneven film leave me feeling uneasy as though I've hitched on the roller-coaster ride and wanted to get off while it's ongoing. There is a bit of unintentional racial stereotype element in the film, notably the infamous gross-out dinner sequence and voodoo that do not have any basis in reality. It's a fictional adventure movie with racist stereotypes put forth from Lucas' vivid imagination in storytelling. I'm sure George Lucas had subconsciously released the conceived racist stereotypes because he grew up watching the uncensored and unabashedly racist cartoon shorts released by Walt Disney Studio, Warner Bros and MGM. (Exhibit A: Jar-Jar in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace)That's not to say it's better to be uptight with political correct thought and attitude. I hate PC. But I understood criticism that The Temple of Doom is perhaps racist by denigrating the culture and race to condense into the adventure yarn. There's The Adventures of Tintin with racist elements as well and yet I still enjoy the classic comics by overlooking the controversial element as long as the story is involving.And the biggest problem, of course, is unnecessary gore. I don't remember my reaction or for that matter my father's reaction when we saw the movie in the screening, but I understand how incredulous the parents felt when they were duped into bringing children to see a PG-rated Indiana Jones popcorn movie only to be appalled by the dark and horrific brutality. Steve Spielberg wasn't a father at that time yet, but he wised up as soon as he became a father to understand and empathize with the point of view of dismayed and concerned parents. I give Spielberg a credit for the creation of a PG-13 category after the debacle of violent and frightening PG movies (this and Gremlin) to alleviate parental concern. I don't understand why this movie isn't re-submitted for re-rating, but I'm sure presently strict MPAA will probably give it an R instead of a PG-13 to the dismay of Spielberg, Lucas and co.It's a pity The Temple of Doom isn't artistically a good movie, despite technical achievements that won the film an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. I like dark films but this isn't one of them because of nonsensical story and intentionally absurd tone. Despite the valiant attempt to be as dark as can be on Lucas' suggestion, the film doesn't feel right at all. It is the mistaken decision to impose overall tone that completely undermine the enjoyment of the film, leaving the viewers disappointed. They would ask "why is this movie isn't as good as that first movie?" and they already know the answer.I watched the closing credit with intent to catch the name of a promising future director: David Fincher, co-credited with matte photography when he was a (very) young man. Incredible talent.** out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Wonderful Action Adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the Wonderful Family classic that is ET The Master of Film returned to the Indiana Jones series for the sequel to Raiders of The Lost Ark with a rip-roaring companion piece to Raiders of the Lost Ark but the film's tone is altogether slightly darker so younger children will need adult supervision compared to Raiders which is absolutely fine for all ages! Anyway The direction is similar to Raiders but this film moves from location to location with pristine ease and painstaking detail in the film's shot composition it really works visually more so than Raiders I adore Raiders but the visual presentation of Temple is so clearer and really visually stark and more interesting to look at because the pace is slowed down only slightly compared to Raiders but it still has that quick really breakneck pace of Raiders but it is slightly slowed only a little bit a tiny bit slower mainly for plot development a few times but it is still an excellent really different film compared to Raiders, As I say Raiders is the greatest action adventure film ever made but Temple really has a different approach to it's story the way the different plot points are introduced it really feels different and I admire that greatly well that's the brilliance of the Master of Film I guess! The Score By John Williams is altogether different we still have the iconic theme everybody knows but it is used only when appropriate but is then interspersed with all new themes for Willie Scott and Indy's relationship and Short Round Indy's new sidekick Indy and Short Round have a great relationship on screen together and it shows I hear Harrison Ford got on really well with the actor who plays Short Round who would later star in the Classic adventure movie the Goonies, back to the score the other new themes include themes for the Temple of Doom itself and the Slave Children's March is one of my many favourite individual pieces of music John Williams has composed it really captures that section of the film wonderfully the music in Africa as Indy, Short Round and Willie trek across the landscape is quite something to behold and hear I really love the End Credits Suite that combines all the themes from the film in perfect order All of John Williams's Scores have some sort of end credits suite at the end which is composed differently compared to the other variations or performances of the themes or musical identities so really listen to those end credit suite it really helps you identify each musical identification or melodic material it really is clear and catchy too! Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom does not get the attention it deserves sometimes so what if it is not exactly like Raiders so what it is a New Adventure for Indiana Jones and it is really entertaining scary funny mainly Short Round's comedy with Indy I really like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom because of the differences to Raiders and it is a great action adventure worthy of the Indiana Jones series!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly the only good Indiana Jones film because I watched it the most, it has some of the most memorable dangerous moments in the franchise. It has a good lead villain who gets what he deserves at the very end. It's got a lot of ritualistic stuff which makes it seem like an even better adventure which has a good storyline. It's truly the only good one because it has an unusual sidekick, a typical drama queen, and a very action packed beginning. The whole film is a masterpiece that people just don't understand it's value. It's the best out of the series and has the most intense moments. I give it a solid 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie doesn't get enough credit, the most underrated sequel of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the dark prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark, there are way to many haters when it comes to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Sure, it has it's flaws and is by no means the strongest movie of the Indiana Jones series. Personally I love the whole classic trilogy and it's been a very important part of my childhood. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a awesome sequel, I don't know why people complain so much about it. It's easy to notice that each film is downright brilliant yet refreshingly different from each other. With Temple of Doom by the far the darkest in the series. This is an amazing adventure with jaw dropping action, brilliant sets and exotic locales, and a darker story than the first film. Harrison Ford gives an strong performance as Indiana Jones, the rugged, tough talking archaeologist. Ford got comfortable with the character in Raiders of The Lost Ark, he completely perfected the character in Temple of Doom. He is one of my favorite actors gives us the greatest characters in movie history. Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round is lovable and has amazing chemistry with Harrison Ford, Short Round is probably my favorite sidekicks of all time. The leading lady, Willie, is a typical damsel in distress, who spends the movie screaming and complaining. John Williams' music is also at it's best. He even received an Academy Award nomination despite already being nominated for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark. The film did win an Oscar for it's visual effects instead Ghostbusters won which, when viewed today, seem a little bit outdated, while Temple of Doom on the other hand looks just as good now as when it was released in 1984. From start to finish the film is filled with tons of memorable moments. This movie is pretty much impossible not to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream And Scream Again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although undoubtedly the worst of the trilogy by some way, IJATTOD is still harmless fun with some good action sequences and the cliffhanger bit with the crocodiles at the end is worth waiting for. This one is probably the most politically correct out of the trilogy as well seeing as it involves children being used as slaves. It has its themes set firmly with adolescence and Indy here is seen as kind of a role model, a grumpy one at that and his relationship with Short Round gives the film its heart. It too is arguably the most violent of three with some pretty unfriendly scenes for a family movie, this makes it darker than Raiders and Crusade. But this does not really account for much as the whole premise is a bit dull and Kate Capshaw screams a bit to much for my liking. Harrison Ford too seems to walk through his Indy role and the kid from The Goonies plays, well, basically the kid from the Goonies again minus the gadgets! 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the action sequences in this movie seem more frantic than the Raiders of The Lost Ark or The Last Crusade, the domination of them is to cover a weakness in not only the script but the heroine. Kate Capshaw does not thrill me in this role here. I think she is the weakest actress in the series. Unfortunately, she is the most dominate woman in any of the films appearing more than any other which sinks this film to ordinary.Harrison Ford is pretty much his usual Indiana. A lot of the scenes were shot inside a massive cave complex which detracts from the film as well. This turns out to be Spielbergs bridge from the first to third film much like The Empire Strikes Back was for George Lucas in the Star Wars series. While your heroes are here &amp; there is plenty of action, it leaves you a little flat from the first film.Out of the films in this series, this one is by far the weakest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just watched this movie for the first time in 13 years, I was wondering if the experience would be like many of my other movie experiences (meaning that it isn't quite what I remember from childhood). It wasn't however. While I found the film just as entertaining as the other two Indiana Jones thrillers, I was just as disturbed and disgusted by the sacrifice sequences as I was at the age of 9. Once again, I was thrilled by the score, but I think the best piece, and my favorite will always be Short Round. The humor of this small pint brings a contrast to the film that I think it badly needs. All in all, a good entertaining romp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK adventure film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas and Steven Spielberg take Indiana Jones on a much darker adventure in the sequel to the smash hit Raiders of the Lost Ark. This film seems to be the least popular entry in the series. Its efforts to top Raiders are apparent in the overuse of gross out scenes with bugs instead of snakes, as well as a few over-the-top (but still fun) action scenes.Doom has exciting action scenes, and Amrish Puri is an entertaining (if a bit one dimensional) bad guy. No one can make the word "welcome" sound more evil! Possibly the best parts of Doom were the mine cart chase and the final rope bridge scene. The mine cart chase was done so well in terms of staging, lighting, etc. that you don't even stop and think "why on earth did these people bother to build a roller-coaster?" I would say the rope bridge scene is arguably better than Raider's finale because Jones actually defeats the bad guys, whereas in Raiders the bad guys would have killed themselves with or without Indy. On a technical level this film is top notch, I would not expect less from Spielberg or Lucas. Ford injured his back while filming and Spielberg was forced to work with his stunt doubles for a few weeks (possibly months). After Ford recovered, Spielberg had to go back and film close-ups for the scene where Jones fights Pat Roach, the big guy in the temple. I have to say Spielberg edited this sequence perfectly, as there were no scenes where I could tell Indiana Jones was actually Vic Armstrong, Harrison's stunt double. The sets were also just as amazing if not better than Raiders' sets; the big Temple Chamber was the most impressive set in the movie, and possibly the entire series. You would never guess that Pankot palace was just a matte painting either.The film begins with an excellent action sequence in a nightclub in Shanghai, but from there the film's flaws start to appear. Most of the characters in this film are just not particularly likable or interesting. We are introduced to Jones' new girlfriend, Willie Scott (played by Spielberg's future wife Kate Capshaw). Scott is a spoiled brat, not funny or charming like Marion in Raiders. Her constant complaining makes you want to press the mute button on the remote control. I never thought the Indy from Raiders would like this kind of woman. The romance in this movie feels forced. Despite all of Willie's whining, there are a few genuinely funny moments, like the homage to the scene in Raiders when Indy shoots the Egyptian guy with the big sword. Only this time, when Indy reaches for his gun he remembers he lost it in China, making for a very funny awkward moment.Then we have Jones' kid sidekick Short Round. I don't think Shorty is in the movie other than to lighten the mood. He only has a bunch of "oh isn't he cute" scenes. There is sentimentality between Indy and Shorty that feels forced, like the romance with Willie. I think the film makers were uncomfortable with the darkness of the film so they wanted to inject more humor. I'd be interested to know if the character of Shorty was Spielberg's idea. Now normally it is OK to have a character like this, as long as there are interesting characters to make up for them. Jones had interesting relationships with Belloq and Marion in Raiders, and with his father in Last Crusade, but sadly there is nothing like that in Doom. One could argue that Indy's character goes from a selfish treasure hunter to a more noble hero, but unfortunately the transition wasn't really essential to the plot, nor was there a discernible moment of transition. There was never any point where I thought Indy would just take the stones for himself and leave the slave children with the evil cult. The biggest problem for me was that the plot was not quite involving enough, largely due to a weak macguffin. Indy embarks on a quest to find the magic Sankara stones and free children who have been enslaved by the Thuggee cult. Unfortunately we never find out what these stones can actually do (so they glow, big deal). We have to take Mola Ram's word that these stones will empower the cult to rule the world. They are overshadowed by the black magic and the child slaves so they sort of get lost in the mix of things. The plot is progressed by coincidences and accidents. For example, Jones doesn't have to uncover any clues to lead him to the stones (except for a vague inscription on a wall), he just stumbles upon them when he accidentally finds a secret passage. I know I'll come off as a monster, but freeing children is just not a very interesting thing for someone like Indiana Jones to do. It comes off as a cheap technique to get the audience to root for the good guys. I think the writers felt they needed to give him a more moral objective that would really make the audience feel satisfied, because the stones certainly wouldn't do that by themselves.Incidentally this film is filled with stereotypes and inaccuracies that have been perpetuated since Gunga Din. Since when have Voodoo dolls been a part of Hinduism? All of the Indiana Jones films are filled with stereotypes but Doom takes the cake in the "ignorance" category. Even the good Indians are somewhat childlike and primitive in their belief that Indiana Jones was sent by their god to save them. In conclusion, Temple of Doom is an entertaining action film, but it does not stand out as a great accomplishment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM managed to avoid the pitfalls that made RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK just a tad less than it should've been. It's "darker," which is a big plus, and some of the more elaborate sequences, like the opening ballroom shootout, are even better done than the action scenes in the first film- and more original in conception, too (as a good many of the action scenes in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK were lifted almost shot-for-shot from the serials the movie emulated). Kate Capshaw was never lovelier, and Short Round harked back to the kid sidekicks that were sometimes found in the early adventure serials. In this case, "darker" was better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the worst of the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"the raiders of the lost ark" was a huge commercial and critical success in 1981. So it was almost inevitable that it was followed by a sequel. This sequel was "Indiana Jones and the temple of doom" and sadly this is a rather poor sequel. If Steven Spielberg takes back the good old recipes that made Indiana Jones's success (exotic sceneries, entertaining pursuits, object with magical powers), on the other hand, his movie focuses a bit too much on the bloody and the unhealthy and it spoils considerably the movie. Sometimes the movie verges on the ridiculous. As a consequence, it makes the adventure movie its attraction. There's also a problem as far as the performance is concerned: if Harrison Ford is always charismatic, his partner Kate Capshaw is absolutely unbearable. A disappointing follow-up and one of Spielberg's worst movies. Fortunately, he'll catch up with the next section of Indiana Jones' adventures: "Indiana Jones and the last crusade" (1989).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weakest of the trilogy ? but still enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When escaping from a crime lord, Indy, nightclub singer Willie Scott and Short Round are involved in a plane crash which leaves them stranded in India. The locals are convinced that they have come to recover the village's sacred stone and children - both of which have been taken by the human-sacrificing Thuggee cult. They journey to the local palace to investigate - only to find more than they bargained for.This is the second in the Indiana Jones series, but is a prequel to the action of Raiders of the Lost Ark - and it many ways it does feel like a step backwards. The story is a very far fetched and is hard to believe, this was the same as Raiders but it is more obvious here. The mysticisms involved makes it seem more distant than the world of archaeology. But what the problem really is is the lack of fun.With Raiders and The Last Crusade that was a tremendous feeling of fun and enjoyment that ran through the whole film that made it really easy to dispel belief. Here much of the fun has been replaced by gore - making it less enjoyable. Yes, sometimes the sense of humour does surface but only occasionally. The tone is not as self mocking as Raiders was and it makes you feel like it's taking itself too seriously perhaps?Ford is great as he always is in simple hero characters and does the jokes and the action really well - his lines aren't great when he has to be sincere (`Yes, now I see the power of the stones'!) but most of it is good. Kate Capshaw (must have been sleeping with the director!) is terrible - Raiders' female character was strong and feisty, here Capshaw merely runs round screaming and complaining about breaking nails - it could have been comedy relief but it's merely annoying. And of course, having learnt from ET, Spielberg shoves a cute kid in there. In fairness most of the time Jonathon Ke Quan isn't that bad and is quite good - but when he's putting karate moves on 6ft men you just think to yourself `what's he doing in this film?'. The baddies are less well formed that the other films - they are merely native savages who must be dealt with.The film is saved by the great set pieces - be it the opening club scene, the life raft or the great chase through the mines - there is plenty of great action here. Unfortunately it's the bit between the action (ie the story) that has been forgotten.Overall a disappointment - but Spielberg making mistakes is still better than many other film makers going full belt. A competent adventure film.</fullReview>

This time he is trying to free young Indian children from an evil cult which is using them as slave-labor during the mid-1930s. The screenplay is somewhat disjointed and some of the material is dark and disturbing. Harrison Ford is good as usual, but Steven Spielberg's relentless direction and his ability to turn the film into a 1 hour and 58 minute thrill ride saves the questionable material. Overall a good film, but probably the weakest in the popular series. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good second film, not as good as the first or third films, but still a very good one from Steven Spielberg. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) this time is not involved with German Nazis or in amongst the war, he is in India searching for sacred stones belonging to a village. Accompanied by the squeamish Wilhelmina 'Willie' Scott (Kate Capshaw, Spielberg's wife) and Short 'Shorty' Round (introducing Jonathan Ke Quan) he must go to Pankot Palace, where there is supposed to be a Temple (of Doom) where the villains stole the village's Sankara stone, which helps them get their food and water and other stuff. So he is going there to find the stones, and also free the many children that they stole from the parents. What follows is some stuff that small children may find scary, including the villain Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) who can take out men's hearts, and places people in a special cage to be lowered into the deadly pit. At one point, Indiana himself is made a villain when he drinks the blood of the God they worship, but he is revived and they get all the children out, and escape in an exciting train cart chase, oh, and collapse a wood and rope bridge. Also starring Roshan Seth as Chattar Lal, Philip Stone as Captain Phillip Blumburtt, Roy Chiao as Lao Che, A View to a Kill's David Yip as Wu Han, Ric Young as Kao Kan and Dan Aykroyd as Earl Weber. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Music for John Williams, and it was won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Sound. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Harrison Ford was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Indiana Jones was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains.

Parts 1 and 3 had Indy (Harrison Ford) battling the Nazis trying to find a Biblical relic. This one has him accompanied by nightclub singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and homeless boy Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan), battling East Indian cultists who have stolen a sacred stone. As far as I could tell, Willie did nothing but complain about everything (was that supposed to be funny?), and Short Round was...well, you know how some kids are.

		<fullReview>Despite the attempts to make this film a great sequel, they ended up with a tragic try to make another Indiana Jones movie. Let me tell some of the problems I had with this film.*SOME SPOILERS AHEAD*SPOILERS* 1.-The opening scene-it was okay until Indy jumped out the window, into the car which is being drived by TEN YEAR OLD!! 2.-It just didn't fit Indiana Jones, going into a jungle was okay, but some of the things he did...just wasn't Indy 3.-The Plane-After the pilots jump out of the plane, Indy, the kid, and the girl(I haven't seen the movie in about year so I forget their names except for Indy),jump out with and inflatable raft and use it as a parachute. And they land safely on a SHALLOW stream below... I know some things are stupid and I can put up with them but THAT?!?!. 4.-The interactions-I found the girl and the boy extremely obnoxious, and although Ford was excellent as Indy, despite his failed attempts, the other actors just could not act. 5.-the sacrifice-Once Indy finds the cult in a secret passageway in the mansion he's in(sounds a bit kiddish, but that's okay, I can put up with that). He then witnesses a sacrifice made by the cult in which the leader pulls out the heart of another man with his bare hands, and then the man lives long enough to be put into a cage and lowered into a pit of burning lava, all the meanwhile still livin(WHOA, hold on here, now that's just plain stupid AND kiddish). And yet they're making this more of a kiddy movie, especially seeing a ten year old is Indy's sidekick, and now the whole heart thing. Yet they're violent enough to show the blood squeezing out of the cult leaders hand as he holds it high in the air, meanwhile the heart's still pumping!! Either kid movie or not, make your choice. 6. The mine ride-perhaps one of the dumbest parts, I'd say the third dumbest part compared to the heart and the plane parts. First the stuff they do in these mine carts is just so unrealistic. I won't even go into it it's so dumb. 7.-I could go on and on-I have a feeling by now you want me to stop before I make my comment on the bridge climax scene, but I'll tell you some things of what greatly dissapointed me. My grandmother is almost 80 years old, she is a huge fan of the Indiana Jones series, She probably is hoping she'll be alive still when number 4 comes out, but however, she really dislikes this one, I think for the same reasons as me. I grew up on these movies whenever I'd go to her old house, I always watched number 1 and 3, 3 is still my favorite one.But I was never allowed to see temple of doom, because it was too violent. When I got older though, I finally got to see it. I wasn't exactly let down at first, but I was alot younger and well, it's like watching superman, he's the big hero. But as I got older, boy the older the more stupid it became. So I just want to say to all Indy fans, if you're die hard fans, well you've probably already seen this seeing it's been around for about 15 years I think, but if you've just become a fan, and can't wait to see the sequel....You're going to be a little let down just to warn you. So all in all, I'd have to give this 2 1/2 out of 5 stars. I hope number 4(which they are planning on making right now)lives up to the 1st and third movies, because those are the greats, and they should be shown a little more respect</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If THE TEMPLE OF DOOM suffers from anything then it suffers from a condition called " Sequelitis " . It's a condition that is in no way serious but does show that in order to infect the host ( Aka the cinema audience) the carrier ( Aka Mr Hollywood producer ) gets into a stupor of not doing anything , instead the carrier takes all the best ideas of an earlier movie and gives the host more of the same . In effect we have a movie that does not dare be different and why should it if the previous clone made the carrier a fortune at the box office . And to be fair THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is exciting and funny in parts . The problem is if you didn't like RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK you won't love this movieI've always thought Spielberg was overrated and when this movie was released he was regarded in some quarters as the greatest director of all time - A laughable assumption . The film contains some impressive set pieces but they would have been more impressive if the director had bothered to do a bit of trimming like the cart chase which goes on for too long . This especially becomes obvious when we're treated ( Though I doubt if " treated " is the correct word ) of a close up of Kate Capshaw screaming into the camera . This over the top humour reminded me of Spielberg's 1941 which is a very good example of spectacular humour not working . I should also point out that with the exception of JAWS I have always found John Williams to b a very average composer , and if some people consider this 1984 offering to be by " the greatest director of all time " then why was I unimpressed by the cinematography ? It should also be mentioned that if you were upset by the amount of violence in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK you'll also be upset by the amount of violence here but that's to be expected since this movie suffers from sequelitis</fullReview>
