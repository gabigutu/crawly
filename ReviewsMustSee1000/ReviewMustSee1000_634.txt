		<shortDescription>?Evil Angel' is a fitting tribute to the Chamberlain's and the death of baby Azaria.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is any Australian that I feel sorrier for, it would have to be Lindy Chamberlain. Her compelling story is one of the more famous court cases in Australian history. Also known as ?A cry in the dark', ?Evil Angel' shows how divided the Australian public really were towards this case and how the media can manipulate a story, by favouring just one side of a story that they believe is the whole truth. When I hear the cry ?The dingo's got my baby', it brings back memories from along time ago.During a camping trip, an infant disappears from her family's tent. When the child's mother spies a dingo nearby, authorities launch a frantic search, but all they find is a torn, bloodied garment. The press, distressed by the mother's seeming "lack of emotion", and suspicious of her religious beliefs, begin to accuse her of murdering the baby. The sentiment against her begins to grow, and soon the whole continent is talking about the case. Despite the lack of evidence, the woman is imprisoned; although investigators eventually re-examine her story, the damage is done: the innocent mother's relationship with her husband has been irreparably destroyed. This is the documentary style film adaptation of the true story of Lindy and Michael Chamberlain.This film has some truly amazing performance in it. Meryl Streep is a wonderful actress, but in this film she does so much that you just have to like. She really becomes ?Lindy' and embodies what she actually went through. I remember reading that Streep had to have speaking classes, so she could sound ?Australian', which she does very well. But it is her persona I like the most. Streep performance as Chamberlain is so flawless, as she shows no emotion when she is going in and out of court, which is what the real Lindy Chamberlain did. It is understandable that the general public would think that Lindy is guilty of murder, which is again testament to Streep's masterful performance. However in court Lindy is visibly upset, when she has to recall the night a dingo took her baby.The other performance which is most noteworthy is that of Sam Neill. While Neill has gone on to do many big performances in Hollywood blockbusters such as ?Jurassic Park' and the Aussie favourite ?The Dish', this is one film I continue to remember him from. I like how we see that Michael is visibly distressed by the whole court case scenario, with him stumbling through the interrogation when he is on the stand. It is also most taxing on the couple's personal life, with Michael the first one to crack.Yet there are some famous Australian cameos from many actors in ?Evil Angel'. Look at these for names; Maurie Fields, Charles ?Bud' Tingwell, John Howard, Frankie J. Holden, Mark Little, Mark Mitchell, Glenn Robbins and Kym Gyngell. All of them are well known personalities in Australian TV, and it is of great significance to this story to have such great fame among the cast of this film.Director/Screenwriter of ?Evil Angel' Fred Schepisi does justice to this story in many ways. Firstly, Schepisi and co screenwriter Robert Caswell stuck very close to the story written by John Bryson. Then Schepisi directs this film in quite a unique way. He points the story in many ways, showing the Chamberlain's in one shot, then to the media, then to the general public. This amount of change gives the film great variety, which is good. If it was fixated with just the Chamberlains, this movie could have had major problems. I also like the many shots of Australia that this film shows off. Having this tragedy take place in the Northern territory, certainly gave that state and its famous attraction Ayers Rock (Uluru) some sort reputation, as this film does too. Yet there are some excellent shots in Alice Springs, Darwin and in the Chamberlain's home-town (for some time) of Mt. Isa in Queensland. This is good work of cinematographer Ian Baker. So with all those factors taken into consideration, this film looks deep into what it must be like to go through the loss of a baby child, taken by a wild animal. It also a fascinating insight into what the media can do to turn a story and how merciless people can be towards someone that in all possibility could be ?innocent'. Although it is 22 years since this horrible event has happened, I realise that Chamberlain's lives were, and probably never will be the same again. Michael and Lindy had to go through the most painful of divorces, and their children had to go grow up with a large amount of innuendo attached to their lives. I am thankful that Lindy Chamberlain was released from prison, after serving three and a half years of a life imprisonment sentence for a crime which she did not commit.CMRS gives ?Evil Angel': 4 (Very Good Film)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent look at 'justice' and the media</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them. As I watched this film, made in 1988, in 1999, I thought I was watching the O.J. Simpson debacle (although I have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation).The Australian news media, if this movie is to be believed, devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought. It was scary to see the scenes of invasive, swarming media hordes, ridiculous accounts of half-truths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society.Equally appalling is the media's depiction as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case. I do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case (the accused are Seven-Day Adventists).Today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important.Streep is excellent as usual, and this is the best I've ever seen Sam Neill. The Aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Emotional Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extremely-powerful based-on-a-true story film that can be infuriating to watch. I say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people, in this case an innocent Australian couple charged with killing their baby.Meryl Streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but I thought Sam Neill was just as good. Let's just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for Streep because she had to learn an Australian accent. (She learned it so well I had trouble understanding her in parts.)Without giving anything away, all I can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Cry in the Dark" is a masterful piece of cinema, haunting, and incredibly though provoking. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who, in 1980, witnessed a horrific sight, seeing her 3-month-old baby being brutally taken from their family's tent, while camping on the Austrailian outback. Azaria (the baby) was never seen again, and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world. Meryl Streep does immaculate justice to the role of Lindy, as she always does. But the one thing that helps "A Cry in the Dark" never fall flat is the brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case, tears are brought to the eyes. The concept is nothing less then terrifying, and afterwards you are left haunted, but also inspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>apparently, you can't be a Seventh Day Adventist in a media-centric society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw "A Cry in the Dark", I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw it, I was shocked at what it portrayed. When I saw it a second time in an Australian Cinema class, I realized a second point: communication issues. You see, when a dingo snatched Lindy Chamberlain's (Meryl Streep) baby, she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were grief-stricken but didn't show it. As Seventh Day Adventists, they believed that God willed this to happen, and so they couldn't mourn it. But when people all over Australia saw their lack of sadness, everyone started believing that Lindy did it herself.The point is, the wrong message got communicated to the public, and it turned people against Lindy. Even though this was a pure accident, it still happened. It may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media, regardless of any media outlet's political views.As for the performances, Streep does a very good job with an Australian accent (no surprise there), and Sam Neill is equally great. You will probably get blown away just by what you see here. Definitely one of Fred Schepisi's best movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie overall, but the acting is outstanding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meryl Streep was incredible in this film. She has an amazing knack for accents, and she shows incredible skill in this film overall. I really felt for her when Lindy was being persecuted. She was played realistically, too. She got cranky, upset, and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt. I didn't expect much from the film initially, but I really got interested in it, and the movie is based on a real person and real events. It turned out to be better than I had anticipated. Sam Neill was also outstanding; this is the best work I've seen from him, and I've really liked him in other movies (The Piano, for example). I gave the film a 7, but if I could rate just the acting, I'd give the it a 9.5, and a perfect 10 for Streep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great trial film, stunning photography, and the one of the best Sam Neill films yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unqualified "10." The level of writing and acting in this Australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of "old" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neill matches Streep line for line, and take for take -- it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best, notwithstanding the intensity of his role. This engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama, portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms. The movie -- which won several top awards in Australia -- boasts not only a superlative cast and director, but wonderful and authentic Australian locales. It proves that people are the same the world over. And, after all these years, people still delight in repeating the famous Streep line, accent and all: "A dingo ate moy baby!" Including that imp "Elaine Benis" on "Seinfeld."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leaves every viewer shaken to the core, Streep's best performance ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) have just welcomed a baby girl, Azaria. As Seventh Day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day and soon have Azaria dedicated to God at their church, with their two older boys looking on. Michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to Ayer's Rock, one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of Australia. Not being wealthy, the family camps near the site. After a wonderful first day, Lindy puts baby Azaria to sleep in one of the tents. Suddenly, she hears Azaria crying. As Lindy rushes to the tent, a dingo dog is just exiting, shaking his head. The baby is gone and soon, so is the dingo. Although the entire camp looks for the baby, she is not found. Concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child, the Chamberlains struggle to accept God's decision and go on with their lives. But, unfortunately, the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that Lindy murdered the baby. She is subsequently arrested and put on trial. How could this happen? This is a great depiction of real events that shows how "mob rule" is not a figment of the imagination. The entire country turns against the Chamberlains, in part because they are seen as odd. Streep gives her best performance ever as the complex Lindy, whose own strong-willed demeanor works against her every step of the way. Neill, likewise, does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused Michael. The cast is one of the largest ever, with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into Lindy's case. The costumes, scenery, script, direction and production are all top of the line. If you have never seen or heard of this film, remedy that straight away. It is not a far cry from reality to say that this "Cry" should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another example of Meryl Streep's enormous talent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know she's been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents, but she nails the accent every time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that smart. But that just makes Streep's work all the more remarkable. I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations. About the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things. I don't know much about Australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story. I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday. And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues. A pretty good film. A bit different. Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a true story of an Australian couple wha are charged with murder when their infant child disappears. Meryl Streep is excellent, as always, and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isn't particularly likable.The media frenzy that surrounded this case in Australia is reminiscent of the Sam Sheppard murder case in Ohio during the 50's. These real-life situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled. I well remember the Cleveland Plain Dealer running a huge headline stating "Why Isn't Sam Sheppard in Jail?". The prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure, and Sheppard was tried and convicted. Only after years in jail was he exonerated.I love movies which tell a true story, do it in an interesting way, and make an important point in the process. This is one of those movies. Other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include "Hurricane", "The Thin Blue Line", and "Breaker Morant". In particular, the latter is another Australian film which is highly recommended.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>insightful study of a modern media frenzy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The facts in the case of an Australian couple persecuted by a headline-hungry press should be familiar to viewers of the CBS news show 60 Minutes, which aired the story (not coincidentally) just before this film was released. Both versions recount the disappearance during a weekend camping trip of Lindy and Michael Chamberlain's infant daughter, and the subsequent three-ring media circus which led to wild (and totally fabricated) accusations of cult fanaticism and ritual sacrifices, and eventually to a murder conviction for the bereaved mother. But the big screen dramatization has more in mind than just a strong reprimand for misguided journalism ethics. The reporters covering the case are shown to be more ferocious than the wild dingo dog claimed by the Chamberlain's to have killed their child, but the screenplay wisely implicates public opinion as well, which condemned Lindy Chamberlain to prison for not having a telegenic personality (the same trait might also lose her sympathy with moviegoers, despite another challenging performance by Meryl Streep). Director Fred Schepisi presents the story as a straightforward, undemonstrative docudrama, letting the cold-blooded courtroom drama speak for itself, with a pair of excellent actors (Streep and Sam Neill) taking up the slack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Following: I picked up the book "Evil Angels" when it first came out knowing nothing of the case. Just to give the press and the Austrialian people a break here, I was quite far into it before I began to question the Chamberlain's guilt. The author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did. John Bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors (and picked up by the press) of the arterial spray, the actelone (??) plates, Dr. James Cameron's certainty that the collar was cut with scissors, that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up, bloody hand print, etc. all quite convincingly. After all, these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie, and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn't apparent to me at all. It was also highly technical evidence, difficult for a layman to understand. To this point, beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials, hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human; people didn't believe it was possible. The public was suspicious of the Seventh Day Adventists, whose origins made them appear to be a cult, and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt. Were it not for dedicated, selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony, finding Azaria's clothes later would not have been enough to get Lindy out of jail. The book shook me for that reason, and I've been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone's guilt ever since (excepting OJ of course). I was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don't think it could have been done better. I've always liked Sam, who I could identify with completely, and Meryl was perfect as always. Beautiful photography, haunting music. I think it's not only a very good, but a very important, movie. Too bad it didn't receive more publicity at the time it was released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Meryl Streep fan. I feel she is so versatile. This is just another character where she shows her versatility. I don't think the role of Lindy Chamberlain was an easy one, nor Michael Chamberlain for that matter. Meryl Streep and Sam Neil both did an INCREDIBLE job playing those roles.This is a very sad story. I couldn't even imagine having to going through what Lindy had to go through after losing a baby. As if losing the baby wasn't enough. This movie shows the power of media. As soon as people start talking the whole story escalates. Everything went out of control. I find it so sad how everyone has to jump on the bandwagon, and this mom went to jail because of it. I know that with certain murder trials I have had quite a strong opinions of what I believe is true. So I guess this is exactly the same thing, part of our human nature.I found the beginning of the movie a bit slow, but from the time Azaria was taken, I couldn't take my eye away from the screen. I was too emotionally involved. I found how they kept showing snippets of the general public to be very effective. It was interesting to see how everyone has their opinion, in the beginning silly things like the name Azaria means sacrifice in the wilderness, and eventually it all turns into a hate for Lindy. People celebrated when she got convicted. This is a really sad, but great movie. The movie left me with a lot of things to think about, about human nature, media etc etc. Most definitely a tearjerker, but I think one of those are good every now and then. Knowing that this is based on a true story just makes it that much sadder...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a solid movie sending many significant social messages with a towering performance from Streep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Best remembered by cinephiles as the film won Meryl Streep a Cannes BEST ACTRESS trophy and is among one of her 19 Oscar-nominated performances, A CRY IN THE DARK is a faithful adaptation of a sensational true story in Australia, about Lindy Chamberlain (Streep), a mother of three, and her parson husband Michael (Neill), the former is accused of murdering her newborn baby daughter during a camping trip in Ayers Rock in 1980, while she claims the baby is snatched by a dingo, and the latter is charged as an accessory. Now this case is already cleared as their convictions have been overturned in 1988 when new key evidence emerges.Before watching the movie, I have no idea how the story will wind up, all I know is that it is a thorny case of whether a mother murders her own child or not, so I conjecture it would straddle the key issue of the mother's innocence, but director Fred Schepisi (SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION 1993, 6/10) gives a firm hand in exerting Lindy's innocence, and vigilantly indicts the media's hullabaloo and hyper coverage, the spuriousness lies in the forensic system and the public's collective impressionability maliciously based on mislead first impression and personal prejudice. The Chamberlains are Seventh-Day Adventists, the tragedy and its segueing emotional toll also affect their beliefs, not to mention the vicious allegations of their cultish sacrifice, especially for Michael, who implores God for a reason to take away their daughter, cries out that hell can't be worse than this when they are on trial for a egregious but fictitious crime, his unraveling is perceptibly characterised by a blond Sam Neill. Running parallel to Michael's deterioration, Meryl's Lindy is the backbone of the whole myth, she is not a grieving mother who is all teary-eyed and rueful of her ephemeral inattention, she is tougher than her husband, not intend to indulge in grievance as life must go on, so in front of the camera, she seems aloof, withheld, a shade indignant, which generates a negative impression among the spectators, when malign rumours run amok, she tries to right the falsehood with more media involvement which is sardonically a wishful thinking. I'm no expert of accent, but it is swell to watch Meryl articulate a New Zealand accent (Lindy is New Zealand born in real life) without any feigned effort betrayed. Here Meryl shines magnificently all through to be unfathomable and detached, even during the most pulverising point, she is resolutely staunch, and her scenes in the courtroom are paradigm of balancing heart-rending outburst with constrained implosion, it is OK to being wronged, it is not the end, since she doesn't kill her baby, there is no guilty conscience exuded as all the onlookers are eagerly expecting in front of their televisions. Aesthetically the film is more in line with a solid TV movie sending many significant social messages, but there are way too many gratuitous reaction shots of bystanders thrust every now and then, as they can hardly have any saying versus the final verdict, it serves only as a repeated reminder of how ignorant is the public and how easily they can be influenced by a manufactured national hoopla. It seems that Schepisi pushes fairly too hard this time, otherwise, the film remains comparatively relatable and if you adore Meryl Streep, you should not let it slip through your fingers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Chamberlain's Vs. Australia and Media Scrutiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense. Based on the book "Evil Angels" and titled so in its Australian release, A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch. It presents a scenario that's all too real for us in America: the witch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target.Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who didn't play the sympathy card, and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn't kill her own child. The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece. And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as ever, even when her husband Michael was falling apart.This stance, of course, is the power of strength, as unsympathetic as it may look like, and people happen to react strongly to that. They want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn, not sit there and look blank. People don't understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations. Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold, but not unfeeling woman, one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to, or the Chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that. Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news-media. They'll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Australian screenwriter, producer and director Fred Schepisi's seventh feature film which he wrote with Australian screenwriter Robert Caswell (1946-2006), is inspired by real events which took place in Australia in 1980. It premiered in Australia, was shot on locations in Australia and is an Australia-United States co-production which was produced by producer Verity Lambert. It tells the story about a thirty-one-year-old Australian mother named Alice Lynne Murchison Chamberlain.Distinctly and subtly directed by Australian filmmaker Fred Schepisi, this quietly paced and somewhat fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main characters' point of view, draws a judicial portrayal of an Australian father named Michael Chamberlain who went with his wife, their sons and their daughter named Azaria to a city called Mount Isa (1923) in the state of Queensland, Australia and how a baby coat and inventions caused a persecution of a family.

Lives lost, families torn apart, special moments lost, characters tainted ....yet the truth revealed itself in the end. Certainly brings hope in the end, although sad that a number of events had to occur before realizing it. A strong message and reality that the media has the power to control and influence what and how we are subjected to their portrayal of events. A good representation of characters and sequence of events. As a viewer, you cannot be watching this movie without being subjected to the horror the character of the mom and rest of the family had to endure.

		<fullReview>This true story of a mother losing her baby to a wild animal (Dingo) whilst on vacation has been told for many years. At the beginning we believe it was the Dingo however as the days went on many believed it to be the mother. I thoroughly enjoyed the unknown of whether the mother, played by Meryl Streep, killed her own baby or if the Dingo ate the baby.I found it surprising that I had even a glimpse of wishful thinking and hope, for the mother, that the baby was miraculously found (even after being missing for a month). Of course this was impossible however the idea of losing a baby of a few months old is just too unbearable to comprehend.We notice how media changes the thoughts of many people, as the ones who originally believe she is innocent convert their opinions to believe she is guilty. On the side line I feel "shame" when I watched the movie however I am probably the same as those people with many other instances in my life today, with my opinion of a country, person, nationality changing from watching a movie, the news or even a short clip. Our lives and opinions are highly influenced by media subconsciously.A story being told and heard is never the same as watching the story from the victim's point of view where we are then able to feel and see what they went to and get another side to the story. Seeing the struggle that the mother and father had to go through was very challenging and it brought out emotions within myself. Even though finding remains of the baby in the middle of the desert is a devastating occurrence, it was in fact a blessing in this case as it was the key to the mother's freedom. Humanity strives for freedom, however she will never fully be free with the loss of a loved one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A contemporary, and classic, tale of injustice.Evil Angels, aka A Cry in the Dark, depicts the famous case of Azaria Chamberlain, a baby killed by a dingo near Ayers Rock / Uluru in 1980. Due to the sensationalist, libelous and slanderous nature of the Australian media and the evidence-manufacturing abilities of the Northern Territory Police the mother of the baby, Lindy Chamberlain, was charged with the baby's murder. What follows is a frustrating and harrowing ordeal, for the accused and for the viewer, as you are lead through the travesty that was the court case.Many themes are covered, none of which show Australian society in a positive light. Shows just how despicable the Australian media are - sadly, they're even worse now (95% of what you see or read in Australian media is sensationalized bs). Shows the incompetence, even corruption, of Australia's police forces, particularly in the Northern Territory in the 1980s. Shows how the media can influence a trial, and how far-from-optimal the jury system is. How the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict is beyond me.Also shows how the media get the average yobbo caught up in someone else's affairs - the trial had nothing to do with them.Great performance by Meryl Streep in the lead role. She totally nails the accent (which is more than one can say for most Hollywood actors faking an Australian accent) and seems immersed in the role. She well deserved her Oscar nomination.Sam Neill is OK as Michael Chamberlain. The bit-part Australian actors often leave a lot to be desired, however, overdoing the redneckness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a true story, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) loses her baby to a dingo while camping near Ayers Rock in Australia. She and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) would go through an odyssey of lies and innuendos leading to their conviction in the murder of their child.The story moves along quite well with the two stellar leads. When I rewatched it recently, I saw the realism of the court case and the gossip that goes along with a celebrity case. I didn't really care that much about O J Simpson when it happened. But I had some time during the Casey Anthony case, and the media circus is so close to this movie. All those little real people inserts in the movie just hit the nail on the head.I also love the performances of Neill and Streep. I love when the husband started to break down. I love that after the conviction, Streep tells the guards that Neill is going to fall. I love all their interplay. The one thing I would change is to not show the dingo in the tent when it happened. I would plant a little doubt in the mind of the audience. It would cause a little bit of unease especially in the beginning. Other than that, this is perfectly made.</fullReview>

Lindy is convinced that a native Dingo(a sort of wild dog) grabbed and killed Azaria, but the police and public don't believe her, since they never heard of such behavior by a dingo, and so the Chamberlains find themselves arrested and charged with their daughter's murder. They would be tried and later convicted, though that would be later overturned, and they would eventually be exonerated.Fine performances by the leads, and good direction by Fred Shepisi make this a memorable and interesting tragic tale of a rush to judgment by both the press and public, a situation still relevant today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving film with brilliant acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was one of the most intriguing mysteries of the twentieth century. On 17 August 1980, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain were on a family camping trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock), when their nine-week-old daughter, Azaria, disappeared. The couple maintained that she had been taken by a dingo, but circumstantial evidence, which included Lindy's confrontational personality and the family's religious beliefs, led to the perception within Australia that Azaria had been murdered by her mother. As many readers will know, Lindy was convicted of the crime after a trial that received unprecedented media coverage (rivalled only by Madeleine McCann's disappearance in 2007) and served three years in prison, before new evidence emerged which exonerated her.Hearing the news this morning that, at long last, an Australian coroner has served the Chamberlains with a death certificate confirming that Azaria was killed by a dingo, reminded me of how brilliantly the family's struggle for justice was portrayed in A Cry in the Dark.Quite often, the courtroom drama, so popular in the 1980s, can be a very formulaic film genre. The undoubted tension of real-life courtrooms rarely translates into exciting films; some exceptions being, I believe, Primal Fear (1996) and Jagged Edge (1985). The success of those films, like that of A Cry in the Dark, is chiefly down to their having an eerie, highly ambiguous mystery at their hearts which keeps the audience gripped. Indeed, Fred Schepisi's film focuses on conversations between anonymous characters throughout Australia in order to reflect the circus-like attention the Chamberlain case received.Meryl Streep's performance is key to maintaining the central ambiguity. In the film, Lindy is both a common housewife who is simply determined to prove her innocence and a potentially sadistic murderess. Despite your sympathy for her, the nagging doubt that Lindy might be guilty persists until the final scenes, and this prevents A Cry in the Dark from becoming predictable - even though you know the outcome.Like so many times in her acting career, Streep fully transforms herself into the human being she is portraying: accent immaculate (to my untrained ears at least), mannerisms, everything. She is Lindy Chamberlain - a hard person to like in some ways, but someone whom you instantly admire for her courage and conviction. Though nominated for the Best Actress Oscar, Streep uncharacteristically (and unjustly) didn't win on this occasion, although perhaps I should applaud this fact, given my last blog entry about Biopics.Sam Neill puts in, arguably, his best performance as Michael Chamberlain, Lindy's loyal but weaker husband. His struggle to defend his family's honour from the lawyers and reporters seemingly intent on breaking it apart is truly poignant, especially as even he must quash those nagging doubts regarding Lindy's innocence. It's not just the acting that makes this a great film, however; the razor-sharp script helps Streep and Neill along, the musical score (so 80s) is suitably mysterious, and the judicious editing makes for an intelligent and smooth viewing experience.A Cry in the Dark is a film that doesn't outstay its welcome. It begins, it delivers its emotive story, then it ends. It's about family loyalty and the often-malevolent influence of the press, an issue which is more relevant today than ever. Those of you who haven't seen this film should, and those who haven't seen it in awhile should reappraise it.Culturally significant and thoroughly entertaining.For more film reviews: http://ins-kino.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Cry in the Dark is a solid film, one that could have easily gone off the tracks but is instead well directed and written. The sentimentality feels honest and true, as it is in real life. As much as the film makes you think about the actual case, it's also a vehicle for Streep's incredible performance. I'm still amazed to this day how well she can play in different accents. Here, she shows at first her grief, but also her resentment and her anger towards what is happening to her. I don't know much about the real woman, but Streep plays this character incredibly. She's very resistant to showing emotion to the media, but you can see her true sadness and exhaustion. Overall, a worthy piece to the case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Azaria Chamberlain, a nine week old Australian baby, disappears whilst on a camping trip with her family. Her parents report that the child was taken from her tent by a wild dingo. No body is found. The parents are arrested, suspected of murder.A highly publicised court-case follows. Azaria's mother, Lindy Chamberlain, is tried for murder. The media and public, finding the woman surprisingly cold, somehow get it into their collective heads that the parents are guilty because of this. As the media's focus on the trial is highly sensational, what follow is a public lynching of sorts, Lindy convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Azaria's father, Michael Chamberlain, is then convicted as an accessory and given a suspended sentence.I will not spoil the film's conclusion, suffice to say that actress Meryl Streep, who plays Lindy Chamberlain, lends the film surprising power. Streep plays a very cold character, deliberately off putting. We're thus suckered, like the public, into believing we too can successfully "spot a liar".7.9/10 ? Gentle direction, nice music and an impressive performance by Meryl Streep and Sam Neill as the film's central couple, make this an effective docudrama. The film's themes - "one woman against the world", "steadfast faith", "religious trials", "the importance of innocence" and "the danger of rash judgements" ? are standard "movie of the week" stuff, far less interesting than Streep's performance. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes folks, this is it... the origin of that popular quote " A DINGO ATE MY BABY!!" ( Though, you never actually hear those words said in the film) It all derives from a true story about how a religious, devoted mother off on a little trip deep in the Aussie Outback with her husband and two other kids has her baby abducted and ultimately devoured by a particularly strong dingo. Unfortunately, just when the couple are coming to terms with their loss, foul play is suspected and they're hauled into court accused of murder, pursued by a dogged (geddit?) press and disbelieved by a suspicious public. Can their relationship take the strain, and will they stay out of jail? Of course, if you followed the coverage at the time, you'd already know the answer to that, but try not to spoil it for those who didn't...Films based on actual events don't come any better than this, as we find ourselves immersed in this living nightmare for the married pair, where everyone has an opinion on what happened, the media is out to get them and even the police seem untrustworthy. Painstaking research must have been done, as we hear every angle of the case covered in minute deal... It's like we're there, in the gallery, watching events transpire before our eyes. This might be all for nought if the acting wasn't up to scratch, but in Streep and Neill they have two true professionals who accurately portray every minute of heartbreak and frustration that their real-life counterparts must have faced. Streep especially is perfect; with a dead-on accent to boot; not surprisingly, she won yet ANOTHER Oscar nomination.There is still those who think Lindy is guilty, after four trials and plenty of evidence backing her story.Probably the same people who think Man never landed on the Moon, There were two shooters when JFK got assassinated and Global Warming is a myth. You know who you are. Weirdos... 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sacrifice in the Wilderness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In August 1980 a nine-week-old baby girl named Azaria Chamberlain disappeared from a camp-site near Ayers Rock, Australia. The baby's mother Alice (generally known as Lindy) stated that her daughter had been taken by a wild dingo, and a subsequent inquest ruled that her account of events was true. That, however, was not the end of the matter. The police continued to investigate the disappearance, and eventually Lindy was charged with Azaria's murder; her husband Michael was charged with helping her dispose of the body. In October 1982 both were convicted and Lindy was sentenced to life imprisonment. (Michael was only given a suspended sentence). Several years later fresh evidence came to light which led to Lindy's release from prison; in 1988, shortly before this film was released, both the Chamberlains were acquitted by the Northern Territory Court of Appeals of all the charges against them.The "dingo baby case", as it became known, was one of the most controversial cases in Australian legal history. I remember an Australian friend coming to visit me in the early nineties, several years after Lindy and Michael Chamberlain had been exonerated, and as like me he was a keen film enthusiast I suggested that we should watch "Out of Africa" which was on television that evening. He refused point blank, stating that ever since the release of "A Cry in the Dark" he had made it a principle not to watch any film starring Meryl Streep because of what he described as her part in the "whitewashing of a notorious child-killer". My friend's attitude was by no means unusual in Australia. The case divided public opinion sharply in that country, with the majority probably believing that the Chamberlains were guilty. Gossip about them was widely repeated and quickly accepted as the truth. One thing that even the prosecution was unable to come up with was a plausible motive for the alleged crime. Those, however, who wanted to see the Chamberlains prosecuted in the court of public opinion were not so reticent. The couple were members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church- indeed, Michael was a pastor in that church- and rumour soon had it that Adventist religious doctrine demands the human sacrifice of young children in order to atone for the sins of the community. It was also widely, and incorrectly, reported in the media that the name Azaria means "sacrifice in the wilderness". Few of those who passed on these rumours had any real interest in Adventism, or how the doctrines of that church differ from those of mainstream Christianity; they merely saw the church as a bizarre and fanatical cult. This was the second film directed by Fred Schepisi in his native Australia. His first film, "The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith", also based on a real-life murder case, was part of the Australian "new wave" of the Seventies, but soon after making it Schepisi left for Hollywood. It is a dry, factual look at the facts of the case in the manner of a television docudrama; there is little to distinguish it from a "based-on-a-true-story" TV movie except for the presence of a major international star in the shape of Meryl Streep. (That and the fact that it is more factually accurate than most TV movies). Streep gets a chance to add another to her collection of accents, having earlier in the decade bagged British ("The French Lieutenant's Woman", "Plenty"), Polish ("Sophie's Choice") and Danish ("Out of Africa"). (Some people still think of her as an actress whose main skill is the ability to reproduce foreign accents, even though since the end of the eighties she has rarely played characters who are not American, her Italian-born housewife in "The Bridges of Madison County" and Margaret Thatcher in "The Iron Lady" being the main exceptions). Here she gives an excellent performance as Lindy Chamberlain. What is so remarkable is that she is able to convey not only her Lindy's strength of personality and belief in her own innocence but also the character traits which persuaded many people that Lindy was in fact guilty. Meryl was nominated for a "Best Actress" Oscar but lost out to Jodie Foster in "The Accused". What alienated so many members of the public was Lindy's refusal to make a show of her grief and her calm demeanour and stoical acceptance of her daughter's death. This attitude was probably based on Lindy's firm religious beliefs, her conviction that Azaria's death was the will of God and that her daughter had gone to a better life in Heaven, but many people took it as cold-heartedness, even as proof of her guilt. Sam Neill is also good as Michael, a weaker character than his wife, who confronted with disaster loses faith both in God and in Lindy's innocence. "A Cry in the Dark" has many similarities to a number of British films from around this period dramatising real-life miscarriages of justice, such as "Dance with a Stranger" and "Let Him Have It". Films of this nature, quite apart from their entertainment value, also have a useful social function in that they remind us of how easily such miscarriages can occur. In Lindy Chamberlain's case the main factors appear to have been public hysteria, prejudice against a minority religion, the irresponsibility of parts of the media and flawed "expert" evidence. (Azaria's clothing was examined by a British forensic scientist with no knowledge of dingoes; a chemical sprayed on the Chamberlains' car as a sound deadener was mistaken for blood). That the Chamberlains were eventually exonerated was largely due to the chance discovery of new evidence; one wonders how many innocent people are still in jail waiting for such evidence to turn up. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vox Populi vs. Lindy Chamberlain or Would the truth ever triumph over emotions in a media-centric society ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Cry in the Dark" in an Australian film from an Australian director, Fred Schepisi, chronicling the most famous trial of Australian history, the disappearance of a nine- week old baby, Azaria Chamberlain, in a campground near Ayers Rock (world's biggest rock) in 1980. The sad episode is infamous for the "The Dingo took my baby" line, the desperate cry of a mother, Lindy Chamberlain who saw the dingo coming off the tent where she put little Azaria a few minutes before, before it would be reduced to an 'opinion' debated by millions of Australians and questioned in trial. The Chamberlains would end up being convicted for the murder of their own baby after no evidence of a piece of clothing took by a dingo could be found.And whether it was the dingo who took little Azaria or Lindy, with the complicity of her husband Michael, who killed her child, matters less in the course of the film than the mechanisms that lead to one conviction to another. And Schepisi handles the case with a relative precision allowing us to understand to which extent, media, public opinion, the carrying of the case by the Law, the limitations of the police investigations, and last but no least, the reactions of the Chamberlain's family influenced perceptions and divided people. Recognized by the American Film Institute as the 9th in the list of the 10 greatest courtroom dramas, "A Cry in the Dark" provides a powerful social commentary about the fourth power and its undeniable interference with public opinion in the name of emotionalism and sensationalism.If I were bold, I would even make a comparison with the Dreyfus affair in France, although the political implications are totally different. But both cases strongly divided opinions, and the cultural background of the main protagonist played a significant role. Indeed, the Chamberlains are followers of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, technically, we don't learn much about it except in the way it strongly influences their lives and can easily make them look or sound like an obscurantist Church from common people's perspective. Michael is a pastor and constantly refers to Jesus and the end of the world, even when he's stuck by such a tragic event, even when he thanks people from the campground for their help. But it's Lindy who crystallizes the hatred and the suspicion. She looks cold and tough, has no difficulty to evoke the most gruesome details about the investigation, she's in a total contradiction about the way opinion would picture a mother who just lost her baby. At the end, what we have is a sensational case deviated by an excess of emotions and a woman who lacks this very emotion, and when the evidence doesn't speak for her, we feel that the fight is already lost. The power of "A Cry in the Dark" relies on the director's capacity to handle a very complex case, full of difficult notions, and encapsulate the public opinion through a series of little scenes showing people debating the case, even fighting over it. These little moments punctuating the legal plot line enable us not to understand the trial but why the Chamberlain Family lost it, as soon as the accusation stopped being pointed at the dingo but at them. It's even ironic that the dingo, which was one of the most representative animals of Australia, started to be seen as a sympathetic scapegoat, while Lindy Chamberlain stroke people from the courtroom as an icy and ruthless woman. And on that level, it's impossible to get further in the review without mentioning Meryl Streep. Calling it a virtuoso performance is almost a pleonasm because she carries with her own talent whatever made the film an instant classic. Not to diminish the merits of the director, writers, or even Sam Neil's supporting role as Michael, but the film feels like a minor production, it was even produced by the Golan-Globus pairing, more famous for 80's B- movies. It's like a TV Movie careful to report in a documentary-style the Chamberlain case without falling in a melodramatic trap. And it works for most of the part, because making the Chamberlains sympathetic would have reduced them to simple victims of circumstances while in reality, they contributed to their own misfortune. And Streep is able to metamorphose into a strong and tough women who refuses to play the game, to laugh or to weep just to please the jury, she doesn't use tears to implore people to believe them. They think she killed her baby, well, that's too bad. Meryl Streep, Oscar-nominated for the role of Lindy Chamberlain, redefines again the rule of acting through her extraordinary talent to multiply the accents, to be realer than the real, and to embody in her eyes all the emotion needed to elevate the film. In the course of the trial, while Michael looks absolutely devastated, his faith shattered by an intolerable bad luck streak, Lindy stands still, her eyes full of an expression of anger and dark confidence enough to chill the blood of anyone. First seen as a loving mother, she quickly becomes a suspect, then a witch, and then even the jury avoids seeing her. I wouldn't go as far as saying that the movie must be watched if only for Meryl Streep's performance, but as it doesn't have the stylistic ambitions of "Kramer vs. Kramer", if it wasn't for Meryl Streep, the movie would have definitely sunk into oblivion and not become this pop-culture phenomenon forever associated with Australia.The film was released in 1988 after the Chamberlains were finally acquitted when a baby clothing was found in a dingo lair. It's deliberately anticlimactic because the essential lies elsewhere; it's less about the Azaria Chamberlain case than the sad influence emotions can have on people, manipulating their opinion at the expense of truth. For that, "A Cry in the Dark" is an important film that hasn't lost its relevance.</fullReview>

The central characters, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, whose daughter disappears during a night out in the Australian outback, are not bad people, but then surely not all, or even most, of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better. But though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the Chamberlains from the start of their life's tragic disarray, the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip, news media, crowds, mobs and assumptions. It's not a movie about the society of Australia in particular; it's merely an account of a true story that happened there. Society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are.When a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine's dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog, when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines, newspapers and TV programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy, there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one's own unaware perceptions, influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one's life. The reason I appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out, from the victims to the masses.The evidence against Lindy Chamberlain aside, suspicion was jet-fueled mostly by a virtue of hers. To the public eye, she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter. Why was she able to keep her cool, even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up, for TV and the press? How much of the downward spiral could've been prevented had she behaved more to the public's liking in the media? Meryl Streep, one of, if not the, greatest actress working today, may not give a performance that particularly stands out, and frankly neither does any other actor, or department of film-making. But she, and the screenwriters, do understand Lindy. What is infuriating is that it's not that difficult. Apparently, she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case. Whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense, we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation.Whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as Sophie's Choice, The Devil Wears Prada, Angels In America or other such work, it is a triumph. It is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself. She frustrates us because we don't know what she's thinking or feeling. It took me awhile to feel endeared toward her, but this is the movie's way of suggesting the reaction of the public's attention.She is married to a pastor, and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most. Initially, they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to God's will, kick-starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter's death was some sort of ritual killing on their part. Whatever happened to the little girl, her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media's intake didn't immediately identify, so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry...well...Meryl Streep and Sam Neill are constantly on screen, but the public plays the real leads here. Like punctuation for each plot advance, director Fred Schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office, where the public tries Lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What innocence means to innocent people!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In August 1980 the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents Lindy and Michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation. The media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood. What followed was a gross miscarriage of justice.Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock, central Australia, that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area. No-one believed them. Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and Michael as an accessory after the fact. The whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing. The Chamberlain's trial was over before it began.Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was found guilty. There was never enough evidence to convict her, yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure. How could we as a nation even sit in judgement? From where we are, how could we possibly presume to know? Unless there was absolute proof, and no reasonable doubt whatsoever, the Chamberlains should have been acquitted.Fred Schepisi's film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of John Bryson's novel, that the Chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them. That in fact a dingo did take baby Azaria on that fateful night at Ayers Rock.Schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation, hell bent on 'the truth' being brought to light. He shows Australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the Chamberlains pay! His screenplay, co-written with Robert Caswell, vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred.The outstanding Meryl Streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts. She brings to life most convincingly the tough little Aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight. Even her accent is almost, but not quite, spot on. A very good effort by the master of that trade. Sam Neill is every bit as good as Streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned Michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart, and he starts to question his Christianity. His, as was Streep's, is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly. The entire support cast are also excellent, with some of Australia's finest actors and actresses playing a part.Technically the film is brilliant too, with Director of Photography Ian Baker capturing this great land with splendour (especially the Rock). Editor Jill Bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton provides a telling score.For all Aussies this is a must see, a shocking look in the mirror if you will, at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served, and the truth to be known. As Michael Chamberlain said : "I don't think anybody really understands what innocence means.....to innocent people."Saturday, May 20, 1995 - VideoEven on return viewings Fred Schepisi's account of the travesty of justice that befell the Chamberlains, who lost baby Azaria at Ayres rock in 1980, is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving.Schepisi and Robert Caswell have expertly transferred John Bryson's novel to the screen, telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, whose new born daughter Azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down.Amid media speculation and vicious public rumour Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and Michael was charged as an accessory after the fact. What followed was little more than trial by media, and with the Australian people determined she be put away, Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence.Meryl Streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles Australia head on to prove her innocence. She is truly awesome, and the only thing that fails her is a true blue Aussie accent, though she does her level best to sound ocker. You might wonder why a top Australian actress wasn't cast in the role, but star power is probably the answer. Alongside Meryl is an equally impressive Sam Neill, outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes, while he feels powerless to do anything about it. A strong Aussie cast lend compelling support.Editing from Jill Bilcock is very timely, Ian Baker's cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and Bruce Smeaton's music is perfect for the part. Truly a must for all conscientious Australians.Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow Meryl!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I have seen the best of Meryl Strep after feasting on a string of movies by her, most notably OUT OF Africa, BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, ADAPTATION, THE HOURS, IRONWEED,among others. I was thus surprised when I was fortunate to chance upon A CRY IN THE DARK being shown on Cinemax. This was Meryl Streep in a different picture, nothing I have seen of her before. Here she was playing an Australian Mother wrongly accused and convicted of murdering her own child. Streep gave us here a powerful and unforgettable portrait of a tormented person who grieved rather inwardly, crying alone in the dark. I can't praise Streep enough for this earth-shattering performance.My appreciation for this actress already reaches heaven high. And it continues to rise further as I go about her other films...Interestingly, I haven't seen the one performance unanimously cited by critics and moviegoers alike as her best--SOPHIE'S CHOICE. I have not seen her portrayal of Karen Silkwood too.I wonder how I would look at the actress upon viewing these other performances....Long live the QUEEN of cinema, Meryl Streep!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An examination of the Trial by Media.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a docudrama story on the Lindy Chamberlain case and a look at it's impact on Australian society. It especially looks at the problem of innuendo, gossip and expectation when dealing with real-life dramas.One issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations. Not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis. Just because the characters in the movies and on TV act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so. This is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings. It's an issue that has to be constantly addressed.The leads play the characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based-on-fact individuals. Some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in Australia as comic actors. It re-enforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals.(Spoiler warning!)I have to say something very personal here; in that I am actually an ex-Adventist who was a practicing member in Australia at the time this incident occurred; so I have a slightly different impression of the story than most. I think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality, and emotional heart. I think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers. It captured the themes of the story brilliantly.I once heard Fred Schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to "play the best case for their character they could". While this is especially apt for this story, I think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The necessary enemy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Common sense tells us that "seeing is believing." Experience tells us that, when motivation is strong enough, it's the other way around -- "believing is seeing." Under pressure from the press and from public opinion, criminalists see blood where there is no blood. Forensic pathologists who have never see a dingo claim an absence of dingo teeth marks. Investigators see an arterial blood spray where there is nothing but a sound-deadening compound.The case took place at a time when another of those episodes of collective hysteria was sweeping the English-speaking world. Satanic worshippers lurked in the most unlikely place and preschools were filled with pedophiles. Smokers endangered our health by subjecting us to whiffs of the burning weed. We seem to need an expression for our collective hatred. There's even evidence from gerontological studies that angry people tend to outlive more pacific individuals -- an effect the authors attributed to "the necessary enemy." Maybe now, after the resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism, we'll have more palpable enemies than will o' the wisps.The Chamberlains were caught up in that wave of collective hatred. The case must have been a dramatic one -- wild dog eats baby! One can imagine the headlines, the earnest discussions, the fixed conclusions based on presumptions. Lindy Chamberlain certainly did nothing to discourage the calumny heaped upon her. She wasn't very good at playing the victim, in contrast to, say, the Menendez brothers who slaughtered their parents, then wept on the stand while describing how abused they were, and wound up with a mistrial. And not nearly as good as Susan Smith, the woman in the unlikely town of Union, South Carolina, who drowned her two children and sobbed openly on TV while begging the mythical black kidnapper not to harm them.Well, after all, occupying the role of victim is an acquired skill and some have acquired less of it than others. (Mersault, in Camus' "The Stranger.") Lindy Chamberlain, as expertly played here my Meryl Streep, a phenomenally talented technical actress, is not a likable person. She matter-of-factly whines on, complaining about things in a sing-song voice, punctuated by occasional outbursts of anger. She needed some coaching from the Menendez' on how to engage the jury's sympathy. And she LOOKS wrong too. She should be small and vulnerable, instead of lumpy. And she seems to have gone out of her way to look ill-groomed. Streep, properly glamorized, is a beautiful and intelligent-looking woman. As Lindy Chamberlain her eyebrows are plucked and then painted back in as mere smudges by the makeup department. Her black hair (which should have been blonde) was probably meant to be in a style called page boy (is that right?) but comes out looking more like a Nazi helmet. Streep must have put on weight for the role. Her arms and breasts are flabby and her neck seems the size of a telephone pole, reducing her lips to a tiny pink orifice in the middle of the vast featureless plane of her face. She's as unsympathetic as all get out and human nature being what it is, people are likely to get confused about the difference between being dislikable and being guilty of murder.Sam Neill is far more sympathetic a character but, where Streep is arrogant, he's sensitive, muddled, and weak. He's completely discombobulated by the prosecution's series of questions: "Did she say she saw anything in the dingo's mouth? Did she say she didn't see anything in the dingo's mouth? Did she tell you she saw NOTHING in the dingo's mouth?" Confused, he answers that, yes, she told him she saw the dingo come out with the baby in her mouth.Reminds me of an interrogation from "Catch-22", something like this. Superior officer to subordinate: "When did you say we were a bunch of fools?" Subordinate: "I never said you were fools." Superior: "Now you're telling me when you DIDN'T say it. I'm asking you when you DID say we were a bunch of fools." Subordinate: "I ALWAYS never say you were a bunch of fools."It's a fast-paced movie. If there were any dissolves I missed them. The story comes to us in pointed scenes of the Chamberlains together, intercut with snippets of public reaction to the spectacle. But the movie, for all the tragedy inherent in the story, isn't gripping. It not only has no hero or heroine, there's no one who's particularly likable. Neill suffers in silence and Streep has almost done too good a job alienating us from her character and her anguish. But overall, whatever it lacks in emotional impact it more than makes up for in its instructive quality. And of course our sympathies are with the real-life Chamberlains who were put through an immeasurable ordeal. The press and the gossipy, half-hysterical public may be easy targets, but they're very real threats to our collective common sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER: Dingos and the Different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Except for the acting of Meryl Streep, which is of note as always, I'd avoid this film because it has a dated "Movie of the Week" quality about it. But it is worth watching if you keep the several understories in mind: How a couple endures media scrutiny, and how the different are treated.Throughout the movie the issue is the credibility of the different. Australians are different than "us" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) automatically come at it with an air of "oddness" about them. The couple involved is religious (different than most of culture) and Adventists (different) at that. So their lifestyle and mindset are suspect to begin with. Dingos are different animals than other dogs, so again we're faced with oddness questions. The real story, then, is how society (and the world) treats the different, those who have different accents, different beliefs, than we do and how we treat what they say as suspect.It's difficult to hear the phrase "A dingo took my baby!" without laughing and there are humorous posts, sadly, all over the web about it. But in the years that followed the story and the movie it has been discovered (as you'll find in web searches) that much larger children have been stalked by dingos. Research by experts in dingos have shown that it was not only possible but most probable that the baby was taken by dingos (maybe a pair), extracted expertly from the clothing and eaten within moments without a trace.Yet what is left behind is the question of why people defended dingos when they were found to be endangering children rather than killing the dingo to save the children, why because a woman's affect (expression) is so cold she is assumed to be guilty, and on and on.Haunting questions, with or without the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meryl Streep at her best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the Lifetime TV network and thought it was an interesting story. Several years later I see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie. The story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself. The cast just makes it that much more appealing. Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture. She nails Mrs. Chamberlain's mannerisms, the accent, and even look. She shows the pain, hurt, surprise, and anger that Lindy had to endure, and in the process it's hard to remember that it ISN'T Lindy. In my opinion, this performance of Meryl's was better than her Oscar-winning turn in "Sophie's Choice", and should have garnered her her third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain, and for some surprising reason, wasn't recognized by the Academy with at least a nomination. In all, this movie only receive ONE Oscar nod (Streep's for Best Actress.) However, it did receive several Australian Oscars and nominations.Definitely a top-rate movie: it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just yet another Streep accent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have just read some of the comments on the message boards and some of the reviews. Some opinions differ from mine, but that is usual. I am NOT a big fan of Meryl Streep... never having "bought into" the "Meryl is the Greatest American Actress since Bette Davis!!!" hype. But then, I never really bought into the "Bette Davis is the Greatest American Actress" hype either.All that said ... for me, this was just another Streep Accent film. The story was interesting because, not living in Australia, I was oblivious to the real life events and the furor it caused. I was not aware of the outcome of the trial and the appeals etc. The whole media mess reminded me of the parents being accused in the "who killed the baby-pageant-queen" case... also still not really solved.Streep is as usual.. Streep. Sam Neill is OK as the husband... not outstanding but OK. The many many bit parts and extras convey the hysteria that occurred in the country. The kids were mostly impossible to understand and the new little girl was obviously the child of some member of the cast or crew.Would I recommend this film ... nope .. not really. Too many better films to watch. Streep best actress that year ? Nopers again ! Plus she had a funny haircut and 1/2 eyebrows that were incredibly distracting. Give it a miss.</fullReview>

Streep and Neill both give commendable performances, and there is also some wonderful scenery. Set in '80, filmed in '88, it's a nostalgic experience for those of us old enough to remember those times, not that I notice any really glaring differences between then and now.

		<fullReview>Once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they... somehow... managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended, you'll find that it's not half bad. The plot is engaging and interesting, and the pacing is fast, with this covering many situations, and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken. Where this really stands out is the acting. The performances are excellent. Neill and Streep are both impeccable. It's also cool to hear so much Australian spoken in a Hollywood film, and even those who don't come naturally to it at least attempt an accent. The cinematography and editing are nice enough, but they don't really go beyond the standard stuff. This movie's story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling. While I have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture, I understand that it is quite close to the truth. There is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this. It is, at times, a downright great courtroom drama. I recommend this to any fellow fan of such. 7/10</fullReview>

Lindy and David are New Zealanders who immigrated to Australia (soz Meryl your accent is wrong) A two month old baby disappeared while camping with their family (why would anyone go to the middle of the desert to see a massive rock with such a young family is anyone's guess especially when she couldn't do anything except watch her husband climb up Uluru) It is extremely unlikely that a dingo would be able to carry a baby let alone not leave a massive mess inside the tent when you consider they are constantly fed by the tourists, to this day this is unanswered but that's not to say that she is innocent or guilty it's just a very unlikely event. The press really took away any chance of getting to the real truth of this story.... who or what killed Azaria Chamberlain? This movie is extremely hard for Australian's to look at itself cause I can't get over the stupid comments made by the Australians, it really made us look silly and I feel that it didn't really portray what Australia is really all about. The things you can learn from this movie is that press can destroy any facts and Police can botch up any investigation, bigotry is rife in Australia when it comes to religion and truth to what happen to Azaria will never be known. Good to watch however you need to consider that this is a POV and still the facts are out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fascinating movie, based on a true story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) accused of killing her baby daughter. She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is highly suspicious. The film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case, the way Australians interpreted what was presented in the media, and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman's conviction, based on barely any hard evidence. I love films that question the media, and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system. I've always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 Angry Men before they go through with their duties. It's not, as has often been said, a liberal movie, but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge. A Cry in the Dark is likewise clinical. Schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic. Some may find the film boring or dry, but I found it engaging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A CRY IN THE DARK : Brilliantly Tense Film-making...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A CRY IN THE DARK A CRY IN THE DARK was a film that I anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid, if unremarkable film. This assumption came from the fact that aside from Streep's Best Actress nomination, the movie received little attention from major awards groups.Little did I anticipate that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a riveting drama, well-constructed on every level. If you ask me, this is an under-appreciatted classic.The film opens rather slowly, letting the audience settle into the Chamberlain's at a relaxed pace and really notice that, at the core, they are an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (the director) selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy, while also showing the attentive bliss with which Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain care for their children.While the famous line "A Dingo Took My Baby!" has become somewhat of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to laughable. The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured. It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questions.The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the Chamberlain's continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court, which suspects Lindy of murder.The fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping. As an audience member, I was fully invested in the Chamberlain's plight... and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media. But at the same, the media/public opinion is understandable. I loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic, but they always had valid reasons to hold their views.The final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas.In terms of performances, the only ones that really matter in this film are those of Streep and Neill... and they deliver in every way. For me, this ranks as one of (if not #1) Meryl Streep's best performances. For all her mastery of different accents (which of course are very impressive in their own right), Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters. I find this to be one of Streep's more subtle performances, and she hits it out of the park. And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streep's performance. From what I've seen, this is undoubtedly Neill's finest work to date. It's a shame he wasn't recognized by the Academy with a Leading Actor nomination to match Streep's... b/c the two of them play of each other brilliantly.More emotionally gripping than most films, and also incredibly suspenseful... A CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where Meryl screams "The dingo took my baby!" watch the film and see just how much more there is to A CRY IN THE DARK then that one line....

		<shortDescription>Guilty until proven innocent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based.The right to be presumed "Innocent until proven guilty" is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society; but according to Fred Schepisi's partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous Australian murder trial, it was not granted to Lindy Chamberlain, accused of killing her baby. The story suggesting her innocence was unlikely (a dingo was alleged to have taken it), but those implying her guilt even more so, and there was no solid evidence against her. But the Australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt, and the deeply religious Chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media (and the media themselves, of course, were anything but innocent in this process). So although cleared by an initial inquest, they were later prosecuted and convicted. Although Chamberlain was eventually released, this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence "proving" their innocence, something no defendants should have to produce.'A Cry in the Dark' is well acted throughout, especially by Meryl Streep, who puts on a convincing Australian accent (at least to this Pom's ears) and manages keep Lindy sympathetic (to us) while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure. The scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking, because we believe in the characters as real. Regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story (something I can't comment on), the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the British popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership's least charitable instincts. No legal system will ever be perfect; but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary British tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put Lindy Chamberlain away. I'm not a religious man, but the Bible still contains some killer lines (if you'll excuse the pun). "Judge not lest ye be judged" is one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a terrific story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religious bigotry is rampant everywhere. Australia is not immune to it.A dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having "killed" her own baby. I don't mean to spoil the story for you, but you need to know the basics before getting knee-deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison.Buy or rent the movie and discover how deep-seated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globe.This is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors.Both Meryl Streep (with her famous Aussie accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is his native-born pronunciation, are outstanding. Those with supporting roles are also quite good.You will remember this movie for many years.See it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Meryl is amazing, but this project fails to take off to reach her level. Too bad. The story has potential: Meryl as a great actress acting a character who is a poor actress. The Adventist Bible providing a useless script. The process of `discovery' amounting to fabrication. But to the extent that it works, it does so by skipping around the country through living rooms and bars and many, many other places. It effectively establishes the `entity' of the Australian people, millions and millions of them arrayed against this woman.

		<fullReview>I believe they were telling the truth the whole time..U cant trust anything in the wild... They family went through hell.Those poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them. But still having to deal with the rumours. As well as dealing with the lose of their little sister. I cant believe this case went on for so long.seems like the jury couldn't see the truth, even if it bit them on the ass.I feel for this family, and if i could let them know i hate what has happened to them, i would.I have no idea what they went through, i cant even imagine it. After watching this movie, i was in tears, and had to check on my little girl in bed...I think everyone should watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Streep is amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Meryl Streep does an amazing job. She always seems to amaze audiences and critics with her ability to master an accent. This film is based on a true story, which took place in August 1980. Its about a family whos baby is killed while out in the wilderness. However, there is no body, and all evidence points to the mother (Streep.) This movie is 2 hours long, but totally keeps you on the edge of your seat. The evidence will shock you, and keep you guessing... and the ending is amazing. I recommend that if you enjoy Streep, true stories, or drama/mysteries, check this one out at your local video store!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a brilliant performance Streep creates a media frenzy among the Australian press. Why? Because her display of public grieving is less than what people expect. So does this mean that guilt or innocence in determined by preconceived notions of what we should or should not be feeling, or at least displaying? Apparently so in this case. Neil, agonizes over his daughters disappearance, and questions his faith in God -serious stuff for one so committed.There's a lot going on in this film -see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being devoured by wild canines and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds. Meryl Streep gives the performance of her life, melodramatic, overwrought but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate horror.If comedies about the infants being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this and, yes, it is an odd choice of topic for a farce but really very little of the movie has anything to do with that as it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for her Aussie accent and facial contortions. Throwing in a slam at media bias and sensationalism and disregard for either the truth or ethics gives the movie the chance to make the daring point that those things are bad.</fullReview>
