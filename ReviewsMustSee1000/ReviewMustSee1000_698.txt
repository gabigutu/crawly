		<shortDescription>Can't decide if it's thriller or drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been long awaiting this movie ever since I saw the trailer, which made it look like a political drama, starring three of my favorite actors; Al Pacino, John Cusack, and Bridget Fonda. And even though it was directed by Harold Becker, who has done uneven work, he and Pacino did combine on SEA OF LOVE, which ranks among each of their best work. But interference on some level(for starters, several of the scenes in the original trailer don't appear in the movie) and changing of tone(subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller) make this, while watchable, nowhere near as it could have been.Which is too bad, because I really wanted to like this movie. There was great potential here to be a film about how government can still be worthwhile despite all the corruption, and to make a complex statement about that corruption, not the usual good guys vs. bad guys. And there is good acting here. Pacino and Cusack are both very good, and Danny Aiello gives one of the best performances of his career. But Fonda is wasted in her role, having nothing to do, and while there is merit in the central storyline, when it turns to a thriller, the movie loses its way, briefly recovers in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino, and then falls down completely in the end. I wish I could like this more, but no.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this neglected movie quite a bit, for a number of reasons.The characters. I found them believable, real, with some depth, in conflict. Not cardboard, cartoon-like. I found that I could really identify with and care about them.The story. I thought it was really interesting and realistic. The behind-the-scenes look at political machinations was exciting. I tend to like movies without special effects, that are not unrealistic fantasies. ("Ordinary People" generally comes to my mind.) I thought that this movie simply took real-life type people, put them in interesting situations, filled with conflict, and had us watch them deal with the problems they were in.I also think the movie had a message for us, in terms of right and wrong. In fact, it's downright Shakespearian. (Contrast this with another Al Pacino movie, "Heat", where the criminals are portrayed just as sympathetically as the law enforcement officers, and there is no inkling at all that there is anything morally wrong with armed robbery. I'm uncomfortable with that.)It's refreshing to see a movie in this day and age without gratuitous sex, violence, bombs and bullets, profanity.On a cinematic level, I found the directing, acting (the entire cast) and production to be first rate.I realize that many, many people (possibly the large majority) don't see things as I've described here. But if what I've written resonates, then you'll probably like this movie a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie for John Cusack fans. He is in almost every scene as a mayoral aide who gets in way over his head trying to solve a murder mystery involving a drug dealer, a lonewolf cop and a six-year-old boy. Cusack has definitely grown into serious adult roles, as this film makes abundantly clear. Pacino is also topnotch as a crusading mayor who harbors a terrible secret. He is in control and charismatic as hell. Watch for the funeral scene where he sways what could have been a very hostile crowd. Danny Aiello also is terrific as a Brooklyn borough chief in bed with the mafia. Too bad the shaky script wasn't up to the acting. Is this a drama or an action piece? It wavers back and forth. But even if you figure out the resolution early on, which my kid did less than halfway through, this may keep you reasonably spellbound. A little too talky, although some pretty good dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent political thriller not pretending anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, there is a plenty of ways how to spoil a political thriller. Usually they are derivative or too ambitious, often they feature a conspiracy that is totally paranoic and unbelievable. But City Hall does not do neither of the above mentioned. The plot is cleverly crafted, story is believable. As far as characters go I would say this movie is a solid average. No character seems out of place and Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His portrayal of a charismatic NYC mayor is superb and proves again that Al Pacino belongs to the absolute top of American actors nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent political thriller, played much quieter and slower than other, higher ranking films in this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack how do they manage to skip over these amazing career topping performances? A story of friendships, father-son relationships, corruption and deceit. The two actors gel amazingly well together, and the supports from Aiello and Fonda are equally as impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially when the papers run to press. Instead of focussing on an over complex corruption scandal, it creates wonderful characters who show the human side of failure an political bribery, The final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and acted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politics in The Big Apple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a transplanted New Yorker, I might be more critical than most in watching City Hall. But I have to say that before even getting to the story itself I was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of New York City that Director Harold Becker created.For example there's a reference to Woerner's Restaurant in Brooklyn where political boss Frank Anselmo likes to eat. There is or was a Woerner's Restaurant on Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I lived in New York back in 1996. It was in fact particularly favored by political people in the Borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts.No surprise because the script was co-authored by Nicholas Pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories. He knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film.A detective played by Nestor Serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss Anthony Franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead, including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school. The story mushrooms and at the end it's reached inside City Hall itself.Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his Deputy Mayor a transplanted Louisianan, a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself. He's the outsider here and in trying to do damage control, Cusack finds more than he bargained for,Danny Aiello plays Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo and for those of you not from New York, his character is based on the late Borough President of Queens Donald Manes who was also brought down by scandal. He's very much the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them, do Aiello in. City Hall was the farewell performance on film for Anthony Franciosa, one of the most underrated and under-appreciated talents ever on the screen. No one watches anyone else whenever he's on.Al Pacino's best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed, he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself. His is a complex part, he's a decent enough man, but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like New York. For those who want to know about political life in the Big Apple, City Hall is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film, very underrated, never outdated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best crime-drama movies during the late 1990s. It was filled with a great cast, a powerful storyline, and many of the players involved gave great performances. Pacino was great; he should have been nominated for something. John Cusack was good too, as long as the viewer doesn't mind his Louuu-siana accent. He may come off as annoying if you can't stand this dialect. The way that Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was believable, dramatic, and slightly comical at times. Danny Aiello was superb as always. David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too many. It may take a second viewing to remember, "which Zapatti was which?" After so many cross-references, one has to stop and think just to recap. The ending didn't have a lot of sting. It was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown. This was one of the few problems with the film. Since the movie wasn't billed as a "huge, blockbuster" big screen hit, it made some forget that this movie even existed. Pacino and Aiello were great but the film's lack of "splash" in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations. It was semi-successful in the home market, and viewers are still learning that this title is out there. Made in 1996, it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to come.So, make yourself some lemon pudding (you'll see) and see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Smooth Political Talker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that shocked me about this film, considering the cast, was the small amount of profanity. I mean, with Al Pacino, John Cusack, Bridget Fonda and Danny Aiello, I didn't expect this low-key a film. Aiello and Cusack not uttering one swear word? Wow, that's almost unheard of in films.The story is very low-key, maybe too much so for a lot of people which includes me at times, but I enjoyed this. In fact, just watching and listening to Pacino and Cusack in this movie was plenty of entertainment. They played a mayor and a deputy mayor, respectively.However, to be honest, I didn't always comprehend what was going on in the story. Apparently the mayor knew what was going on all the time and it was just business (or politics) as usual, for him.Pacino's speech at the funeral of the young black kid was outstanding. Talk about a smooth political orator! Pacino played New York City Mayor "John Pappas." He reminded me a lot of another New Yorker, former governor Mario Cuomo who, although I disagreed with many of his statements, was a smooth talker like Pacino's character in here. I wonder if they modeled "Pappas" after Cuomo?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. This is as good a performance as he's ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance compelling --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awesomely powerful --- the film has a fast paced, gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks. This outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence, overheated sex or gutter language. There is murder. There are bad people. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A film like this restores my jaded faith in Hollywood. I don't award many tens. This one richly deserves it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harold Becker directed this political drama that stars Al Pacino as New York City Mayor John Pappas, who must deal with the aftermath of an accidental shooting involving a young boy that threatens his party's re-election chances. John Cusack is deputy mayor Kevin Calhoun, who launches his own investigation into the matter, and is shocked to find scandal and corruption that threatens to ruin his reverence and respect for his boss, who is an eloquent speaker, but since when does that equal virtue and honesty? Danny Aiello, Bridget Fonda, &amp; Martin Landau round out a fine cast, which is really the best thing about this marginal film that never quite reaches the heights of profound revelatory drama it aspires to, coming up short in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie that gets better the more you watch it (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie about 6 times now. And each time I view it, I'm more impressed by the story and the acting. Its like watching a train wreck being set in motion. Its subtle in its approach, but very effective in reaching its goal. Spoilers-&gt; At the center of the story is a very nice dichotomy. On the one hand we have Deputy major, Eddy Calhoun (Cusack) unknowingly tearing at the old boys network that forms the hart of major of New York's Administration and on the other hand we have the mob boss Zappati who's deliberately trying to maintain the status quo through all means necessary. This situation nicely culminates in the end when Zappati orders Alselmo to make it easy on himself by killing himself and Calhoun ordering Pappas to do the same, politically speaking.The movie also contains some really great one-liners such as (a personal weakness of mine): - You don't sum up a man's life in one moment - The only thing new in this world is the history you don't knowAll in all, a great movie that deserves a much higher rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex but Worth Repeated Viewings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the negative comments before viewing this film and undeterred, went ahead and started watching. I admit that I had to rewind quite a few times as the film is incredibly complex, involved and full of detail. That is a good thing but also, quite unexpected in this culture of car chases, explosions, gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development. In fact, what a welcome departure, however, I am so used to not paying a lot of attention to what I watch. This film is chock full of character development and plot line; the kind that we used to analyze when I was in high school. It requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer. What a nice change. I would compare it to 'All The President's Men' in terms of generic subject matter. That is, it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence upon officials to essentially 'own' them. Unlike 'All The President's Men', this film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters actual personality. In this sense the movie is a character study like 'The Negotiatior' with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In that movie, their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense. Yet, the plot is dependent on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other, trust each, and ultimately unite together against the corrupt Police Department. There is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but generically, there are many similarities. I WILL say that City Hall requires a whole lot more concentration. In fact, I was struck how parallel it was to past and present political scandals I've seen in my life going back to Watergate. The thing is, the public knows that something is wrong, for sure! but following the details is hard to do. This movie is not even close to being as complex as real life but it actually is realistic to life in its complexity. I think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized the film: unrealistic expectations.If one watches this knowing what they are about to see and are up to the experience, it really is excellent! I watched it 3 times in a row! The acting is superb and the directing is flawless. The weakest link is John Cusak's accent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across the country and especially in the political landscape, people with any kind of political ambition, should take time out to see this film. The movie is called " City Hall " and with little imagination, its synopsis can take place anywhere in America. It just so happens to open in New York. Here we have the story of a popular politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) with enough savvy to run a major metropolitan city with very little effort. His right-hand man is none other than Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack) an equally bright individual who's ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed destined for higher office. Everything points in that direction, until a police shooting ignites an investigation spearheaded by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda) who believes the guilt points towards city hall and the mayor. A six year old boy and a police officer's death are blamed on a career criminal who's questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover-up by political pay-offs and city corruption involving union leaders like Danny Aiello played by Frank Anselmo, corrupt judicial officials like Judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. Also implicated, are party officials like Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) who works for the probation office of New York. But it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting. A great vehicle for Cusack and a sure bet nominee to become a classic. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling political 'whodunit' ruined by a pointless ending and an unnecessary close-to-romantic subplot ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since Frank Capra and "The Godfather" movies, Cinema had shattered faith on American politicians and I guess, reality finished the job. And given the requirements of the political thriller genre, dissociating the word 'politician' from the epithet 'crooked' became unconceivable, and Harold Becker's "City Hall" is no exception: the script co-written by three giants: Bo Goldman, Nicholas Pileggi and Paul Schradder, depicts politicians as puppets with money as the strings held by criminals.The games had its rules and one of them was to never harm, let alone, kill, innocent people. In "Scarface", Tony Montana owed his demise to this principle and Eliott Ness couldn't overlook the explosion that killed a poor little girl in "The Untouchables". "City Hall" opens with an off-duty cop and an in-probation criminal linked to the mob, meeting on a rainy day and shooting at each other. Nothing we're not familiar with, but then there's a stray bullet that takes the film to an unexpected direction, killing a 6-year little boy going to school with his father.When a bullet kills a child, the community can't close eyes. We know the bullet hasn't finished its trajectory and many other heads will follow. The film is basically about the aftermath of the triple-murder, a thrilling investigation and its political domino-effect. What makes it even more riveting relies on the character who desperately tries to reassemble the pieces of the puzzle: Kevin Calhoun, John Cusack in his 'boyish look' days, as the deputy of an ambitious and charismatic lawyer named John Pappas, played by a Pacino at the top of his game (sometimes over it). Calhoun asks a friend about the killer's probation and what follows is a great piece of dialog. David Paymer's character looks confused. "Isn't the document kosher enough?" "No, it's too kosher." We get the message.In other words, the Judge let a gangster free while he deserved to be sentenced for jail for more than 10 years. And the 'signal' alert starts ringing when Calhoun discovers that the judge happens to be a friend of John Pappas. Calhoun tries to protect his mentor, little he knows that Pappas will also be revealed as the mastermind of the whole operation. Mastermind is a bit too much; in fact, this is a benign case of political corruption. Then Mobster Zappati wants to spare his nephew a 15-year sentence, he orders his friend, a Brooklyn mayor, named Anselmo, played by a great Danny Aiello to 'persuade the judge', a good friend of John Pappas, which loops the loop. Meanwhile, Anselmo orders to hide 40 000 dollars in the cop's home to imply that he wasn't that clean. Really small potatoes, we've seen worse.But all of these actions are aggravated by the dramatic turn it took, when a lamb was sacrificed at the altar of political corruption. But more dramatic, even tragic, is the unforgivable turn the film takes as it deliberately screws up the mechanism it confidently built up. It all starts with Bridget Fonda's character as the lawyer representing the cop's widow and struggling to clear her husband's name, in order to get a full pension ? well, if it wasn't meant to be a sort of 'romantic' subplot, why a beautiful blonde for that? And this is where the film starts to lose its beat, because there's nothing she brought up that Calhoun couldn't have discovered alone. The whole ride to 'buffalo' was just the set-up to a cringe-worthy ending that didn't even make sense in the first place.Basically, Fonda is the film's first mistake, and the poster could have done without her. There was so many great moments, a reunion between Anselmo and his business partners, his last conversation with Zapatti which had the same powerful undertones as the unforgettable meeting between Tom Hagen and Frankie Pentangeli in "The Godfather Part II". The film even has the intelligence to spare us some random action scenes, it's all in the mystery surrounding the opening crime, it's one hell of a political whodunit, meaning: who committed the first mistake? And the only character for the film is Calhoun, whose arc will change from idealism to an awareness of the limitation of the political world. If anything, the film had to conclude on a sad and melancholic note.Instead, we have that upbeat tone at the end, where he campaigns for some candidature I didn't even care about and an exchange of a few wisecracks with Bridget Fonda. That 'bullet killing a child' was the plot device that belonged to "City Hall" and no other film could have used it instead. Imagine the conversation, you know "City Hall"? "City what"? The film where a kid gets killed during a shoot-out and Pacino makes a speech during his funeral." "Yeah, I remember that movie, so ? how about it?" "Well, it could have been much better." Unfortunately, the film is so thought-provoking and subversive that some other parts simply didn't work, the ending, Bridget Fonda, and the fact that we're left confused about the future of John Pappas.It's incredible that a screenplay written by the authors of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'", "Scent of a Woman", "Goodfellas", "Casino", "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull" couldn't come up with a more explosive material. A disappointing collective work, for a film with a very promising concept, a stellar cast, but the conclusion of an ordinary TV movie. That 'bullet killing a child' deserved more. When you have such an original opening, you can't afford such a cheap and ordinary ending, much more one that doesn't even ring true : in other words, this was a man's film.Indeed, it could have been to political thrillers what "Heat" was to the gangster genre, it could have been even longer, what a waste of performances, especially Aiello who was astonishing.</fullReview>

It's greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense. We know who the bad guys are from the beginning, and just follow along as they fall like dominoes. The film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex, but has forgotten to substitute good, clean romance or excitement in any other way. All the flavor of a good, flat decaffeinated diet cola. "Q&amp;A", which also takes place in New York, is a far better alternative, as is "LA Confidential".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Cusack, deputy-mayor to Al Pacino, develops evidence of corruption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"City Hall" (1996) is a fine neo-noir that I'd like to rate 3/4 or 7.5. I think it's underrated at its current IMDb 6.2. This movie has several clear strengths that lift it above the pack.One strength is the strong acting. Al Pacino is at the top of his form as mayor of New York City. John Cusack's performance here as deputy-mayor is excellent too, and it shows his range. His character is more sympathetic than some of those he's played in the past. Danny Aiello is terrific playing a Brooklyn political boss who has a close relationship to a Mafia don, Tony Franciosa. Martin Landau plays a judge who has been friendly with Pacino for a very long time. Bridget Fonda completes the main roles as an advocate. David Paymer is strong in support as are a number of players unfamiliar to me but who all carry the ball.The script is insightful, fresh and sharp. The story combines mainly political drama with a noir voyage of discovery led by Cusack as he looks into a violent incident at the start of the film that took 3 lives: a cop, a mob figure, and a 6-year old boy. The title accurately reflects that much of the story centers on the political activities of the mayor, as pressures are brought to bear on him from several sides. This is the milieu in which the noir elements of hidden deal-making, payoffs and corruption accumulate and eventually come to dominate the story.With the benefit of having seen several thousand films in the interim, I appreciated this film much more on this viewing than years ago when I first saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment considering the cast--especially a post-'Heat' Pacino!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of Al Pacino (from the likes of 'Heat', the 'Godfather' movies, and 'Dog Day Afternoon' especially) and having had a huge crush on Bridget Fonda ('Single White Female', anyone?) back in the day (Peter Fonda's famous daughter was named 85th sexiest star in film history, and Mrs. Danny Elfman hasn't been involved in film, unfortunately, since 2002), I was hugely disappointed in this film, especially since I had loved director Harold Becker's previous 'Sea of Love', which also starred Pacino. The first half was decent and involving, but it kind of slid off the rails, interest-wise for me, the rest of the way and got too talky and uninspired.I don't really know if the problem was with the script or its direction. I know I'm not the greatest John Cusack fan in the world (I find he's much better in comedy, like his sister Joan), but he had pretty good co-stars, whose talents were basically wasted, in Martin Landau, Anthony Franciosa and Danny Aiello (these guys were BORN for these roles and films, so on paper, this should have really worked out well). I had always wondered why this film had bombed so miserably, and now I know why. In cases like this, more should have been done to alter the story arc, just some basic tweaks, to make it more suspenseful and/or (though I usually balk at such 'Hollywood' tendencies) some romantic tension (a beauty such as Fonda's was misused--they may as well have hired someone else). All in all, a wasted opportunity that's worth a look if you like dramas about corruption--just don't go in with big expectations, and don't bother with a re-watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Naivety To Disillusionment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in New York City, this political drama is about an investigation into a shooting incident and also a young man's journey from naivety to disillusionment. The young man is Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack) who, after becoming fascinated by politics as a youngster in Louisiana, embarked on a career that led him to "The Big Apple" and his current role as Deputy Mayor of the city. He's energetic, highly-motivated and eager to learn all that he can from his boss Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino), who's obviously a well-intentioned man and a consummate politician.The always-busy Mayor's office is attempting to bring the Democratic Party Convention to the city and planning to build a bank amongst other things when news comes through about a shootout in a Brooklyn street. An exchange of fire between an undercover cop and a drug dealer had left both men dead and a stray bullet had also killed an innocent 6-year-old boy who'd had the misfortune to be close-by at the time. On hearing the news, Mayor Pappas swings into action immediately by launching an investigation (which Calhoun is appointed to lead) and then visiting the cop's widow and the boy's father before skilfully updating the media at a swiftly-convened press conference. Despite being advised that he wouldn't be welcomed by the congregation of the Harlem church where the boy's funeral is to be held, Pappas insists on attending and gives a stirring speech that's well-received by everyone present.Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda), an attorney who works for the Detectives' Endowment Association, is on hand to protect the reputation of the deceased cop and the interests of his widow. She takes an interest in Calhoun's investigation which focuses on, whose bullet killed the child, why the cop went to a meeting with a drug dealer without any back-up and why the drug dealer had been paroled rather than jailed for the serious crimes he'd committed in the recent past.Calhoun's investigation reveals that the boy had been killed by the drug dealer's bullet and that the decision to parole the young criminal had been made as a result of a conspiracy involving the drug dealer's Mafia-boss/uncle, Paul Zapatti (Tony Franciosa), a Brooklyn politician called Frank Anselmo (Danny Aiello) and Judge Walter Stern (Martin Landau). A couple of these men become immediate casualties of the conspiracy but others soon follow.There was a lot of talent on board in the making of this movie as a couple of members of the writing team had previously been involved in classics like "Taxi Driver", "Casino" and "Goodfellas" and Ken Lipper had served as Deputy Mayor of New York City under Mayor Ed Koch. Lipper's input in particular must've been important and is, no doubt, the reason why the dialogue in "City Hall" is so realistic and incisive.It's great to see Al Pacino in a role that's so perfect for him as he comfortably displays the flamboyance, charisma and shrewdness of John Pappas and delivers the kind of speeches that would be expected of a politician of his calibre. It's also enjoyable to watch the slick way in which his character's political instincts kick in whenever he has to deal with a difficult problem and also his skill in handling different types of people. John Cusack, in his understated way, also does well in portraying the transition that Calhoun goes through as he matures both as a politician and a man. Tony Franciosa and Martin Landau are especially good in their supporting roles and Danny Aiello makes a tremendous impression as a political operator with a penchant for the music of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein."City Hall" shows very adeptly how many deals, compromises and accommodations have to be made in order to achieve anything of any significance and also implicitly questions how anyone can keep their integrity in such a milieu. It's these qualities that ultimately make this movie so thought-provoking as well as entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al Pacino has again managed to make good out of what would probably be a bad movie. Pacino holds the whole thing together in a great performance as always as the mayor of New York. After the accidental death of a six year old boy the deputy mayor also a great performance by John Cusack, and Bridget Fonda investigate the matter they find themself is a pool of corruption. It is sometimes confusing due to the high amout of characters and the script is at time uneaen but is worth while because of the great performance by Pacino</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film tries too much and manages only to be a combination of earnest and confusing. Both Pacino and Cusack are fighting hard for something but it's difficult to find much in the way of stakes in most of what is going on, with the result that they both end up looking like so much ado about nothing. Bridget Fonda is totally lost and manages only to portray her character as dull, more the fault of the script than the actor. There's some nice character work, such as that of Richard Schiff, now getting well deserved kudos on 'The West Wing', and another veteran, Mel Winkler. Finally, it's a mystery why everything is so darkly lit. Maybe on some subconscious level the cinimatographer didn't want us to see what was going on. After all, he may have reasoned that we weren't about to understand it anyhow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Little Nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw City Hall on NBC about four years ago and thought that this movie was perfect for TV. With a couple of judicious language cuts and some clumsy edits for violence, the movie came to the little screen essentially intact. Unfortunately, City Hall is such a pleasant and vacant little "thriller," you probably will have forgotten it by the time you get up from in front of the TV to stretch.There's almost nothing here in this pedestrian story of city hall corruption! Al Pacino is just fine as the mayor of New York, a man who keeps hammering home to his staff, headed by the Pillsbury Doughboy incarnate, John Cusack, that if it's good for the city, it's good. Cusack looks as if he needs to be put back in the oven for another ten minutes. Bridget Fonda is all pretty hair and nice legs and freshly scrubbed cardboard. Danny Aiello plays, well, Danny Aiello. The other person of interest in the movie, Tony Franciosa, has been around a long, long time (and he is just so interesting to watch, even though he doesn't have much to do).There's an interesting sub-plot wherein Pacino is working very hard to bring the 1996 Democratic National Convention to town. Senator Ernest Hollings makes a nice appearance with Pacino and other bigwigs at a dinner party, and his cameo adds a bit of gravitas to this fluffy little Harold Becker film.Pacino is just plain fun to watch as he chews the scenery, and makes it look very much like good governance. Cusack doesn't fare so well. He has a great voice (and the sound recording of the actors is crisp and melodious), but at one point or another, you have to wonder how, really, this Louisiana transplant, Kevin Calhoun, got to be the Deputy Mayor of New York City. He tells Fonda something about politics being in all Louisianans' blood streams. Then he goes back to fighting corruption.Does anyone see the irony here? Oh, well. The movie is over, the dead cop's wife has got his pension, the baddies are locked up or have moved on, Cusack is chunkily cheerful (and has Fonda, with those spiffy gams and happy face), Pacino has apparently retired to practice law, and you can't remember what you did for the last two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really like this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it's New York City, Al Pacino is the charismatic Mayor with White House ambitions and John Cusack his southern(!) Deputy Mayor. There is a shoot out between an evil drug dealer and a cop, both of them are killed as well as a young child caught in the crossfire. The drug dealer is part of a notorious crime family, and the media discovers that the last time in court he should have gotten 10-20 instead of probation, and should have been long off the streets. Cusack is troubled by how this could have happened and jumps in with both feet, attractive Fonda tags along because she is counsel for the cop's family once the cop becomes disgraced. There you have it in a nutshell. I am sure there are issues with the realism of this including how and why a Deputy Mayor would get so deeply involved in this sort of investigation, but Pacino plays the Mayor to a textured T and Cusack is always fine as the idealistic young man. My favorite performance, an even more textured one, is by Danny Aiello as the local political boss dealing with eerie mobster Tony Franciosa. I like every twist and turn of this movie and every major role; whether it is realistic or not the interaction between the players is superb. I have seen it several times and rate it Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack) is a loyal deputy mayor who admires Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) of NYC. He is ambitious and a real operator. A simple day gets turn on its head when off-duty police detective Eddie Santos meets with Tino Zapatti nephew of a mob boss. They get into a shootout which kills them and a 6 six year boy. There are questions about Santos and police lawyer Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda) defends his name. There is also a question about a light sentence headed down on Zapatti by Judge Walter Stern (Martin Landau) who is an old friend of the mayor. Kevin has to fight to uncover the truth which includes crooked politician Frank Anselmo (Danny Aiello).It's a bit scattered with lots of characters all with their own agendas. It has a lot of great scenes with Al Pacino as the all-knowing mayor. Cusack is also great as the idealistic operator. It's a good sprawling political thriller. I love all the backroom talks, the glad-handing, the political deals, the crooked politicians and the underhanded maneuvers. It's a fine political drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CITY HALLI don't know why I watch political films. I am not a very political person and I am the first person to admit that I don't understand politics some of the time... but this movie stars Al Pacino.A cop meets up with a member of a gangster family which ends up in a shoot out... during the shoot out a stray bullet hits a 6 year old boy and kills him. The deputy mayor investigates what happened and realises there is a lot more than meets the eye.This is a drama that was very interesting. It was horrible seeing the boy getting shot. I am a father of 2 children and I really don't know what I would do if I lost either of them. Watching a scene like that really scares me and brings home that it really could happen to anyone. All it takes is to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.There are some shocking scenes in this movie, but in general it is quite a slow film. There is a lot of dialogue which you have to listen to otherwise you could miss a big plot twist. I don't mind a lot of dialogue, but if it is political I will struggle to understand it. Thankfully this film was not that bad to follow.Some of the plot twists were quite predictable but others I didn't see coming at all.The acting was brilliant from everyone. Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda are the lead cast members. I can't really fault anyones performance.It was OK... It is one of those movies that I am happy I watched, but I doubt I will ever watch it again.I will give this film 6 out of 10."The virgin looks pregnant to me"For more reviews please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best acted political films you will see. At the beginning you get a good idea of some of the wheeling and dealing the local politicians do just to get votes and keep various factions satisfied.There are four writers credited with the screenplay and three of those are recognised top drawer writers. It is obvious that the film has gone through various manifestations, gestations, rewrites and conceptual readjustments before a final, locked script emerged.The film dealing with a shooting that leaves a cop dead as well as an innocent child sets off a chain of events that leads to political skulduggery.While others might find the film hard going, even dense, there is no denying the quality of the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie - but a bit disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the DVD cover of this movie, the Norwegian distributor had tagged as a "political thriller". It's about the intrigues and murders around the mayor of New York (played by Al Pacino), but is it a thriller? For me the first commandment for a thriller is excitement and good pace, and this movie lacks that. It is also a bit predictable. but I will describe it more like a political drama more than a thriller.I'm surely not an American, so I will not fully understand the political system in the US. What I pick up from newspapers and TV is almost all about corruption and fraud. Yes, this is a movie and not reality - but there's a touch of real life in every movie, there is a rotten apple in every basket, even in little Norway.my favorite actor Al Pacino gave a very good performance, although it's too quiet behind him. An extra point to John Cusack and Danny Aiello as well. On the other hand I got the feeling that I've seen the story before, the lone ranger and his girl fighting to expose the big political conspiracy, so I would like to see more originality in the plot. The advantage for betting on a well known horse such as Pacino is that they can't get too wrong - Pacino saved the movie, I'll blame the writers for the rest. There is a lot of skilled actors involved here, it's too bad they weren't able to show what they really can do; they to little to work with. But all in all this is not a bad movie, but I did feel a little disappointment - maybe I expected too much. But Al was good as always.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacino's soliloquy at the funeral of the murdered child is nothing short of incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film did not do well at the box office, probably because the drama is mostly in the dialog. There are a few tense moments, but most of the suspense and tension in the film come from Pacino's dynamic personality and Cusack's charm. Which is not to say the film is without merit. As a political thriller, it is probably more accurate in the way events are handled than most. You see the people in the mix, you see the steps that have to be taken, and you see the politics involved. Pacino's soliloquy at the funeral of the murdered child is nothing short of incredible, but soliloquy is what Al does best. Splendid performances by Aiello, Landau, Paymer, and Schiff fill out the plot with color and flair, and almost make up for the lackluster Fonda and the much too stereotypical Franciosa. Not at the top of my list, but definitely not at the bottom. Collectible if you are a lover of Pacino or Cusack, rated R for language and violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, What Else Is New?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Idealistic Louisiana-born John Cusack (as Kevin Calhoun) moves to New York City, where he impresses up-and-coming politician Al Pacino (as John Pappas) enough to become the Mayor's right hand man. The story begins with a shoot-out in Brooklyn, involving a gangster drug dealer and "off-duty" policeman. Unfortunately, an innocent six-year-old boy is shot dead in their crossfire. Naturally, this arouses a heightened interest in justice from the press, police, and public. Mayor Pacino tries to manage the unfolding drama with an eye on keeping his and Gotham City's reputation intact; he is considering a run for the White House, and is bidding on the upcoming Democratic Convention.Deputy Mayor Cusack joins the investigation, on his mentor's behalf. Pretty Bridget Fonda (as Marybeth Cogan) is added to up the feminine quotient, obviously; following one of the story's funerals, she and Cusack have a great car scene. Singing Rogers and Hammerstein songs, Danny Aiello (as Frank Anselmo) leads a terrific supporting cast. "City Hall" is so predictable, reviewers and studio publicity (like the DVD sleeve description) routinely hint at the film's big revelation; it was suppose to unravel slowly, but is painfully obvious too early on - in fact, the film's events, except for the opening boy's death, feel like a well-worn old pair of shoes. But, they are comfortable and fit nice.******* City Hall (2/16/96) Harold Becker ~ John Cusack, Al Pacino, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pileggi-Schrader Script In Which Silence Has Much More Inherent Meaning Than Speech.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Working from a script written in part by Nicholas Pileggi, best known for writing the book Wiseguy, which he adapted into the movie Goodfellas, and for writing the book and screenplay Casino, director Harold Becker shows how connected circles scratch each other's backs, even in the command of a comparatively honorable mayor like Pappas, who is regarded as a presidential prospect. As Cusack follows the paper trail of the dead mobster's probation report, his skepticism is agitated. How did this violent young man get probation rather than a jail sentence? We meet the other players in the plot, not the least of which is Danny Aiello, the political boss of Brooklyn, and Tony Franciosa, the Mafia boss whose nephew was shot dead. How and why these people are affiliated I leave to the movie to divulge, though there are never any misgivings that they are.The narrative is told generally through the eyes of the Cusack character, a visionary from Louisiana who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him. Much is made by everyone of bureaucratic knowledge passed down through the generations. Some of the dialogue is ungracefully erudite, but considering I just described the building blocks of the story as bureaucratic knowledge, one can't say it doesn't work. The shooting case builds against the seasoning of two other issues on the mayor's desk: a charge by Aiello for a subway stop and an off-ramp in Brooklyn to aid a new banking center, and the city's bid for the next Democratic convention. Individual idiosyncrasies are also explored, including Aiello's emotional bond with the music of Rogers and Hammerstein.Much also is made of menschkeit, a Yiddish expression, which, Pappas explains to his deputy, is about the bond of honor between two men, about what happens between the two hands in a handshake. This connection doesn't mean much to Bridget Fonda, the lawyer for the policeman's association who defends the dead cop's honor and fights for his widow's pension even as incriminating evidence appears. Little by little, the deputy mayor comes to grasp that menschkeit is such an influential notion that it outclasses he law.There are various scenes of hard impact, including one where the Brooklyn boss comes home for lunch in the middle of the day, his wife asserts her interest through the medium of the dish she has cooked, and then the Mafia boss drops in by surprise. There is also a compelling, and markedly conjectural, late scene between the mayor and his deputy.One scene handled with delicacy is comprised of the mayor's decision to speak at the funeral of the slain child, in a Harlem church. His advisers tell him he won't be wanted there. But he goes anyway, and cranks himself up for a spiel of unabashed hyperbole, Pacino and his character both.It gets an impressive reaction from the congregation, but the mayor knows, and his deputy knows, that it was artificial, and the way they scrupulously evade discussing it, in the limousine taking them away, is a subtle employment of composure and innuendo. This is a script that knows it has to supply Pacino with the reason why most of his fans go to see him, and immediately follows its quota with the reality that silence has much more inherent meaning than speech.Pacino and Cusack are convincing together throughout the movie, the older man unbreakable and aware, the younger one anxious to learn, but with ideals that don't sway. Pacino is innate with his down-to-earth capacity to marry common sense and inventive imagination, inspired flair and matter-of-fact realism. Cusack moves very freely in spite of his dark defensiveness.The Bridget Fonda subplot development is unnecessary, but it is a result of veteran screenwriter Paul Schrader's otherwise shrewdly perceptive belief in the worth of every character, and each is fleshed into earnest embodiments. Aiello, for instance, is a highlight because he evokes his character's joie de vivre and sensitivity to his environment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** When undercover Brooklyn North Det. Eddie Santos, Nestor Serrano,was to meet his drug supplier Tito Zapatti, Larry Romano, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in a buy and bust operation, with Tito being the one who gets busted, that things went haywire with both Det. Santos and Tito ending up getting shot and killed by each other. During the deadly shootout an innocent bystander six year-old James Bone Jr.,Jaliyl Lynn,was also killed in the cross-fire.With New York City slated to host the 1996 Democratic Presidential Convention that summer that last thing that the city's flamboyant Mayor Pappas, Al Pacino, wanted was a possible riot over young James Bones tragic death by a possible, in was later determined that it was a bullet from Tito's gun that killed young James, member of the New York City Police Department.What was far more shocking then even Bone's death is that his killer Tito Zapatti was given probation by the well respected NY State Judge Walter Stern, Martin Landau. When he should have been put behind bars for 10 to 20 years by being arrested with a kilo of cocaine in the backseat of his car! It soon became evident that the person who got Judge Stern his job, for a $50,000.00 payoff, was non other the Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo, Danny Aiello. It's Anselmo who's involved with Mayor Pappas in a land deal, involving the New York Subway System, that would bring him and his real estate friends tens of millions of dollars over the next two years! It would also indirectly connect Mayor Pappas in the Bone killing by connecting him to Judge Stern, who made it possible for Tito be be free, who's a mutual friend of both him and his Gomba, or Landsman, Frank Anselmo!To keep all this from blowing up the late Det. Santons is framed, by working undercover without the authority from his superiors, in the Bone shooting. In fact those framing Santos go as far and hiding some $40,000.00 in cash in his upstate summer home making it look like he was being paid off by Tito's uncle Mafia boss Paul Zapatti, Anthony Francoisa, for letting his nephew deal drugs with him getting a piece of the action. Which may well explain him, as well as Tito, getting shot by Tito welshing on his paying Santos off!As things turn out it's Mayor Pappas' deputy in City Hall Kevin Calhoun, John Cusack, who ends up messing everything up for his boss by being too honest in finding who was responsible in covering up Tito's criminal record that allowed him to be out on the streets. The facts that Kevin uncovered lead straight to Frank Anselmo, a major political supporter of Mayor Pappas, who as it turned out was connected by the hip to Tito's Mafia chieftain Uncle Paul!A bit over-plotted "City Hall" does show how big city corruption can filter up, as well as down, to everyone in city government without them, like Mayor Pappas, even knowing about it. Mayor Pappas biggest sin was that he was friends with Brooklyn Boss Anselmo who was putting people into jobs, like Judge Stern, who were subjected to being blackmailed from Anselmo's real boss Mafioso Paul Zapatti.***SPOILERS*** It only took a deadly shootout in Williamsburg to set everything into motion not by only Tito, besides Det. Santos and James Bone, being killed but why he was allowed to be out on the street in order to bring the very popular New York City Mayor down. Mayor Pappas was looking forward to much bigger things, like Governor or even President, in his future political pursuits. As it turned out his top deputy Kevin Calhoun in not looking the other way was responsible for his demise. As well as that of the Mayor's good friend Frank Anselmo and the person whom he helped put on the bench, as a state judge, Judge Stern. Who's decision in letting Tito Zapatti off made this whole disaster, which resulted in at least a half dozen murders and one suicide, possible!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crucial situation but rather banal altogether</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film concerns a classic theme. In fact it concerns the theme exploited by Batman, from beginning to end, but in real data and details. The mayor of New York, appreciated and very diligent and dynamic, in order to get some project through slightly faster than normal, yields to some pressure from some private business contractors about a criminal drug dealer who should have been sent and kept in prison and he pressurizes the judge in his turn to set him free on probation in spite of a negative probation report that disappears but is not destroyed, be it only because of the political value it represents. And what was to happen happens and a few people, including a black schoolboy is killed in a shoot out between a police detective and that criminal. The city may explode because of it: racial tension because of the black school boy and social tension because of the insecurity such criminals free to roam around and go on with their criminal activities represent to the public. Unluckily the film does not show that tension very well and follows the investigation of the first deputy mayor who wants to find out the truth and does find it out. But along the way a few witnesses are killed, and those who had played some role in the whole business are forced to retire (the judge), to end their career and life (the contractor or the contractor's go between), a public officer who was ready to deliver the disappeared probation report, and some shady character after he provides some crucial information. The mayor himself retires and takes a long vacation; But the main interest of the film is in the exploration of the contortions the mayor is doing to cover up the problem and the contortions he remembers having done in the past that led to the mistake about this probation case. The political philosophy that nothing is pure white or pure black and that everything is grey which is never comfortable to decision makers is invoked as an excuse for wrong but profitable decisions. We are not speaking of necessary compromises to get to some consensus in some domains that are crucial to public interest. We are speaking of considering as less important to take a bad decision about some petty or supposedly petty criminal than some infrastructure or economic project in the city. That is not typical of New York. That is true in any mayoral office. It is just more significant in quantity and in quality in a big metropolitan area like New York and of course in a city or country where police departments are municipal and are controlled by political imperatives. The young deputy mayor is thus pushing the old mayor out of the way, and he derails his ambition to be the governor of New York in order to become the president of the US. The mayor is perfect due to the embodiment Al Pacino offers us since he is able to express ten minutes of dialogue with one facial expression that makes the whole dialogue useless. I find the end slightly mushy with the ex-deputy mayor campaigning in his own name. That seems to mean that he was so attached to justice because he saw his chance to push the mayor out of his own way. Hence he is not better than all the others, just still too young in his ambition.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politically intriguing and a breath taking Pacino performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City Hall takes on the politics of a city rather than country, state or any sort of major political table. Granted it shines on New York City which is a huge political arena, especially nowadays, but it still goes for a smaller scale and puts the microscope on a few key players in a city wide scandal stumbled on by the mayor's right hand. Director Harold Becker is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done Mercury Rising, Malice, and Domestic Disturbance and I think in many ways he incorporates so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault. I mean City Hall is meant to be a political drama, not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and potatoes of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand out...what else...or rather who else...Al Pacino. The film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the mayoral office and the inner workings of the city. As the film continues it broadens its political spectrum to include a democratic boss, and his connections and then we are introduced to some of the goings on within the city. As events unfold a mystery begins and the political aspect is kind of left in the background but it still has a brilliant set up.I absolutely hate talking about Al Pacino. I mean even if ONCE he didn't give a good performance how could I ever say it? The man is acting royalty. There is just something brilliant about his entire demeanor. In City Hall Pacino plays the New York City mayor. He has a sense of duty and honor and immediately appears to be a very upstanding politician. He also delivers one of the most powerful and outright engaging speeches I've ever seen at the 'James Bone' Funeral. I re-watched that speech four times and the first time I watched Pacino give it, my mouth gaped open and I almost wanted to stand up and applaud. Its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by Pacino. John Cusack, who I really do enjoy as an actor, turns in a mediocre and overdone performance as the deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun. He is kind of the focus of the film and him and Pacino have good chemistry together when they are on screen but there is just something in this performance...he seems like he's trying too hard. His accent is just bizarre, and although he is supposed to be cutthroat and intimidating he doesn't get seem to pull it off. Maybe he was having an off film. Bridget Fonda, on her way out of her high point stardom does an okay job as attorney for police widows Marybeth Cogan. Her performance is very similar to Cusack's in that she just doesn't seem to find her groove with this character. Danny Aiello is terrific although his character is a little under explored as democratic boss with ties to the mafia Frank Anselmo. Martin Landau makes a decent cameo as Judge under scrutiny Walter Stern.The problem with City Hall is evident in my review of the characters and actors. Everyone is...okay. There is a lot of back story that they try to bring out without actually showing it and it unfortunately leaves you just a little bit confused about the whole conspiracy. And of course you have Al Pacino in a rather small supporting role but he's absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film. It almost feels like maybe they are intimidated by him being on screen with them. So City Hall could have been this huge political epic drama/thriller but it felt cut and toned down to an average run of the mill one BUT it still has to be seen for Pacino and a different spin on the inner working of politics. If you just won't see this movie than find Pacino's speech at James Bone funeral because the word electrifying doesn't seem to give it justice but you can see what makes Al Pacino so incredible because in a mediocre film he pulls out this wallop of a speech and makes you feel it. If you're a John Cusack fan which I am...he's definitely done better but he is the main character and all in all he does get his justice. A decent movie but unfortunately potential loss. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quiet Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the quiet noir of the first part, the acting of Pacino and Cusak, especially their scenes together. The moodiness of the setting and the juxtaposition of the old pol and the idealistic youth was effecting. I wish Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the movie; she was an earnest and appealing character. The film went off the rails for me when the assistant mayor starting snooping around the mafioso to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly didn't want him meddling in. Nobody in their right mind would meet a mafioso on an abandoned dock in a junkyard. Here the story became implausible. Something that I don't understand: why did the cop and Vito have a shootout if the latter was delivering info that could bring down the corrupt judge?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's Al Pacino but little else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certain actors capable of elevating even the lamest films to high degrees of watchability simply on the basis of their talent alone. Al Pacino is one such actor. Time and again Pacino finds himself immersed in a quagmire of dreadful direction, dulling dialog and sodden secondary actors. Yet always Pacino's awesome screen presence manages to make the film worth viewing. Recent examples displaying this phenomenon include, "Devil's advocate", "Any given sunday" and the urban political drama, "City Hall".In "City Hall" Pacino plays John Pappas the greatest mayor in New York City history according to his good ole' boy Deputy mayor played lamely by John Cusack. As the film opens, things are going well for the Pappas administration. His people oriented policies and disarming personality have his popularity ratings soaring. Even his political opponents admit he is doing a heck of job running the big apple. But then an early morning shootout between an off duty police officer and the nephew of a mafia kingpin threatens to unravel all Pappas has worked to build. In addition to its two participants the shooting claims the life of a young boy on his way to school. Privately investigating the matter the deputy mayor and the slain policeman's widow's Lawyer played by Bridget Fonda, uncover evidence the mobsters nephew got a free ride on his last conviction.As the duo digs deeper it becomes apparent that someone in the administration pulled some strings to lessen the nephew's sentence. But who is the mysterious someone? Is only person involved? How deeply into the mob bosses pocket are they? And how high up the administrative ladder does the corruption go?City Hall wants us to be intrigued by these questions. But we are not. Cusack and Fonda are so out of their depth that it is hard to take them seriously. Only when Pacino enters the fray does the movie become interesting. No matter if he is cutting deals with local party bosses, greasing national democratic party bigwigs, or comforting mourners of the slain boy; Pacino's performance is absolutely riveting.Unfortunately, Mayor Pappas is merely a supporting character in "City Hall". Worse he disappears for much of the middle portion of the film. A pity to say the least. If Mayor Pappas had been the center of focus "City Hall" might have been a classic movie rather than an average, uneven one. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well-Made Political Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New York City has a charismatic, 'can-do' mayor. John Pappas is a politician to his core, a tough, smart operator who is also a consummate media performer. We see him grandstanding for the cameras and cutting deals with Tammany Hall pork-barrellers like Frankie Anselmo. Pappas is able and ambitious, and his eyes are fixed on the White House. Pappas' deputy is Kevin Calhoun, the right-hand man who virtually runs the city on his boss's behalf, and never ever fumbles the ball. A native of Louisiana, Calhoun enjoys likening himself to Huey Long - but although he shares his hero's political acumen, he proves himself to have rather more scruples. A street incident, seemingly unconnected in any way with the mayor's office, reverberates through City Hall and begins to impact on the lives of Pappas and Calhoun. A cop meets an informer 'off the record', and bullets fly. The fallout from this tragedy gradually lifts the lid on a cesspool of graft and corruption. Who are the guilty men? How high does this thing go? Pacino is always value for money, and he is great in this high-octane portrayal of Pappas, the nice guy who inhabits the grey areas of morality. He delivers a mighty funeral oration over the coffin of a dead child, but we are left wondering whether one single word of it was sincerely felt. Pappas imitates the cadences of a gospel preacher and exploits the emotions of a grieving congregation - but by what right is he even present at the service? This is the film in which John Cusack comes of age as a movie star. The teen comedies are emphatically behind him now. He portrays Calhoun as a man of diamond-hard intelligence and integrity who cleans out the sleaze and restores the notion of public service to politics. Cusack carries the film, and does it very ably. Danny Aiello's career took a long time to flower, but by the mid 1990's he was undeniably a 'name'. Here, he plays with great flair the part of Frank Anselmo, the Borough Boss with Mafia connections. Two well-known actors play their roles so well that they are difficult to recognise: Martin Landau is solemn and convincing as Judge Stern, and Tony Franciosa comes close to stealing the show as Paul Zapatti, the 'godfather'. The real star of the picture is politics itself. Lipper and Schrader's first-class screenplay is drenched in the flavour of politics. Fast-talking New Yorkers make pitches for or against new property development projects, and mayoral policies are vigorously promoted or expediently shelved - sometimes vigorously promoted, THEN expediently shelved. Pappas accuses his deputy of acting like a gumshoe in a dime novel, and he has a point. Perhaps the film stretches our credulity a little too far in asking us to accept that a smart, sophisticated politician like Calhoun would ever get involved in dangerous detective work of this kind. Another shortcoming is the character of Mary Beth, the lawyer played by Bridget Fonda, a part which has 'token' written all over it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogged down in the bureaucracy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold Becker is a director you can trust, that is, if you're Al Pacino. If you're just some stiff with $8.00 for a movie ticket, then 'let the buyer beware' should be your credo.I am not a big Pacino fan, feeling he only plays one character well, and that one I'm way past tired. John Cusack, on the other hand, is a different story. Next to him Pacino has a good chance of looking good here, and he does.What Bridget Fonda or her character is doing, I have no idea. The role she plays here is so meaningless you have to wonder if she put some money in the picture herself. In the fast moving world of Hollywood's careers, one rarely recovers from this Waterworld sized mistake. She gets her mortgage paid, I'm sure, but we get absolutely nothing in return. The on-screen chemistry between Fonda and Cusack rivals the Jodie Foster-Matthew McConaghey pairing in "Contact", (or Lisa Marie Presley and anybody), for lack of heat.The story? Who knows? It wanders aimlessly (like New York City bureaucracy) to an unsatisfactory, or no real conclusion (like New York City bureaucracy). If the purpose was to show us that even those with best of intentions.(can't get anything done) well we know that already. Maybe that there is a fine line between the good guys and the bad guys.but we know that already.That a Harold Becker movie will leave you less than satisfied..we know that already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm sorry, but it's really not that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies where I sat and tried my hardest to watch it straight through. However, hard as it tried, "City Hall" failed to capture my attention for much of its long-seeming run. Still, I felt bad that I had not given it much of a chance, so when it came on TV another time, I decided to watch it again...and still felt pretty bored. I don't know what it was. Maybe crime dramas just aren't really my thing, and "City Hall" has crime. As it is with a lot of crime movies, nobody is really much what they seem in "City Hall."Adding on to the weakness is the characters. John Cusack is given a meaty role to portray, and he somewhat succeeds, but...lacks something. Charm, maybe. Bridget Fonda is also rather charisma-free in her role, and Danny Aiello appears in what his seemingly his "millionth" role as some mobster. Can we say typecasting? As for Al Pacino, whom most people tended to treat as the star of the film, though he justfully deserves to be about fourth billed, I'm not exactly sure what he was trying to prove. As the mayor of New York, Pacino spends most of his time either in an office or hobnobbing with the social elite. Neither of these situations amount to a great part, or even much of a pointful one (not that they could have had the movie without him, though). A particularly amusing example of this is when he is giving a speech at a funeral. Despite Al's audience being a crowd of mourning "lower class" men and women, Al was shrieking and waving his hands and acting like he was about to lead the Revolution. Now dramatic acting is always nice to a scene, but it does have its limits. And unfortunately, that scene was toward the begining, when the film still had a little life.By the middle of the film, all life has been drained away and the petty crime sub-plot has taken its place. I think even the cast members were begining to feel drained by the lack of anything exciting. When Al and the other men of importance are at an opera house and somebody is raising trouble in the lobby, even the actors who were playing the guards meant to protect ol' Al don't seem to care about his predicament, as they glance dolefully around the hall with expressions of boredom. And these actors (one was John Slattery of the TV series Feds) know what they're doing too. It just says something about the quality of the film they were stuck with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Think of it as colours. There's black, and there's white, and in between is mostly grey. That's us. Now grey is a tough colour, because it's not as simple as black and white - and for the media, certainly not as interesting. But... it's what we are." ? Mayor Pappas A better third "Godfather" film than "Godfather 3", Harold Becker's "City Hall" stars Al Pacino as John Pappas, a New York mayor who's struggling to cope with the fallout of a recent homicide. Assisting Pappas is Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack), an idealistic deputy mayor.Much of "City Hall" takes the format of a noirish detective movie in which Calhoun uncovers the genre's usual morass of corruption, conspiracy and underhanded deals. A naive youngster from small-town Louisiana, Calhoun learns to both ditch his naivety and accept that high profile politics is a game rife with Machiavellian monsters. One such monster is Mayor Pappas, a charismatic master of realpolitik who floats between shadows, boardrooms and richly varnished woodwork like a late-career Michael Corleone. Pappas hopes to run for President, and like all self-deceiving villains, spends most of his time rationalizing everything he does in the name of "the greater good". Pappas may break a few rules, crack a few eggs, he says, but he's doing it for the city. For you.Pacino, unsurprisingly, injects Shakespearean grandeur into his character. He is the Greek scion of the megalopolis, treating Pappas' life as a theatre show, feigning compassion and humanity before lizard lips. Part of the fun of the movie is observing the way Pappas operates, stroking egos, placating enemies, winking at his own manipulations. Always juggling balls (contracts, business deals etc) in the air, he's more concerned with "menschkeite" - a Yiddish phrase meaning the bonds of honour between men of power ? than his City and its occupants."City Hall" is no David Simon's "The Wire", an HBO TV series which attempted to sketch the workings of a large neo-liberal city, including several of its major organs (see too 1948's "The Naked City"). But it nevertheless does well to suggest the sheer size of New York City, the sheer interconnectedness and complexity of its social institutions, and the labyrinthine, vast and messy ways bureaucracies are run. At its best, "City Hall's" central mystery is used as a means of taking us on an inside-the-network tour of New York's political apparatus and, again like "The Wire", does well to show how the machine maintains power, how this power relates to different ethnic groups, and how cities turn otherwise well-meaning human beings into budget-brained pragmatists with so many conflicting loyalties, constituencies, and priorities that the essence of compromise starts flowing naturally through their veins. And of course, lording over this beautiful cesspit is John Pappas. Pacino ? always an actor in love with scenery chewing ? plays Pappas as the ultimate showman; a devil who delights in giving rousing speeches. One iconic moment sees Pacino unloading a giant monologue upon a crowded church. Whilst most actors would play the scene straight, Pacino disgorges his monologue with tongue firmly in cheek, amplifying the insincerity of Pappas' words. The film then climaxes with a beautiful scene in which Calhoun and Pappas square off in a tiny room. On the surface, their conversation is about Pappas' journey from idealism to corruption, but look closer and you can see Pappas subtly manipulating Calhon, trying to influence the young Deputy Mayor into pardoning him whilst also hinting that Calhoun will one day suffer his own personal fall from grace."City Hall" ultimately collapses into clichs (and a familiar "coming of age" climax). Still, Pacino is always entertaining, writers Paul Schrader and Nicholas Pileggi manage some good moments, and the film is rather unique in terms of mid-1990s, mainstream political thrillers. It was co-written by Ken Lipper, deputy mayor of New York under Ed Koch.7.9/10 - Worth two viewings. Makes a good companion piece to "The Contender", "Prince of the City" and "The Wire".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CITY HALL is a somewhat mixed bag. Part vignettes of NYC political life, and part moralizing tale. Al Pacino, a Dukakis-esque Boss with Presidential dreams, gives an oft times sullen or subdued performance. There's a couple times when he chews the scenery, and in the case of CITY HALL, this is where he shines. John Cusack gives a subdued and generally flawless performance, without going into caricature of a New Orleans dialect, or sliding into melodrama during the films climax. Danny Aiello as a burrough political chief, is also very good. I love showtunes, too.The major problem with CITY HALL, and it is a good movie in many ways, is the general feeling of a lack of momentum. It comes off more like a documentary, than a motion picture. We see the action or follow the story from a detached perspective, and naturally, the viewer doesn't become involved. When the viewer doesn't get involved to a certain degree, they become apathetic towards the characters, and eventually, the plot.This tends to alienate, and what should have been a riveting, detail divulging finale, came off as a "Hmmm...uh...okay." They say you "Can't fight city hall," as the tread worn cliche goes. Yet, it still can't stop you from thinking what might have been, if they had just tightened up the screenplay and pacing of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al Pacino is at his best when he overacts - I enjoyed him immensely in Devil's Advocate. In City Hall, his performance is good, but not thrilling. In one obsequy, the screenplay does give him a chance to pound the floorboards, and it's enjoyable to watch him turn a potentially hostile audience into roaring enthusiasts.But what of the rest of the film? John Cusack gets a miserable character, full of so many inconsistencies one wonders if his role was designed by committee. Bridget Fonda - and her character - don't even belong in the film. The only suspense SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER for me was wondering whether Danny Aiello's character - probably the best role in the film - would commit suicide on or off camera. Too bad director chose wrong again on that one.But the whole story is so weak and predictable that I kept myself amused only by looking for production inconsistencies. LA Confidential is a far better example of the genre.</fullReview>

Why had it even been saved? 4. Why did Judge Stern resign for taking bribes, when we later learn that the Mayor had been giving him orders? Did he bend the rules for the bribes, or for the Mayor? 5.

		<fullReview>We often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics, but I still recommend "City Hall". In a role he was born to play, Al Pacino stars as New York's mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy. But it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect. In this movie, the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal. No matter how much you trust any given politician, you may have your doubts after watching this movie.I understand that I can't name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays, but that's not the point. If we had idealistic impressions of those at the top, this movie tears such ideas down. Certainly one that I encourage you to see.

It was great being able to go beyond the doors of City Hall and see what it looked like in the lobby and through out the entire building. Al Pacino,(Mayor John Pappas),"Gigli",'03, gave an outstanding performance through out the entire picture, and especially when he gave a speech at an African American Church for a little boy who was slain. John Cusack,(Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun),"Runaway Jury",'03, was a devoted servant to the Mayor and worshiped him in everything he attempted to accomplish. Bridget Fonda,(Marybeth Cogan), starts to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and gives a great supporting role.

		<shortDescription>Great Possibilities, no delivery....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City Hall is one of those hopeful yet ultimately frustrating films that never really delivers toward its potential. It's as if the characters, the plot, and the pacing of the film were kept apart throughout filming, and then only introduced in the editing room.The film begins with a lackluster conflict, the accidental shooting of a child by a drug dealer with relatives in the NY mob families who looks as if he came directly from Central Casting, and acts just as stiff. Before we even know anything about this character, he's confronted by a possibly corrupt cop ( the entire background motivation and confusion regarding the cop's rational for meeting with the drug dealer alone, without backup and without reporting in first is left completely unresolved...don't look for answers by the end of the film), gunfire is exchanged, and everyone is dead, including the innocent child, who is clearly injected into this formula for nothing more than aesthetic/emotional purposes, and is treated like "cinema-chum", shot dead for instant sympathy by the audience, only to draw in the bigger fish in the water, the primary characters.On the heels of the shooting, we are introduced to our principles, Al Pacino as the mayor, John Cusack as the deputy mayor, single-handedly managing the entirety of New York. The completely contrived setup of the administration of a city the size of New York being managed, at least from all appearances we are given on screen, by these two characters is beyond laughable...its' insipid. Very little backstory toward the actual operations of a City Hall, the interlying politics required to operate a major city, other than another contrived conversation between Al Pacino and Danny Aiello later in the film regarding quid pro quo negotiations for construction in a borough of the city.The central plot of the movie springs from the reaction by City Hall to this one shooting incident, as the world is (we suppose) put on temporary pause for days afterward in New York by this event. Cusack abandons his supposed position with City Hall and becomes a knee-jerk Mickey Spilane, trodding beside Bridget Fonda on some half-ass investigation of the politics surrounding the now dead cop, suspected of corruption, and the question of why the drug dealer was ever on the streets in the first place, having been questionably released on parole years before. Everyone phones in their performances, which appears as if everyone approached the movie with high hopes, then got distracted by something better to do, (possibly calling their agents for better scripts once this movie started filming) and just showed up to through with the dialogue.Numerous gaffs, faux pauxs regarding life in New York, cornball accents by Cusack, Fonda's character operating with the depth of a spring puddle, vanilla backgrounds, boring dialogue ( save Al Pacino's impassioned, yet ultimately weak tirades toward the shooting of James Bone and his personal conversations with Pappas) make for a really unsatisfying film....so much potential for more here.Avoid it. As much as it pains me to recommend against Al Pacino and John Cusack, actors I really enjoy, City Hall just can't deliver and feels like a TV movie of the week.Recommendations: Better political play on a national basis in Thirteen Days and the Contender.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair-to-middling drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pretty mediocre movie, neither completely awful nor particularly gripping. John Cusack is the young, ambitious deputy mayor to Al Pacino. One of the movie's main problems is that Cusack has the lead role but his character isn't very interesting. He plays a transplanted Southerner determined to help pave the way to the White House (James Carville, anyone?) for his father-figure Mayor Pacino. A shoot-out at the beginning of the movie that leaves a cop, a felon, and a young boy dead unearths possible corruption in the courts, leading the idealistic and inquisitive Cusack on a trail that may lead back into his very own office (don't want to give anything away, but the video box says as much).Much of the movie's two hour run-time is stuffed with chatter to show the atmosphere of the New York political scene, but ultimately it just fills like filler because there's not much of a payoff, as the scandal that is eventually unveiled is as simple as 1-2-3. Bridget Fonda has third billing but her role is a minor one (maybe 20 minutes of screen time) as the lawyer representing the dead cop's family. Mostly, she seems to be around to give Cusack a love interest and gives a pretty dull performance. Pacino alternates between being bombastic (in his supposedly charismatic moments) and just looking plain tired. Cusack is saddled with a ridiculous "Louisiana" accent that comes and goes. This is definitely not the best work of any three of these normally good actors. Overall, the movie's probably okay if it's on TV and there's nothing much else to do, otherwise it's not a real compelling watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing Political Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City Hall is a rather interesting, if not by the books political thriller that highlights the everyday corruption we see in American politics. It's not really eye-opening, but it's relevant in today's world despite the film being made eighteen years ago. This film is not about what happens on the outside, but what happens on the inside. Those who want to study politics may want to check out this film.Harold Becker's film is about how a scandal which involved a dead cop and a dead six-year-old, changed the lives of the mayor and his deputy mayor. The mayor, John Pappas is known for his brilliance and the deputy mayor, Kevin Calhoun is just as smart. But when a lawyer accuses the mayor of corruption, Calhoun must decide whether to follow his idol or to part sides.The acting is pretty good for the most part. Al Pacino has done better roles in his career, but though he seems to not particularly try here, he seems to do an okay job. John Cusack was excellent, and this is one of his better roles of the 90's. I don't understand why Bridget Fonda is in this movie since her character really is of no relevance, but I guess she did fine. Danny Aiello was excellent as the corrupt political boss of Brooklyn.Overall, City Hall is little above average political thriller that is extremely predictable, but still quite enjoyable and thrilling. It tells a good lesson about corruption in politics, but the story could have used some tweaking. But all-in-all, I was able to enjoy the film for what it is: A good, old-fashioned political thriller. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>living in jersey for over 10 years and visiting n y c , i am very fond of this film,, John Cusack knocks the ball out of the park with this one, possibly his greatest work,, save for the Jack Bull. a little boy get's killed by in a shootout between a dirty cop and a gangster, john plays the deputy mayor,, brigette fonda is excellent in this film as well playing opposite john,, Al Pacino plays the Mayor of the great city of New York City who buy the way is also trying to get the Democratic National Convention to come there instead of Miami, so there is a lot of political wheeling and dealing there,, this film is a fascinating look at political life in the big city, and what happens between gangsters and politicians..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is among the best political ones to depict what I lived in France since 10 years and especially the last five ones: what's a corrupt democracy ? In those situations, the elected ones have indeed a fabulous live: for the public, they are real demagogues, making beautiful and moving speeches while in reality, they use their authority and public goods to serve their own private interest. The difference between this movie and my reality is that those American shameful politicians when caught red handed are quick to resign or worst while in my country, they are totally immune. So, beware, this isn't a simple movie: if you miss the beginning, it's hard to understand as the facts are speedy and come from everywhere. Thus, the audience runs in all the NYC boroughs and the movie is really alive and interesting. At last, the casting is wonderful: I never appreciated Aiello and I was happy to see him playing a bastard. Cusac is perfect as a idealistic young man, Bridget was a courageous and sympathetic lawyer and Al gives us something else than to be a cop and i'm sure Vito would be pleased!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I will say this is the worst movie of Al Pacino, and this is not his mistake. I don't really know what the director was thinking while making the movie. If you have to make it a political drama, make one. But if you have to make it a murder mystery, than have it like that. I don't really know why people liked this movie so much (giving it 6 and 7 Rating, as it does not deserve it). This is simply a waste of time. People who want to watch the Political Dramas, they are well aware of the fact that the Politicians are far more intelligent than the ones shown in the story. And if they do bad things, they don't simply give up so easily. Everyone seemed to know what was happening, and no one seemed to react it. How come some one be so neglecting to incoming danger? It is natural for people having power to find the negative ways, and solve the issues, especially when they have already done something negative. It looks like they were all waiting for the climax to just pop up, and then say... 'Ah! What the..." For some reasons, the climax seemed to be obvious since the middle of the movie.3/10 only for Al Pacino. I really liked the way he delivered his Passionate speeches. I won't say it was a completely boring movie, but many people won't enjoy it. I only did because of being Al-Pacino Frenzy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admittedly, I find Al Pacino to be a guilty pleasure. He was a fine actor until Scent of a Woman, where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably. I hoped this film, of which I'd heard almost nothing growing up, would be a nice little gem. An overlooked, ahead-of-its-time, intelligent and engaging city-political thriller. It's not.City Hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters, names, and "realistic" citywide issues, that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating, that once you find out the truth, it will blow your mind. In truth, however, these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as Corruption of Power, Two-Faced Politicians, Mafia with Police ties, etc. And theoretically, this setup allows for some thrilling tension, the fear that none of the characters are safe, and anything could happen! But again, it really doesn't.Unfortunately, the only things that happen are quite predictable, and we're left with several "confession" monologues, that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the "real world" of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider-web of lies and cover-ups, the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal. I don't think we're left with that in City Hall, and while it's a very full film, I don't find it altogether rich.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cusack plays the NY mayor's right hand man who journeys on a moral crusade and finds the truth under his door mat. Pacino does a fine job as the mayor. The script has its moments with the dialogue but the story goes wishy-washy and leaves you with what you expected. You do have to worry when four script writers are credited for this poor effort by Becker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>smart, well-crafted movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I appreciate movies like this: smart and well-crafted, entertaining, absorbing, well-acted and nicely directed. Nobody -- even Pacino -- is chewing the scenery*, trying to stand out; one of the film's most effective moments (Aielo pulling over at his beloved off ramp) is chilling precisely because of its restraint.Not as good as, say, QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL is of a similar cloth: engaging the mind as well as eye, ear, and heart. Why such well-hewn entertainment flops at the box office is anybody's guess.*You know, Pacino does chew it up in one particular scene, but precisely because it's required. Great scene, too.</fullReview>
