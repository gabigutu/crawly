		<shortDescription>The Perfect Finale to a Wonderful Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a loyal fan of the Back to the Future phenomenon, I long awaited a chance to publish my take on the series. It may be a bit surprising to some that I would choose to write my comments in the section specific to the last movie which has been considered to be the worst film of the trilogy.For many years, in consideration of this one trilogy which served to inspire and excite me as to possibilities of the motion picture industry, I would look with a disappointment on BTTF Part Three, believing it to be an unwelcome, unexciting film which ended the legacy.However, recently it came upon me to purchase the trilogy on VHS and re-experience it, as I had once did, though now from a more balanced perspective. I watched the first two Back to the Future movies avoided the third in the fear of being once again disappointed. Utter disappointment is no longer the feeling I can use to describe my take of the movie.Back to the Future 3 is a well-written, well-directed, well-balanced piece. With an incredible musical score, brilliant acting and excellent composition, the movie reminded me that Back to the Future was never about action. It was truly about the characters we came to know and love in the first movie. It was a return to the basics, the friendship between Marty and Doc and how each was thrown through time to change not only the future of Hill Valley, but also their own lives and their future choices.Robert Zemeckis' (the writer) decision to send the two friends back to 1885, in their final adventure, was brilliant. Imagery like the "famous Hill Valley courthouse under construction" and the "steam engine train wheeling up to the rear of the futuristic Delorean" was unforgettable. For example, the dancing at the Courthouse welcoming festivities contrasted with the action-laden scene (in BTTF2) between Griff and Marty at the same place just a century and a half later.All in all, Back to the Future Part Three was a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy. To anyone who despises this film, I recommend another full watching. There are so many details which are kudos out to fans of the previous two movies. The movie successfully slowed the pace of the other two movies (in preparation for conclusion) without losing the loyalty of true fans. It captured the essence of what brought these fans to Back to the Future in the first place.If you haven't seen it, rent and enjoy :) If you have seen it and wasn't particularly pleased, I beg another viewing.L8r!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as incredible as the first two, Back To The Future III provides two hours of great fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doc Brown and Marty McFly are back for another time travel adventure, and once again their exploits are great to watch. The film is well-written and directed, and all of the actors involved delivered spectacular performances once again. There could not have been a sharper contrast between the last Back To The Future and this one (we go from the neon colored future of flying cars and 3D movies to the old dirty west with its overflowing spittoons and gunfighting), yet the story holds together strongly and keeps the attention of the audience from start to finish.The old west was portrayed beautifully, although maybe a bit crudely and stereotypically, and the way that the town of Hill Valley was transformed for all three films is one of the biggest highlights of the series as a whole. In Back To The Future III, the challenges that face Doc and Marty are ingenius, and a solution to their problems is extremely difficult to think of, which makes it that much more fun to watch the film.Back To The Future III is an excellent way to have ended the trilogy, which as a whole is among the best trilogies ever made. What other group of movies follows the same characters through their adventures which take place in three different centuries? Clearly, Back To The Future III deserves a lot of respect, as do the previous two films. They are all a huge amount of fun to watch, and the films can be enjoyed by people of all ages, which is a quality that few films possess.If you haven't seen these films, go out and get them, and if you have seen them, you may want to go out and watch them again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marty, Doc, Zemeckis, And Gale pay homage to the Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having set a new standard in time travel films with Back To The Future and Back To The Future Part II, it was with eager anticipation that I looked forward to seeing if Robert Zemeckis could bring his trilogy to a satisfying conclusion. To conclude any trilogy in a successful manner some of the key ingredients you need are: 1. do something in your wrap up you haven't done before 2. keep the main characters true to what they have been previously 3. tie up all the loose threads and 4. give us a satisfying ending.For this third outing in the series, Zemeckis takes us where we have yet to tread, that being 1885 Hill Valley. With Marty trapped once again in the year 1955, he enlists the 1955 Doc Brown to help him return home. As we know by now, things are never that simple when it comes to Marty and Doc. Marty has no magic ruby slippers to click together three times and say, "There's no place like home." It seems Doc ended up in the Old West, but hid the DeLorean in a cave for Marty to find some 70 years later so he may return home back to 1985 and destroy the time machine. After discovering that Doc met with some misfortune shortly after arriving in 1885 Hill Valley, Marty decides to travel back in time to rescue him. While BTTFIII does not have the break neck frantic pace of Part II, it is a good film on its own. For the first time, Zemeckis slows things down a bit, making this third film straightforward, yet just as delightful in a lot of ways as the other films. The first thing he does is throw us a little change up. Zemeckis and Gale decide to center the complications of this third film around Doc Brown by having him fall unexpectedly in love with a school teacher by the name of Clara(Mary Steenburgen). In essence, Doc loses his head over a woman and loses his scientific reasoning in the process. It is left up to Marty to become the voice of reason when Doc begins to let his emotions rule his reactions. Yet, Marty seems as a amused as we are by the whole thing. This is one romance that could easily have been the downfall of this film, but thanks to the performances of Steenburgen and Christopher Lloyd, together they develop a chemistry that makes it all work and work to perfection. So by having the majority of the film take place in the old west, then introducing something to the plot we didn't expect, Zemeckis takes care of the first point I mentioned above. There's also the matter of Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen. The meanest, grimiest, filthiest, most ruthless outlaw to ever inhabit Hill Valley. If you liked Thomas F. Wilson's portrayals of Biff, you'll be amazed at his rambunctious portrayal of Mad Dog. He even somehow manages to top his villainous portrayals in the first two films which is not an easy task. So yes, all the characters from the first two films are here in some form or another, and though Doc Brown may be in love, he is still the Doc. This solidly takes care of my second point about keeping the characters true to what they have been before.Zemeckis and Gale have been absolute geniuses in writing these films. In each film they have taken little pieces from the previous films and make them essential to what's happening. For instance, if you've seen the second part there is a short scene that is extremely relevant to what goes on in the finale. When originally viewing it in Part II, I'm sure you never gave it a second thought. When the pay off comes in this film, you can't help but chuckle and say, oh I see. As for my third point about tying up loose ends, they do that and tie up some things we didn't even know were loose ends.In Part II, it was necessary for several of the actors to play different roles. This one is no different. Besides being Marty Mcfly, Fox also portrays his ancestor Shamus Mcfly, who is Irish, and again Fox shows his versatility as Lea Thompson does as his wife Maggie. Of course James Tolkan is back as Strickland and theres a couple of good jokes about his character that will surprise you...well at least one of them will surprise you the other will just leave you laughing. As if all this wasn't good enough, Zemeckis also gives us several old western character actors, Dub Taylor, Pat Buttram, and Harry Carey Jr. Another great touch thrown in just for the fun of it.In reviewing the fist two parts of the trilogy, I failed to mention Alan Silvestri's terrific score. All three films owe a great deal of their success to it, and the fact that he was able to keep the same theme, yet do variations on it that perfectly fitted each film deserves as much credit as all the others responsible for making this film received.So what about point 4, a satisfying ending? Of course, you'll have to see the film to find out for yourself. I can only say that when Part 3 was over I felt a certain amount of sadness that the trilogy had ended. Even now when I watch the three films, I wish there had been a fourth, and a fifth. This was not because the ending of the third film left me unsatisfied in anyway, quite the contrary in fact. It was because I would miss not only the films themselves, but most of all the rich detail and characterizations brought to life for us by a wonderful cast, director, writers and the rest of the crew responsible for enabling us to enjoy one of the most memorable series of films ever. And when you live in my memory forever, you get my grade. For Back To The Future Part III it's an A+. As for the trilogy, there is no grade high enough, no rating high enough, for me to give it the award it so richly deserves. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picking up where #2 left off, Marty is stuck in 1955 again and has to explain to the 1955 Doc why he's back and uses a letter Doc sends him from 1885 to explain what happened. After fixing up the time machine (hidden in a from 1885 cave), they find out that Doc is murdered in the past by Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen (played by Thomas F. Wilson) "over a matter of $80 dollars." So Marty decides to go back and rescue Doc before the murder can occur, but he is bedeviled by a rip in the fuel line - meaning they have to find another way to get the time machine to hit 88 miles per hour - and Doc falling in love with school teacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen). Along the way, he gets advice both from Doc and his 1885 ancestor Seamus McFly (also played by Michael J. Fox) that he should really learn to control his temper.Fox and Lloyd are fun to watch as always, and I give my hat off to the studio for hiring Mary Steenburgen as Doc's love interest and not some super model type; it's more fitting of who Doc is. Wilson's Biff Tannen officially became a traditional "villain" in #2 with him murdering George McFly, and now Wilson plays an even bigger villain in Buford Tannen, whom he makes both funny and menacing.Ironically, Wilson is said to be a very nice man in real life. Leah Thompson makes the most of a thankless dual role as both Lorraine McFly and Marty's great, great grandmother Maggie McFly, and James Tolkan plays his Principal character's soft spoken law man ancestor (killed in a deleted scene by Buford Tannen; "Remember son... discipline.")It should be noted that originally there were no sequels planned with the first movie; that bit with Doc taking Marty and Jennifer to the future to help their kids was just another gag. But the film was such a hit that the studio couldn't NOT do sequels, so this one and part 2 were filmed back to back, which is becoming more of a craze these days.Although on the surface it's a lighthearted comedy about time travel, it's also about what it means to be a man. The first film defined being a man through violently standing up to your tormentors, while this film and #2 go with the theme that being a man also means you have to reign yourself in when people start annoying you. Marty' willingness to fight back was his strength in the first film but here it is his flaw, as people in both 2015, 1955 and 1885 continually get his goat. The message of self-control is bluntly stated when Doc says to Marty "You can' t keep going off the handle every time someone calls you a name, that's why you get into that accident in the future!" (referring of course to the car accident mentioned in part 2). It is not until Marty realizes his error when he's about to meet Buford in the gun fight that he achieves this ideal and, much to Seamus's glee, says of Buford and the opinions surrounding him "He's an asshole! I don't care what Tannen says, and I don't care what anyone else says either!" Because of this, he is able to avoid said accident.Also loaded with gags, references to other great westerns ("My name is Clint Eastwood.") and Doc's response to being asked if his hijacking the train is a hold up: "It's a science experiment!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The difficult third part in the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even in the best franchises which proved that sequels can be just as good, if not better than the originals, the third parts are often fairly controversial. Look no further than to the third entries in "The Godfather" and "The Terminator" movies. "Back To The Future III" is no exception to that rule as it clearly is the weakest part in the trilogy, but it's still one hell of a great ride.Writer/producer Bob Gale and writer/director Robert Zemeckis are two very clever men. They know the difficulties of sequels well. As Zemeckis explains somewhere on the "BTTF"-DVD set, the hardest part is to give the audience something new without moving too far away from the original's spirit. "Back To The Future II" achieved that goal gloriously (although Zemeckis who is very critical about his own work is always downsizing the greatness of it). Maybe the two Bobs went a bit too far away from what audiences loved about the original in part 3.Although the movie is set mainly in the Wild West, it's still seen through the eyes of two people from the 80's. There are shootouts, horse chases and train robberies, but "Back To The Future III" is never a real Western. What makes this movie seem different from its predecessors is that fittingly it doesn't have a lot to do with teen culture anymore (save for a Michael Jackson-reference). Marty himself seems to have grown up quite a bit and you'll be surprised to see him behaving more focused on his mission than Doc in the latter half of the movie. This change of places by the characters was a deliberate decision by the writers and it does push the story and the relationship of Marty and Doc forward, but something about it just doesn't feel right.It's intriguing to learn about the origins of Hill Valley and the ancestors of the McFly-clan. However, the earnest Seamus McFly and his family - that for some reason includes a woman looking like Marty's mother - seem strangely out of place in a BTTF-movie. They're just not quirky enough. What makes the story seem even more estranged is the introduction of a new character, Clara Clayton, with whom Doc falls madly in love. Now, although we should all be happy for Doc having found his own private happiness, somehow we don't want him to behave like that. It's not Doc as we know and love him - and that's exactly the problem Robert Zemeckis was talking about. Marty and Doc used to be a team. Was anyone happy for John when Yoko got between him and The Beatles?I still think "Back To The Future III" is an amazing accomplishment, a fine finale to one of the best trilogies ever made. You can't give enough praise to Zemeckis and Gale for not just making these movies for financial reasons but for actually trying to make them as good as possible. Personally, I love this movie to bits and I don't think it could have been realized any better. The only explanation I got for why this brilliant sequel got a lukewarm rating of 6.7 from IMDb users, is the dilemma Zemeckis himself was aware of, but couldn't fully avoid.Fans who are still longing for a fourth part should keep that in mind and would be best advised to let it go. Zemeckis and Gale have said repeatedly that they don't plan on ever continuing the story. And why should they? Everything has been said, everything has been done. The movies are perfect the way they are. Let's be thankful there are still filmmakers that stick to their artistic conviction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree that most of the time sequels to great movies are no good. Get to the third installment and it's become a joke. One of the lone exceptions to this rule is Back to the Future Part III. It's just a perfect movie. Entertaining, intelligent, and funny it is a hoot for fans of the first movie. Back to the Future is one franchise where all three movies are worthy of your attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie makes a great end for the Back To The Future trilogy. I didn't think that I would like it much because it was about the old west, but I loved it! Michael J. Fox shows off his talents again, by playing Marty McFly, and his old relative in the west. The only part I didn't like was the ending. I'd really like to find out what happens to all the characters years later. But overall, an awesome film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most fun of the three.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part III, the wild west entry, is probably the most fun. The original has just such a fantastic premise that creates a sense of urgency about seeing it out till the end, but there is something uncomfortable about your mother having a crush on you that leaves a bad taste in the mouth during Part I. The premise of Part III is this: in 1955, Doc learns that he will eventually travel back to 1885 to live out his days as a blacksmith, but then Copernicus, Doc's 1955 dog, stumbles upon a gravestone that tells Doc and Marty that Doc will be shot to death by Buford Tannen over a matter of 80 dollars. Naturally, Marty says he will travel back to 1885 and get Doc and bring him back to the future with him (though it couldn't be 1955, because there's already one Doc there).There are time-jumping laws that are not obeyed by the scriptwriters here, and much worse than in the second film, but this one's so well concentrated and so much the better movie that they hardly matter. It has a climax involving a train that rivals the clocktower climax of the first one. A fantastic scene.Thomas F Wilson, the perennial bad guy of these movies, who started off as Biff Tannen in the original, played Griff Tannen in the second one, throws himself into a Yosemite Sam part as Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen in the third. Mary Steenbergen, in one of her few leading roles, is a nice addition to the cast. She fits right into the wild west world, as the dainty schoolteacher who plays "his beloved Clara" to the Doc.Like the others, its larger-than-life tone, with the over-blown time-travel dialogue and melodramatic highs and lows, render it into a kind of live-action cartoon. Kids will enjoy Part III the most, but it is so good-natured that adults should have fun with it too. Out of the three, this is the one that you'll be able to put on any time and feel good. Great, harmless fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conclusion Of A Trilogy That Is Sheer Fun, Excitement &amp; Energy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marty and doc are back, but in another time. They go to the West in 1885 in order to save Doc's life and from then on the Western adventure takes place. It's a pity that so many people disliked the third movie because, in my humble opinion, it's a great finale to this fantastic trilogy. It is very well written with rich characters and clever dialogues. This third part does differ in the sense that it's set in the West and has less of the futuristic gadgets and gizmos (obviously, since it's not set in the distant future but you'll still see a few including a time-travelling freight train) but it still retains the same energy, a different kind of action and it pays a nice homage to Western classics. Fox and Lloyd continue their roles of the teen hero and the crazy doctor (and it never gets old) but this time there's a new female lead. Mary Steenburgen delivers a hilariously wonderful performance as the ditsy Clara. She and Lloyd are funny and sweet together. Clara is the perfect lady for Doc and Steenburgen fits the part like a glove. This time, Lea Thompson appears as an Irish settler. Zemeckis has brilliantly picked up from where the second one ended. The film ends on a delightful note and I would have liked to see more 'Back to The Future' movies. But, I'm still very pleased with the way it is. There have been only very few trilogies that have impressed me overall. My list includes names like Ray's 'Apu Trilogy' and Coppola's 'Godfather' trilogy and of course Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part 3-I'm afraid there's not enough room in this De Lauren for the two of us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I just finished the Back to the Future trilogy and all I have to say is that I was pleasantly surprised and relieved that I finally had the opportunity to see these films. Without a doubt, the first was my favorite, the second was my second favorite, and the third worked, but it didn't work as well as the other two movies. Part three worked the same formulas from the first and second, but some of the situations just seemed a tad too unrealistic.Marty and The Doc are now in the Wild Wild West way back in 1885, and as you know the tools are not quite advanced as they are in 1985, so they have to figure out the best they can on how to get back to the future. But Doc falls in love with a woman he saves from going over a cliff, Clara, and Marty has been challenged by Mad Dog, or Biff in a different generation, to a duel. This is a major problem since Marty found a tombstone in the future with a possibility of having either his or Doc's name on it.Well, I'm really glad that I had the opportunity to see these Back to the Future films, because they were good movies. I have to say that I was wrong, I tried to stay away from these films, I'll admit, because it just seemed so hokey and not my type of movie, but I think that's a major problem we all need to work on and not be so judgmental before we typecast a movie that we think we won't like because we might end up with little treasures.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Zemeckis' Back To The Future rocks !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Back To The Future part 2, I was really looking forward to see the third part because it's the exact sequel of the second. In fact, Back To The Future part 2 has no end in itself. You have to see the last part of the trilogy to know the end of the adventure. That's why I saw the third part just after the second =D.In this movie the main character, the young Marty McFly (Michael J.Fox), has to go back to 1885 in order to find his long-time friend and eminent scientist Emmett Brown. Doc has been accidentally sent to the old Far West at the end of the second movie and this film tells Marty's journey to find his friend and go back to the present.I am really fond of the first two movies so I had a little apprehension about this one. I was afraid I might be bored or disappointed. But this is a really good film too. The universe is kind of different because the action takes place a century before so it isn't boring at all. Moreover, even if the characters are involved in a cowboys story, they're still themselves and I am still crazy about them. They fit perfectly in their role and, as in the other movies, Marty meets some people of his family. He meets some bad guys too, and the worst is part of Biff Tannen's family, as usual.My favorite scene happens at the end, just before Marty and Doc finally go back home. They really are in trouble because Buff Tannen, Biff's ancestor, wants to shoot them and Marty uses a trick he learned in the previous movie. I like this sort of links between the parts of the trilogy very much.I really love this movie and I would recommend it to anyone who saw the first ones. Not only is the plot as good and funny as usual, but there has been a really good effort in the camera-work to make the film look like a classic western.This is really a cult movie in the Sci-Fi world and in my opinion, it's a shame there haven't been other sequels. There's never too much Back To The Future and you never get enough !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to the Old West ... Back to the Roots ... Back to the Future ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And here comes the conclusion of one of the finest and most likable cinematic trilogies: "Back to the Future Part III", more than a sequel, a resourcing in the spirit that made the first film such an endearing classic, with an even more escapist value in the setting, the Far West during the 1880's. As a Sci-Fi Family Romantic Comedy, "Back to the Future Part III" is already a winner, but the Western is the defining aspect of its originality. "Back to the Future Part III" was directly made after the second, basically recycling the same material, and using the same team, the same casting etc. The continuity between the two films is so determining that there's no way watching the second without getting immediately to the third, it's like keeping in touch with the same family. Indeed, as much as I can watch the first one alone, because it's a class on its own and a film I consider slightly independent from the two sequels, on the other hand, I consider the sequels too connected to each other not to be seen in a row. This continuity helps to appreciate the second part that feels more like a link between the two other films while "Part III" resurrects the spirit of the first one by focusing on the emotionality rather than the eternal "back to the future" mission.This has always been Marty's preoccupation and the thrust of the trilogy but the travels also had the merit to solve some familial issues and help a beloved character to improve something in his life, if anything, the trilogy defines the notion of 'coming-of-age' as the inspirational aspect of the film, its encouragement for success through self-improvement. But since people were facing less materialistic issues than during the 80's, I guess there was a need to take some distance from these so-called philosophies of successes and a huge step back one century earlier when the 80's followed the Secession War and preceded the Industrial Revolution that would lead to demise of the frontier spirit. The Far West is less a setting or an era, than a state of mind, embodying the roots of the American spirit in its purest form, before greed and profit perverted its meaning. The Far West setting perfectly fitted the tormenting desire of Doc Emmett Brown for retirement and a tacit existential quest for love.Consequently, while the central character of the first film was George McFly and the second part focused on the McFly Family, Gale and Zemeckis took the last film as a great opportunity to enrich the character of Doc Brown and close his story's arc through a love story in order to replace the "mad scientist" label by a necessary element of three-dimensionality. On the surface, Marty's mission is to prevent Brown from being killed by the villain who ?for our greatest delight- is Biff's ancestor, Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen, but while Marty and Doc try to find a solution to push the DeLorean to 88 mph, destiny puts them in Clara's path. So Doc meets Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), a teacher whose fate was to fall in the Shonash ravine canyon and give it a posthumous name.At that point of the trilogy, we're all aware of the time travels' mechanisms, we can even be surprised by Marty's incapability "to reason fourth-dimensionally", who he traveled so much. But here, the film invites us to put all the scientific stuff into perspective and think of the real elements that predefine our fates. There's a strong philosophical material hidden behind the love story as the film concludes its approach on time travels with the idea that nothing is written except by our free will and our capacity not to let external elements direct our lives. But I may make the film sound too intellectual when it's also a great comedy and one hell of a western.The film is the opportunity to rediscover and say goodbye to the wonderful characters of Hill Valley, to see the first McFlys in American land, to witness the inauguration of the clock tower which, as Doc said, was fitting that he and Marty could witness, not to mention Marty pretending to be named Clint Eastwood, at the risk of tarnishing this name by becoming the biggest yellow belly in the Old West. And the delight on the comedic level is in the way the humor works on a meta-referential level as if the film was breaking an imperceptible fourth wall, playing on its own trademarks. I can't resist to the scene where Marty, realizing that he might be killed instead of Doc utters a "Great Scott" followed by Doc's comment "I know this is heavy", when Marty wonders why they always have to "cut these things so damn close" or when, in the most dramatic situations, he reacts by an ironic 'perfect'.And speaking of dramatic, the film also provides great thrilling moments you'd expect from a Western, and probably the most heart-pounding climax from the trilogy with the train sequence, so suspenseful, I remember I had to pause for seconds the first time I watched it. This was one of the few times, I needed to take a break because it was just too suspenseful, but what a fitting and rewarding conclusion. Action, escapism, duels, stage, rides, Indians, cavalry, "Back to the Future Part III" is also an independent homage to the Western genre with some exhilarating moments, served by Alan Silvestri's terrific score, probably his best work in the trilogy.And this is why I consider "Back to the Future" as the greatest trilogy after "The Godfather" with a slight advantage that remains the consistency in terms of spirit, thrills, laughs and emotional value. So thank you Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale, Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and all the team for these three unforgettable classics!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a fun film that has all the elements of any genre known to man, just watch Back to the Future Part III. This film has sci-fi, horror, romance, comedy, tragedy, drama, and inspiration all bound together to make a film that you will never forget. Back to the Future Part III is thought to just be a fun film for the whole family. However, it is more than that. It's a film about the growth and knowledge of a young man. The journey Marty Mcfly takes in this film gives him the understanding of life that is unrivaled to anything else a motion picture could show. In the end this is a great film that has an excellent quote about life by Doc Brown, "Your future hasn't been written yet, no ones has. Your future is whatever you make it. So make it a good one, both of you."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great conclusion to Back to the Future series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second and final sequel to one of the most iconic movies in cinematic history closes the series out with a bang, where Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) journeys to the year 1885 to save Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown (Christopher Lloyd) from a fatal duel with Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson). This is also Marty's last chance to travel back to his own time with no more time interference.The special effects team really did an awesome job in making the time travel elements seem spectacular but realistic-looking, especially the DeLorean, and the cinematography of the Old Wild West was detailed and captures the 1800s feel very well.Just like the first two movies, the direction by Robert Zemeckis was well-paced from start to finish, making the film intriguing throughout, from Marty meeting his ancestors in the old west to Doc meeting schoolteacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen). Their sudden love-at-first-sight attraction complicates the travel travel plans of Marty, adding suspense to the film. And, Marty skirmishing with Tanner is just entertaining to watch.Spot-on acting by Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenbrugen, Thomas F. Wilson and Lea Thompson. They all made the film engaging and I especially liked their portrayals of old wild west people. The romantic subplot slows the story's pacing down a bit, but the race against time plot makes this sequel another edge-of-your-seat experience and is a great conclusion to the Back to the Future series.Grade A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third TIME's a Charm!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoiler Alert!) At the end of PART II, Marty's trapped back in 1955. Doc is trapped back in 1885. Young Doc is frantic and confused that Marty is still in the past. Through a letter, older Doc sends word to Marty about where to find and how to repair the time machine. Upon learning that older Doc is destined to die at the hands of a gunman, Marty decides to take one last trip in the Delorean. FLASH! In 1885, he comes across his relatives (but hides that fact by calling himself Clint Eastwood), runs a-foul of some gunmen led by Mad Dog Tannen, and eventually tracks down Doc. Now, they have to find a way back to 1985. But... There's a lot of story crammed into this one. Almost rivaling the complex plot of PART II. In this one, the focus is more on Doc as the main character. Though he's trying hard to leave the past alone, he falls in love with Clara, a schoolmarm. Which is tearing him apart: Should he stay or should he go? (Why doesn't he just bring Clara along?) We also get to see some of his ingenious inventions, including a gigantic fridge. Some viewers have come to consider this the weakest entry, but I disagree. Of the entire series, this one focuses most on the relationship between the various characters. It's a film with heart. And it has the coolest finale of all! So what are you waiting for? YEE-HAW, GO AND SEE IT!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As much fun as you can have in the Old West - 90%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a reason why I left the final part of the trilogy to be reviewed, other than watching the series chronologically. There are a small number of films that I hold dear to my heart, regardless of their flaws and plot-holes - something Part 3 has in abundance. The reasons why I can forgive in this case and not in so many others is, quite simply, this is one of the most fun films I've ever seen and remains so. It may feel as artificial and sanitised as a boy band cover version. It might not even make much sense, especially if the complicated middle film left you behind. But it's what used to be called a ripping yarn, full of danger and romance, excitement and humour. It's the most complete of the three and the most enjoyable and I'll always wish I could write a movie like this.Having received the Doc's letter at the end of Part 2, Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) returns to the 1955 version of Doctor Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who's still celebrating sending Marty back in the first place. Upon discovering that the Doc is shot and killed by one of Biff's ancestors, Mad Dog Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) in 1885 - a few days after sending Marty his letter - Marty decides to ignore the Doc's wishes to be left alone and heads back to 1885 to try and save the Doc. Except things get complicated, naturally - the DeLorean's fuel runs dry, meaning it can't get to the magic 88 mph to time-travel. Not only that but the Doc has fallen hard for newly-arrived teacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) and Mad Dog decides that if he can't kill the Doc then he'll settle for Marty instead...I've criticised other sequels for recycling material and jokes from their predecessors and "Back To The Future: Part 3" is also guilty of this. The same situations, the same scenarios and the same conclusions. But fittingly for a time-travelling adventure, it's not so much about the destination but the journey and the movie offers a riotous combination of western, comedy, sci-fi and love story in equal measures. Forget trying to follow the plot intricacies and inconsistencies because none of it will make much sense. Stop trying to pick apart the performances because Fox &amp; Lloyd still make a great team, even if Steenburgen hasn't as much to do as the boys. Personally, I'd make Wilson the MVP - his bad-ass bandito routine feels much more threatening than the various incarnations of Biff we've known over the years. The setting is also flawless, even if it's the opposite of the likes of "Deadwood". Every dollar of the film's budget is on screen and every cent of it is geared towards providing the audience with a pleasingly straight-up story that manages to converge on several points in time and wrap the series up in fine fashion.If you wanted to mark the film down as being barely coherent, repetitive and not as intelligent as the two first films then go ahead. But for me, none of these things prevent "Back To The Future: Part 3" from being a hugely enjoyable experience and my favourite of the three. In fact, the only thing I didn't like was the very ending which contradicted everything we'd expect from the Doc and didn't feel even remotely plausible - which is some achievement in a movie about time travel! At the end of the day, a film should always try to entertain at the very least. It might inform, educate, scare or inspire but it should always entertain and happily, "Back To The Future: Part 3" is an undeniable success in this department. It's not clever or as tight as its two parent films but it remains a shining jewel of a movie, the last dying light from an Eighties phenomenon. If you can find the series on Blu-Ray then I implore you to track it down because you and your family will enjoy them for years to come. And if you've seen them before, it pays to revisit because these films are much better than you may remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Provides Utter Joy At Present Just Like When It Was Initially Released</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The final installment in the Back to the Future trilogy picks up where the second film left off, but it casts off the dizzying time travel of the first two films for mostly routine comedy set in the Old West.This science fiction comedy was directed by Robert Zemeckis and starred Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenburgen, Thomas F. Wilson, and Lea Thompson. It takes place immediately after the events of Back to the Future Part II. While stranded in 1955, Marty McFly discovers that his friend Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown was killed by Biff Tannen's great- grandfather Buford. Marty decides to travel to 1885 to rescue Doc and return to his own time line.In the movie,Marty McFly receives a 70-year-old letter from his inventor friend, Doc Brown, who tells Marty that he has retreated a century in time to live out a relatively quiet life in the Old West. Doc Brown reveals that he hid his DeLorean car/time machine in an abandoned mine outside town, and when Marty does some research and discovers that the Doc died shortly after writing the letter, he decides to find the car, travel back in time, and warn the Doc about his demise. Meanwhile, the Doc, who has fallen in love with a local woman, realizes he can't hide in the past from the problems he has caused to the time flow in the previous two adventures. He reluctantly decides to return to the present with Marty, but first, they have to find a way to get the DeLorean up to time-travel velocity with a broken fuel line and no gasoline. The simplicity of plot, and the wide expansiveness of its use of space, are a refreshing change from the convoluted, visually cramped and cluttered second part.Also,this is a good deal more likable because the product plugs have been held back, and Zemeckis is clearly having fun alluding to his favorite westerns; there's also a certain sweetness and charm in the Lloyd-Steenburgen romance.In addition to that,it avoids many of the previous sequel's narrative and logical pitfalls and reengages more successfully with the simple, direct pleasures that made the first film such a hit. It was an utter joy in 1990 when it was released and again when the viewer watches it at present.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best trilogies in film history wraps up with its own unique flare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a whole I absolutely adore the Back To The Future trilogy. It is easily one of my all time favourite series' of films. In watching them again recently, I was immediately struck with how well the series has aged in plot, characters and special effects but also how completely different each instalment of this series is. Usually with any series of films, they all have a common style and feel like Lord of The Rings or Star Wars and certainly Back To The Future seamlessly fits together but each and every one of them is as different as they possibly can be. Back To The Future 3 played on Zemeckis' love of old school Westerns (something I feel as well) and he does it nearly perfectly. If you step back and look at this movie and ignore the time travel aspect, it holds its own as a Western. You have the dusty Western town, the old tavern, gun fights, festivals, trains and robberies. It has everything and that makes it incredibly fun. Add in to the fact that you already are completely hooked on Marty and Doc's adventure and everything they've been through and this is one of the most fun times you can have watching a movie. They couldn't have wrapped this up much better than this.Cleverly, each and every instalment of this series is fresh and they do that by keeping the main characters ever evolving. The difference between the Marty McFly of Back To The Future 1 and 2 was very evident and this time Marty is sort of more like he was in the first film. Christopher Lloyd's Doc is the one who gets the huge character development this time around. It doesn't matter how you shake it, Michael J. Fox and Christopher LLoyd are flat out amazing in their respective roles and they have amazing chemistry opposite each other. Lloyd's Doc Brown is significantly less zany and eccentric and more controlled and gets to fall in love and he's the level headed one this time around. He is by far more heroic in this sequel and we, as fans, welcome that!! Mary Steenburgen joins the cast as Lloyd's love interest and she is terrific. She is just a tad bit cheesy and sort of southern school ma'arm type and it works perfect. She has terrific chemistry with Lloyd and the only downside is we don't get to see more from her. She is a welcomed addition to the cast. Thomas F. Wilson proves his villainous versatility yet again playing "Mad Dog" Tannen, the crazy wild west killer and does it perfectly. He even gets to play it more seriously than his previous Biff incarnations. Lea Thompson is one again reduced but this time is just barely a cameo in the movie which is a little unfortunate since she was so good in the first film. Elisabeth Shue is also barely a blip on the casting list as Marty's girlfriend back in 1985.Nothing touches the first film. That movie is one of the best ever made period. However, Robert Zemeckis took that idea and went crazy with it in all the best ways and created two bizarre, out there, insanely fun sequels that are as different from the first as they are from each other. I could never tell you my favourite parts of "Back To The Future without listing a half dozen scenes from the second film and from this one. "Where'd you learn to shoot like that?" Pie plate Frisbee, the incredible climactic train scene at the end which easily rivals any of the best scenes of this trilogy or of any modern day blockbuster. Each and every time I watch it I am literally on the edge of my seat watching it. Its fantastic and Zemeckis proves why he is one of the best directors out there. No matter which instalment is your favourite you have to pay respect to how terrific they all are and you have to watch them as one giant epic and this one was as good as ever this time around. I look forward to watching my favourite trilogy again soon!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From one to three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I call The Back to the Future movies a trilogy set that was something a lot like the original "Star Wars" movies, and they made "Back to the Future Part III" a great part in all of this. "Back to the Future Part III" was practically an old-west situation with a good amount of science-fiction and humor through the whole thing.Through all of this, you're expecting to see someone get shot and killed in the old west, yet Marty is constantly beats the bad guys. I especially like the ending in the west, where Marty has everyone thinking he has been shot and killed by Biff Tannen, and then he gets up and simply beats him up having him unconscious and disgusted. This is a dream for nearly everyone to do to a bully.Watch the whole "Back to the Future" movies side by side and you will find the whole set, fun and amusing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Good It Stands on it's own! Great Comic Western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie stands on its own without Parts I or II. One of the greatest sequels ever! Doc invents several gadgets in 1885 that are both the implausible and impossible. Mary Steenburgen injects a great deal of energy into the film as the "schoolmarm" and "sweetheart" of Doc Brown. Her stunt woman-double can really ride that horse! Thomas Wilson also "runs away with the movie" as stupid villain Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen and shows that he can really act! Everything works here: Great sets, decoration, costumes, Marty's Irish ancestors. Lea Thompson (again) is fantastic. Real old-time Western actors in the saloon! "Doc" as the reluctant "sober" drunk! The changing tombstone picture! A winner all the way! "Mad Dog" commits very little serious violence and the movie is far better because of it! The "running gag" of the manure dump! The "riveting" Clint Eastwood "gag" of the metal stove-plate that saves Marty's life! The almost-mandatory "gunfight in the street"! The train scenes work seamlessly from beginning to end. The train-wreak and bridge-tracks are all opticals and miniatures. The ending is a real train-wreak as Marty barely misses being run over by a modern-day train when he gets back to 1985 and Doc appears from the past (with the whole family and "Einstein the Dog") on the most futuristic steam locomotive imaginable! One of our favorite Saturday afternoon movies. Actually better than Part I, but I don't have "11" stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as fun as the first two - Back to the Future III is wicked fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my! The Back to the Future film series is one of the biggest, greatest, most-loved, most-extraordinary film franchises of all time. Back to the Future III is incredible. It's genuinely just as good as the first two films in the series. Since this is the closing film (for now), it marks the ending to the films. Marty and Doc return for their (until otherwise stated) final time. Its theme is certainly all the wackier and is very enjoyable and fun. I think Back to the Future III's theme stands out from the other two films in the series. It's extremely bizarre and fantastic in every way! Back to the Future III has a fun start-to-finish and it engages the viewer from the very start. I can't think of a better way to end a great science-fiction film series. A fourth BTTF film would be astounding and very welcomed, but until then we have the perfect ending to the wonderful 80s franchise that leaves us in happiness and pure joy. Back to the Future III is awesome! 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Zemekis(along with actors Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown) return to complete the trilogy in this very entertaining and satisfying conclusion, which sees Marty stranded in 1955 after the older Dr. Brown is sent back to 1885 in the De Lorean. He is helped by the young Dr. Brown to use the same De Lorean(left behind in 1885 for Marty) to get back to 1985, but instead uses it to go back to 1885 to rescue him, since he learns that he'll be gunned down by Buford Tannen(Thomas Wilson again) Doc doesn't want to leave though, since he has fallen in love with a new schoolteacher Clara(played by Mary Steenburgen) who is also destined to die...Highly entertaining completion to the saga is great fun throughout, making clever use of its ideas and culture differences, but doing so with the same good-natured charm of the first. Grand ending with them reunited by the "train"...though a further installment has yet to arrive.(Which is fine by me!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Western end to one of the best franchises ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be completely honest. Until today, I have not seen a 'Back to the Future' film, though I've heard that they were great. I decided to watch the entire trilogy today and this to me, is one of the greatest film experiences of all time and will never regret the fact that I watched these films! I have absolutely fallen in love with the first two simply because of the story connection between the two, however hearing that the third and final installment was based in Western Times, I was thoroughly disappointed as I'm no fan of Western films. But boy, this has got me into Western movies as well! Like most would say, this is the "weakest" of the great trilogy but by no means is it that weak. Its a superb conclusion to one of the greatest franchises of all time and equal to my second favorite franchise1) Lord of the Rings (yes, I find it better) 2) Original Star Wars trilogy and Back to the Future trilogy Back to the Future has more of every element than what the first two did. There was a fine romance story thrown in and it did not feel out of place. In fact, most importantly, the whole thing felt realistic and had an impact to Doc. The scene where Mad Dog pretty much confirms that there will be a throw off between him and Marthy was hilarious! It was so unexpected. The fight between the two was also great and there were many shocks thrown across the film. At the end, when we are all left to assume that Doc died, I really was crying. He was one of the most lovable film characters for me but I also believed he would come back. However, when they kept delaying his return I started to believe that maybe a moral for Marty may be to let go of the past and future and move on but our good old pal comes back. These kind of scenes made me love the film more and more.I also loved the main theme song of the film. It had such a joyful feel to everything. It was absolutely perfect as was the acting in this film. Definitely a must see film but DO NOT watch this without watching the first two installments in its order. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's BTTF western style!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ending of Back To The Future Part II left most audiences a bit disappointed. That is however the true fans embraced the fact that Back To The Future would soon become a film trilogy.Picking up where we left off from the original sequel, Marty is stuck in 1955 with no Delorean. Doc Brown has been sent off to 1885 from a freak accident.Marty Mcfly is determined to see Doc Brown home to 1985. That is however when a charming Clara Clayton, (Mary Steenbergen) comes to town, Doc suddenly finds himself head over heals for her. While this is going on, Marty's short temper lands him a staged fight with the notorious Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen. Not only that, but the Delorean time machine is still not functioning correctly.The original theatrical release landed on Friday, May 24th, 1990 - Memorial Day weekend. Limited places around the United States were showing all three films back to back to back.What makes the third film exciting in it's own way is that this was a first chance to go into the wild west from the perspective of a time traveler, not somebody who was already there. This had never been done before, let alone having a time travel series reach a second sequel. The only other storyline that is remotely like this is A Yankie Doodle in King Arthur's Court, which is a plot that has been a bit over-exhausted.True fans of Back to The Future will no be disappointed. All of the main actors from the first two films returned, (minus Crispen Glover who had a few problems with the way his character was portrayed). Tom Wilson who plays Biff Tannen in the series made history by taking on multiple roles of the Tannen family members, Griff Tannen, Old Biff, Biff in 1985 and Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen.Rumors of a fourth film have gone across the web and back. It is in the contract with Universal and Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have stated that it ends with the third film. The only other versions were the Saturday morning cartoon that ran from 1991 to 1993 and the Ride at Universal from 1991 to 2007.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great part III and a great movie in general. While I liked the first two episodes, this one really brought a sense of character and family to our time traveling friends, Marty and Doc Brown. And this one was a complete reversal of Back to the Future, where instead of Marty being the center of the film, now it is Doc Brown. This is the case especially when Clara Clayton comes to visit Doc Brown at his house and he and Marty have to cover up the DeLorean, with a model Doc Brown built of how they are going to get back to 1985 near the car - in the first film, it was Marty's mother who visited him and Doc Brown (again both having to cover up the DeLorean and again with a model Doc Brown built to show how Marty will get back to 1985)! But not only this, the chemistry between Mary Steenburgen and Christopher Lloyd was heartfelt and director Robert Zemeckis really brought out the best in both. An excellent movie for sure!

		<fullReview>The intelligent script of the second installment is no longer in play, but these movies run seamlessly, one right after the other, with no discernible break.In my opinion, this is the most fun of the series, and grants a fond farewell to the franchise. Our favorite characters are back and are dealing with the problems of time travel once more.While the first installment had the virtue of being "fresh and new," and the second was "dark and atmospheric," this third chapter is just downright fun.The story here was developed as a way of saying, "Goodbye" to the series. From start to finish, you feel it. While it is bittersweet for some, it plays out to a rousing and satisfying end. It is my favorite, though it is not considered to be the best of this run. Perhaps it is the flying locomotive, or maybe it's getting to see Doc Brown's sons, or suppose it's getting to watch Doc fall in love. Whatever the reason, this concluding chapter of the Back to the Future trilogy is my favorite of the bunch.It rates an 8.6/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quieter conclusion with an unexpected Western twist (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the frenetic pace of "Back to the Future Part II", the speed has been slowed down, and the tone lightened up considerably, for this final part of the "Back to the Future" trilogy set back in the Old West. This allows for the usual time-travel high-jinks, better characterisation and even some references to popular Western films of old.Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) has ended up back in 1955. Courtesy of a letter sent from the past, he learns that Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who disappeared in a freak accident at the end of the last film, spent his final days in the old West Hill Valley in 1885. Retrieving the buried time machine with Doc's '1955 counterpart', Marty learns his old friend died after being shot in the back by Buford Tannen (Thomas F.Wilson). He then vows to return to the old West, rescue his friend and get them both back to the future...The film works very well on a technical level, with some good Western-style variations on Alan Silvestri's memorable theme score. There is a strong continuity, in plot and references, to the previous films. The over-the-top, cartoonish style of the second film has been replaced with a more relaxed, romantic tone that eases the series towards it's conclusion. Special effects are as spectacular as ever, particularly in the train chase finale.The old-style Western setting allows for a lot of funny nods and references to Western films, particularly 'High Noon', 'My Darling Clementine' and, most memorably, 'A Fistful of Dollars'. Marty passes himself off as 'Clint Eastwood' and when he refuses to face Tannen in a duel he's told: 'Everybody everywhere will say Clint Eastwood is the biggest yellabelly in the West.'The acting, on all fronts, is much better. Fox completes his character's arc begun in the second film, as he finally learns the value of self-control and restraint. It's interesting how in the first film he resolves his parents destiny, in the second his children's, and the third film he finally sorts out his own. He also appears, with Lea Thompson, as his own ancestor. He has a cheesy Irish accent, but he still pulls the part off. Lloyd gets to do more than just play the mad scientist, allowing for a soft, touching courtship with Mary Steenburgen as the local schoolmarm. They have a good scene together where they share their love of Jules Verne. Thomas F. Wilson makes for a slaveringly good villain in the gun-toting Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen.What is really interesting is the themes running throughout the series which comes to head here. Marty learns about self-confidence and self-control and Doc, as he explains to Marty (as well as, indirectly, the audience) says that 'your future hasn't been written yet. No-one's has. Your future is whatever you make it. So make it a good one."And thus ends this clever, fantastic and enduringly popular series of films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid closure to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marty and Doc are now in the Old West and must figure out a way to return to 1985.The first one was perfect. One couldn't figure out how they were going to follow it up with any degree of real success and in the end they didn't. Part II was miles behind the quality of the original and, while it was pretty solid in it's own right, left most viewers dissatisfied. To my utmost surprise (in 1989 at least) the second chapter ended with a brief trailer promising a third, and final, installment. This time in the Old West and then this long story would come to an end.First of all, "Back to the Future, Part III" is an improvement over Part II. It's more pure fun than the second one and the climax on board the train is quite spectacular. Everything concerning special effects is outstanding but that was also the case with Part II.Director Zemeckis's fetish with having actors play opposite themselves isn't taken to the extremes here as in Part II but the story is still somewhat confusing. I'll never get that part with Clayton Ravine and how on earth Doc managed to build this Super Duper time machine in the end but it's not like the first one was crystal clear either.Fox is always a hoot as Marty and Lloyd is still perfect as Doc. Steenburgen is barely passable as the love interest (something about her always bugs me) but the real star here is Thomas F. Wilson, this time (mostly) playing "Mad Dog" Tannen, a crazy and quite stupid gunman who's ultimately as unfortunate as his great great grandson Biff. Like in Part II, he completely steals the show and here he has most of the great lines ("Forfeit...what's that mean?", Priceless).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>almost a spoof, but an outstanding joy and return to form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Somebody wanted a laugh. Well, surely. After the wonderful original film, and an awkward second part which preached of a fashion victim future, Michael J Fox or somebody else must have politely suggested to Robert Zemeckis that they wanted to strap on a gun belt and shout ye ha.Filmed back to back with "Back to the Future Part II", this concluding adventure for Marty McFly (Fox) and Doctor Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) finds them back in the old West, and feels good. Much more mature in colour than it's predecessors (strange considering the linkage), it is strong family entertainment which never takes itself too seriously. Almost a spoof of the characters Zemeckis had worked hard to create, it never attempts anything other than to make you smile. It might not be as classic as the first film, but this third concluding part of the trilogy is magnificent fun.Trapped in 1955 after the events of the previous film, Marty McFly (Fox) is staying with the Doc Brown (Lloyd) of that period. When they discover an unfortunate event has befallen the Brown of the future who is now living in the past (confused yet?), McFly knows he must once more travels further back in time to save his close friend.A more laid back conclusion when compared to previous films, this final adventure for Marty and the Doc is wonderful. Entertaining from the outset, it thrives on placing 1980s residents in the old West. A clash in culture, the one surprise is that this notion hasn't been recreated by reality television gurus.Once more cleverly written, there is a strong abundance of jokes previously missing from the series, and Michael J Fox is also more than willing to dress himself up in multiple roles, this time playing Marty's Irish Immigrant ancestor Seamus. Hamming up the Irish accent, Fox demonstrates that whilst he's out for a laugh, he can still act his socks off when he wants to.Christopher Lloyd too demonstrates an improved skill as he draws on his comic talents from "Taxi" to turn the Doc even more eccentric. Unlike the spread from previous films, this time the joy of the film is watching these two actors play off against each other.The "Back to the Future" series completes itself with the same success with which it began. Radically different films, Parts I and III are both entertaining and great to watch. More laid back than the previous two outings, this third and final part thrives on the simple fact that everybody is out to spoof themselves and to have a good time. That good time is shown in the work itself and as a result it's easy to love this film. Brilliant from start to finish, and a worthy conclusion to a superb trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Ending to a Perfect Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first movie, Back to the Future, had successfully blended Sci-Fi and high school drama to give us a heart-warming little tale. This movie does an equally good job of taking Sci-Fi to the wild west. The previous movie had ended with Doc being accidentally transported to 1985. Marty takes the help of 1955-Doc again, to bring 1985-Doc back to the present day(1985).What follows is a fun-filled adventure. Marty meets his ancestors. Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen, an ancestor of Biff's, is a dreaded outlaw. A forefather of Principal Strickland is the town Marshal. There are gunfights, duels, Indians, Fedoras, chasing trains on horses, rescuing of a damsel and romance. The film pays tribute to the great westerns of the past. Marty adopts the name Clint Eastwood when he meets his ancestors. Like in some of the classic westerns, this film too has the plot-line where an outsider (time-traveler in this case) comes to a lawless town and teaches them, by setting a example, that violence is no good.The trilogy on the whole does a great job with time-travelling and alternate time-lines. There are a total of fifteen known time-journeys, three alternate 1885's, four alternate 1955's, four alternate 1985's, one 2015 we see and one which is yet to be made and zero plot-holes, in all the three films combined. What makes it even more special is that none of it is complicated. That is how story-telling ought to be.It is a one-of-a-kind time-travel trilogy. A must watch for film aficionados and casual movie-watchers alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No one's future is written for them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sitting back to watch the final, for now, entry in the Back to the Future trilogy, I was a little disheartened. I had a lot of fun with this series, and was sad not to be traveling through the dimensions of time with Marty and Doc Brown for the last time. But alas, all good things must come to an end, and of course, I can always rent the DVD, or perhaps even add any of them to my own collection. Back to the Future Part III, didn't simply "phone it in" for its' final act, it provided a complete compilation to its time travel exploits.This story picks up where the second left off; with Marty (Michael J. Fox) acting on a letter he received from Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). At the conclusion of Back to the Future Part II, the DeLorean is struck by lightning, with Doc inside, and he is transported all the way back to 1885, in the old west. Since Doc had always dreamed of living in the Wild West, he was not severely disappointed to be stuck in the 1800's, and he certainly was stuck because it would be 70 or so years before the replacement parts he needed to repair the DeLorean would exist. He writes Marty a letter explaining to him what he is up to and that he is fine and should be left in 1885. Soon after receiving the letter, however, Marty uncovers that Doc Brown is about to die. Unwilling to leave him to that fate, Marty ignores all risks, intent on traveling to 1885, to find Doc Brown. This would prove impossible without a trip back to 1955, to get some help from the Doc Brown of the past. Marty's crash landing in 1885 creates quite a conundrum, however, as a fuel line breaks causing all of the gas to leak out of the DeLorean. Doc reminds him that gas hasn't been invented yet, and they will have to be innovative to find a way to power the DeLorean to the necessary 88 M.P.H. needed to travel through time. After devising a plan to power the DeLorean by locomotive power, a new distraction, of a feminine nature arrives. A Ms. Clara Clayton greets Doc Brown, and he is instantly smitten by her. Doc even vows to stay in the past with Clara after helping Marty fix the DeLorean. Our Heroes situation is made even more difficult because Marty, in typical McFly fashion refuses to be called "chicken", or "yellow" in 1885 terms. After an altercation with Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), Marty gains the attention of the gun that he discovered was to kill Doc. In the final installment of Robert Zemeckis beloved time traveling adventure, out duo is outrunning a gun, deciding between love and fate, and learning that the words of others should only ever be words rather than a reflection of ourselves; a pleasing finale to the Back to the Future series.Once again, the brilliant on-screen chemistry of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd bring Back to the Future Part III to life. Years working together on the same franchise were nothing to dilute the pair's on-screen chemistry. Still as engaging as ever, it was pure joy to watch Marty and Doc on screen again, one last time. This film also kept the heart in to the movie. Each entry in this trilogy has heart at the center, no pun intended. It was endearing to see our zany Doc Brown fall in love, even if he did wish to pick his new love over traveling with Marty.I would recommend Back to the Future Part III to almost anyone. Rated PG, it is appropriate and engaging for all ages. Fans of the trilogy have to see it, as it wraps up all of our favorite's story lines. Anyone who believes in the power of love, time, and destiny will feel empowered by the message. I'm not sure what type of viewer Couldn't find something to appreciate about Back to the Future Part III, and to me, that's exactly how a franchise should end; pleasing the one time viewer and the series fanatic alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent,Unforgettable Finale To The Trilogy And A Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back To The Future Part III is an excellent and unforgettable finale to the Back To The Future Trilogy that combines wonderful direction,a terrific cast,a fantastic script,an amazing score and great special effects. All of those elements make Back To The Future Part III a memorable conclusion to the Back To The Future Trilogy and a classic.Taking place after the events in Part II,Back To The Future Part III has Marty(Michael J. Fox)traveling back in time to the Old West to Hill Valley in 1885 to rescue Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)and get him back to 1985. While there in the old west Marty and Doc have to deal with outlaw Buford Maddog Tannen(Thomas F. Wilson)while Doc falls in love with a woman named Clara(Mary Steenburgen).Back To The Future Part III is a brilliant and entertaining finale to the amazing Back To The Future Trilogy and basically proves that all good things must come to an end. Making a final film in a movie Trilogy is tough but Director Robert Zemeckis has created a conclusion that brings things to a fitting end that brings the Back To The Future Trilogy full circle. For 118 minutes Back TO The Future Part III combines different movie genres such as SCI-FI,Comedy,Western,Action and romance giving viewers a genre mash-up of 10 different movies in one but the movie never becoming uneven or confused. Whereas the first film went back in time to the 1950s and the second film went to the past present and future in 2015,Back To The Future goes back in time to the Old West with six shooters,Cowboys and stagecoaches. While the concept of a time traveling movie set in the West won't appeal to most viewers speaking for myself as a Western movie fan I loved it. There are plenty of references to Classic Westerns in Back To The Future Part III mostly to Clint Eastwood Westerns(Marty calls himself Clint Eastwood and wears a poncho resembling Eastwood's in the Spagetti Westerns). Don't expect a realistic or gritty vision of the Wild West because the way the West is depicted in this film is all in great fun. The Comedy and laughs in BTTF PIII are funny,over the top and go with the energy and style of the film which is lighthearted and humorous. The screenplay by Bob Gale is fantastic and memorable with dialog that gives this movie a nice energy and pace that keeps the movie going. While all three BTTF films are character driven Part III is probably the most character driven and introspective especially with our Heroes Marty and Doc Brown. With each of the three films we see Marty becoming more mature but still dealing with issues(Marty doesn't like being called a chicken). But as the film goes on he learns to grow and deal with the problem in an interesting way. With Doc Brown we see a different side to him we didn't see in the first two movies where we see Doc Brown firing a Western style gun,falling in love,showing romantic feelings or dancing with a woman which adds to Doc's character. We also see Marty and Doc friendship at a crossroads because while Marty wants to take Doc back to 1985,Doc is debating whether he wants to stay or go and dealing with their futures. It's the examination of Marty and Doc Brown's characters in this one that make Part III so watchable. The ending of Back To The Future Part III(which is the final 20-30 minutes)is fantastic,thrilling and will leave you with a smile and an unforgettable conclusion to the Back To The Future saga and for Marty and Doc. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent and brilliant as Marty McFly(and Shamus McFly)and Doc Brown once again showing great chemistry. Mary Steenburgen is wonderful and beautiful as Clara,Doc's love interest. Thomas F. Wilson is delightful as Griff Tannen,a Western outlaw and once again as Biff. Lea Thompson is great in a duel role as Maggie Mcfly and Lorianne Baines-McFly. Elisabeth Shue does a good job as Jennifer,Marty's girlfriend. Matt Clark(Chester The Bartender),Pat Buttram(Saloon Old Timer),Harry Carey Jr.(Saloon Old Timer),Dub Taylor(Saloon Old-Timer),James Tolkan(Marshal James Strickland),Marc McClure(Dave McFly),Wendie Jo Spencer(Linda McFly)and Flea(Needles)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Zemeckis is outstanding,with Zemeckis bringing the same energy and style to the Western setting. Great direction,Zemeckis.The score by Alan Silvestri is outstanding,thrilling and fits in well with the Western atmosphere. Fantastic score,Silvestri.The Special Effects by Industrial,Light And Magic are incredible and visual stunning once again. Amazing effects,ILM.In final word,if you love Robert Zemeckis,SCI-FI Films,or the first two Back To The Future films I highly suggest you see Back To The Future Part III,an excellent and unforgettable finale to the trilogy. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great conclusion for this trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picking up where the second one left off, lighting struck the time machine as it sends Doc back to the old west in 1885 as Marty goes back to find him, and try to bring him back home to 1985. Meanwhile, Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen is having a showdown with Marty besides killing Doc, and Doc has fallen in love with the woman of his life Claire Clayton. Everyone has their own views on which "Back to the Future" sequel is the best, but to me personally, I think they're both good and I do say that I like three slightly more than two. However, they're both not as good as the first. In my opinion, I think the humor is just as funny as the first two, and I still think that taking place in the old west isn't that bad of an idea. I do like how the west looks, and really doesn't come off from a set of a television movie or show if you may ask. I thought the drama for the characters are really well handled, and I thought Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd both continue to be great together. Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson are great too, while Mary Steenburgen does a fine job and I don't find her character annoying. The special effects are good, while some are dated like having two characters in the same scene just like what the second one did as I need to mention that. The pacing is well done, and the story really did kept me involved with it. Robert Zemeckis' direction is very well directed, and I love Alan Silvestri's music. The song "Doubleback" by ZZ Top is my favorite song of the trilogy, and I really do listen quite often. As for the ending, I thought it ended exactly how it should end as the movie does have a great message as what Doc says in the movie "Your future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one." I sure hope that everyone can relate to that line, and we can make the future whatever we want to make. I really have a lot of fun with this movie, and I don't think it deserves the hate it gets. "Back to the Future Part III" is a great conclusion for this trilogy, and I am giving this movie a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The holy trilogy goes out with a bang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a tall order for a third movie to not only bring the series to a tidy conclusion, but to follow up the hectic tone of the previous entry. But "Back to the Future Part III" does both, and a great job no less. What's cool about this is that, even though the pacing and tone are more relaxed (fitting the Old West setting), it's still a tight script. I don't tend to look at the clock during this movie, and that says a lot.Also, this is Doc's story, and it's a great change of pace to finally see him a little more front-and-center. I have to admit, his intro in this movie is also pretty badass. And Steenburgen's nod to "Time After Time" is a treat."Part III" is a great resolution to the series, tying up all the loose threads and bringing things to an end with a nice dose of character. This could've gone sideways (one wrong move, and you'll wind up with a "Godfather Part III"), but it never does, and makes for one hell of a finish to the trilogy.9/10</fullReview>

There's something special about these movies that just makes you love them and they just really hold up as masterpieces.I remember watching this one a lot as a kid on VHS and there is so much to like about this movie.The plot for this film centers around Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travels back to 1885 to find Dr. Emmitt Brown (Christoper Lloyd) before Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F.Wilson) finds him first we are also introduce to Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen).The fact the movie is set in the Old West makes it plenty of opportunely to use the setting and it does that pretty well.The Effects are pretty awesome plus I enjoy the comedy bits of the movie it goes to show how with creative writing you will have a win win for the fans. Also the movie is full of great movie quotes.The Acting in this movie is very strong with the Back To The Future films you can always count on good acting and this film is no different the cast once again brought their craft to the filmThis film does a great justice on wrapping up a great trilogy and it is one of the best third movies in a series ever.

		<shortDescription>Back to the Future Part III was a fine way to end the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday, me and my movie theatre-working friend rewatched all three Back to the Future films for a one-time-only showing. Since the second one partially took place on October 21, 2015-that became the reason for that particular day's reshowing of them all. Anyway, this one focuses on Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) traveling to 1885 to search for his pal Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who seemed to accidentally end up there at the end of the last one. Also, in this one, Doc falls for a teacher named Clara (Mary Steenburgen). Oh, and Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson return to play their character's ancestors. After the last one was almost devoid of laughs, this one has quite a bit of them with much of the touching sentiment mostly missing from the previous entry. And the message Doc says at the end is quite pertinent, if I say so myself! So on that note, Back to the Future Part III is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once Upon a Time In Hill Valley</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I loved Back to the Future Part II for how frantic and fast paced it is, I love Part III for largely the opposite reason; for being more simple and laid back. You need a dark chapter like Part II before you can have something more romantic and light hearted like Part III. I love the western setting, there's a certain innocence to it; it's classic in every sense of the word. There's monument valley, cowboys, Indians, a saloon as well as the atypical western music score. It's also fun to see Marty and Doc in a date much further back in time as well as seeing the images, quotes and motifs from the first film reapplied in the western setting. The film shows us Hill Valley during its early days, thus over the course of three films we get the entire history (and near future) of this town, making it a character onto itself, even if the western setting does raise the question about Hill Valley's geographical location. Part III is the Doc's movie, it gave his character a whole new dimension. His scientific ethics are challenged by falling in love for the first time. I don't think many people realise it but Doc Brown is a pretty dark character. He blew his family's fortune on inventions which don't work (at least until he invented time travel), and is ostracised from the rest of Hill Valley, so it's about time something finally went right in his life and he finds a love. Plus it's cute, two geeks falling in love who were previously separated by space and time. My only complaint with Part III (really my only complaint with any film in the trilogy) is that the film pulls the liar revelled, one of my most dreaded of movie clichs. We know the Doc and Clara are going to get back together towards the end of the movie, so do really need to have the movie abruptly stop for a period. But I'm more forgiving of it in this instance as their separation does contribute to the suspense during the film's finale, which is one of the highlights of the entire trilogy. The interactions between Marty and Doc are just as great as ever, even more so that they have to find a way to get the DeLoran up to 88 miles per hour with the technology available to them in 1885. Although I do have to ask is Doc not going against his principles at the end by creating another time machine, oh well, it's still a great ending. Back to the Future Part III is my least favourite of the series but I still love it. Unlike other film franchises the trilogy is done and dusted. It's not polluted with further sequels, prequels, remakes, reboots, re-whatevers, and hopefully it will stay that way.The End.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't review each movie alone, the trilogy is so bond together that it's impossible.Must say that this is one of the most memorable Sci-fi comedies or movies related to time- travel in the whole film making history. The story's great, you'll love the plot. Dr. Brown's explanations make sure that even the most complex things could be understood by everyone. You'll get excited for all the high-tense scenes like never, even after seeing it several times. That's one of the best things about the movie. Alan Silvestri's score is just great, gives an emotional touch like not many scores do.Now, a little problem comes to the fx. instead of using models like in star wars (what also made star wars win Oscars for the effects) they started using CG, just CG technology wasn't yet so perfectioned in 80s-90s like nowadays. That's a little problem though, the movie's not overloaded with these FX at all. Also, I think this chapter is the best in the series, has the biggest emotional plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zippy, snappy and thoroughly enjoyable second sequel which reminds us of how good American produced/English-language franchises can be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think we'd all be lying if we said we didn't sit through the final few shots of Back to the Future: Part III and didn't necessarily 'feel' something sad or melancholy wash over us. The conclusion to what has to go down as one of the best film trilogies of all time, a sentiment made even more prominent following recent additions to the respective Terminator and Die Hard franchises, carries with it an uplifting air of pomp and conclusion juxtaposed with a sense of heartbreak in that the only way to experience time travelling adventures with these characters, whom we love a great deal, is to sit through a rerun. There is genuine heart to proceedings here, and we sense the director, a certain Robert Zemeckis, of whom has been responsible for some great work over the years, is genuinely trying new things and attempting to push the franchise down different routes. What isn't happening is what often occurs with certain other sequels belonging to certain other franchises; that is to say, simulacrum-imbued romps of previous entries following that same lead character, of whom was never particularly interesting in the first place, trudging through the same locations and doing the same act with nothing registering and not much of it particularly interesting.The film continues the adventures of Marty McFly, but it veers more away to his faithful partner in time, Emmett "Doc" Brown, in the fashion the last entry alluded it would: Doc's favourite ever era in history was "the old West", while at one point in Part II, he stated his intent to dismantle the confounded time machine built out of a Delorean and focus his attentions on the "one other mystery of the universe: women(!)". We begin in 1955, and following events of the second film, Marty crash-lands back into Doc Brown's world; he of whom is only just recovering from the events of the very first film. Marty still has that letter from the end of Part II, a letter addressed to him from Doc although written in 1885 having spent several decades with a courier company. It's worth pointing out that the incarnation of Doc that is trapped in 1885 is he of the year 1985, and as you watch and struggle to sync it all up to see if it makes sense, one must battle the wave of nostalgia washing over one on top of listening and working it all out. Blowing up the entrance to an old mine near a graveyard, so that Marty may travel back to the 80's, they stumble across no ordinary grave: Doc's grave from the nineteenth century, and they take it upon themselves to alter the plan by sending Marty back to save him.When Marty arrives back, it is as magical as it is when he respectively crash lands into both the 50's and the 2010's; that trademark-of-the-series crane shot over the town-general is like a friend of old rearing up after not having previously seen them for several years, whilst the gag about encountering his "mother" (or a descendant of his mother) very early on after travelling is still funny. Initially, Marty struggles; falling afoul of his untamed Western surroundings by very nearly coming a cropper to the local wildlife, natives and the soiled water a nearby rancher gives him. There is some early, if unwelcome, instances of humour revolving around a baby urinating on him and his treading in horse manure, but the general idea is he's ill-suited to his surroundings. The Tannen's are back, Thomas F. Wilson returns as an incarnation of what is arguably the most famous school bully that's ever been put to film; here playing Buford, an ancestor of Biff and Griff et al. and a gunslinger whose reputation is built up through still images and newspaper reports prior to his arrival on screen. When he does arrive, the first we see of him is his holstered pistol filling the screen as he walks through a saloon door, thus inferring the danger and the sense of conflict synonymous with him.Where it is established Doc has but a few days left to live, complications in their plan to save both of them arises when Clara Clayton (Steenburgen) bursts onto the scene; a woman destined by history to perish over the side of a cliff but saved by Doc, in what is an event which alters both history as well as Doc's life. Their coming together is the aforementioned wholesome substance, while providing with Doc with as much of the limelight as McFly is good value. Back to the Future: Part III works through its sense of there constantly being something at stake - we are aware of what the characters have to do, that is to say, something wholly scientific that is yet to have been tried which unfolds in a pre-modern era. If we look back upon this third Back to the Future film, and to a degree the second one as well, with a differing sense of fondness, then it is because that sense of the fire still going as a mainstream franchise hits its third film has all but dissipated from series of the more recent times. We enjoy the places the film take us; specifically, its covering of two people coming to form a relationship away from the core dynamic of McFly and Doc - if there were criticisms directed at the second film for thrashing around too much as it travelled and darted through time, then this is the entry that is grounded in one place and burns slowly as two characters come together and connect. As a result, we are required to hark back to films such as these made at a time when you actually felt filmmakers were trying new things and were out to enthrall as well as touch emotions, rather than proceed with a going through of the motions.</fullReview>

This one does follow the other two, but it doesn't relate that directly to them(except for tying up loose ends Part II left for it so it'd have *something*), other than referencing the first one somewhat(much less than the second did). It's not at a high school comedy, nor a carefully written homage to the original, it's a Western adventure with time travel. The core concept remains the same, if messing up the time-line seems less dangerous this time around(and in general it doesn't feel as exciting as the others). The focus is on Emmett now, and with little story left to tell, they give him a love interest. Tannen remains the villain, and is the only one left to really overact(except for Lloyd, the mug-master), not to mention one of the only to return. We do get the trilogy treatment, with this returning to the roots and revealing information we didn't know before and a sense of closure. The humor is again pretty silly, in fact maybe moreso than earlier. As a period piece, it really works, you believe that you're seeing early US. I recommend this to fans of the franchise. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once more for old time's sake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the brain-melting series of temporal twists and turns performed by Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in Part II of the Back to the Future trilogy, the time-travelling pair keep it relatively simple for Part III, spending nearly the whole film in one place and one year: the wicked wild, wild west of 1885, where Marty meets his Oirish ancestors, Doc falls in love (with schoolteacher Clara Clayton, played by the lovely Mary Steenburgen), and both face mortal danger from gun-slinging outlaw Mad Dog Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) and his gang.Considering that it was shot back-to-back with Part II, the lack of narrative complexity for the final chapter comes as a bit of a surprise, but does little to diminish the film's overall ability to entertain: Part III might be a less frantic affair, but thanks to an excellent script packed with witty dialogue, welcome character development, plenty of tips of the Stetson to the previous two films, and a rousing finale, it is no less enjoyable than its predecessors, thus making the whole trilogy one of the most consistently brilliant series of movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going Back To The Future shows how good part 3 is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others, BTTF3 didn't have the immediate impact for me which its two predecessors had, leading to a sense of disappointment. Hindsight gives me some idea why this may be so.I think it is because the three time eras visited in the first movies are all within my frame of reference, but the Wild West is not. Once I put that to one side, I see what a worthy conclusion to the trilogy we have.The plotting is absolutely fantastic - there are so many interlocking elements here, pieced together with the precision of a piece of fine machinery. Choosing such a completely different time era - and one which has been immortalised in hundreds of westerns - provides a whole new playground for gags, visual reference, plot anchors and so on. And the decision to add a love interest for Doc to the story offers a welcome change to Marty's familial complications, as well as giving the movie (and the series) a much needed heart - and Mary Steenburgen fits into the established cast as if she had been there from the start.And the finale, which draws together elements from all three films and provides several payoffs within the space of under five minutes, is perfect. Simply perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This makes me want to go back and watch the whole trilogy again!!!!!!!Marty, I mean Clint Eastwood ;), is blasted back to 1885 to save the doc from a gang of thuds. However, once he's there he discovers quite a problem. I'll try not to give too much away.You thought blasting Marty into 2015 was funny? Yeah, I agree, but this was just as funny. Some of the humor this time comes from continuity (especially the sequence of "I had a horrible nightmare." "Well, you're back in (fill in the blank) now." "WHAT?!" But it's still funny the third time.) Within 5 minutes of Marty arriving he's already nearly killed, which is probably the least amount of action you'll see in the entire movie. A lot more romance, a lot more action and a lot more humor can be expected from this one.Not to be punny, but while this movie goes a little off the rails from the first movie, it's still entertaining and keeps you guessing.Michael J. Fox still has the best facial expressions. Lol, I really want to see this whole trilogy again!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful conclusion to a trilogy that really has given us everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the Doc is sent back to the old west Marty (Fox) finds the 1955 Doc for help to travel to 1885 to save his future self from assassination.The third and final instalment to the time travelling trilogy brings around a western adventure for the coolest time traveller of all Marty McFly as he attempts to save the Doc's life.In 1985 back to the future brought around a sensational new concept of travelling back and forth and altering past events and with the coolest car on the market was a worldwide smash and rightly so. And only being 2 when this was released, I feel I missed the appreciation to the climax of a truly brilliant series.Still praised to this very day the conclusion has more action, drama and adventure than the previous two parts and adapting a western styled genre gives the series diversity whilst still maintaining a powerful segment devoted to science.As Marty and the Doc contemplate returning back to the present in 1985 numerous factors arise to cause problems for their future. Mad Dog wants their lives whilst a love interest for the Doc appears, deflecting his attention from the present as he contemplates his own future.Having focused purposefully on Marty's family for the previous two films it was a nice gesture to focus in more on the doc's life and outlook and as a result this feels more rewarding and the entire trilogy benefits from spreading its emotions through its main players. Even Tannen has some purposeful and meaningful dialogue in this script which is also beneficial as the film winds up.Encoding more action sequences than ever Part III adds the intensity and power to give the western scenes extra spice. From shoot outs to a splendid train/car experiment this feels none stop and your heart will pump for more, yet sadly the fun and adventure had to finish somewhere and is the case with life, it is always good to go out on a high.Michael J Fox once more generates a slick styled protagonist with his clever mimics of Clint somebody and though the first costume design is far-fetched he somehow carries it off. Lloyd's Doc is once more exceptionally intelligent and knowledgeable and having extra dialogue and on screen time we see a more human side to his personality.This trilogy reinvented the concept of travelling through time with a complex intent but never degrading the audience with its basic yet eccentric styled discourse and with such superb characters and intent of action with humour this trilogy has astounded many and will do for all of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back to the Future Part III is slightly better than Back to the Future Part II. This film has a couple of improvements. I'm ashamed to say that this is the final film, and I wish it wasn't. I wish the delightful Back to the Future films would go on. The plot: Continuing from the second film, Doc has just disappeared from the storm. He sends Marty a letter saying that he's in the western times and for him not to go looking for him. So Marty goes looking for the other Doc Brown, from the 50's. They soon find out that Doc will be killed by Biff Tannon's relative. So Marty and the Doc from the 50's discover a time machine that Doc stored from the western times. So Marty travels to the western times. Many things happen from there. Doc finally falls in love with Clara, and other things happen from there. Back to the Future Part III isn't in the third part curse. It's exciting, cute, funny, and a lot of fun. I was upset when it was over because I knew there would never be another film. I liked Mary Steenburgen as Doc's girlfriend. I loved Back to the Future Part III, and I definitely think you should see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This time McFly goes back to 1985 to save the Doc.It is my least favorite of the three movies but still very entertaining and a great ending to the series.I will first say what makes me like this movie less than the other two. It is mainly because in the first two movies I liked the interaction of him with his family and how it affects the present. This is missing in the second part. We still get to see his ancestors and get the first McFly born in America pee on Marty, but it is very short. It is also less of a sci fi and more of a western. Which is also what makes it the favorite of the three for my father who loves westerns since he was a kid!.But aside from this the movie is very good. We still get to see a lot of Marty and the Doc. Doc even gets a little romance in this movie. Mary Steenburgen was great as Clara and they had a good chemistry. Biff's ancestor is of course the villain here and again he is on wonderful. "Clint Eastwood, what kind of a stupid name is that?!". Also great action towards the end with the chasing of the train, was very exciting. The final scene is also awesome, just a right quotation to end this great series with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY REVIEW: The Time Travel Adventure Ends So Well!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back to the Future Part III. And then I was finished with one of the longest time travel fun ever. Starting from the point where Part I and Part II finished, Part III takes you this time to the old west era of 1885. You might think how many ideas they have up their sleeves to make us laugh, you will be surprised to see they have never run out of ideas while making this totally coherent screenplay that can be fit in three movies rather single one. Most of the laughter comes from how to make time machine work in the technically backward 1885. Michael and Christopher playing Marty and Doc respectively are still at their best. Dialogues like "Great Scott", "That's heavy" and "I am back from the future" remain with you. Doc's expressions whenever he hears about scientific innovation of future are priceless. His subtle love encounter is cute and lovable. I suggest you watch this trilogy in one go and I bet you must not have laughed so much for 6 long hours. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Back to the Future Part III. It ends but it ends so well that you will feel like that they have just started.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Zemeckis shot both this film and Back To The Future II at the same time, so it was released just months after #2 ended it's theater run. With the story fresh in the minds of the movie-goer, the best they came up with was an excuse to visit the Wild West. I suppose of all of the times in American History, the most interesting was the lawless West, where drunks were as common as blacksmiths, I just wished the movie makers would have picked a different, maybe more interesting period of time to end the Back To The Future movies with. But as it is, Back To The Future is a worthy end to the trilogy, wrapping up all of the loose ends (there weren't that many to be tied up, so if you missed the first two movies, you're not too far behind) and with more than a wink to the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns of the 1960s, Back To The Future III is fun and entertaining. It just could have been so much more. With Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) back in 1885 by way of the ending of BTTF 2, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox in his signature role) uses the time machine to rescue him. While there, they meet up with the town's new teacher who was supposed to fall in a glen, but was saved by Brown and McFly, another alteration to the geography of Hill Valley. The teacher, played by Mary Steenbergen, falls for Doc Brown, and this union of science minds sets up the climax for decisions that have to be made. Just like the other BTTF movies, McFly needs an alias, Calvin Klein (named after his underwear) in the first two movies, and Clint Eastwood in this one. Knowing that name allows the viewers to rejoice in an homage to "A Fistful of Dollars" at the end of the movie. Not as good as the first two movies, it is still a good film that ends the trilogy with fun and a satisfying conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tremendous fun and a worthy concluding instalment to a great trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first film, and while a step down I enjoyed the second as well. The third film is tremendous fun from start to finish, and contrary to what the other reviewers say I prefer this over the second. Yes the storyline is mediocre in places, but Doc's romance was touching and the steam-train finale was phenomenally staged. The film is set in the Old West and gives the stars a chance to revel in the situations that made the matine western serials such a delight for so many people. The script is as witty and clever as the ones in the first two films, the direction is once again excellent and I loved the casting of the old western favourites such as Harry Carey Jnr and Pat Buttram. And as always Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd are on cracking form as Marty and Doc. Overall, despite the occasionally mediocre story, this is a worthy end to a great trilogy. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to the Future Part III: 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To fully enjoy Back to the Future Part III, you will have had to seen and remember the first two Back to the Futures. They reference and allude to them so many times; you have to remember everything fully. Of course, the first one is the real one, so they go back to that one more often.Michael J. Fox is back for his third outing as Marty McFly, time traveler. Christopher Lloyd is Dr. Emmett Brown, mad scientist. In the first one, Doc made a time machine and Marty went to 1955 and made his parents not meet. In Part II, Marty went to 2015. Now, because Doc from 1955 went back to 1885 and he's going to get himself killed, Marty goes there. Believe me, the plot is a whole lot crazier than that. Speaking of crazy, Doc looks a lot crazier than in parts I and II.Not as good as the first, way better than the second. Fox and Lloyd are quite good, with comedic timing, real chemistry, and making sure the movie doesn't have one dull point. Also, Lloyd has superior chemistry with a teacher in the Old West, Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), who comes in. Of course, because Doc wasn't supposed to be out there in the first place, it causes a paradox in the time-space continuum, meaning that what would happen in the future won't happen. You can discuss the technicalities and the plot holes/paradoxes, but really, you're not supposed to.Not really being a fan of the Old West, I wasn't really looking forward to this. However, I do like futuristic movies, I didn't really like the second one. Basically, it's a flip-flop. Many times, it looked like a stereotypical Western, with its gunslingers and its facades.Going back to the technical aspects (besides Doc saying `Great Scott!' many times), if you think closely, the three movies take place in one day. The fun of these types of movies should be put into a TV series. Most movies-to-TV-series don't work, but if they keep going to different time periods, it would be fun.There's not really much more to say, except that it's funny and extremely entertaining, a must for any casual sci-fi, adventure, western, or comedy fan.My rating: 8/10Rated PG for profanity, action violence, and sticky situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have finally finished rewatching the back to the future trilogy and this is a fantastic finish to the trilogy. After the events of the previous film the doc travels back in time to 1885. He leaves a letter for marty who decides to go back and save the doc. Michael j fox is back as marty mcfly and he is back with the same charm and charisma that he showed us in the previous films. He truly fits in the wild west and the character really goes out on a high. However, the most interesting character in this film is doc brown played by christopher lloyd. His character is really given depth in this film and he combines his romance with the quirky fun moments that have made him such a beloved character. Mary steenburgen is the new love interest for doc and they have great chemistry together. Thomas f Wilson is back but this time as the cowboy mad dog tannen and he is a fun villain for this film. The story has some good drama involved with the romance and the new setting really helps. However, my only complaint for this film is the lack of imagination in the story. Some of the characters feel forced in and the situations aren't as imaginative as the previous films. The script is great, it once again combines humour and drama really well to flesh out these characters. The style is great with allot of fun in the action scenes that makes this film flow really well. Overall this is a fantastic third instalment that should definitely be seen along with the other back to the future films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Saved the West for Last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that a lot of people rate Part III quite low, even those who like the underrated Part II. This may be because the break-neck pace of Part II is gone and this last entry mellows out and takes its time to develop its own story while also fully resolving the huge 130-year adventure of the entire trilogy. If it were a 90-minute cash-in I would understand why some people are indifferent towards Part III, but it's so much more than that.You could argue that Part III is almost a remake of the first movie. In several ways this is true, but it also has the appeal that makes the first so endearing. Instead of being nostalgic for the naive 80s or innocent 50s, Part III makes us long for the wide-open spaces of the old west, when the US was still in its infancy, before skyscrapers, shopping malls, and Starbucks lined every horizon. A time when there was still real freedom. But with freedom comes anarchy, this time taking the form of Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen - fastest gun in the west.I will admit that there is a noticeable lack of excitement as Doc romances Clara Clayton which goes against the ever-escalating disaster suspense of the series and might not interest viewers who are not keen period love stories. The action and adventure takes a back seat here while romance, comedy, and clever plotting get their own space. On the flipside Alan Silvestri delivers his most exciting score for the series, fusing the BTTF theme with a rousing western melody which is especially fun during the climax on the train. Plus, it's always fun to see 1955 Doc, who I always thought was more eccentric and closer to insanity than his older counterpart.We also get to see the "birth" of the clock tower which is a nice counterpoint to it's "death" in the first movie. Part III also opens with the brilliant lightning strike and Doc's rudely interrupted celebration, which is just awesome.Yes, it does have its shortcomings, I won't deny that. Why doesn't Doc just syphon the gasoline from the DeLorean he came to 1885 in? It would save them the effort of hijacking a train. But I am being pedantic again. I always felt that Part III was a definitive and fitting end to the series and I never thought that a Part IV would be necessary. There is not "To Be Concluded/Continued", there is only "The End" and it makes perfect sense that it should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior to the second one, in my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The final installment in the Back to the Future franchise once again picks up from where the previous film left us, with Marty (Michael J. Fox) trapped in the past and with a letter in his hand from Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), now living in the 19th century as a village blacksmith. And thus, it's once again the job of our heroes to get, you guessed it, back to the future.The first Back to the Future is undoubtedly the best in the franchise, there's no arguing about that. It is the most original, gets to do the best jokes, flows the smoothest and has the tightest narrative. But, many would claim that the second film is also the second best. A fair point, as it has some of the most memorable scenes and is arguably the most creative of the three. But, personally I do think that it jumped around a bit too much and that the third one is the better movie because it tells its story better, contains all the good sides shared by the two previous films and is a magnificent end to one of the best movie trilogies ever made.Plus I'm a sucker for good western comedy, which this movie has tons in it. That might have something to do with it.Once again all the actors reprise their roles and do it magnificently. Thomas F. Wilson shows a whole new side from himself as Mad Dog Tannen, a Wild West outlaw with a grudge to settle with Doc. The new characters, most notably Mary Steenburgen as Clara Clayton, also do a good job of being both sympathetic characters as well as hilarious parodies of the western stereotypes. Just like in the previous films.Definitely do check the film out if you haven't seen it already and liked the previous two films. It continues the story flawlessly and is an exciting end to our tale of Marty and Doc.</fullReview>

I believe this plot element was beautifully handled.Once more the duo have a problem returning to the future, which is their present time, which is now the past. Gasoline of all things is now the culprit. But that doesn't stop the genius Doctor Brown from coming up with a plan to get home.I saw this in my teens at my local cinema as a double feature.

		<fullReview>We are greeted in this series with Marty and Doc and their adventures with a time traveling vehicle. Marty ends up back in time by mistake and ruins his parents first meeting. So he has to get them to fall in love while avoiding changing everything else in the past. After some intense moments, he succeeds and is able to get back to his time and everything changed, but for the better.Then the next movie comes out and it's a pretty darn good sequel. Not only does Marty go forward in time to the future, he gets to go back in time and ends up in an alternate timeline due to someone else getting access to the machine. So with this problem, they have to go back to the same time as last time, only this time Marty has to avoid himself, the one who's getting his parents together! In the end it's almost perfect... and then Doc ends up being struck by lightning while trying to land the time machine, and he goes back to the 1800s during the wild west!Of course Marty can't leave Doc alone and goes back in time to save Doc... only this time Doc ends up falling in love with a women, and after being mixed between trying to send Marty and himself back home, and wanting to stay with his newly found love, he ends up sending Marty back to normal time, while sticking around. Of course by this point we need a happy ending and Doc reveals that he in fact invents a train that can travel through time.I didn't like the fact that Doc ended up breaking his own rules, however it is fictional and I suppose it only shows that Doc is human. But in the end, I liked it!I rate it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenburgen, Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson star in this 1990 sci-fi adventure sequel directed by Robert Zemeckis. This picks up where the last film ended with Marty McFly (Fox) getting a letter from his friend, Doc Emmett Brown (Lloyd) stating that he's been accidentally sent to 1885 after the Delorean time machine was struck by lightning. Marty explains to the 1955 Doc what happened and shows him the letter. They read it and learn that Doc also gets shot by Biff's dangerous ancestor, Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen (Wilson). Doc helps Marty get back to 1885 and after Marty arrives calling himself Clint Eastwood, he's threatened by Buford). Doc saves Marty and they're reunited trying to figure how to fix the Delorean after it malfunctions. In the process, Doc and Marty save school teacher, Clara Clayton (Steenburgen) from death and she and Doc fall for each other. Marty also meets his ancestors, Seamus McFly (Fox) and his wife, Maggie (Thompson) who don't realize he's their relative. Soon, Doc and Marty are challenged by Buford and must try using a train to push the Delorean up to 88 miles per hour to get back to 1985. This is a good concluding chapter to one of the best trilogies that I recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, I know you did send me back to the future. But I'm back! I'm back from the future.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doc Brown is back in 1885 in the Old West, soon to be joined by Marty who has found that Doc is in mortal danger from Burford "Mad-Dog" Tannen.Rounding out what turned out to be a hugely popular trilogy, Back to the Future Part III restored the core essence heart of Part 1, whilst simultaneously tying up all the threads with a fully formed story. More sedate in its telling {not hard following on from the manic pacing of part 2} part 3 fuses science fiction malarkey with, well, Western malarkey. All played out with the usual array of clever jokes and series reprises, only in a Wild Wild West setting. An interesting point to note is how the roles of Doc &amp; Marty have been reversed from the first film, here Marty is the maniacal plot axis, whizzing around getting into scrapes as Doc ambles around in love, courtesy of the delightfully classic looking Mary Steenburgen as Clara Clayton. Thomas F. Wilson returns for villain duties as Tannen, a Western bully villain pulled straight out of many a classic oater from way back in the day, and Lea Thompson &amp; Elisabeth Shue ensure the "past" is not forgotten.When Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale started making Back To The Future in 1985, could they have envisaged that they would make three films and end up with a steam engine time machine in the Wild West? Possibly not, but as part 3 hurtles {literally} towards its suspense laden finale, two things are for certain. One is that they wisely closed the series down with a surefire coda winner. Two is that between them they crafted one of the most entertaining family trilogies to have ever graced the screen. No doubt about the fact that part one is the uniformly class act of the three, but parts two &amp; three themselves reward groups of all ages. Great Scot indeed. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>End of the Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back to the Future Parts II and III were shot back-to-back, and the second film ended with a cliff-hanger. Part III starts with how Part II ended.After Doctor 'Doc' Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is trapped in 1885, and Marty (Michael J. Fox) seems trapped in 1955. He goes to the younger version of Doc to help him and discover that the time machine was hidden in an old mine. But whilst in a graveyard, Marty finds Doc's tombstone and that he is about to be murdered in a week in his timeline, and he decides to go back and save him. But in 1885 the time machine loses fuel and both have to find a way at getting back to the future via another method. They have to do this in a few days before Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) murders the Doc. As well as finding a way back to 1985, the Doc also finally finds love in the shape of school-teacher Carla Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) and the man is thorn between going back home or staying with his new love.The Old West world set in Back to the Future Part III is a fantasy version, not a gritty view, despite reference to Clint Eastwood westerns (which is also a good thing when done right). But this is a family film so what do you exact. The plot is pretty weak compared to the first two films, and was too similar to the first film which was better. Some of the jokes, like Marty's dancing fall flat and there is a bit to much self referencing and repeated jokes. But they are still some good jokes, and Christopher Lloyd and Thomas F. Wilson were good in the film. Michael J. Fox is good as Marty, letting the character grow a bit more, but as Seamus his character wasn't that interesting and his Irish accent was terrible.Robert Zemeckis is known for his skill with special effects, but in this film he takes a more traditional approach, using stunt work and little graphics. He was trying to make a 50 style western with a modern twist. He again does a very good job with the series.Trilogies have often been a problem for Hollywood, with the third film being the weakest. It's not hard to think of examples, the Godfather Part III, X-Men: the Last Stand, Alien 3, Terminator: Rise of the Machines, Blade Trinity, The Matrix Revolutions, all good examples of films ruining their predecessors. However Back to the Future Part III is more fitting to the first two films and is meant to be an end to the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the much darker part two things lighten up for the concluding part of the story. Here there are plenty of jokes and some nice references to other films, in particular "A Fist Full of Dollars".When the film opens Marty is still trapped in 1955 but the letter he received that the end of part two tells him that Doc is alive and well living in 1885. The letter also informs Marty where the DeLorean has been hidden and how, with the help of 1955-Doc he can get it running and return to 1985. However before Marty can do that he learns that Doc died a few days after sending his letter to instead of returning to 1985 he dresses up a rather camp 1950s cowboy costume and goes to 1885. Here he meets his great-great-grandparents who he tells he is called Clint Eastwood. When he head goes into town he ends up making an enemy of the local gunman Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen, an ancestor of Biff. This is also the person who had been destined to kill Doc. When Marty saves Doc at the party to celebrate the construction of the new town clock he is challenged to a duel. Now he has two days to either prepare to fight or to get the DeLorean up to 88MPH without any suitable fuel. There is also a subplot involving Doc and the town's new teacher Clara Clayton.While I think this is probably the weakest of the trilogy it is still a pretty good film and it wraps the story up nicely. As well as being fun science fiction it also works as a decent comedy western, especially if you are a fan of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns. As in the first two parts Micael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd were great in the leading roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fitting End To A Great Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Back to the Future Part III, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) goes back in time again...waaaaay back. For the past 8 months, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has been peacefully living in the year 1885, since the time machine was struck by lightning. After finding out that Doc is murdered, Marty goes back to the Old West to save his friend and return to 1985. This movie is my least favorite of the trilogy, but it's still a good movie. After the hectic Part II, Part III is a bit more laid back. I like this movie a lot, and although the first two are better, it's still a fun movie that I'll watch every now and again. By the end of the film, it's sad to know that the adventure's over, but it still was one hell of an adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually these kind of movies don't fare well with critics, the audience, and the box office. I feel that this film had success in all these categories. I certainly felt this is a good way to end a classic series.This time, Marty McFly travels back to 1888 to rescue Doc. If Doc is not rescued, he will perish and history may be altered in one way or another.The acting is pretty good. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd basically did as well as they did in the first two. Mary Steenburgen was a nice addition. It added some romance to the film.Now, the important thing is that this film is not as good as the first two films. Well, the plot/characters/acting/music are, but it did not give me the feel as I would normally feel while watching a classic.Overall, this is a grand finale to a great series. I would pick this movie as the best one. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing the surprise and originality factor had pretty much vanished entirely after the two first films, Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis were forced to come up with a slightly different approach for the finale of their hugely successful and ultimately entertaining time-traveling "Back to the Future" trilogy. They masterfully succeeded in this by drastically altering the time setting and by shifting the main emphasis towards Christoper Lloyd's character Doc instead of Marty. Number three takes Marty back to the Wild West in 1885, where Doc has settled himself in a small village after the DeLorean's short circuit in 1955. Doc had instructed Marty to return to his own time and let him remain in 1885, but upon discovering Doc's tombstone indicating a premature death, Marty travels back in time after all. With the DeLorean damaged beyond repair, they now both find themselves stuck in the Wild West and their attempts to find a solution are subsequently interrupted by Biff Tannen's criminal ancestor Buford and by the Doc himself falling in love with the charming school teacher Clara Clayton. The change in tone almost leads to this third film having its very own and independent personality. Those who endlessly claim that part three is the weakest and least memorable entry of the trilogy probably didn't yet realize that the source of paradox-jokes and situational humor was as good as exhausted after two films already. This film contains a different type of comedy, as it actually qualifies as a respectful Spaghetti Western satire (Marty imitates everything he learned about the Wild West from watching Clint Eastwood films) and a highly likable romantic comedy. And then still the die-hard fans of parts one and two have no actual reason to complain, since most of the characters re-appear as their own ancestors (like Michael J. Fox in a double role as the first McFly who entered America, the aforementioned malignant Buford Tannen and even Mr. Strickland as a late 19th Century lawman). The eventual return to 1985 is enormously spectacular and exciting, with the DeLorean being put on rails and pushed by a locomotive in order to reach 88 miles per hour, and the director's interpretation and re-creation of the Western period is prototypic but irresistibly charming, with raunchy saloons, unhygienic cowboys spitting around everywhere, a town's festival (with live performance by ZZ Top!) and the cavalry chasing after Indians. We already knew Michael J. Fox and Christoper Lloyd were ideally cast as Marty and Doc, but now also Mary Steenburgen gives away a stellar performance as the cute teacher and love-interest. "Back to the Future Part III" is a stupendous film and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back to the Future III picks up where the second movie leaves off. After the DeLorean was struck by lightning, Marty has to go back to 1885 to rescue Doc before he is shot in the back by Buford Tannen, Biff's great grandfather, played hilariously by Thomas Wilson. Buford is even stupider than Biff, and even though his character is very cruel, Wilson's funny performance lightens him up. Marty is even more out of his element in the old west than he was in 1955, going by the name of Clint Eastwood. When Marty and Doc are reunited, they are about to go back to the future when they encounter a problem: the DeLorean's fuel line was torn, and without gasoline, they can't get the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour. They come up with a hair brained scheme to hijack a train to push the time machine to 88 mph. The only problem is Doc has fallen in love with Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), and he is reluctant to leave her. Back to the Future Part III gets more criticism than Part II, and I do not really understand why. In fact I would say it is about as funny as the first movie, and a lot funnier than the second. The bar tender has some of the best lines in the series, like "Water? You want water you'd better go dunk your head in the horse trough out there." and "There's a fella that can't hold his liquor!" The beginning is also my favorite opening scene in the series. When 1955 Doc sees Marty in his house, his reaction is priceless. I also thought the concept of 1985 Doc burying the time machine in a cave for seventy years was really cool. It was a nice touch to show the construction of the clock tower too.The love story between Doc and Clara is very sweet and a welcome new direction for the series. Back to the Future I &amp; II focused on Marty and his family, so it was a good idea to give Doc a turn. Marty comes to terms with his insecurities about being called a coward, and makes a fateful decision at the end which changes his life for the better. The only criticism I have is that the ending is a bit of a stretch. Just when Marty thinks Doc is gone, a time machine train appears, and Doc steps out with his two kids! It seems like the writers were trying too hard to be sentimental, and it's hard to accept that Doc would build another time machine after he was so dead set on destroying the Delorean. Nevertheless it still makes for a happy ending to a really fun series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The finale for the BTTF series is great. The Old West, what could be better? Since the Delorean was put in a cave, and it got those white walls, amazing! Then when he meets the ancestors, he had to use the name Clint Eastwood, so he wouldn't let them know he's a descendant. The bar scene is a hoot. The fancy footwork, Marty(Michael J. Fox) singing the song "BAD". Then he has to save his friend, "Doc" Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd) from an assassination. Finding out stuff from the 50's was a necessity, both Doc and Marty worked together as a fine team. The train scene is classic, since there's no fuel around the locomotive boosted the DeLorean, and went back on the tracks when Marty comes back to 1985. The Delorean may have been history, but the locomotive become the new time machine. Far Out! This movie was perfect. I liked very well. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are a team. Robert Zemeckis is a genius! Rating 4 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

So Marty and younger Doc gets to fix the flying time-traveling DeLorean back on it's feet. Where Doc has kept it hidden in a cave for over 70 years. Marty finds out that Doc will be murder in that year by Biff's great grand-father:Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson). Marty goes back in the pass to save him but things gets complicated, when Marty and Doc saved a woman named Clara (Oscar-Winner:Mary Steenburgen) and they unexpectedly changed her fate. Since she was supposed to die in an accidental death. But Doc ends up falling in love with Clara and Marty gets himself in trouble with "Mad Dog" but Marty's faith is now, more serious than Doc's previous dangerous faith.Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Cast Away, Death Becomes Her, Used Cars) made an enjoyable, entertaining fantasy/comedy/adventure sequel that is better than the complicated second film. it also has some great visual gags as well. Although this was the least successful in the U.S. Box Office but this film does play well on video. The leads are terrific in this.DVD has an sharp Pan &amp; Scan (1.33;1) transfer and an good, digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an Q &amp; A commentary track by the director and screenwriter:Bob Gale (1941, Tales from the Crypt presents Bordello of Blood, Trespass). DVD also has another commentary track by producer:Neil Canton and Gale. DVD also has behind the scenes featurette, trivia track, deleted scene and more. Do not miss this enjoyable fantasy/adventure.

		<shortDescription>A western touch for this final installment in the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, 1985's "Back to the Future" turned out to be a massive hit. After that movie, it took four years for the first sequel to finally come, but then the final installment in the trilogy was released the following year. Neither of these sequels have generally been considered as good as the original smash hit sci-fi comedy, and it seems that quite a few "Back to the Future" fans have been disappointed by them, but in my opinion, they are both only slightly inferior.Marty is stuck in the year 1955 again, while the Doc Brown of 1985 is stuck in 1885. Marty has received a letter from Doc from 1885, telling him where he is, and giving him instructions on where to find the damaged time machine so the Doc of 1955 can help the 1980s teenager get back to his time. Doc has also told Marty in this letter that he is happy in 1885 and Marty is not to attempt to rescue him. However, just after Marty and the Doc of 1955 find the time machine, Marty sees a tombstone with Doc's name on it! It turns out that the scientist was shot in 1885 by an outlaw named Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen (an ancestor of Biff Tannen), not long after he wrote the letter to Marty! So now, despite Doc's instructions, Marty must use the repaired time machine to travel back to the old west and save his friend! If you look at the IMDb ratings and votes for the three installments in the "Back to the Future" trilogy, it is clear that each one is less popular than the last. Each film has a lower rating than the last, and has less votes. In fact, the original 1985 blockbuster has a significantly higher rating than its two sequels, as well as a significantly higher number of votes. However, parts two and three still have reasonably high ratings, and both have over 40, 000 votes, which means they are fairly popular. While I agree that neither sequel can match the original, both of them have enough qualities to make them worthy sequels.Of the three movies, "Back to the Future Part III" definitely bears the most differences from the others. Since so much of it takes place in the old west, this final installment in the trilogy is partially a western, which is not something that can be said about its two predecessors. So, for fans of the previous two installments (or at least the original) who strongly dislike the western genre in movies, this conclusion in the trilogy would obviously be disappointing. However, unless you detest westerns in general, "Part III" could be very enjoyable for you, with lots of excitement, as well as some laughs (just like parts one and two). While "Part III" may not be as consistent as the original, it's still a job well done, and if you want to see how the story ends, I highly doubt you want to miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Easily worth it's ten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised to learn that people thought this was the weak link in the series. It is perhaps the most delightful because of the addition of Mary Steenburgen, Doc's unexpected love interest.She makes every film she's in a little special. Women could really take lessons on how she does it. Or maybe we'll never know. She played the same sort of role in Time After Time (1979). She's very formal, but because she's not the best looking person in any group of people, she lets it be known that she's very interested in letting the relationship go further. Give nothing, receive everything. Especially in the beginning. If ever there was a woman who represents the feminine mystique (or what men think of as the feminine mystique) it is embodied in Mary Steenburgen.The characters she creates are intelligent, been around, knows what's happening, but always takes a chance because one time she's not going to be disappointed. Doc doesn't stand a chance: it's not only her intelligence. It's she.Then there's Tannon. He would gladly rape Clara, but he would never succumb to her wiles. When "Mad Dog" (hope he never reads this -- he hates the name from anyone but his friends and I don't dance very well) wants to kill Doc at the dance, Marty throws a pie plate to spoil his aim. When Buford Tannon ("Mad Dog") issues his threat, he finds out he has such a busy itinerary of wrong doing that the soonest he can work it in is two days hence, first thing in the morning. It's a Mastercard Priceless moment.Doc himself is his usual energetic goofy self, inventing things that raise absurdity to a new level. What makes him so funny is that he never tells a joke, would not understand one if it was told, and babbles scientific principles that exist only in his own mind -- certainly in no text I've ever read.Michael J. Fox is just right for the part. Even his counterpart in 1885 Shames McFly from Ireland you understand is a scream on the screen and yet there seems to be nothing you could point to that would make him as appealing and humorous as he is other than to say Fox exudes charm the way a boyish teenage class president exudes charm.This is a film worth spending a couple of hours with. Enjoy its enthusiasm and good humor. I think it is by far the best of the three.</fullReview>

Although it confuses me on the fact that Doc said he was going to destroy the time machine cuz it was nothing but trouble, and yet he builds a second time machine made from a train. And if it takes so much just to build a fridge that looks more like an assembly line, how could've he built such a futuristic thing in 1885? I know he had to come back for his dog einstein and as he says he didn't want marty to worry about him but unless he only travels from 1885 to 1985 or whatever time just to see marty, everything will be fine i guess. I also wish they had told us what happened to doc at the end. You can guess he went back to 1885 to live with his new family but then what? "Hey Doc, So where ya going now? Back to the future?"Nope, already been there", are 2 lines that i think leave the subject to wide open. There was closure at the end, but i don't think there was enough of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this film. With the hopping between the 50's, 80's and the future in the other two films, it was a perfect time for the franchise to go back even further. The old west is a great place to finish up the trilogy. All of the themes that played out so well in the first film are wrapped up here nicely in the old West.This film I tend to find on TV more so than the others. Not too sure why, but I think the overall finality of it and the setting are contributing factors. This was the first time someone tried to film a franchises 2nd and 3rd acts back to back. I think of the films that have tried this, this trilogy was able to do it the best. I love this third act and it always makes me glassy eyed when "the end" comes up.The relationship between Doc and Marty is one of the great character building relationships in film.

Better plotted than part II because it has a simpler, more character focused story, it's really Doc Brown's film in which Marty plays an lesser role and thats fine with me because he was always my favourite of the two anyway. I'm not a fans of Westerns, though they've grown on me in the last few years, but the third portion is a affectionate pastiche which plenty to enjoy and although a love interest sub-plot is about as welcome as freight train careering into your life's work, Mary Steenburgen, drippy and a little bit kooky, just about cuts the mustard though given her tendency to cause problems for the time travelling duo perhaps letting her fall to her death might have been the safest course of action. Its all tied up in a fairly moralistic, 'everyone gazes lovingly into each others eyes' fashion which makes us cynical Europeans groan a bit and I'm fairly sure steam power isn't quite a viable substitute for plutonium but in a series with flying cars and a Libyan terrorist cell chasing a teenager with a rocket launcher in the middle of a Californian shopping mall car park, thats just niggling. A terrible waste of a Delorean too, you can't just walk into a showroom and buy another one y'know!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Finishing Touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first "Back To The Future" film was an all-time classic that needs no introduction. Its quasi-scientific approach to fantasy (where time-travel is explained except where doing so makes the plot impossible) gives it just the right touch for a mainstream audience. The second and third parts of the trilogy were filmed simultaneously, so they need to be viewed as a whole, even if they were not released as one; this obviously hurt II's performance with the critics and at the box office.The strength of the series has always been as a buddy film: Marty and Doc have a close friendship that few of us ever get to experience. They completely trust and rely on each other, and they only argue without ever really fighting or even hinting at betrayal. They can count on each other in a way that most of us can't, and accept each other's individuality. It takes a lot of trust to take the risks that Marty and Doc take for each other.Each movie of the series has involved the same characters in different time settings, and that itself is fascinating. Biff Tannen is now Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen, what one would expect a survivalist ancestor of the 1950s schoolyard bully or 1980s workplace bully to be. George and Lorraine McFly are now Seamus and Maggie McFly, a far more mature and industrious, and far less dysfunctional, couple that we would expect of first-generation immigrants of an era when there was too much work to be done for one to bumble around like George or become embittered like Lorraine. This "Mr. Strickland" is not a school principal, but a Marshall, and he is neither intimidated nor fooled by Biff/Buford. Doc Brown is back as himself, setting up shop as a blacksmith and relying on his superior knowledge to see his way through that era.Even the humor is transplanted. Marty gets to "learn" how to shoot on a practice range that looks like his favorite "Outlaw" video game and dazzles the locals. The chase scene is transplanted, but skateboards don't move well on dirt, so he is lassoed. The space-time continuum is threatened yet again, this time by Doc's love interest, Clara (played by the well-cast Marty Steenburgen). Doc and Marty are again ridiculed when they share their visions of the future with the locals ("automobiles?"), and we once again find our heroes having to figure out a way to get "back to the future." No one can say that this film or either one before it jumps any sharks, that's for sure. The story was amazingly true to itself throughout all three films.</fullReview>

I know that some people knock 2 or 3, but frankly, I thought 2 was incredibly creative and 3 is my favorite. Yes, if you start examining things too closely, you can find holes, but let's be realistic--you have to suspend disbelief to accept time travel in the first place, so why nit pick? I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of my DVD trilogy and can't wait to see the extras. And my favorite line in all the three--"you better go out there, or people will say that Clint Eastwood is the biggest coward in the west". And I loved the Eastwood ravine at the end. These films were so well plotted and put together--not just your typical sequels because the first one made money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy climax to a fine trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it doesn't have quite the same ingenuity and vitality that made the first two parts such great entertainment, the third and final part of the excellent Back to the Future trilogy still offers two hours of solid entertainment. The first part saw our heroes go back into the past slightly, and the second part saw us travel into the future; so to be different, this one finds us massively in the past, in the great Wild West. What follows is a mixture of various western tributes (some of which are blatantly obvious, others less so) combined with a fun, if slightly predictable, plot line. Marty McFly has had to travel back to 1885 in order to save Doc Brown, whom Marty has discovered will die on Monday if he doesn't do something about it. With the space time continuum in disarray, Marty must struggle to save Doc Brown from a notorious gunman known as MadDog (who looks suspiciously like Biff from the other two films) while also making sure that he doesn't change anything as it will have serious repercussions on his future. That's the future from 1985 onwards, not the 1895 one. I think.For a trilogy of films predominantly aimed at children, this has one hell of a confusing plot. Luckily, however, through tight scripting and a nice plot pace; Robert Zemeckis tells his story well, and even if you're not sure of the plot line on the whole, it's always obvious what's immediately going on. The film features a number of nice set-pieces (much like the other two) and there honestly isn't a moment of down time in the entire film (or trilogy, for that matter). As you might expect, the best set-piece has saved until the end; and the train chase climax blends tension, suspense and humour to ensure that the film ends on a high. The characters are well done and entertaining throughout, and both the leads; Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd were born to play the roles that they play in this film. Both have made other movies, but neither one has even come close to being as memorable as they are here; and that reinforces my point. On the whole, this is a worthy climax to a very fine trilogy and it should please everyone who sees it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A western unlike any other!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie continues where the last one with Marty stuck in 1955. But Doc Brown sent him a letter from 1855 through Western Union, that told him that after the Delorean was struck by lightning he was sent to 1855 and was unable to repair it, but has managed to bury it somewhere, where Marty can get to it in 1955 and hopefully the younger version of himself can repair it so he can drive it back to 1985 and then destroy it. But after finding it, Marty discovers that shortly after sending the letter Doc would be shot by an outlaw, Mad Dog Tannen. Marty then goes back to 1885 to save him and meets his ancestors. After finding the Doc, they were about to leave when Marty told the Doc that upon arriving the Delorean's gas tank was punctured, so they don't have any gasoline to run the car, which means they have to find some way to get the car to 88 mph. They decide to try pushing it with a locomotive. And things are fine except for the fact that Tannen, who had it in for Doc, now has it for Marty and has challenged him to gunfight on the day that they are going to leave, and Doc is smitten with Clara Clayton, the new school teacher.I think of this as a sci-fi western. It really fun and has some cool special effects. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and Mary Steenburgen do amazing jobs with their roles and as always director Robert Zemeckis gives us some great comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back To The Future 3 is the most exciting conclusion of the popular franchise and one of the best films of 1990 this time our favorite heroes go back to the wild west. Marty(Fox) goes back to 1885 to save his pal Doc Brown (Lloyd) from getting killed by Mad Dog Tannen (Wilson), during the film Doc falls in love with Clara Clayton (Steenburgen)a new teacher who arrived in town. When I first saw the movie it was very entertaining and amazing Michael J. Fox once again did an incredible job as Marty and Christopher Lloyd was funny as Emmett Brown a scientist and inventor. If anyone is a fan of science fiction I recommend that you see the entire series because it's worth it . 9/10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Continuing the tradition of the "Back To The Future" trilogy, Michael J.

The second film saw introduction of Marty's girlfriend Jennifer and the finale saw Clara Clayton, a love interest for Emmett "Doc" Brown.The film was set in the 1885 old west, which was a great change. I don't think I would have liked it as much if it was set in 1885 and a regular setting as the viewers witnessed in the first two films.I'm glad I saw this film because it continued to have the same great elements as the first two with the same dialogue and scenes but crafted in such a way that was unique to the trilogy.I was sad to see this great trilogy come to an end but as the clich goes all good things must come to an end. I can only wonder what would have happened if there more films.If there is anyone who has not seen any of the films in the trilogy, they are missing out on a great piece of nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After receiving a letter from the Doc saying he is living in 1885 and that the Delorian is hidden in a cave on the outskirts of Hill Valley, Marty and the Doc of 1955 repair the delorian and Marty is about to go back to his time when he finds out that the Doc will be shot by Mad Dog Tannen in the year 1885. Marty decides to go back and save the Doc and get back to 1985 to get rid of the time machine for good. But, can Marty survive the old west, and pull the Doc away from his new love Clara. Back to the Future Part 3 is the last in this great series of time travel flicks. It has all the charm and fun of the first two, but now the action takes place in the west. Great acting all around. Most of the cast is back, soundtrack is still top notch, and just a great ending to a great series. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Enjoyable Trilogy Comes to an End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Back To The Future Trilogy in my mind is the most enjoyable Trilogy out there. The Movies are not too long, the characters are easy to like, the bad guy is fun to hate and the plot line is easy to follow for anyone. The Adventures of Marty McFly and Doc Brown are exciting to watch in the first two films and the fun doesn't stop in the third.Often called the worst film of the bunch, BTTF three takes our characters to the old west. I, myself, enjoyed this idea. We did the 1955 thing twice, we been to the future, why not go back to a time where we could see Hill Vally being built. How the Tanned family has been picking on the McFly family as soon as the McFly's showed up in Hill Vally. I also liked the idea that the third film returns to a more simple storyline. The first film was almost a love story mixed with action, the second was action with interesting ideas in returning back to a time where there are two Marty's and two Doc Browns, two people who have all ready lived that day and can't risk running into their younger selves. The third film returns us back to a love story, this time involving Doc Brown and his interest, Clara Clayton.Now, some people have questioned the idea that If Marty had not gone back to 1885, than Doc wouldn't have been their to save Clara."but i did have one small doubt. clara is saved by the doc. and marty together. meaning had marty not gone back in time, the doc. would not have saved clara as both of them went to the cliff. in which case clara would have been killed had marty not gone back. THEN HOW DID HER NAME APPEAR ON THE GRAVESTONE OF THE DOC. BEFORE MARTY WENT BACK IN TIME?SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD LONG BEFORE THE DOC GOT KILLED"Interesting point, but one must remember that if Marty would not have come back to 1885, than Doc would have picked Miss Clara Clayton at the train station. See, in the original folk tale, before Doc traveled to 1885, no one picked Clara at the station, and she fell into the Ravine, however, when Doc goes back in time, Doc is there to pick Clara up at the station. When Marty goes back to 1885, Doc is asked to pick her up, but he forgets because he is with Marty, but later, Doc happens to save her anyway, thus falling in love with her.BTTF Trilogy manages to amaze me in each film, and the climatic train sequence is a wonderful ending to the Time Machine and the Trilogy. I only hope that maybe one day, they can bring back BTTF to the big screen one more time.</fullReview>

I also had a bunch of favourites, but after rewatching them now, I understood, that the only great movie is Back to the Future... all parts. Even nowadays with these super visual effects all around our minds, killing with realism, BTTF looks good, even better than some of new installments. And it will be great forever.

		<shortDescription>One of the best sequels I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels are annoying. They think they can take the ideas from the original, and somehow build up a plot different enough and interesting enough to arouse people's interest in seeing it. And yes, people see it, but it really isn't any good. "Back to the Future" is perhaps the best 'sci-fi-comedy-thriller' ever made. Then they made "Back to the Future Part II", which I said was not an exception to that rule I mentioned, but indeed an improvement. But what about "Back to the Future Part III"? Does it meet the mediocre expectations everyone had? No. It exceeds them.Honestly, "Back to the Future Part III" is just as good as the original "Back to the Future". On paper, it actually looks pretty boring; especially compared to the fast-packed action we got in the first two. And even after I've given you to storyline, you'll still have doubts. I'll explain my arguments contradicting that later on.Here's the story: Just like BTTF2, BTTF3 takes place at the exact time BTTF2 left off. Marty goes back to 1955 Doc and Doc passes out. The first new scene is actually the funniest scene in the movie: Marty had taken Doc home, and it's now the next morning. Marty and Doc are lying on adjacent couches in Doc's den, and when Doc wakes up, he still doesn't realize Marty's there. Then he voice records the events of the previous night into some kind of 1955 tape recorder, and then Marty taps Doc on his shoulder and Doc turns around, and puts on a hilarious performance, of how shocked he is to see him. Well anyway, the movie proceeds with Marty reading 1985 Doc's letter, in which Doc tells him that he's buried the DeLorean he took with him to 1885 in a mine (so Marty can use it to go back to 1985). HOWEVER...the mine is right next to an old cemetery, and Marty comes across a familiar tombstone.There's a whole lot more. As a matter of fact, what I just described is only the first 15 minutes or so. Hopefully, what I DID just tell you will convince you enough. And the bottom line of BTTF3 is: though Roger Ebert complained about how they've toned down on the time traveling quite a bit in this one, it really is just as fun and entertaining as the first and the second. The climax is especially wonderfully worth watching, as is the rest of it. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely much underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been underrated from its release to this day. Even the producers and director underrate it.If you see the film out of context of the other two you will watch a nice and well-done Western parody, which on the one hand tries to mock typical cliches and on the other hand conveys something about real life on the Frontier. Isn't it quite funny how the "educated" Marty McFly falls for every cliche he has seen on TV? Even the gunmen (Tannen and his gang), who themselves try hard to *be* the feared Jesse James' of their valley, are baffled by Marty's view on the West.Almost everything that connects this part to the other two is nothing more than icing on the cake, knitting together some loose ends (i.e. Marty's inability to play the guitar). It doesn't add anything to the characters or plot or story. Nonetheless these in-jokes are brilliantly executed, coming nice and easy, not with big fanfare.I really recommend this film - although, let it be noted that it is not the brilliant and innovative movie that *Back to the Future * is. Or s dark a satire as the second part; it's just plain old fun with real characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that someone could make a third-installment that is just as good or at least pretty close to the other two films. I really liked this film and it is a great continuation of part II. I'm not one to like westerns, but this movie really pulls it off (of course, this isn't really much of a western, just a western setting)! Robert Zemeckis is definitely one of the best directors out there and he doesn't let you down with this film. The acting in this film is great, the story is incredible and the special effects are superb. I have to say that I'm really impressed with Michael J. Fox and Thomas F. Wilson in these films because of how many different characters they play and how many different versions of the same characters they play. There really isn't much I can say other than "See This Movie!!! And if you haven't already, see Part I and II." This is definitely a great finale to a great trilogy.

		<shortDescription>The perfect conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why Back to the Future Part III go so knocked out by everybody when they saw it and just say that they liked everyone but this. Maybe because it doesn't have the fast-pace of Part II but it more than makes up for it in humor. Plus, it leaves you satisfied, knowing that there probably won't be any more Back to the Future movies. Not as easy thing to do. The story picks up right where Part II's cliffhanger ended: Marty McFly (Micheal J. Fox) is stuck in 1955 when the DeLorean time machine piloted by his friend Doc (Christopher Lloyd), from 1985, is struck be lightning and sent back to 1885. When Marty discovers that Doc is shot a few days after his postmarks a letter to Marty, McFly decides to disobey Doc's wishes, go back in time, and save Doc from his fate. It is much easier to explain if you see Part II (all the movies, actually). I was kind of letdown by Part II's lack of humor but I am glad to see that it has been restored in III. Doc and Marty have some great lines and the overall tone of the Wild West in 1885 is light and fun (Marty's alias is Clint Eastwood). Both Chistopher Lloyd and Fox are fine is roles they have become quite familiar with. The only problem is Mary Steenburgen, who plays Clara, the love interest of Doc and one of the deciding factors on wether or not he should leave. She has an annoying quality and it's tough to root for the romance, although Doc is very likeable. The special effects are quite good in Back to the Future Part III, a signature of any film that Steven Spielberg is involved with. Alan Silvestri's score is also as good as it has been in the previous films. The movie really wrapped up the trilogy with humor and charm, plus great performances. As much as I like Back to the Future, I can't imagine another sequel, just because this movie ended it so well. See the whole trilogy because they are the best movies in the cast and crew's careers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Final Film is Fun Enough, but Missing Something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Zemeckis's fantastic time travel trilogy ends with a whimper. Well, all right, that may be a little harsh, but I don't feel it lived up to the fun of the first two. The finale finds Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) trapped in the wild west of 1885 and Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is determined to bring him back when he discovers Doc is murdered by local outlaw Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson). It's got some fun moments but my favorite aspect of the trilogy, time travel, isn't as prominent this time around.After Marty arrives in 1885, the time travel element is put on hold for the duration of the film, as the DeLorean is temporarily out of commission. This is unfortunate, as the DeLorean is probably my favorite "character" from the trilogy. Watching as Doc and Marty bounce around time to fix the paradoxes they create was always a blast; this time it's just a matter of getting back to the future before Tannen kills either one of them. We're also treated to a new love interest for Doc, in the form of Mary Steenburgen as schoolteacher Clara Clayton. It's nice to see Doc getting attention but it's still not what I was looking for in a BTTF film.The movie plays out like a generic western/fish-out-of-water comedy and is good for some laughs. Marty's reaction to antiquated life in the old west is funny enough and I loved the final act with Doc and Marty's final confrontation with Tannen and race against time to get the DeLorean up to speed. Still, of the three films, this film finds itself as the weak link in the chain. The cast is phenomenal as we've come to expect, and it really helps with the mediocre storyline. On the off chance you haven't already since this, don't expect the final installment of one of cinema's most memorable series to leave you completely satisfied, but at least you know you can count on an entertaining two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sequels ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Back to the Future is in my opinion one of the very best in its genre. Of course it was such a huge success that there had to be a sequel or two. Predictably, Back to the Future Part II was not anywhere near as good as the original. Back to the Future Part III on the other hand manages to match and even maybe surpass the quality of the first one.In this movie Marty travels back to 1955 and meets Doc (just seconds after Doc sent him back to the future in the first movie) to tell him that he (Doc) is stuck in 1885 because of a time travel he took in 1985(!) Marty then has to go back to 1885 too to warn Doc that he is about to be shot in a few days and therefore has to come back to 1985 with him (Marty). The idea of a time travel to the Wild West is pretty amusing, and here the opportunity for fun anachronistic situations is well taken care of. For example, when Marty has to come up with a name for himself, of course the first one that springs to mind is Clint Eastwood. "What a sissy name is that?" one of the bad guys remarks. And the scene where Marty has to dance to avoid being shot in his feet and starts to moonwalk is just hilarious.I think in addition to the humor, what makes this movie so watchable is that great care is taken to make the Western environment convincing. Also the story is pretty exciting and not totally predictable as is often the case in this type of movies. The acting is first class and the actors really seem to enjoy themselves.My only complaint is that the ending is kind of a letdown, but other than that I could hardly imagine how the movie could have been improved. I have seen it at least three times, and saw it again for the first time in many years with my 10 year old daughter a few days ago. She enjoyed it a lot, but not as much as the first in the series. This was mainly due to the fact that she had problems with making sense of the story which is a bit convoluted for a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to the Future Part III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film is brilliant, the second film is less brilliant, and this final instalment in the trilogy is just as good as the first, from director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump) and executive producer Steven Spielberg. You remember that Dr. 'Doc' Emmet Brown was struck by lightning in 1955, sending him to 1885, but he managed to send a letter to his friend, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox). Marty has found 1955 Doc, after the moment he sent him back to 1985 in the first film, and he needs his help send him back again. In this letter, Doc explains that he was okay, and that he does not want Marty to come back for him, but after finding the DeLoreon time machine in the mine where Doc left it, not far away is a grave stone with Doc's name on it, made a week after he sent the letter. So now Marty ignores Doc's wishes, and goes to 1885 to save his life, and bring him back to 1985. Marty briefly meets the man who is set to kill Doc, Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson, also playing a brief Biff Tannen), and he eventually finds Doc, who has been working as a blacksmith. They cannot go back to the future because the DeLoreon's fuel system was damaged, but they get an idea to push it to get it up to the speed of 88mph, using the train. This idea is slowed though, when after rescuing her, and changing history doing it, Doc meets, and is infatuated with school teacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen). Mad Dog meanwhile has now instead of Doc, intends to kill Marty, or, should that be Clint Eastwood (which Marty called himself). Doc was planning not to go back with Marty, but he made him realise he does not belong in this time, and say a heart felt goodbye to Clara. The day of the train "experiment" comes, and after defeating Mad Dog, Marty and Doc prepare to go back to the future, but Clara is not far behind when she realises Doc's explanation for leaving was true. In the end, after a great train scene, Marty made it back, and after getting out of it, the time machine was destroyed like Doc wanted, but he and Clara on the hover board never made it to the car. But don't worry, after Marty gets back to girlfriend Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue), Doc returns in the train, which he converted into a time machine, and also reveals his two young boys, before blasting off again, oh, and he explained that the future hasn't been written yet, so a happy ending for both Marty and Doc. Also starring Lea Thompson as Maggie McFly/Lorraine McFly. An improvement from the previous sequel, both the story and characters are all lovable, Doc in particular got a deserved love story, a good adventure and western film, with a little technology involved. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have a nice future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It vexes me no end just how many people are in the habit of calling this the weakest of all the 'Back to the Future' movies ? I'm not going to claim that it's any real patch on the 1985 original, of course, but then again the original was undeniably one movie of a special kind ? innovative, fast-paced and sharply-written, words cannot describe the kicks I still get out of watching it after all these years. Try as they may, neither sequel was quite able to match this golden standard, but at the very least 'Back to the Future Part III' is on equal par with the second film (and at most it's heaps better). While you can look back on 'BTTF Part II' as a loud, flashy and perfectly enjoyable theme park ride of a flick, oozing with thrills and spills but of the somewhat more superficial sort, 'BTTF Part III' has succeeded in toning down all the hyperactivity by a notch, devoting a bigger thrust of time to plot and character and thus making it the superior follow-up all-round. Here, the real backbone of this trilogy ? the friendship between Marty McFly and Doc Brown ? is given a lot more weight than in the previous round, throwing the unlikely duo into all sorts of perilous situations to test their loyalty to each other, and earning it points for warmth and heart. As before, both Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd have tackled their roles brilliantly, and the best laughs continue to come from Marty's sweet na?veness in contrasting the present with the past (if that moon-walking sequence doesn't do it for you, you seriously need to order a new sense of humour ? go try your luck on Ebay). Plus, Doc Brown's new love interest in Mary Steenburgen doesn't serve this movie badly either, even allowing the screenplay a couple of quiet and reflective moments to finally consider some of those philosophical musings that might just cross your mind when you mess with the space time continuum.So although a massive improvement on the 1989 instalment, there are reasons why this never manages to pack quite the same punch as its big father film of 1985. The biggest problem that 'BTTF III' has in setting itself primarily in the Wild West is that it's virtually impossible to pedal clear of the standard clichs (not to mention forced Western accents) you'll find attached to any level of parody of this genre. And while the vast majority of parallel scenes from the other BTTF movies that are echoed fondly throughout work to good effect, I for one was getting a little tired of Thomas F Wilson always having to crash head-first into a pile of horse manure (it was funny the first couple of times). There's also the rather messy subplot concerning Marty's personal future that had to be carried over here from the previous flick, drilling in a good few extra plot-holes as it goes ? but I'm a big enough fan to turn a blind eye for the most part. In the end, the overall air of this film is far too breezy and good-natured for any of its flaws to have any lasting detriment - it's very entertaining, you can warm to and understand the characters, and with action-adventure movies like this that's all that really matters.Everything considered, in concocting a fun and thoroughly feel-good final chapter to close this adventure and do the original movie justice, they succeeded well enough, enabling you to walk away with pure satisfaction in your heart. After all this time, this still emerges as one of the most memorable and enjoyable cinematic trilogies ever conceived. Godfather what?Grade: a very strong B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2nd best, minor spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing beats the original but this film has two of the three most hilarious moments in the trilogy and for that I like it more than the 2nd which I found ill-fittingly dark, for some reason.The first moment of inconceivable mirth features Doc Brown furlong and disconsolate nursing a single shot post sunrise surrounded by slack jawed half-wits.Finally downing the whisky he stiffens like a enthused cock, falling, already unconscious on to the dusty floor knocking over a table in his declension. TIMBER!The second finds the exultant Mad Dog Tannen, after shooting Marty, swaggering forward, redistributing weight from one foot to another in a gleeful fashion as he takes a bow and slurs the words 'thank you, thank you' in a hilariously illusory show of appreciation for the gaping crowd.Coulda been even better if not for minor plot holes which only the ridiculously obsessive fan would pick up on and an overly neat and upbeat ending which comes of aspatronising to the viewer.....a more contemplative ending would have been a far more fitting end to the story. Doc shoulda stayed in the Old West.8.5/10 - recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice End To The Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning it was clear that there were only going to be three Back to the Future films with a beginning, middle and definite end. Twelve years after this film's release, it's nice to see that promise has been kept.I won't spoil the plot too much but Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd once again do a good job. Fox as Marty McFly travels back to 1885 to help out Doc Brown who is in a spot of bother.Just like the previous two films there are plenty of laughs and some truly great scenes (particularly the final scenes). My favourite scene was where McFly who is in the wild west tells everyone his name is Clint Eastwood and they all look at him in disbelief ("What type of a name is that?").All in all, this was a great end to a fantastic trilogy. I urge anyone to check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film. It was very well done and a great way to end arguably the greatest movie trilogy of all time (with a respectful nod to Star Wars). This movie contains a line that has become my favorite in cinema history. When Doc is in the bar, depressed over being dumped by Miss Clara, sitting with a bottle of whiskey in front of him and holding a shot of whiskey, he spills the beans on the future. This violates all his beliefs about not messing with the space/time continuum. One of the men at the bar notices that Doc has been talking abstractly about the future for hours, discussing inventions that nobody understands. "How many has he had?" the man asks. And then the line that--in my opinion--is a priceless classic: "NONE! That's his first one and he hasn't touched it yet! He just likes to sit there and hold it!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant Closing to the Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back to the Future Part III was less confusing than Part II, but it also dispensed with most of the time travel paradoxes and mysteries that made the Parts I and II so intriguing.Set almost entirely in 1885 it picks up at the cliff-hanger ending of Part II with Doc Brown inadvertently sent to 1885, and Marty stuck in 1955. The 1955 version of Doc Brown helps Marty return to 1885 to save Doc's life, and there the movie remains until the very end.I wish Part III had moved about in time more, and the 1885 version of Hill Valley not been so hokey, but I still heartily recommend Part III and the entire trilogy. Part I is by far the best, and the only part that can be viewed by itself. Don't try to view Parts II and III without viewing the precedent movies....if you do you will definitely be lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great end to a great trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third and final part in the Sci-Fi Comedy trilogy picks up directly from the second movie with Marty stranded in 1955, after Doc was accidentally sent back to 1885. Instead of going back home to 1985, Marty decides to go back to the old West when he discovers Doc's fate in 1885 is that he will be shot dead by Biff Tannen's ruthless grandfather Buford "Mad Dog".The second and third movies in the trilogy seem to divide opinion. Some prefer the more special effects and plot driven 2, and some prefer the more relaxed, character driven nature of this one. I personally love both and I'm glad they offer different things. As much as I like 2 for fully taking advantage of the Time Travel concept, I'm glad that the film-makers didn't try to go further with the special effects and ideas. The first movie despite it's premise was more about character and heart than it was action and special effects and it was good to see a return to that here.Third time around, Michael J.Fox and Christopher Lloyd are still on great form and playing off each other well. And it's good to see Marty and Doc interact with each other more here, the plot really gets to flesh out their friendship, and even Doc's character when he meets and falls in love with a schoolteacher (Mary Steenburgen).The movie looks fantastic. Director Robert Zemeckis said he wanted to make a western and his affection for them is on full display. There's some desert scenery and photography here that was shot at Monument Valley which instantly reminds you of The Searchers. With Marty using Clint Eastwood as his alias and after the brief clip of Fistful Of Dollars in the second movie it's no surprise that the spaghetti westerns come in for the spoof treatment, but with Marty been a civilized "fish out of water" and Buford a nasty bully, the movie mainly pays homage to the classic The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. And just in case you don't get the instant reference Tannen even calls him dude. But despite all the amusing in-jokes and send-ups at play, the film thankfully still has it's own originality and carries that distinctive charm the previous BTTF movies had.It's a good-natured sequel that builds up to an entertaining showdown in the street, and then a well staged sequence with a speeding train that's just as exciting as the climax of the first movie involving the clock tower.I'm just glad they ended the series like this before the ideas became tired and repetitive. Many franchises are ruined by too many sequels and thankfully this wasn't one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The conclusion to a fantastic trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some critics seem to claim that this is their least favorite in the trilogy (which I could see why), however this is my personal second favorite. Yeah, this one probably has the least to do with time travel from the rest. And just seemed like an excuse to travel to the wild west era. However I just enjoyed the development and chemistry, although it does seem a bit rushed from time to time. The plot this time is simple and yet entertaining, it revolves around saving the Doc's life and making it back to present time. What this movie is, is a nice modern at least when this flick came out, homage to the western films, especially the ones with Clint Eastwood in it. I am pretty sure that this third installment was planned alongside part 2, because it does pick up nicely after the second installment and is simply interwoven well. The flaw is that the stakes just seemed weaker this time around and just lacked those clever moments that the first and second has. The simplicity is a nice touch, however I would have been nice if this had a bit more momentum going for it along the ride. Despite the cool way they decide to take Marty back to the future. The chemistry this time is at it's peak even if the development in certain areas like I said is weak and thus the interactions and how they deal with the environment Marty is in, is actually quite engrossing. Even if I just didn't like how the Doc starts to break all of his rules for time travel. All in all this installment is a worthy conclusion to a fantastic trilogy.8.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Rare Brilliant Closings to an Amazing Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this passing month, I have seen all three "Back to the Future" films for the very first time in my life. Now, I have seen many tiny pieces (I believe everyone has), enough to the point that if another film or show references "Back to the Future", I completely catch it. I must say, however, that there are very few trilogies on the planet that add up to such mesmerizing films as these. There are only four trilogies I love, and the list goes along like this: "The Lord of the Rings", the original "Star Wars" films, all three of "The Matrix" films, and now this. Believe me, readers: you will never find something as excellent as these three films about the curiosity of time travel being invented. I must admit that I was quite reluctant by the trailer for this film at the end of "Back to the Future: Part II", but I admire this one to an extent that surpasses the second film by far.For this third chapter in the saga, Marty McFly heads back in time to pick-up the Doc. At the moment, the Doc is trapped in a western time period, thus forcing Marty to create a new identity; Clint Eastwood. That's right. For the third time in the series, Marty and Doc must head back to the future . . .The first noteworthy thing to tell you is that this film may also be one of the greatest science-fiction AND western films ever created. It was definitely a brilliant idea to carry the story to the past this time round; otherwise, "Part III" could have been a failed re-treading of the first two "Back to the Future" films.The acting in this film is--simply put--heartfelt and endearing. The audience could swear that all three films were shot back-to-back, and that adds so much more to the series. We have also acquired the same charm of humor and action blended that the prior films had presented us with. There is not one single performance in the entire film that is lackluster; all of these actors shine brightly in these roles, much as they always did previously.The writing of dialogue and action setpieces in the film are so enveloping and epic, especially towards the close of the film. It's extraordinary in so many ways. I think the most appealing thing about the film is how it self-references itself continuously throughout the films. Self-referencing, as I stated earlier, is very charming, and it makes the audience feel so much more at home with the tale and characters. This film gives us a well-executed message about life, and I think this is one point of a plus that makes the film so joyful and welcoming. This film, besides being set in the past (nearly a hundred years before the eighties, to be exact), is more about our individual futures as human beings. This idea, in turn, is so very rare to see in filmography that you cannot help but praise the film with applause. Phenomenal.One very shocking revelation is the set itself: it looks like a real town in REAL western time periods. I actually had a double-take at how detailed some props and areas looked in the film. It is absolutely beautiful, especially when we see the many mountain ranges of this desert.As always, the soundtrack adds a childhood feeling to the film; that feeling you get when you are so familiar with a certain object that it brings this deep joy and empathy to your heart.With one last major compliment in the film's favor, I have to mention that when the film closed, I had the biggest smile on my face than I have had in quite a while. It is the kind of smile I believe everyone gets at the end of "Star Wars", or "The Lord of the Rings", or "It's a Wonderful Life". This film deserves every title of excellency it has received over the many years since its release.My rating for "Back to the Future: Part III" is a nine-out-of-ten stars.Merry Christmas, and God bless!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best of the three Back to the Future movies. Two was a hodgepodge impossible to follow without a "schematic", but this one is enjoyable on all levels. No fancy anything, just a few good actors in a lovely part of the country enjoying their time together and producing a really good film for the rest of us.The lighting and cinematography are great, the historical details interesting, the plot fun, and the geography just plain confusing. What's with "Devil's Tower" in the background of the drive in? Isn't that like, somewhere in Nevada or something? It sure would be, "a hell of a long hike back to Hill Valley!" Oh well, who cares? Marty has also gained some weight swooshing through the time portal this go around, but again, who cares? Michael Fox has said that "living happened" between the production of these three movies, his son was born, his father died...he must have been thinking about time indeed.Thank you all who made this excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the point where the dam breaks for the BTTF trilogy. Without the innocent, loose grasp of reality present in the first film, nor the amusing, campy glimpses of the future seen in the second, there's really not all that much to look forward to as this bad western lolls its way toward the finish line. Marty McFly and Doc Brown still make for strong core characters, ones we desperately want to see come out ahead, but they've got their arms full here with a stale set of recurring gags, a base premise that's thin at best and a hammy love story that doesn't really bring anything meaningful to the table. Where the original was able to effortlessly skirt the holes that speckled its plot, the saga's grand finale bowls straight through them with no regard for the repercussions, leaving audiences skeptical. A needless leap across both genre and era, at least it has the dignity to close the door behind it when the credits queue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once I saw each of these "Back To The Future" films on VHS, after viewing all of them earlier in the movie theaters, I wound up only keeping one: this one.This film - the third and final one in the "Back To The Future" series, didn't have the annoying bully "Biff" (except in a subservient role at the very end) and it had a nice western look and flavor to it. Yes, it's a little loud and the two main characters - "Marty McFly" (Michael J. Fox) and "Dr. Emmetr Brown" (Christopher Lloyd) mainly shout to each other (probably to hear over the noisy soundtrack!), but it's generally an enjoyable two hours of film with fun-type characters and a cool Old-West theme.Even the bad guy is kind of fun to watch. It also offers good humor and two pretty women, Mary Steenburgen and Elisabeth Shue. I loved the train scenes, too, which were beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The exciting conclusion to a series that defy all the rules of time travel and created a few new ones of their own.Running out of ideas to take the series after past and future they are sent to the 1800s in a spaghetti western based on popular trends at the time.While not the strongest in the trilogy, it offered a refreshing plot that hadn't been done before by focusing the attention on Emmett Brown who set up a respectable business, a honored member of the community and finds true love with Clair Clayton.I like the shift in time as I feel we explored the Myfly history to the brink and it was a dried up well. The relationship, though platonic, was uplifting to see two love birds romance one another old school.I noticed throughout repeating themes like the different times of hill valley, Marty's family being involved in some way, Biff's family all being thugs and the ever present clock tower that never seems to work. It does become an in joke of itself and loses some of the grounded reality at least we had besides the sci element.Both families stayed? The Tannons are bad seeds and that clock tower was cursed to never run, lol.Marty even has to fight him in a fuel after he searches history books confirming his old pal will die and does with the help of Clint Easy videos he memorized. As I said it becomes a parody of itself.The ending however was a roller coaster ride of craziness blending all the movies together as they rob a train trying to get up to 55 miles an hour, Claire comes galloping up to join her love and he must use the hoverboard to save her.As doc says farewell to his friend, I feel like it was a goodbye to all the fans and crew that made this thrilling trilogy a success.</fullReview>

Not only does Marty use Clint Eastwoods name as his persona (Which tickled Clint).

In this, the third and final chapter in the series, Marty McFly (Fox)is transported, thanks to the DeLorean, to the year 1885. The Old West. Alan Silvestri is back and he adds a "Western" flavor to the music score. Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox work great together and the story of time travel is a topic I love in science fiction."Back to the Future 3" is a well-written, well-directed, well-balanced piece. With an incredible musical score, brilliant acting and excellent composition, the movie reminded me that "Back to the Future" was never about action. The effects and everything are mild and tame in this one. Not as exciting as the previous ones. Still, it is a wonderfully made and put together film. It is thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable. A very satisfying end to the whole saga. All in all, good characters, story telling, and workable effects and acting.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the Back to the Future series. In particular, the first two. Back to the Future Part 3 isn't bad, but it's true it's not anywhere near as good as the first. In true Back to the Future Fashion, it starts just as the last left off. In 1955, after preventing a time-line where Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) becomes a corrupt casino owner, Marty McFly (Michael J Fox), witnesses his friend Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) get struck by lightning in the DeLorean DMC time machine, and sent back to 1885. After re-meeting 1955 Emmett (who had just helped the Marty of the first film get back to 1985), Marty goes to 1885, to bring home Emmett and prevent him from being killed by Biff's great grandfather Buford Tannen (Wilson). It's not as good as the first two, because it's not as funny or endearing as those ones. It is kind of a basic story. There's still a lot going on, just not enough to make Part 3 as interesting. But overall, it's still a good movie, and the ending scene really wraps up the trilogy nicely. If you're a fan (and you haven't already seen this movie) go check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sure, and I hope you're considering the future, Mr. Eastwood".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a fun film, but for reasons most viewers wouldn't even have considered. For starters, since the Western is my favorite movie genre, the Wild West setting allowed the film makers to introduce a trio of old time cowboy actors to the story. I don't think their character names were mentioned in the picture, but it was cool to see Harry Carey Jr., Pat Buttram and Dub Taylor hanging around the old saloon offering their take on Hill Valley newcomer Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox). I had to wonder if they might have all appeared together in a 'real' Western at some point along the way. I wouldn't bet against it.Then with all that Clint Eastwood business, the film brings up a great trivia point when Marty makes his appearance outside a movie theater in 1955, and right there is a poster for "Revenge of the Creature". That was the movie in which Clint Eastwood made his screen debut for just a brief moment, trying to figure out what happened to a missing lab mouse! That 'Creature' by the way, was the Creature From the Black Lagoon, and the movie was the second in the franchise consisting of three films.Regarding the actual story, I've long ago given up on trying to figure out how the time travel stuff works, it's just not that important. There was a time I would have twisted myself into a pretzel trying to keep it all straight but I've found that just going with the flow is a whole lot easier. Take Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) for example, his presence in 1885 for eight months should have had some impact on the space-time continuum for events in 1955 and 1985, but what's the point of trying to figure that out. By the time we get to the finale, old Doc is whizzing around the cosmos in his tricked out flying train with Clara (Mary Steenburgen) and his two little pardners.So the best thing to do here I guess is just have some fun with the picture, knowing that the saga of Marty and Doc has come to it's final conclusion. For all the players who appeared in all three episodes, good job, it had to be a once in a googolplex experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What kind of stupid name is that?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is basically the western version of the original film and hits the same beats, which I think is what makes it a more enjoyable experience. With a time machine there are absolutely no limits and the western is such a distinct and easily immersive setting that can be tweaked depending on your level of seriousness. Yes, it hits all the usual clichs but I think it does it well with a sort of light hearted humour about it. We chuckle when Marty dubs himself Clint Eastwood and thumbs his gun, holster and belt as he parades around the town spouting classic one liners (I know this is what I would do if I found myself transported back in time). It was admittedly cool to see Hilly Valley futurised but it quickly got old fast when we were confronted with the same scenarios; Biff, this time with three cronies, and even more villainous to the point of ridiculous. The western version of Biff feels more naturally fitting; he still is the one dimensional bully figure, he still has his cronies, he still thuggishly calls out Marty for being a chicken (yellow belly, this time) but these are the sorts of characters that pop up in westerns to be dispatched by our wandering hero. His natural animosity and nefariousness is just perfect for the rogue gunslinger who turns up and troubles the small townfolk. Likewise, Strickland had a rather random cameo in Part II that made little sense but his authoritative characterisation is very fitting for the role of the town sheriff. And in the McFly ancestors you have Lea Thompson is a subdued but effective role, accent and all, and Fox in the same disguise but not trying to draw attention to themselves. They are simply played straight, part of the landscape and don't have some crazy dilemma that must be fixed to assure the McFly lineage. It's with much more ease than that storyline which was developed and then tossed in Part II. And at the root of all we have the romance between Doc Brown and the lovely Clara Clayton. It's not hugely complex, but it's simply and sincere enough, something that seemed to be lacking in part II, and comparable to the situation of young Lorraine's crush on her time travelling son. This breeds a rather interesting conflict between the duties of the Doc to fix up all his mess and his first real relationship - previously he was just the crazy scientist who made the adventure all possible. Loyd's first heroic appearance and his verbal sparring is just great. And it all concludes in a action sequence of rip-roaring suspense - and in the end, we can imagine all the crazy stories they have with their kids.Fox is great again, and particularly goofy in his bright pink shirt and red pants against the dusty brown settlement, evoking again the same sort of alien feeling that his life preserver jacket did in the original. And he makes the goofs very funny too; the comedic timing of the Indians mural turning into real Indians on the backdrop of a chase in Monument Valley, the original of his shooting skills, his modern catchphrases, and the bar fight which he turns into a smooth dance routine. And in the ending, Zemeckis neatly ties up the trilogy by giving us closure for all the little haphazard moments in the future that were hinted at, and suggests fittingly, with the Delorean now destroyed, that it is now in their own hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The future has arrived, again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back To The Future part III was an improvement on part II, but still had a feeling of deja vu, and when they would try to do something different with the characters, familiarity with the setups fills the air, and the pieces would fall into place and we were watching a Western remake of the original. The DeLorean was clearly on its last leg, the wheels had quite literally fallen off, the fuel pump gone, no fuel, it's up to Marty and quack Doc Brown to get it up to 88 MPH, to get their happy asses back to the future, again. But then love rears its head in the form of Mary Steenbergen, and the Doc's plans might be changing. The leads are all as good as they ever were, but the formula was wearing thin. Still, this has more heart and charm in it than its predecessor, and the lighting in the Doc's stable was beautiful (as odd of a compliment as that may be) Another round of applause from the audience when this one ended was a great way to end the evening, Back To The Future day, 21 October 2015, as a good time was had by all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The third and final chapter of the Back to the Future trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back to the Future Part III (1990) is the final chapter of the Back to the Future trilogy which began in 1985. Due to the same freak lighting storm that sent Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) from 1955 back to 1985, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) was zapped by the same bolt sending him to 1885. With the fate of the space/time continuum and the lives of Marty and Doc weigh in the balance of the events that will transpire in the wild west version of the city of Hill Valley and their ancestors. Can Marty McFly and Doc Brown put everything back in balance or will the universe collapse from within itself?The final chapter of the Back to the Future trilogy is a fun watch but a big drop off from part II. They were both shot back-to-back utilizing most of the cast from the previous films. The writing and direction of Robert Zemeckis along with the acting of Michael J. Fox hold this film together. Christopher Lloyd held his own as the eccentric Doc Brown along with the lovable and talented Mary Steenburgen as the new schoolmarm Clara Clayton.Fans of the series will appreciate the ending of the film and storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The final installment in the Back to the Future trilogy picks up where the second film left off, but it casts off the dizzying time travel of the first two films for mostly routine comedy set in the Old West. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) receives a 70-year-old letter from his inventor friend, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who tells Marty that he has retreated a century in time to live out a relatively quiet life in the Old West. Doc Brown reveals that he hid his DeLorean car/time machine in an abandoned mine outside town, and when Marty does some research and discovers that the Doc died shortly after writing the letter, he decides to find the car, travel back in time, and warn the Doc about his demise. Meanwhile, the Doc, who has fallen in love with a local woman (Mary Steenburgen), realizes he can't hide in the past from the problems he has caused to the time flow in the previous two adventures. He reluctantly decides to return to the present with Marty, but first, they have to find a way to get the DeLorean up to time-travel velocity with a broken fuel line and no gasoline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My big mistake watching this film was seeing it out of sequence. I'm sure I saw B.T.T.F.1 on its original release, but don't remember catching numbers 2 &amp; 3 when they first came out. So maybe I should have held off viewing this, the final episode in Marty &amp; the Doc's time-travelling adventures, but if I lopped off the framing elements at the beginning and of this the third feature, it was still easy to enjoy this typically bright, humorous and action- packed Robert Zemeckis film.This time, to prevent the Doc's death in a past-life, our intrepid heroes have to double- back in time (with thanks to ZZ Top) to the old West to fix the time-line and still find a way back to their own time, a tricky task given that the DeLorean gets damaged en-route. Along the way, Marty meets his forebears and the Doc falls in love, the climax of the western section being a high noon showdown between Marty and a demonised Biff, before the expected race against time for Marty and the tying up of loose ends epilogue.I liked the film a lot, like the runaway train at the end it picks up speed as it goes and even if Zemeckis does pile on the climaxes a bit, it entertains all the way. As before, Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd pal about well together, while Mary Steenbergen is a welcome newcomer as Lloyd's surprise love-interest. The special effects don't always quite come off, but there are some neat humorous touches, like when Marty and the Doc exchange catch-phrases and especially Marty's preferred post-breakfast gunfighting preference. Marty's back-story about meeting his great-great grandparents is weakened by him having clumsily play both parts but otherwise this was a good-natured, matine-adventure fun movie. Now to go back to the past and watch parts one and two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, it's a good enough ending to a "could have been much more" trilogy.The acting just like in the second was horrible. I mean, it was obviously that the actors were pretending not acting like they should have.The story was good, fun and interesting and on top of all that, necessary to save the doctor. Again the same problem with the actors. There was Sheamus McFly and his wife who were looking exactly like Marty and his mom but they had different hairstyles and clothes which made it more realistically.The love story was good, although it didn't suited to the doctor, just like fainting didn't suited him.Just like in the first movie I felt the suspense at the end, not knowing if the doctor will actually made it back to the 1985 or remain in 1885.The final scene with the doctor telling Marty that the future is what you make it to be, just made the second movie useless, and here I guess you know why.Overall, good movie, not as good as the first but way more better than the second for which I give it a 7/10 :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dixit Micheal J. Fox, circa 1985, during BTF promotion.In the numerous and very informative documentaries of this 4 DVD collection, there's this premonitory pearl, funny as it's about time travel. If BTF was a comedy, BTF2 is science fiction, BTF3 is an adventure movie: With the time (no pun intended), this final part is like good wine and gets better! As I'm not a western fan, I underrate this while it's in fact very good: the characters really develop, Steenburgen is a nice addition and unlike BTF2, there's really a new universe to discover with the old west! The 2 Bobs prove once again how talented they are as they succeed to put all the western clichs and blend them nicely with their franchise! It's good that the franchise ends on a full circle (great idea the picture of the clock!) and gives full hope for the future! Like the predecessors, this movie has also paradoxes that die-hard fans notice easily: If not the wish of the production, Emma Thompson shouldn't have been part of the movie as she is another branch of the family! Personally, I don't understand the Clayton Paradox: if Marty heard about the canyon, that means Doc didn't save her thus she can't write a line for his tombstone???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the trilogy and in my opinion, they are all necessary and fit together. This is an enjoyable movie and can be taken as a unit, although there is some need to refer back to the previous episodes, in order to understand the beginning and make proper sense of the ending. It's a nice conclusion to the trilogy, because it ties up the loose ends and resolves some of the plot that was left hanging in Part 2.However, I have a problem that I can't resolve and I may be just misunderstanding something, but I don't get why Doc is missing at the end. At the start of Part 3, we know that Doc has gone back to 1885 by mistake - we found this out at the end of Part 2, when Marty receives a letter. Marty is now in 1955 (also by mistake) and he wants to get back to his original time, i.e. 1985. At the same time, he needs to return to 1885 to rescue Doc who is in danger of being shot. The 1955 version of Doc helps him to do this and this version of Doc remains in 1955. Marty goes back in time, finds Doc, eventually solves all the problems and returns to 1985. Then he says that he misses the Doc, who remained in 1885, but what has happened to Doc from 1955 who should have just got older? I know there are plot holes in all the films, but this has really baffled me.Apart from this issue, it's a fun film and I don't think it is a massive disappointment. It is Part 3 and it deserves its place in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardly a case of killing time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've managed to keep up until now don't panic we're nearly there. We start with Marty still trapped in 1955 and Doc doomed in 1885, Jennifer is asleep on the porch in 1985 and let's just agree to ignore 2015 for now! After Marty discovers that Doc is to die in 7 days ? but 70 years ago ? so it's off to the past; from the past; to get everyone back to the future, which is the past to 2015? I'm dizzy, wait a sec.In actuality this one is a little more straightforward than the previous two regardless of how I just made it look. Doc manages a romantic interlude with a local teacher played by Mary Steenburgen and Marty must once again deal with his various ancestors and those of Biff without impacting future events for his family.Given that the story is less intricate than the previous films they really do drag out the middle section and build up to the climax in this film, probably 20 minutes longer than they should. But given the achievements of the first couple films in the trilogy I am willing to forgive them.If viewed in isolation BttF 3 is by far the least of the three films, the plot is actually reasonably straightforward and just a couple of the nods to the previous/Future films a little forced, but when it all finally wraps up and Marty eventually makes it through that one day in 1985 one of the better trilogies of all time ceases. Definitely the best PG 13 trilogy this side of Toy Story, you really need to understand all the various time jumps, changes and consequences to understand just how creative it all is.Like the Millennium Trilogy of the last couple of years while the individual films are all at least quite good and at best excellent the completed trilogy is somehow much greater than the sum of its parts.Final Rating ? 7.5 / 10. While BttF 3 is a little lacking by comparison it is still a pretty good film. Unfortunately you can't watch this and not compare? At the risk of killing you with cheese the Back to the Future trilogy is one of the best film series of all time(s) between 1885 and 2015, and various spots in between.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect ending to one of the greatest franchises.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrific conclusion to Robert Zemeckis's epic trilogy. Tributes the other two, passing the second one, remaining strong and powerful to conclude the trilogy with an iron fist. We've seen them change the past to fix the future, and now they're on their way to the past to create the future.Marty learns of the Doc's survival after seeing the Dolorian get struck by lightning, as he resides in the Old Wild West of 1885. After learning that the Doc dies from a ruthless bounty hunter, he travels back to 1885 with the Dolorian buried in the ground by the 1885 Doc, traveling back to 1885 to regroup with the Doc, who has lived happily in the West, and falls in love with a beautiful piece of history.Although the love affection kind of gets in the way of the plot to get back and fix the future again, it kind of is part of that plot anyway. Its a lot more epic and intense in this one, not just surviving the West, but the doc starts to wonder whether he should stay with his admirer in the West, or return home, which creates a lot of tension. Returns jokes that were in the others, and still remain funny. It just feels great to get a relaxing of so much time traveling and just take a break, with some minor, but cool West experiences.Perfectly concludes the series, and leaves you with a happy ending with a positive feeling, of one of the most epic trilogies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and watchable last entry...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 12/19/2008 - (Dir-Robert Zemekis): Fun and watchable last entry in the "Back to the Future" series of movies. In some ways, I actually liked this movie more than the original. This movie provides the first time I ever noticed Christopher Lloyd given a chance to expand his character beyond typecasting and he actually does a very good job with it. His character is given a love interest, who is played by Mary Steenburgen, and he then becomes the main part of the story instead of the Michael J. Fox character. The plot is a twisted mess as usual as it is a time travel story and anytime people move back and forth in time you can never keep track of everything. Of course, this series of movies doesn't take itself very seriously and that's why it works. Its' fun to watch the characters even go so far as making fun of their original characters created in the first movie. An example, is an excellent scene where each character mimics the other by using the other character's patented line. After seeing this, we know we've come full circle in the series. Most of the time in this one is spent in the 1880's(the old west) with Fox's character penning himself as Clint Eastwood and this joke is carried throughout this time period. Doc is a blacksmith(aka. inventor) and their main purpose is getting him back to the future before he's killed in a gunfight. They have to find some way of making the Delorean time machine go at least 88 mph and they use a train to push it up to that speed(with the help of some invention from Doc, of course). Everyone lives happily ever after, as you'd expect, and the series ends on a positive note as far as the movie and how it was received, at least by me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marty is now stranded in 1955. But with the help of Doc he finds the delorean in a cave or whatever but uh-oh since Doc was sent back in time to 1885 on accident he got killed there. So Marty has to go back in time to stop him from being shot By Mad Dog I mean Buford Tannen and go Back to the Future. Back To The Future Part 3 is not as good as the first 2 but is still a good film. I liked the old west part because I love westerns. Back 3 is not as good as Back 1 and 2 but it is still a fun movie. It is a good ending to the series. So this is a Final chapter to the series. BTTF 3 is a good film. If you liked Part 1 and Part 2 then you should like this. So my overall rating is 7 out of 10 stars. I recommend this film. Enjoy the ride. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>East meets The West.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Not the strongest in the hit series, but strong enough to keep the series moving.When it finally reached Part III, the BACK TO THE FUTURE series has certainly showed its age. The film's lack of the ingenious ideas that the first films had isolates this from the first two. The film is more of a Western comedy for most part of the film, but not a bad one. Still at the hands of the highly creative crew of Robert Zemeckis (director,co-writer), Bob Gale (writer) and Steven Spielberg (executive producer), BACK TO THE FUTURE III (which was shot back-to-back with Part II) doesn't succumbs to sequel dreadfulness, something that other sequels usually fall upon.The film is not as special effects laden as the second, nor as the first. Although it would probably have been for the best, it lacks the pure high-concept fun. The film rests itself as a Western comedy for most of the time, including a quirky love story between the series' best character Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and fluent schoolteacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen). McFly also challenges the toughest gunman in the West named the "Mad Dog" Tennen (Thomas F. Wilson), presumably Biff Tennen's ancestor. For most parts, its a less effects-driven comedy, with more emphasis on comedy.The path taken by this sequel makes it less crowded and confusing as the second in the series, but it also lacks the manic charms. The original was more lively for most of the time, and it had more ideas while the second film moved at a fast pace with fun at every corner. This film settles to heavily on a Western comedy mode, which makes it rather lacking.But the overall effect is still a good movie. Not as good as I hoped, and this one is the least that holds up among the three films, but I liked it and why wouldn't I. The script, although not filled with the clever time-travel hokum that I loved in the first two, is still cleverly filled with deft comedy bits and appealing characters. It's often tired and repetitive, but there's still so much to recommend.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Felt like I was seeing it for the first time...again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other day I watched this film for what has to be AT LEAST the fourth time,but probably for the first time in eight years. Even though I knew how it went,had a pretty good idea of the sequence of events and even some of the jokes,watching it again(this time on premium cable)still gave me a flood of emotions that one usually gets from watching a movie the first time,only this time with the sentimental melancholy of the knowledge of real time passing. Strangely,that might have actually ENHANCED my experience with this.Originally meant as the end part of "Back to the Future,Part II",but broken off because when director Robert Zemekis,producers Steven Spielberg and Bob Gale realized that they had too much movie in the can to put out as one release,they split this series off into its own film(a fact that I've become a little skeptical of over the years since). Number Three's actually a little bit better than the over-stuffed,over-ambitious 2nd part of the McFly Time travel saga,since the use of anachronistic time-displacement of both Marty(Michael J.Fox) and Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)--in this case the Old West of 1885 rural California,seems to be closer to the true spirit of the 1985 blockbuster original. All the usual elements are in place from the previous movies(particularly the bullying element,supplied by the always capable Thopmas F.Wilson,this time as Bad Biff's ancestor,Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen),and an added love interest for the normally reclusive Doc in the form of a delicate librarian named Clara(Mary Steenburgen),all moves seamlessly enough. One may question the specifics of this film,as per any of the series(or any time travel movie in general),but one who gives in to the charm,humor and kinetics of this Zemekis-Spielberg creation will not be disappointed. Aided by the always huge,welling music score of John Williams,this movie closes the story of time travel fixing(and un-fixing)the lives of the two principles of this story.I watch any of these three movies with some sense of sentimentality and bittersweet. This one in particular,makes me feel both entertained and yet sad. This really WAS a concluding sequel,and with the star players getting older(particularly Fox,who himself was already twenty-eight when filming this movie and was done with playing the kind of clean teen roles he'd been famous to up to that point)and such a memory attached to the players involved,there was no right way to either continue the series with OR without them.I seem to recall a short-lived animated series was created that was easily forgotten. Maybe someday in the future,someone will want to remake this again and be able to do it without stepping on the toes of those(like myself)who enjoyed the originals as greatly as we did. I have my doubts anyone can,but who knows.But as for seeing Marty,Doc Brown and a certain DeLorean fight off both Tannen and his thugs and righting some serious time travel blunders,this is still a glorious viewing experience that can make you feel young again. Being someone who recalls movie viewing in theatres(occasionally on video)from his youth with nearly photographic clarity,I can honestly say that watching this again I couldn't recall much about the experience around this movie,but I do recall how good this film made me feel specifically. How many films can you say that about?</fullReview>

In order to enjoy these films, your senses of time and of flight have to be a little strange anyhow.Mary SturgenBerger heads a fine cast of support in moving the series into the old west. Even Pat Buttrum shows up in a limited support role. The film is still carried by Christopher Lloyd &amp; Michael J Fox but they are supported by a solid cast and a storyline which makes use of every talent in the film. It is a credit to Clint Eastwood that he is secure enough in his life to allow his name to be used for some tung in cheek humor here. A film sequence of Eastwoods shows up in Part 2 so it is entirely logical for him to show up here including the reuse of the sequence in the second film in this movie. The effects people go to town here working on the railroad. The opening sequence at the 1950's style drive in theater is a clever setting too. Visually this film is very well done. This film is the longest in the series and almost gets too long, but it has to be to develop a story which supposedly ends this saga once and for all.It does leave one opening, a story with Doc Browns time traveling kids. Some clever use of naming them after a science fiction author leaves open a plot line using them as a basis. I doubt that they intend to do such a film.</fullReview>

While nowhere near as good, the plot is simpler and funnier than number two. The cast are once again enjoyable, and the finale well-staged and exciting. In this final chapter, the story has become a little corny, especially the very end with its unnecessary 'happy ending' and annoying moral message. However, Spielberg and Co. have delivered a fun finish to this fantastically popular trilogy.Wednesday, February 12, 1992 - Laser Disc</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Back to the Future Part III" is an exciting conclusion to the entire "Back to the Future" trilogy, of which I am a huge fan. Writer/director Robert Zemeckis and writer/producer Bob Gale deserve my utmost praise for the commendable job they did with all three movies. So do Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, and (strictly in "Part III") Mary Steenburgen for their superlative acting. (If you have not yet seen any of the trilogy, DO NOT read any further.) The basic premise of "Part III" is that Marty McFly (Fox) must travel back to the Wild West in the year 1885 in order to save Dr. Emmett L. "Doc" Brown (Lloyd) from being shot by the notorious gunman Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen (Wilson), who happens to be the great-grandfather of Biff Tannen (Wilson again), Marty's arch nemesis from the first two movies. While in 1885, Doc falls in love with schoolteacher Clara Clayton (Steenburgen), with their common interests being a love of science and a fascination with the writings of Jules Verne.My favorite highlights from "Back to the Future Part III" include the following. Obviously, the most thrilling sequence in the picture is the perilous train ride back to the future! At the film's conclusion, Doc summarizes the whole trilogy by telling Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) that their future is whatever they make it. Upon first arriving in 1885, Marty panics as he speedily drives the DeLorean time vehicle away from a Native American attack and then witnesses an exciting charge of the U.S. Cavalry! Marty tries to escape Buford and his gang from a saloon but is easily overpowered as Buford ropes &amp; drags him to his potential hanging site. At the climactic shoot-out, Marty replaces his handgun with his fists in order to defeat Buford. And at the Hill Valley Town Festival (probably the most fun scene for the cast &amp; crew to film), one of the lively dance tunes we hear is actually the ZZ Top hit "Double Back." Doc mentions in "Back to the Future Part III" how he wishes he had never invented his DeLorean time machine, claiming that it has caused nothing but trouble, but in reality, Doc is wrong. In the end, Doc avoids being shot by Buford, marries his sweetheart Clara, and raises two kids with her, along with his ever faithful dog Einstein. As for Marty, over the course of the trilogy he not only greatly improves his family life but also learns not to lose his cool whenever someone calls him a derogatory name such as "chicken." Overall, the entire "Back to the Future" trilogy is so well done that I am still enchanted whenever I watch it. And no, there doesn't need to be a "Back to the Future Part IV" in my opinion, since I truly believe the epic is very well told &amp; developed in the three already-existing movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the wild ride ends in the wild west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the final part of the back to the future trilogy we end up in the wild west. Which doesn't make any sense whatsoever since the hill valley is located in California but who cares with a movie this much fun. Anyway on to the plot: In order to save the doc from dieing marty goes back to 1885 to save him only to damage the delorean. Getting them both stuck in the past. While the doc falls in love and marty gets himself into more trouble than he can handle, they still have to find a way to get back to the future.The biggest problem in this movie is the fact that some of the village sets were never finished which was probably beyond anyones control at the time. While it makes sense that some things are still under construction it ultimately just looks cheap. Another thing that doesn't quite work is that while the movie is a parody on western it also tries to be a serious western at times.Thankfully the characters and the humor are still as strong as they were in the first two films and westerns are still a loads of fun making Back to the Future part 3 a decent ending of a great trilogy with a wild ride in the wild west.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As The First Two(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSEither way, this still is a terrific films. Back to the Future is one of my favorite franchises. What is odd about that is the fact that I saw all of them for the first time in one day. This franchise is excellent. I mean, a lot of franchises have at least one horrid film. For example, Star Wars had the Phantom Menace. That was horrible. I am hear to talk about Back to the Future, though. The only main problem about his one the fact that the West does not feel right for a Back to the Future movie, but it was fun.This film begins right where the second one left off. When 1985 Doc is in the Wild West he rights a letter to 1955 Doc and Marty McFly. The note says that he does not want to come back and it tells where the time machine car is. 1955 Doc and Marty find the car. They also find a tombstone with Doc's name and how he died. He is shot in the back in 1895. Marty goes back in time to rescue him. Unfortuanley, the car runs out of gas so they can not get up to 88 miles per hour to get back to the future. They find out that a train is the only way they can get the car that fast. Doc also falls in love with a woman named Clara. Then on the day of the big party Marty saves Doc form being shot, but the person named Mad Dog who was going to shoot him wants to have a showdown with Marty on Monday. Then Doc tells Clara he is form the future. She gets mad because she thinks he's lying. Marty wins the showdown. Marty then gets back to the future after a successful go on the train. Clara also loves Doc again. Marty goes to the future. Then a time machine train comes with Doc and his family on it.Overall, this is a really good, fine film. Although it can never surpass the first two, it is still very enjoyable and fun to watch. The climax is also good when they get the car in front of the train. They put in extra hot logs in the fire so it can go faster. Then Clara and Doc scale the side of the train to get safely in the front. That was suspenseful and fun to watch. Anyway, Back to the Future fans need to see this film. It is a great finale.8/10Recommended Films: Back to the Future One and Two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clara on tombstone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It says in the Goofs that "Factual errors: On Doc Brown's headstone, it says he was laid to rest by his beloved Clara on September 7th, 1885. But according to history, Clara was supposed to have died falling into the ravine (which would be named after her) days earlier, which also means she and Doc most likely would have never met." I don't think this actually is a goof-up. The writers' would've spotted this one, it's too obvious.When Doc Brown first went back to 1885, he lived in Hill Valley for eight months before writing the letter to Marty. In this time he had made friends &amp; enemies, as we all know. The mayor was one of these. Now, when Marty has arrived in 1885, the Mayor comes to visit Doc, and reminds him to about the arriving school teacher. Doc decides against meeting her.But, what happened in the history before Marty arrived there? Simple. Doc wasn't informed about falling in love with Clara, and went and met her. He (somehow) handled the horses, or took a different route, and they never crashed into the ravine. And what happened in the original history, the one where Doc never came to the Old West? No one went to meet Ms. Clara and she had to travel to town alone, and her horses were spooked by a snake.And now that Marty "warned" Doc about him falling in love with Clara, Doc didn't go to meet her, like in the untouched history, and again her horses were spooked. It happened differently, but again Doc was there to save her (even though we never saw the first rescue, nor did Doc &amp; Clara even necessarily realize what might've happened).Aargh, this is much easier to think through, than to write down. =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weakest entry in the series, but still very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great way to close off a classic trilogy. Though it obviously wasn't on par with the first, I think was was almost as enjoyable as Part 2. The plot was much less complicated, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. It's a good thing because it's much easier to wrap your head around, however it shows that the writers were more concerned with finishing the series than making another classic. The majority of the cast reprise their roles, and are all as great as ever. The Clara character was kind of annoying, but I can forgive that because she was important to the plot. I liked the ending, great way to end the series. Last but not least, what western fan such as myself wouldn't love the Good, Bad and the Ugly reference! Overall this was a fitting end to a great trilogy. Probably the weakest of the three, but that's definitely not a bad thing.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to the Past,then the Future, Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For my comment on the 1st "Back to the Future," I mentioned how there aren't too many time travel movies because all the good premises have been used up in a select few sf films ("The Time Machine," etc.)... This is never more evident than here, the 3rd &amp; final chapter of the McFly clan and Doc Brown, where-in new cast member Steenbergen essentially duplicates her role from "Time After Time" of '79. Once again she is visited by a time traveler (the Doc in this case) and gets swept away by him in grand fantasy fulfillment. Or was this all a sly nod to her earlier film role and that film? In any case, some of the stuff with changing photographs and repetitive motifs (Marty/Fox waking up as Lea Thompson hovers over him) begins to get stale and it's just as well this was the finale. Most of the film takes place way back in 1885, where our heroes need to figure out a way to get their 'time-vehicle' up to 88 mph without fuel.Halfway through, I began to compare this effort to low-end time travel movies such as "Timerider" (also a plot involving going back to the old west), which is not a good thing. However, this benefits from the engaging characters we've come to know in the previous 2 films and a lot of silly wordplay on the 'Clint Eastwood' name, which is worth a chuckle. To me, one of the more clever scenes was a pay-off on the foreshadowing of a famous scene from an actual Eastwood movie ("A Fistful of Dollars" I believe). But almost all the interaction with the western characters was like from some average TV episode, including all the dumb conflict with yet another incarnation of Biff (Wilson), here a foul-looking gunslinger. The romance angle is sort of sweet and the climactic action on the hurtling train is well done, as expected. The final little whammy with Doc &amp; his bride is not too surprising, but I found it interesting no explanation was offered for Doc's triumphant return (wait, that hover-board from the previous film - is that how he did it? - great scott!). The end could have been a set-up for a series titled something like 'Adventures in Time with Doc Brown' but maybe it's just as well nothing like that happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, an okay sequel !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think with Another 48 Hours I listed several classic Hollywood sequel flops, a pretty easy task. I should have included, if I didn't, BTF II which was a terrible piece of trash. This one goes in a different direction as Lloyd, Fox and DeLorean take their act to the old West. Of course Biff's ancestor is there to make life miserable if not impossible for Fox. Steenburgen provides an unexpected and very touching bit of romance for Lloyd, while Fox amuses himself by going by the name of Eastwood. It's all good fun, climaxed by a wild if somewhat overdone train run. A young Shue works well as Fox's own love interest and the wrap up is fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good ender to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly the third instalment of the "Back To The Future" series still holds up the interested to the end, and even tough it's not as funny as the first one it does have a couple of delicious scenes in it.This time Marty (Fox) goes in to the wild west to save his friend Doc (Lloyd) from early dead of lead poisoning. We also see Doc falling in love with pretty teacher Clara (Mary Steenburgen).Special effects are again used more sparingly, just like in the first one, which is a good thing considering the state of special effects of that time. This ensures, that the viewers won't have enough time to start criticizing them and they look good enough to fool the eye. The bloat of effects was a small problem in part 2 of the series.There are small amount of jokes and situations, that are direct continuity from the two previous films and you need to have a keen eye to spot all the reference jokes to the previous episodes. The truth be said, I don't believe, that the film wouldn't work as well if you haven't watched the previous films before, just because of the whole time continuum play.This is a good ender for the series and I hope, that this will be it. But if the third sequel will ever be made I would hope, that it would be made by the same individuals involved in the series, as I doubt it would be the same without Fox and Lloyd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>doc in love? A western film? Mad Dog Tannen? Really mixed feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i don't know whether to hate or love this film. I went through a stage of hating it but then i found myself loving it. I don't know what it was but something was wrong and as many times as I have watched this it still seems wrong. For one thing, in back to the future two, they took Tannen and made him into a real villain. Giving Wilson a chance to really put his heart and sole into the character. But that didn't work here, Mad Dog seemed too unstable. It was like having Griff there all the time, although a great villain he didn't fit in with the others for some reason. The whole mcFly family members thing didn't work so well this time, perhaps it was the fact that his great great grandma looked just like his mum despite the fact that they, hopefully, weren't related. I didn't like the irish accents and although i hate western films, they used it so well. They should be congratulated. I also like the touch that, although to Marty the doc has only been gone for a couple of minutes. The doc had been in the wild west for 8 months before he wrote that letter. You then get reminded that he is the past and will have died a long time ago if he stayed in the west. Which was a weird feeling. They used time travel to the best again instead of just throwing it in, as they could have but Doc in love and then with children. For some reason it didn't work and another thing, how did he get that train working and why didn't mad dog kill him after Marty left? Although all these things bug me I still really liked the film but every time i praise it those tiny little things come back and i have second thoughts. If you love back to the future see this, it is the perfect ending. IF you think back to the future is okay, then give this a chance. IF you love westerns, don't see this. You wont get what you expect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weaker, but a worthy conclusion to the trilogy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, let me just say - Part 3 is not quite as good as the first, nor the second, really. But it has it's strong points. We are reunited with Marty, who discovers that Doc has ended up in the 19th century. The movie unfolds as they race to repair time as best they can without screwing it up any more than they already have.Part 3 is also fun on the grounds that it brings together the two cinematic styles that can be most appealing to young children - science fiction and westerns. I know I thought it was really cool the first time I saw it. Now that I can take a step back and look at it from a technical point of view, it's still not bad. Granted, the script and directing are definitely weaker than the first two films, but this one is basically a necessary installment because, much like the disputed Matrix films, part 2 and 3 both are smaller divisions of a greater unified storyline. the acting is basically just as good as in the first two. If anything drags it down, it is that the western styling can start to feel tedious to someone who isn't really into that type of movie. Still, despite it's various weaknesses, it is a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy, and you can't watch part 2 without part 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the end of 'Back to the Future Part II', Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) are ready to go back to 1985, but the time machine is struck by lightning and Doc just disappears with the DeLorean. Instantly, Marty receives a letter from the West Union, which was written by Doc seventy years ago, instructing Marty where to find the hidden time machine in order to get himself back to 1985, with the Doc in 1955's help and that the time machine must be destroyed after Marty gets back to his time, so time travel will not cause any trouble again. But soon, Marty finds a grave of Doc's and is determined to save his life. So Marty goes back to 1885 and meets his ancestors.Doc lives contently as a scientist who disguises himself as an ironmongery shop owner. And he falls in love with Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), a new school teacher. He is completely besotted by her. But his death is approaching- he's to be shot dead by 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F Wilson), the ancestor of Biff Tannen (also Thomas F Wilson). Now Marty must save Doc from being murdered and meanwhile he puts his own life in danger by once again succumbing to his weakness- he simply cannot stand being called a 'coward'.After considering the pros and cons, Doc decides to go back to 1985 with Marty and he confesses the truth to Clara, but of course she doesn't believe a word he's said. Heartbroken, Doc is ready to leave with Marty. However, when Clara discovers that Doc has told her the truth, she chases him while Doc and Marty are pushing the time machine with a specially-equipped train...now Doc must choose between going back to his time, or staying with Clara...I love the Wild West scenes, the party and all that...and Doc is in love! Such wonder and magic! The ending is so sweet. This is a perfect ending of the trilogy and the final message is very positive and encouraging- the future can be changed!!! I consider this movie a very imaginative one. Watch the trilogy consecutively, and if you're a time travel fan, you won't be disappointed! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"They saved the best trip for last, but this time they may have gone too far"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second film took over four whole years to come out, this film must have been REALLY desperate, since it was released just six months after part II. This film takes place exactly where the last one ended, with Doc unconscious in 1955. Doc decides to visit his favorite era of all, "The old west". Right when they're ready to leave, Marty screams, and finds out that Doc was killed back in 1885 by Bufford (Mad Dog) Tannen, who was a brutal, outspoken gunman who killed 12 men. I liked this conclusion better than part I, but not as well as part II. There's no "Johnny be good". There's great action, and grim gun fighting. There's less comedy here than in Part I and II. Doc falls for school teacher, Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) and isn't so sure he wants to go back in time after all. In fact he saves her, when her horse is about to fall off a mountain, and altered history! The film runs 118 minutes, but seems shorter. I like movies where runty people square off against grim, unstoppable bad guys, and fortunately there's more of that than in the other BTTF movies. Bufford even has some knucklehead in his blood, and says equally funny, stupid things like "I'm gonna hunt ya down like a duck." another good quote, Doc saying he read 20, 000 leagues under the sea as a boy when it was recently published back then. The climax at the end is more suspenseful and would be more scary to do than before. The film finally comes to a conclusion, and we're finally back in the real world, where it seems like years they'd been gone, when it was only part of a day. Maybe you could tell me what happens, but I was dissapointed how I, but maybe you, found out wheteher Doc never came back and stayed in 1885, or took Clara to 1985 and stayed there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS Of course ? this film follows right on the heels of the 2nd part. It shows Marty going back to 1885 to try to save Doc Brown from being murdered in the wild-wild west. So this time round ? it is more of a Western style affair. Plus the story is much more focussed on Doc Brown (which was probably needed as Marty had been done to death in the first two parts). Doc falls in love with a schoolteacher named Clara ? hurrah!The series definitely gets back on track with this offering ? with things for most people ? drama, romance (which I think was lacking in the second part), action, comedy? Plus the scene with the train and the De-Lorain is quite thrilling ? with the Doc trying to get Marty and himself to the future whilst trying to save his love?. aawwwwhhh!Definitely ? a must see for fans of the original (and the series) ? 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trapped in 1955, Marty discovers the time machine left for him by Doc in 1885. Doc's instructions are clear: return to 1985 immediately, and destroy the time machine. But when Marty discovers that Doc met (will meet?) an untimely end in 1885, he decides instead to travel back in time to save him. Unfortunately, as soon as he arrives in the old west, the DeLorean is taken out of commission, leaving both of them stranded in the past. As they devise a way to get the car up to 88 MPH, Marty end up picking a fight with Biff's ancestor, and Doc falls in love.The plot works well, and part 3 is every bit as good a movie as the original (I thought the second was wholly lacking in the plot department until the final act), but this installment is decidedly less fun. In fact, it would be difficult to categorize this in the action-comedy style of the first two. Part of the reason is that there are fewer jokes this time around, but even the jokes we do get are overshadowed by the darkness of the plot.The first movie was a fun romp in the past as Marty discovered that his parents actually were typical teenagers in their day. Yes, we had the death of Doc Brown, but when that happened at the beginning, we didn't have an emotional investment in him, and as the movie went on, we got the feeling that some way, somehow, things would turn out okay in the end.The second movie had a very dark middle portion, but the movie didn't remain there long enough for it to cast a shadow over the rest of the film. The final act returned us to the giddy frivolity of the original, leaving us smiling through the last forty-five minutes.Part 3 starts with the impending death of a character we have come to love. Some characters (namely, Marty's ancestors) serve only to remind us that the future is at stake, and Doc's love interest simply makes the emotional investment that much heavier. In fact, at the end of the movie, when Clara unknowingly places herself in grave danger, we find it impossible to cheer her strong devotion because her actions may end up costing Doc his life! And this time around we don't have idiotic Biff (Buford is mean but not stupid) to lighten up the tone.As I wrote earlier, this is not a bad film, and I don't want to give the impression that I don't like it because I do. But I'm glad they ended the series when they did, because this final installment clearly demonstrates that the fun was gone.B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back to the Future Part III is a difficult film for me to review. On the one hand, I am far from enamoured by it, but on the other it's the final act in the otherwise excellent time travel trilogy. First off, it must be stated that this entry is the weakest of the three. Many Future fans will disagree with me, citing Part II as the weak link. What they overlook is that Part II has no grand finale like Parts I and III and inevitably suffers because of it. Nothing is tied up, loose ends remain, questions go unanswered and confusion reigns ? so it requires the last chapter to put the world of Marty McFly to rights. But Part II offers greater all-round entertainment, its darker tone offset by some exhilarating action and futuristic special effects.Part III is, to all intents and purposes, a love story with a formulaic Western theme. It is more like the 1985 original in style, with much of the film taking place in one setting, with only two bouts of time travel, culminating in a rousing finale. Unlike Part I, however, this film is lacking the extra ingredient to push it out of the pretty good and into the great. Robert Zemeckis' direction focuses this film on Doc for the first time and perhaps it is this shift in emphasis that left me somewhat disappointed. Interesting though Doc is, and pleasing as it is to see another side of him as he falls in love with school ma'am Clara, our hero throughout the series has been Marty. We have rooted from him from the very beginning and Doc's romance does not hold quite the same appeal. Consequently, I am not a fan of the introduction of the Clara character. It's difficult to explain but I felt like Marty does in that she is forever getting in the way, a barrier to his and Doc's preparations to return home. She is not a dislikable character but in a way I ended up resenting the amount of influence she is has over Doc and hence the storyline. Not enough goes on in the middle of the film when, with no relatives' lives to put right, Marty is a spare part for too long.The pace is deliberately slower than Part II ? which was breathless throughout ? but the film meanders, only getting out of second gear when the time travel sequences are involved. That's not to say it's without its merits. Doc and Marty's friendship is explored in greater depth and to good effect. Marty's refusal to rise to the bait of another nefarious Hill Valley Tannen, Buford ?Mad Dog' this time, shows a belated maturity ? sticks and stones and all that. He later changes the course of his own destiny (the result of which was an unhappy and newly unemployed 47-year-old Marty in Part II), which demonstrated admirable character development. The denouement displays some of the inventiveness lacking throughout the rest of the movie as an exploding steam train propels the DeLorean towards 88mph. It's a gripping last half hour, the pace having been noticeably upped for the better as the time machine careers towards a ravine, with Doc choosing to save the meddlesome Clara over a return to the future with his mulletted protg. Upon returning to 1985, the DeLorean is destroyed by an oncoming freight locomotive, something which I was not altogether happy about. It was such a sad moment given that the time machine had been one of the central characters throughout the whole trilogy. Its destruction would be akin to that of the Millennium Falcon going down irreparably in Return of the Jedi ? not at all a fitting end for a fine piece of kit. And the final act where a married Doc returns with pearls of wisdom, two sons and a time travelling, flying steam train is preposterous and wholly unnecessary. Sure, let us know what happens to him but one senses that by having the train take to the skies a la the DeLorean at the end of Part I, Zemeckis was attempting to add a symmetry to the trilogy that was not needed, or at least not in that manner. It was a silly ending and the whole "the future is unwritten" and "it's what ever you make of it" flies in the face of the first 40 minutes of Part II which was all about altering ?future history'. What exactly was the point of them doing something about Marty's kids when the future, according to Doc, remains a mystery?Nevertheless, the trilogy had to be rounded off somehow and it wasn't the worst ending the filmmakers could have conceived. It does, however, leave a slightly bad taste in the mouth which is a great shame considering what, in the previous two films, had gone before. Back to the Future Part III as a stand alone film might well have cut the mustard. The love element and the old West feelgood factor might be enough to win over those after a pleasant afternoon's viewing. Throw in the spectacular ending and you've not got a bad film at all. But it suffers by comparison to the high standard of what has gone before, not least the exemplary Part I. Back to the Future is among the best films of all time so following it was never going to be easy. Part II was sufficiently bright, breezy and imaginative to keep fans of the first film happy, without ever hitting the heights of the original. Part III though has neither the happy-go-lucky charm of the first film nor the high-octane thrills and spills of its sequel. For fans of the trilogy, it is a solid enough way to wave goodbye to Doc and Marty. It has the in-jokes, the music and the blink-and-you'll-miss-them touches that let you know you're watching a Back to the Future film. But it's by far the worst of the bunch and that I'm afraid will be its damning legacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Starring: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenburgen, and Thomas F. Wilson.The movie picks up where Part II leaves off. Doc is stuck back in 1885, the Old West, and Marty goes back to the past to save him, before he gets stuck in the Old West. The movie is very funny and takes some good old jokes from the first two, and make them a little better. Of course, you have Biff (I guess I should say Buford) in maneur. The movie's franchise has plenty of hot gas to have made some more sequels, but the ending makes sure that it will never happen again. This franchise is just like the Ghostbusters franchise, you want more of them, but you just don't get them (something that the Friday the 13th series just shouldn't get). The movie is a great way to end a great trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great end to the trilogy...with one small plot problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider Back to the Future to be among the best movies ever created. However there is one question I have concerning the plot of Part III. One of the major points of the plot is that there is no gasoline in the time machine (due to a leak) and therefore they can not get it up to 88mph without the use of a train. This is the case with the time machine that Marty brought back to 1885. Is there any gas in the time machine that Doc brought back to 1885?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think of the three parts of the saga (BTTF) I think part three was the best, to take the duo back to the 1800's, and the way Doc had a letter sent to Marty from 1885, I mean in geinus and hiding the time machine for him to find. I like most of all the way they used the different characters played by the same actors like Mad Dogg, Biff, Griff and Oldman Biff were all played by the same actor and Marty, Martin, Old Man Marty, and Shamis McFly were all played by M J Fox. But the shame was there were no relatives of Doc Brown, no children or parents just the same person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Marty, You're Not Thinking Fourth Dimensionally."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS. Picking up just moments before Part II ended, Doc faints when Marty tells him he's back FROM the future. So he takes Doc back to his house where Marty convinces him of what happened by showing him the letter Doc sent him from 1885. Doc said he buried the DeLorean in an old mine shaft, so the 1955 Doc and Marty dig it out. It will never fly again and the tires have rotted off, so they rig it up with new tires and are ready. In the letter, Doc said for Marty to use the time machine to return to 1985 and not come back for him, but one night when Marty and Doc saw Doc's grave and it said he had been shot dead in 1885, Marty was gonna go back there and rescue him. Doc dressed Marty up in ridiculous cowboy clothes. Marty drives the DeLorean up to 88mph and arrives in the Old West and is immediately chased by Indians. Marty hides the DeLorean in a cave where he has a run-in with a bear. He falls on his head and wakes up in the home of his Irish relations Seamus McFly and Maggie, with his baby great grandfather William. Next day, Marty walks to Hill Valley of 1885. It's very different: no phones, no lights, no motor cars, not a single luxury. Like Robinson Crusoe, it's as primative as can be. In a saloon, Marty meets Buford Tannen, the great grandfatherof Biff Tannen. Buford almost lynches Marty when Doc comes to therescue. He dresses Marty in better cowboy clothes, they also run into a problem: the gas tank of the DeLorean was punctured by an Indian arrow so all the gas is gone and the car cannot get up to 88mph without fuel for the car itself. But Doc figures out a way to PUSH the car up to the appropriate mph: a train! One day while Doc and Marty are horseback riding, they rescue a damsel in distress, Clara Clayton, who Doc immediately falls in love with. If they didn't save her, she would've fallen into a ravine, which would one day be named Clayton Ravine, but now that Clayton was saved, it wouldn't be called that. Oh no, they messed up history again!They go to a dance party one night and meet up with Buford Tannen and his gang and because Marty got so offended by them calling him 'yellow', he said he chose them. They would fight the morning Marty and Doc use the train to get them home. That day soon came. Marty didn't want to let down the people betting on him, but he also didn't want to let down the people betting against him. When Doc tried to explain his going back to the future to Clara, she thought he didn't love him, so Doc got drunk and he does not react good with liquor. Soon Buford shows up and Marty faces him by putting a sheet of metal under a cloth, ala Clint Eastwood. He and Doc race after the train and everything goes according to plan until Clara shows up and get's stuck when trying to climb onto the train, so Doc goes after her. But now there's no moretime! The odometer reads 88 mph, the DeLorean flashes forward to 1985, Marty alone. He doesn't have long to sit, because a train zooms forward and destroys the DeLorean. The time machine was in pieces!! Marty get's Jennifer and refuses a drag race with Needles and because of this, an event Jennifer witnessed in 2015 will never happen. Then in a brilliant flash, a flying train appears. Doc rigged it into a time machine! He introduces Marty and Jennifer to the family: Clara they know, and they have two kids: Jules and Verne. And then the family in the train flies off, bringing this trilogy to a close! Part III wasn't as good as the others. Mostly because Marty was so dang annoying!! He was before, but he's more so this time! I mean he was always rude when Doc and Clara were talking. Come on, Marty, you have a girlfriend, what's wrong with Doc getting one?!Michael J. Fox is just that kind of guy when he plays characters like Marty, which is basically all he did in the '80s! And Martywouldn't keep getting into all those jams if he didn't get so offended when people made him mad. Well, that raps up the BTTF trilogy. Some parts were more enjoyable than others. -------------</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything matures nicely in this conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'd like to say that I don't understand the many reviews I've read which criticize this film for taking on a Western element. It makes a lot of sense (and is very exciting) to place emphasis on the time you've travelled to. In the first film, there was a portrait, albeit a rough one, of 1950s middle-class American culture, in the second, a hypothetical future with all the colorful whiz-bang technology that was the vision in the 1980s, and in the final, the Old West--complete with costumes and catch phrases that seem awfully cliched now but were a lot newer in 1885. The traits of the West (issues of absolute historical accuracy aside) were more deeply explored here than the other two environments were in their respective films--which I liked; it was nice to see some more emphasis on where they were rather than why they were there or how they could leave. It pointed to some evolution in the role of Doc's time machine, going from scientific breakthrough to instrument of recreation. That change provided some room for more thorough character development, particularly the Doc through the introduction of his love interest, but also Marty in an exposition of his strength of character--no longer the scared, bewildered kid he was in the first two films, he showed new attitudinal and intellectual resource. I think growth was the overall theme here, a satisfying result of all the adventures. As Marty said, "It's been educational."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best thing about the Back to the Futures...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>is finding the faults. I enjoyed all three quite a lot, and they rank up there as one of my top trilogies. However, it amazes me how some of the obvious blunders got by everyone who watches it. The biggest mistake kinda kills the whole third movie. Back to the Future II ends with Doc getting sent to the old west and III starts with Marty getting a note from doc saying he stashed the time machine away for 70 years so Marty can go home. So, what does he do, he goes to find Doc. YOU GO MARTY!!! But, alas, as only Marty can, he breaks the time machine when he arrives in 1885. Lucky for Marty though is now Doc can uncover the one he stashed away, for Marty to use 70 years later, and they can go home. Ooopppsss...Doc is so absent minded that instead of just getting the time machine out from the hole he left it in, he wanted to derive a completely new plan that involved pushing the broken Dolorian with a train. Well, sometimes the route best taken is the one where you have to work much harder than you had to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Continuing the tradition of the "Back To The Future" trilogy, we have the last of three excellent films.With each film in the trilogy we have seemed to pick up an addition the main cast. The second film saw introduction of Marty's girlfriend Jennifer and the finale saw Clara Clayton, a love interest for "Doc."The film was set in the 1885 old west, which was a great change. I don't think I would have liked it as much if it was set in 1885 and a regular setting as the viewers witnessed in the first two films.I'm glad I saw this film because it continued to have the same great elements as the first two with the same dialogue and scenes but crafted in such a way that was unique to the trilogy.I was sorry to see the trilogy come to an end but as the cliche goes all good things must come to an end. I wonder what could have happened if there was a fourth film.If there is anyone who has not seen any of the films in the trilogy, they are missing out on a great piece of nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, while not as good as the first Back to the Future film, provides a satisfying end to the Trilogy. It's excellent acting, interesting plot, and fun attitude even manage to redeem the second, dreary film that rehashed so much of the original. I am generally not a fan of westerns, but BTF III manages to combine a humor, adventure, and a touch of sci-fi while retaining the spirit and sense of fun found in the first film. The cinematography is excellent as is the musical score. The effects, brilliant for their time, are still quite effective. BTF III has been dismissed as inferior to the first two - but if you're curious - I urge you to give it another look. It is well up to Robert Zemekis' high standards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third and final story to the "Back to the Future" series. I can really say that this one is without a doubt my favorite of the three. In this story, Doc Brown goes back to 1885 Hill Valley (and later Marty). In this film, the bad guy is outlaw Beauford "Mad Dog" Tannen, Biff's great-grandfather. He gets things mixed up as well as Biff like when he says "I'll hunt you down like a duck!" to Marty. One of his colleagues tells him that it's "Hunt you down like a dog." One part that I thought was funny was the scene at the square dance. Marty picks up an empty pie plate that has "Frisbee" printed on it. He then says "Frisbee! Far out!" His Irish ancestors, Seamus (pronounced Shay-Mus) and Maggie look at each other and Seamus says "What was the meaning of that?" Maggie replies "It was right in front of him!" After Beauford get arrested, Marty goes back to the year 1985 and the train destroys the time machine on the Eastwood Ravine, changed from the Clayton Ravine after Marty goes back in time. (Marty told the people of 1885 that his name was Clint Eastwood.) At the end of the movie, Clara Clayton (the woman who Doc fell in love with) and Doc Brown are married and have two children of their own named Jules and Vern.(Wonder where those names came from)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Back to the Future part III" is one of those movies that you hate to see end fearing you will never see those characters again. I felt so bad at the end knowing this was going to be the last i've seen of Marty McFly and good ol' Doc Brown I tell ya it was like seeing two of my closest friends leave. Thank god for their brief reunion on "Spin City" last season this the western of the three and the most enjoyable western i've ever seen.I loved the way the 3 movies focused on love and Doc and Marty's friendship the first focusing on Marty's parent's relationship the second on Marty's own relationship with Jennifer Parker and the third on Doc and Clara's relationship. The movie works in all merits Romance,comedy,Drama it's all there I especially loved the scene with Doc and Clara disscussing Jules Verne which showed us a side of Emmett Brown we never saw before and the scene with the train speeding up the DeLorean. Not to mention Tom Wilson's memorable villain Biff's great grandfather Bufford"Mad Dog"Tannen.The only problem I had with the movie like another IMDB member pointed out was that Doc and Marty just shook hands at the end knowing that they will probably never see each other again they should've at least hugged. Other than that the movie like it's predeccessors is highly reccomended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Us BTTF fans hated to see it end, but it had to sometime as Marty ventures to the old west to rescue Doc from being gunned down. Though Id rank this the third best in the series, that is in no way saying its bad. The writing is still strong, the action is still very good and the characters likable as always. Like with part II there are a handful of scenes reminiscent of the first film ("Mom is that you?", a chase out of the local hangout, spinnning license plate, etc.). The difference here is that time travelling is out of the question with a disabled DeLorean, with the main focus being finding a way to get it moving fast enough to beam them back. They figure out a scheme that could work, but both Marty and Doc must avoid certain death if they wanna make it happen. As with the other two films, nothing goes smoothly with several complicating factors finding their way in. The biggest one, Doc falling in love with a school teacher (Steenburgen). And no matter what time zone your in, theres always trouble with Biff, who this time is represented by his uncle, Buford. The conclusion nearly matches part 1 for drama, with an extremely exciting race down a railroad track on a hijacked locomotive. The only real disappointing moment came in the last five minutes, with Marty and Doc just ho-hummingly shaking hands to say goodbye. After all they've been through, they couldnt at least hug? Seemed a little impersonal, but not a huge misstep, so not too much harm done. Good ZZ Top song "Doubleback" used as the theme and of course the great Alan Silvestri provides another terrific score. And I am like others whod love to see the series continued someday, but unfortunately it would take something really special to do that. So I never get close to holding my breath about seeing film histories two most famous time travellers back in business.</fullReview>

Unlike the Alien-series, which is so bleak, and the Star Wars-series which is utterly boring, and the Lethal Weapon-series which finally runs out of gas, the BTTF-series is pure rock &amp; rolling all-out fun from start to finish!As in all BTTF movies, once again the direction is superb, the casting is excellent (because it's the same), the performances are really fun (with the exception of the Jennifer Parker character, which I think Claudia Wells played better than Elisabeth Shue) and the whole thing is just darn fun!!

		<shortDescription>the grand finale!??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of Westerns, so BTTF3 isn't among my favorite of films. But since it's the finale to one of my beloved trilogies, I often watch it after the other two for a sense of closure.We aren't treated to much time-hopping paradoxes here as in the first two--and that's where the main fault lies. Suddenly, the movie isn't nearly as inventive as the first two because of that missing element. It resorts to cliches of the Old West (saloon hostilities, shootouts at high noon, hey, Marty introduces himself as Clint Eastwood) instead of its creative time-warp adventure. The sense of urgency is lost here, as there's no chance Marty will run into himself. However, it's not a bad film in its own right, since we love the characters by now and we desperately want them to get themselves out of this one final mess.An interesting paradox surfaces early in the movie, and I wonder if anyone else caught it: On Doc Brown's grave is something to the effect of "from Beloved Clara." Well Doc never met Clara UNTIL Marty traveled back to meet him. In fact, Clara originally died in an accident which Marty and Doc saved her from. So when Marty looks at that gravestone, it's technically impossible since he has yet to go back, save her life, and introduce her to Doc.Anyway, just wanted to point that out. One thing that really keeps the style of the BTTF series is the common use of repetition: the scene with Marty awaking to a woman he thinks is his mother (and it usually is), being mocked for his time-inappropriate attire, running into his ancestors, and generally having to solve time-related dilemmas. BTTF3 is a decent finish to an overall outstanding series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a mighty conclusion...too bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean too bad as in 'Too bad this has to be the end', I mean, you all must of heard of the 4th script lying somewhere in Universal StudiosT picking up dust. (In case you don't know, the script is called 'Back to the Begining' and details a story where Marty meets the Doc when he is young but has a fatality in his family which causes Doc to think of time traveling back.) But it will probably never be taken to the screen so you will have to except this is a finale.But still, this is one 'heavy' movie. Where Marty goes to the old west to save Doc from getting shot but things go a little hey-wire since the DeLorean fuel line is torn thus no combustion can acure, sounds troublesome? probably so. So go see the movie and see how everything turns up.I consider this movie, infact, the entire trilogy as a land-mark in movie history and a thing with 'Cosmic Importance', if you don't know what I mean, I relate 'Cosmic Importance' to anything I feel that effected me beyond the first layer it was intended to and usually I pull it out some time after my first use and use it again and again and again...This movie was probably the weakest of the series but was...is a good film even though they crush the DeLorean, but not to worry, everything turns up fine.I recommend this movie to anyone who is someone, so go see it again and again and again and again and....well, you get the point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BTTF3 is a good closing of the trilogy. Although I have to say it's probably the weakest of the three, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. All the actors portray their characters with the usual greatness, and I especially love the climax of the movie where Doc and Clara get stuck on the train. I also thought the "Jules &amp; Verne" thing was really cute.....ooops, I better not give away all of the secrets to the movie! Although BTTF is really sci-fi, Western fans can enjoy this one, too. All-in-all, a great way to end an excellent trilogy. You have to see BTTF3.-2001RulzP.S.-Although I love all the BTTF movies, I really hope they don't make a BTTF4. I mean, what could they possibly make it about? I think it would be a major waste of time and money, and it would be one heck of a job getting the original actors to come back. And I'm sure the almost-40-year-old Michael J. Fox is willing to play a teenager again......Just keep things the way they are now. BTTF4 would lack original material and wouldn't appeal to the rather dumb majority of teens today. Nowadays, almost every teenager wants a movie with violence, sex, cussing, and really hot guys &amp; babes. And BTTF (fortunately) does not have these things. As a great man once said, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Thanks. :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think all the Back to the Future movies were great. In the 3rd part Marty goes to save Doc's life in the old west. Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen has murdered Doc Brown in 1885. Marty takes the time machine out and Delorean rides again. In 1885 Marty claims to be Clint Eastwood. Doc falls in love with a teacher called Clara and that makes going back to 1985 more difficult.It was great that they made BTTF 3 a western. The actors do a great job also in this one. New character is Mary Steenburgen, who is playing Clara Clayton. So this part is also good as all the parts of Back to the future trilogy. So good that you can watch them all many times and you never get bored of them. I still have my hopes for Back to the Future 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fitting end to an entertaining trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back to the Future Part III (BTTF 3) is nothing but a western, happening to feature Marty McFly and Doc Brown. There's nothing wrong with this, but fans were probably hoping for a fast paced adventure featuring all four time zones (1885,1955,1985 and 2015) instead of this carefully paced adventure. Serving as an character building movie, BTTF 3 gives the audience a more detailed impression of what's going on inside the Doc's and Marty's head. Mary Steenenburger makes an appearance as the Doc's love interest, and it's great to see how the Doc and Marty's personalities have changed. There's some nice scenes, but the film appears to plod along at some points, and just lacks the whimsy and comedy found in the first installment. The finale is grand however, a great sequence involving an antique train and the Delorean time machine. And the conclusion of the film is fun, but pratically confirms the fans fears: BTTF Part 4 isn't a likely prospect....</fullReview>

I think at times it seemed to stand still and not go anywhere, like when they started to talk about Doc staying in 1885 and the Party just seemed like a filler, just something to fill the movie up with. The best moments where in 1955 and after they saved Clara. It was a good movie, but it didn't really appeal to me the way the other two did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BTFIII is the worst of the great trilogy, but it is by no means bad. While II is generally considered the worst, it holds up to repeated viewings much better than III. This was also a departure from the other two, as it spends most of the time in the Wild West, and a lot of the pop-culture jokes and references are gone (though there are a fair amount). It's still fun, and you get to see more of the Doc Brown character explored than in the others. If you haven't seen the trilogy, you'll need to watch it just to get the conclusion. However, it's more of a stand-alone movie than II is, so it could be seen even if you're not familiar with the others.Overall, it gets a vote of 8 from me. Watch it, but watch the other two first. You owe it to yourself to see them all if you haven't ever, or even lately...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So we finally come to the conclusion of the back to the future trilogy, and is this film better than part II? Yes, definitely! Is it as good as the first? No...but it comes close. The plot is this: After seeing the delorean struck by lightning at the end of part II, Marty receives a letter from Doc. In the letter, Doc tells Marty that the lightning strike sent him back to 1885. Shortly afterward, Marty and the 1955 Doc find out that the future Doc was murdered in 1885. Ergo, Marty must also travel to 1885 to save his friend's life. Here's what I liked: I liked the setting of the old west Hill Valley, I liked the character of Clara, and I thought that she added a nice new element to the story. Christopher Lloyd and Mary Steenburgen had an excellent chemistry together, and they played off each other very well. Once again, there were great performances all around, and unlike part II, this film had heart! As with the first film, it has a signature song "Double back" that fits the film perfectly. (ZZ Top is one of my all-time favorite bands!) Here's what I didn't like: I didn't like some of the actors playing their original character's son, daughter, grandson or great-grandfather. (This also goes for part II.) It was too cheesy. To me, it just felt like a lame, cheap joke. Why does the villain always have to be Biff, or Biff's grandson, or great grandfather? I think the series would've fared better if there had been new villains for parts II and III. It would've been a step in the right direction, and not just a rehash every time. (Spoilers ahead) I really HATED Marty's "Chicken" complex! It just came out of nowhere, and it's only there to add another problem to the story. In part II, Doc tells Marty that the event with his son in 2015, will destroy his entire family. This however, is only the surface problem! In 2015 we learn that the future Marty is a wash-up. This sole problem, is a direct result of his "Chicken" complex. In part III, Doc tells him that this complex, is what causes him to get into an accident in the future. Marty asks what's wrong with his future, and what does Doc do? NOTHING! Furthermore, why didn't Doc tell Marty about this previously?! Marty knew that Doc was going to be shot in the future, so he warned him about it. Here however, Doc doesn't even so much as warn Marty about this event that destroys his future! I gotta call B.S. on that! As for the whole experience, Back to the future II was garbage, but III was very enjoyable and entertaining. As with many sequels, III falls short of capturing the original's magic, but it was a much more valiant effort this time around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other than The Lord of the Rings I can't think of another trilogy that tells a single story so well over multiple films. Every step of the time travel, whether backwards of forwards, is logically explained as life or death, and this jaunt to 1885 fits perfectly into the world of Doc Brown and his slacker apprentice. It was a great idea for the writers to include objects from various points in history so the characters, and the audience, can see the results of the antics the heroes get into immediately. Things like pictures of tombstones, newspapers, etc. allow the outcomes to be shown on screen without more exposition than is necessary. Hats off to Spielberg, Zemeckis and Gale for allowing the audience to join them on a 3 part adventure that will truly be timeless, and each generation will rediscover. I know this isn't too much about the 3rd film, but what is there to say at this point? It's a fitting ending to a deftly manicured tale of heroics in unlikely places and from unlikely sources.

		<shortDescription>A good conclusion to a fantastic trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back to the Future was pure fun. Part II was extremely well-made but without the spirit of fun. Now, in Part III, the spirit of fun returns. Unfortunately, this film, despite being enjoyable, is the weakest instalment in the Back to the Future trilogy. It picks up where Part II left off, and is extremely enjoyable. Unfortunately, it would've been so much better had the recreation of the Wild West days been more meticulous. Instead, every clich from a Clint Eastwood western is recycled in here (with Marty taking up Eastwood's name, in homage). The result is a more fun film than Part II, but not nearly as strong.In the original film, Marty travels back in time, helps his parents overcome personal problems and get together. Part II had the brilliant idea of giving Marty a problem he struggles with, which people from the places he visits try to help him with. This problem is him being unable to control himself when he is called a name. Part III carries on this subplot, along with a new romantic subplot, which are the film's strongest bits and true joys.The Verdict: Not as strong a sequel as Part II was, but the original's spirit of fun returns in Part III. The result is the weakest instalment of the series, but a fun one to watch nonetheless.Overall Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART III **** The third and final act in the saga series, with Robert Zemekis and Bob Gale going back to the formula used in the original: Putting a teenager into another time frame through a more characterized, personalized experience. Michael J. Fox is back again as the mischievous teen who travels to 1885 to save Christopher Lloyd from a horrible fate. Mary Steenburgen snatches the role of the leading lady to whom Lloyd romances, while Lea Thompson and Elisabeth Shue are nearly nonexistent in their roles. In contrast to the first two films, Fox and Lloyd are in the foreground for a considerable amount of the time without the support of the other classic co-stars, and yet it seems they're talented enough as actors to make movie watching just as fulfilling anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clara who?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of users have pointed out that Marty can't have seen Clara's name on the tombstone, because she got saved as a result of Marty going back, so before he went back Doc wasn't there to save her life, and she died before he got shot.Not necessarily.She was driving through that area on her own because Doc had not come to pick her up at the station, which he would have done if Marty had not come and warned him to stay away from women named Clara. They probably still passed through the area, and the horses still got spooked, but on that timeline Doc was already riding in the wagon and in an even better position to save Clara's life and impress her.So it wasn't Marty going back that saved her, it was Doc going back. And before HE went back, Clara had noone to either pick her up or save her, so she died tragically and got the ravine named after her.Another possibility is that she "originally" died the same way at a later date. It may be that people are destined to die in a particular way, only the time can be changed. Think about it: Doc originally got shot by a libyan, then he got saved by Marty's warning, then he went back a century to get shot by Mad Dog, and once again saved by Marty. So time travelers can't change the way people die, only delay it. Which of course means both Doc and George are still destined to be shot by someone...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLOT SPOILERS:Picking up directly where Part II finished off, the DeLorean has been struck by lightning in 1955 and - with the 1985 Doc Brown inside - has been sent back to 1885! Marty McFly is now stranded in 1955, but gets a letter from Western Union from Doc in 1885 saying that he's buried the DeLorean in a mine shaft as he was unable to repair it. Marty finds 1955 Doc once again and they find and repair the DeLorean. Marty is set to go home until he discovers Doc's tombstone. Doc was murdered on September 7th 1885 by Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen! Marty goes back to 1885 to find Doc and rescue him, but first manages to meet and offend Buford Tannen. Buford nearly kills Marty but Doc saves him in time. Mary and Doc have to get back to the future, but the DeLorean has run out of gas and can't get up to 88mph. The only way to do this is to push it with a steam train, but Doc has fallen in love with teacher Clara Clayton and Buford Tannen is out for revenge on Marty. Will the pair get back to where - and when - they belong?The third and final film in the Back to the Future trilogy is not as good as the first 2, but is by no means a bad film. It is still a very good film, only just beaten by the first two. The Old West is a natural choice as the last time period visited, and Part III also manages to resolves most of the unanswered questions left by Part II.Once again, Michael J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson return, and in Part III they are joined by Mary Steenburgen as Clara Clayton. Steenburgen is a good addition to the series and she fits in very well. Most of the characters are brand new for this film, although Fox, Wilson and James Tolkan all play ancestors of their characters from the first 2 films, and Lea Thompson plays Maggie McFly, Marty's great-great-grandmother. Familiar characters such as Lorraine McFly, Biff Tannen and Jennifer Parker do not reappear until the end of the film, back in 1985, and after seeing so much of them in the first 2 films this one does suffer a bit without them. But obviously, since this is before any of them are born, they cannot appear, and the new characters are almost as good and the "regulars" manage to play their 1885 characters (Fox for instance plays Seamus McFly, Maggie's husband, in 1885 as well as Marty) convincingly.The plot is quite similar to the first - Marty goes back to the past (1885/1955), manages to upset a Tannen (Buford/Biff), has problems getting back to 1985 (no gas/no power), and there is a love story (Doc and Clara/George and Lorraine). Despite the similarities, this film is different in other places. For example, Marty and Doc switch roles - now it is Marty who is the more responsible one and Doc who acts like a lovestruck teenager with Clara. Marty must also deal with parts of his personality that get him into trouble (ie reacting when someone calls him chicken), and his life is in danger at times as well. The plot is not as technological as Part II, and there are less risks of paradoxes, as it relies more on the human sides of the story like Part I did.The train sequence near the end as they try to push the DeLorean up to 88mph is one of the most exciting scenes in the trilogy, and just like the lightning bolt in 1955 in Part I, things don't go to plan! The filmmakers also took a very bold move when the DeLorean gets destroyed once Marty is home safely in 1985. This was their way of saying "No more BTTF movies!", and I must agree with them here despite being a huge fan of the trilogy, because Part III manages to conclude the story so well that a Part IV would ruin it. All the same, it is very sad when it does get destroyed.Marty, in 1885, calls himself "Clint Eastwood" which is an amusing little joke, although hearing everyone calling him "Mr Eastwood" might get a bit weary after a while. There are plenty of in-jokes and references to other Western films in this film for the audience to spot.Alan Silvestri once again does a good job with the music, putting a Western twist on the familiar BTTF theme and also, as before, managing to get the right emotions at the right times. There are only 2 songs in this movie, "The Power Of Love" from Part I, and "Doubleback" by ZZTop, as well as some contemporary music in 1885, and I feel they could have put a song in the 1955 part of the film, since there are few references we are in 1955 at this point of the film, but that is just a minor quibble.Overall, a good conclusion to the trilogy that although not as good as the first 2 films is still a very good film with something for everyone. 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy groups of films, in a sort of "mix tape" way. Of particular interest are sequels and series where different writers and filmmakers are involved. I find the first three Frankenstein films differ in amazing ways for instance, ways that deepen the experience for each film.Here we have Spielberg clone Zemeckis in control of all three in the group. The first was apparently intended as a single project which had a risky creation, involving many changes. Some lack of coherence was introduced because of major changes introduced by the curse of test screenings.The second and third, however were written and filmed together. This was the first big Hollywood project designed in response to questionnaires. You can see it in the recipe. Need more love interest? More actual action? Less Biff? Costumes? Chop, chop, chop.There is a clever thing this movie has that the others did not. It knows it is a movie. It sends our travelers back in time not into an earlier version of their world, but into a movie world. Specifically, it is the most stable genre of all: the western. As soon as Marty arrives, we have the most common trope in westerns: wild Indians yelping as if it were 1955, chased by the cavalry. There are a few jokes about being not in the real world but in a movie world, including the requirements for what happens next.It is not enough. By this time, we are tired of the whole thing.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Back to the Future film was absolute genius. What a brilliant story, Marty McFly stuck in the past having to ensure his parents get together lest he be erased from existence. In Part II things got a little complicated and convoluted. Back and forth we went, from 1985 to 2015 to the hellish alternate 1985. And ultimately back to 1955, in fact right back into the first movie, Johnny B. Goode and all. Maybe it was at times a little hard to follow, maybe it wasn't quite as much fun as the original. But Part II was still an excellent film with a very smart, albeit complex, story. And that set us up for Part III which would prove to be a worthy conclusion to one of the greatest adventures of all time.When last we left our heroes Marty McFly was stuck in 1955 (again) and a bolt of lightning had just sent Doc Brown careening back to 1885. Doc is quite content to live out his days in the Old West. Through the magic of Western Union he has told Marty to go to 1955 Doc (keep your Docs straight) for help in returning to 1985. But Marty and 1955 Doc make a terrible discovery. Just six days after writing that letter to Marty the Doc stuck in 1885 will be shot and killed. "Shot in the back by Buford Tannen, over a matter of eighty dollars" reads Doc's tombstone. As 1955 Doc puts it, "What kind of a future do you call that?" There's only one thing for Marty to do, fire up the DeLorean and head back to 1885 to bring Doc home.From there it's a rather simple story, much simpler than either of the first two films. No more bouncing around the space-time continuum, no paradoxes to unravel the universe. It's basically just a Western. But as Westerns go it's quite a fun one. Seeing the Hill Valley of 1885, and its cast of characters, is quite a treat. There's another generation of McFlys for us to get to know. There's another Strickland, always the disciplinarians in that family. And of course, as in any good Western, there's a vile, odious villain. And in a Back to the Future film that villain just has to be a Tannen. Buford Tannen, call him Mad Dog at your own peril, makes his descendant Biff look like an innocent choirboy. Mad Dog more than lives up to that nickname he so despises. And there is one more important new character. Clara Clayton, a schoolteacher who greatly complicates Marty and Doc's return to 1985. Because Doc Brown, always the pragmatic man of science, has fallen head over heels in love with this woman who died decades before he was born. Seems maybe we'll have a paradox after all.So Doc decides rather than go back to 1985 he wants to stay in the past with Clara. Of course there's the small matter that he's days away from being killed. It all makes for great entertainment. No, it's not as brilliant a story as in either of the first two films. But this simpler story has so much charm. It's great to see Doc in love and Clara makes a perfect match for him. They're like two lost little puppy dogs, the connection between the two instantaneous and incredibly endearing. What kind of a woman could fall in love with Doc Brown? Mary Steenburgen does a great job in portraying Clara, the kind of woman who could do just that. With Steenburgen having the key female role Lea Thompson has only a bit part this time around. But it's great to see her, you can't imagine a Back to the Future film without her. Thomas F. Wilson is simply terrific as Mad Dog Tannen, a nasty villain whom Wilson infuses with wonderful personality. But of course, as ever, the headliners are Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd as Marty and Doc. One of the all-time great film pairings. Two great actors who were absolutely perfect for their respective roles. What a journey those two characters went on over the course of these three films. This third installment may not be as frantic as the first two. It's not bursting with excitement, it's a little slower, suiting its Old West time. After the grave consequences of Marty and Doc's actions in the other films the story here can seem a bit mundane by comparison. But it still entertains, it really is great fun. Maybe the fact the consequences weren't so grave allowed the film to let loose and just enjoy itself a bit. We get one last look at these characters we've come to know and love. And this film gives them the rousing sendoff they deserve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse of the Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stranded in 1955, Marty McFly receives written word from his friend, Doctor Emmett Brown, as to where can be found the DeLorean time machine. However, an unfortunate discovery prompts Marty to go to his friend's aid. Using the time machine, Marty travels to the old west where his friend has run afoul of a gang of thugs and has fallen in love with a local schoolteacher. Using the technology from the time, Marty and Emmett devise one last chance to send the two of them back to the future.Okay, after setting the bar way too high from the second film, I thought I would see the same over-complicated time travel movie. However, I was wrong. In fact, this movie is more laid back. There's no time limit (well, there is). But it's mostly lackluster if you expect something big (excluding the last twenty minutes).In this film, there is no jumping back and forth with oh so complicated situations like the second. The characters just stay in one place to solve one problem. There isn't as much fun in here as I expected. There are still some laughs but not as much as the last two.Even as the conclusion of the trilogy, Robert Zemeckis couldn't create a good (or unique) enough story to continue with. Basically, if you think this movie is much grander and bigger, you'll be disappointed. All you'll get is a lackluster conclusion. At least you have some fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy to follow and easy to enjoy but yet far from being simplistic or patronising ? a great family blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stuck back in 1955, Marty receives a letter from Doc Brown that was written in 1885. Marty takes the letter to Doc in 1955 and together they discover where Doc in 1885 hid the DeLorean. However while uncovering the machine, Marty spots a gravestone that shows Doc was shot in the back and killed by Mad Dog Tannen a mere week after writing the letter. Using the DeLorean, Marty goes back to 1885 to save Doc by brining him back to 1985 where it all began; however on arrival he almost immediately gets into trouble with Mad Dog himself.Having done the future in the previous film, this final instalment in the trilogy goes back to the old west to produce and enjoyable story while also poking fun at the traditions of the western. Similar to the first two films it is a solid family film with an easy to follow time travel plot. It also continues similar themes around the main one of the characters trying to get "back to the future" while we have other subplots regarding Biff, romance and so on. It isn't that deep or that complex but it delivers a solid story with a good heart that is never overshadowed by specific scenes of action and it is affectionate and fun. As director Zemeckis does a great job of pacing the film and providing fun that straddles both genres to good effect and the whole thing does look very professional.The cast continue to be be as good as they were in the other two films and mostly buy into the tone of the film and support it. Fox shows why he was a big draw when he was younger and is the real heart of the film. He just about holds his own alongside scene-stealing Lloyd (although his "great scott" stuff did get a bit old after a while). Wilson does his usual routine but still makes it feel pretty funny, while Tolkan does the same in a smaller role. Steenburger is a nice addition and works well with Lloyd in their join scenes. Thompson is reasonably OK for all she has to do.Overall then a fun and affectionate film that acts as a fitting conclusion to the trilogy. Easy to follow and easy to enjoy but yet far from being simplistic or patronising, it is a great family blockbuster that crosses genres and does so with a good heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endless scenes of Marty waking up after sleep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know you are in trouble when the film has endless scenes of Marty McFly waking up from a deep slumber wondering where the Doc is. That's all that happens in this movie. Marty has nothing to do! He just keeps waking up from sound sleep (usually on the ground on a blanket) and calling out "Doc?" DOC?" That's about it plot wise, folks. So, if you like to see films with a young man waking up from a deep sleep every twenty minutes and wondering where his friend is, then this movie is for you. Gone is the plot urgency of the first two movies, here it is replaced with the urgency of waking up from a deep sleep and wondering if the Doc has made the 'lovings' to the school teacher yet.Give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not a terrible film, but it's a letdown compared to the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's fair to say that BACK TO THE FUTURE PART III is the third and least of the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy; it's merely an average Hollywood comedy adventure movie with sci-fi flourishes, while the first two films in the trilogy were bona fide classics.The problem with this film is that the science fiction material is really limited to just the first twenty minutes. For most of the running time, this film is merely an ordinary western adventure which seems happy to run through all of the clichs in the genre: there's the duel on the dusty screen, the gang of horse-riding villains, the showdowns in the saloon, the chases, and the unwanted romantic sub-plots. The inclusion of the Mary Steenburgen character was a particular reason I remember for disliking this film when I watched it as a kid.It's certainly not a bad film, although it seems worse when you compare it to the earlier films. Michael J. Fox remains good value even though he's only required to go through the motions this time, although Christopher Lloyd's acting goes beyond the boundaries of ham and becomes quite ridiculous. Still, at least the movie picks up for the extended train sequence at the climax, which doesn't disappoint and recaptures some of the old movie magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another super, time-tampering adventure. The more I watch these films the more I realise that the original high concept and Alan Silvestri's score are the two radioactive components that keep these films up and running. That said Zemeckis has already done past and future and their crossing over. This film is much more of a conventional thriller, focuses on Christopher Lloyd's 'Doc', doubles up the romance and multiplies the stock jokes both to do with Westerns and Marty's forebears.Michael J Fox seems slightly slower off the mark than in 1 &amp; 2. He also has to play his something-grandad in a loony ginger wig and oirish accent - a farce I quickly forgot when confronted with the poor Elisabeth Shue's monstrosity of a hairpiece. Mary Steenburgen is a pleasant, affecting Clara Clayton, the love interest for the reliably frenetic Christopher Lloyd. It's a film with occasional corner-cutting but the money has been spent in the right places to maximise the spectacle. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an unnecessary film. It carries a dose of nostalgia and emotions for fans of the previous back to the future films, in which i include myself, but that's its only edge. You'd need to know and relate to the characters from the other films in other to mildly appreciate this one, and that is not a very good sign.Zemeckis/Gale are not genius, or masters of their craft. They started in the shadow of Spielberg fantasy business. But the first two Bttf were novel in the pace they gave to their comedy development. It's how everything juxtaposes that the fun lies. The second film does something even better, and unseen, which is to literally place a film over another. That was great, and the best narrative achievement these guys did.This one brings nothing new or interesting. Yes we still have the energy and amazing vitality of Michael J. Fox and Chris Lloyd, and, even due to more shared screen time, they probably pair better here than on the previous two. But there is no catch, the related characters (Biff, the McFlys) are just direct mirrors to the future ones. The edge is gone. They probably had studio pressure to do this, but they knew they didn't have much more to say. And the prove is that i've recently re seen the trilogy and this one is old and worn out and not funny anymore, unlike the other two.My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

It is another fine piece of entertainment with Doc Brown finding romance with Clara Clayton which means that Clayton ravine becomes Eastwood ravine. It's probably worth mentioning that a lot of the scenes are replayed in each time zone such as the bar scene. If anyone gets the chance to go to Universal Studios make sure you go on the Back to the Future simulator ride which is the best of it's kind.

		<fullReview>Since this movie was made along side with BTTF Part II, it also lacks what made the original great. But this time, Marty and Doc don't do several trips through time like in the original but instead end up trapping themselves in the old west. While Doc falls in love, Marty (AKA Clink Eastwood) has to deal with bully Biff's great ancestor Buford "Mad Dog" Tannon.The movie doesn't have any of the side characters in the original move except briefly, but the actors of those characters play their great ancestors in the old west. The lack of Biff is noticable, as Buford isn't really the same. And the Wild West presented in this movie is quite far from realistic. But no matter, BTTF 3 wraps up all plot lines and closes of the BTTF trilogy for good. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, just not that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad ending just adds to the disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In compliance with IMDb's guidelines, here warns the possible existence of spoilers ahead. Not there are any, but just in case. Okay, now onto BTTFIII. I want to express my particular outrage at this movie. Yeah, you've all read it before; I don't hate BTTF movies, I love them, but this one just doesn't belong in the same league as the others. And having the standard set so high with the first two films is insignificant in this case: This movie simply isn't very good. And this is where my outrage lies. This is a movie that tries to be science fiction, but it doesn't have enough sci-fi elements to justify being in the genre, apart from the time travel gags introduced in the previous two movies. This movie also tries to be a Western but is obviously so clichd and routine that apparently this story was conceived on the parts of both Zemeckis and Gale to satiate some childish filmmakers' fancy to do a Western movie. I don't have evidence to support this, but that doesn't mean it hardly makes sense. Look at Zemeckis's career up to the present day. Notice the kinds of projects he takes, the styles he employs, and the techniques he likes to use. None of the above indicate he has any talent to create a fine, Western epic. Then you have the subtle Western homages, like the inclusion of Patt Buttram as Roger Ebert pointed out in his review, and Doc Brown's line in Part I that said he intended to visit his favorite period in time, the Old West, may in fact be sentiment of Zemeckis and/or Gale. All I'm saying is that maybe Zemeckis wanted to do a Western someday, but knowing he didn't have the talent create a success from a "pure" Western, he decided to roll that idea into part of something more understandably crazy, a BTTF movie...Then maybe we'd all forgive him because he made a sci-fi film first and foremost, not a Western...Unfortunately, this particular story fits in very oddly with the rest of the trilogy. Ebert also stated how the other two were non-linear in their story telling, that all the time travel made for a story that flipped itself inside out while we all smiled at its eccentricity. (Part II was especially time travel madness heaven.) Apart from the scenes in the beginning of this film, which continues directly from Part II, the plot is extremely straightforward, with you classic action movie suspense devices with an Old West twist. Time travel is discussed as means of creating a purpose and direction for the plot, but no time traveling actually occurs after the beginning until final few minutes. BTTF's classic humor is ALL that saves this film from being unwatchable trash. And that brings me to another grievance: The nauseating recycling of established BTTF gags. This was a serious problem with the second movie, where you could easily pick out which gags from Part I were adapted into Part II, and there were far too many instances of those. The problem even blemished Part I, as a few jokes from early in the movie were rehashed later on, which aroused a slightly uncomfortable sense of superfluous repetition. Now this is not necessarily a bad technique, as it can make fans of a film franchise feel at home with all of the in-jokes; it's also just plain amusing to see how story of one movie connects almost directly with another in the series through some small detail. Unfortunately, this technique is extremely difficult to do effectively, and sadly the BTTF movies generally fail with it. Moving on, this film has a much more emphasized love story. Whereas Part II had elements of romance but no real love story, and Part I had a love story that merely served as a fuel for many gags, plot twists, and heck, the entire story. Part I's love story obviously wasn't meant in any way to be heartwarming to romance fans out there. This is quite different in Part III, where tremendous care has been taken to make this offbeat romance at least the slightest bit touching by inserting in all those cutesy google-eyed exchanges, that overplayed kiss under the stars, and of course, the internal debate whether to do what is right according to the principles of science or to give into to needs of the heart. However, in this film, the romance isn't warm like the filmmakers' might've wanted it to be, it's just plain freaky, and I don't mean in the guilty-pleasure S&amp;M kind of way; it's romance between an eccentric old scientist (one of the last men you'd expect in a Hollywood romance) and an equally eccentric woman (which becomes more and more apparent as the movie goes on: For instance, **SPOILER** when the Doc tells Clara that he's from the future and he must return, instead of slapping or laughing at him thinking he's crazy, she gets upset because she thinks he has made up a Jules Verne-type fantasy to exploit her own imagination and break up with her with minimal heartbreak. Then, she stops the train on which she's leaving town just so she could run out and try to catch Brown before he's gone forever, and then she totally loses all semblance of sanity when she chases down and gets on the runaway train, recklessly risking her life just to catch up with Brown.), and that is HARDLY heartstring-tugging in my book. My biggest problem with this movie is its ending, which is probably one of the most poorly constructed endings in contemporary film history. It has a tacked on feel; it seems as if Zemeckis didn't want to upset his audience by ending his story with Marty not seeing the Doc again forever, so he made sure he had some way to bring the Doc back before the credits rolled. If this is the case, then the ending is even more unforgivable than it apparently is. Why? Though it doesn't seem to be pointed out very often these days, the ending is completely contradictory to a theme that was presented throughout most of the trilogy, that time travel is evil, that it should not have been invented, that it must be stopped, and all that philosophical talk about preventing further contamination of the time-space continuum. Ever since the first half of Part II, Doc Brown had been saying that the DeLorean should be destroyed, which he adamantly maintained until the machine was destroyed. Then what happens? Doc Brown comes back in a time machine made from a train! As cool as the train is (it's even better than the DeLorean), it just doesn't fit into the context. Also problematic is exactly how he created the train: It was reasonable to believe he could retro-fit a DeLorean because Part I told us that the Brown family was wealthy. However, how could the Doc come in possession of a train, and quite a train, when he's only the town's blacksmith? And assuming he did get a train somehow, how did he find the means to modify it into what you see? Granted, he did have that DeLorean buried in a mine with which he could've gotten some inspiration, but he himself could not, in the eight months he had lived there prior to Marty's arrival, fix the machine, which draws skepticism on his ability to build another time machine from scratch WITH PARTS NON-EXISTENT IN THE OLD WEST THAT HE WOULD'VE HAD TO INVENT HIMSELF. He would've also had to have installed the hover mechanism on his own, since that business in 2015 would only convert old cars, so traveling to the future would not have helped him much to improve his train. Also, how was he able to get those special parts manufactured in the Old West? The final little problem is that before Doc leaves again, he says the machine is powered on steam, which doesn't sound like a joke. So if it's not a joke, then how on earth does Zemeckis and Gale expect us to believe that a time machine can actually be powered by steam, a fairly weak source of power? The two previous BTTF movies had plot problems mainly with time paradoxes, especially Part II, but they were both very entertaining to watch. Part III is just ho-hum. There's just one thing that's sad about this trilogy: Unlike most franchises, this one was apparently conceived together as a trilogy, since various hints in Part I and Part II (especially II) indicated the story of this third film. (The ending of Part I also indicated what would happen in Part II.) That fact alone should've meant that all of the movies would've been approximately the same in quality, but this is not the case. Somehow, Zemeckis and Gale made up a story that just got worse and worse as it went along. And what's more: Like LOTR and The Matrix trilogy, Part II and III were simultaneously shot, which further should've produced a minimal drop-off in quality as in the case of those other two trilogies (though maybe not Matrix 2 and 3, since we haven't seen those yet). What went wrong?</fullReview>

Fox looks bloated and bored in this one, and the story is obviously wearing thin. Also, Biff Tannen provided such a wonderful villian in the first two, why not try something new? Nope. Instead we have "Mad Dog" Tannen saying (from across the saloon) "Hey McFly!". Sorry, but what was fresh in the first one and somewhat fresh in the second is now stale here. That being said, there is still some fun to be had. The train sequence is Grrreat!!! Marty is peculiarly droll and mellow in this one (why?) but it works occasionally for some laughs ("Frisbee!

		<fullReview>Such is my affection for the Back To The Future movies,that i struggle to write this review but there is no getting away from the feeling that this is by far the weakest entry of the franchise.The things about the film that are good are the central performances from Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd who continue their excellent chemistry and energy. As with the previous Back To The Future sequel this movie plays on and repeats gags from the previous movies to great effect while also paying homage to popular culture with many references. The old west setting is fun at first but never as much fun as the journeys between 1955 and 1985 when Marty McFly interacts with his parents at his age. Mary Steenburgen is introduced as a love interest for Christopher Lloyds Doc Brown which only serves to stall the film and while some might like the love story element, its hard to properly fit it in to a film of this kind when the story strands are all being tied up and in the end it feels terribly perfunctory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst 'back to the future' film ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back to the future (Part 3) started off really good, but went down-hill as the film went on. In between the scenes when Marty was recovered in the McFly home in 1885 by his great great grandparents and when Marty arrived back home to the year 1985 I found this film quite boring, but before and after those scenes, I found this film quite entertaining.In all three Back to the Future films there's sequences in which Marty and his descendants/ancestors are being confronted in a cafe/bar by Biff and his descendants/ancestors as well as when Marty injures himself and ends up being recovered in his mothers/great great grand mothers home and including a few other examples. I quite like this repeated sequence in the first two films, but seeing it again in the third film simply bored me, for its as though the same old storyline in all three films is being regurgitated over and over again with no originality whatsoever.If you think about it, there's no reason why Marty should have been temporarily stuck in the year 1885. The fact that Marty and the Doc couldn't fuel-up the delorean as there was no fuel(gas) facility in the year 1885 shouldn't have been a problem. Why - because if Doc Brown was able to write Marty a letter from the year 1885, for Marty to receive in the year 1955, and as a result of the letter Marty then went back in time to the year 1885, he could of also easily written another letter to Marty to receive in the year 1955 saying 'Oh yeah and by the way bring an extra supply of gas(fuel) when you visit me in the year 1885 for its the only way we can get back home to the future'. If he wrote that letter the moment he'd given it to Western Union postal Service, the fuel would have instantaneously appeared with them in the year 1885 and they would have been able to get back home to the year 1985, without going though the hassle of being pushed by a runaway train in order to get up to 88 miles per hour. This is just one example on how this film didn't make sense as there are many more examples similar to this one that I won't get into. One good element about this film is how it shows how bad things happen for a reason. When Marty went back in time and changed his parents destiny from being losers to winners, he not only changed his families past and present lives, but he also changed his families future - but for the worst. Seeing as Marty changed his fathers destiny, as a result of this change his father George McFly didn't loan his 4 by 4 jeep to Biff, for which Biff would've smashed up in a car accident in the parallel universe for when George was afraid of Biff. If Marty didn't change his fathers destiny, his father George McFly would've loaned the jeep to Biff out of fear and the car would've have been totalled in a car crash. That car was destined to crash! so that Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer wouldn't have used it that night to go camping, in which they wouldn't have crashed it out of a dare from Douglas Needles to go drag racing - leaving their and their children's lives in ruins, for which this car crash led to a result of their children being arrested in the year 2015, however their children's problems in the year 2015 was fixed when Marty and the Doc changed it for when they travelled into the future to the year 2015. It goes to show that although Marty did change his families lives for the better, in the long run it would have been better if he had left things the way they were. Destiny is set for a reason, whether its good or bad.I think making a third sequel to this film was a good idea, but I think it would have been a lot better if the director of this film made this sequel completely different from the first two films. A good idea would have been if Marty and the Doc were travelling all over time to different years doing whatever they want and meeting up with themselves in the same year that they've visited more than once without worrying about a time travel paradox. In my opinion this film could have improved, but even though I feel this way I'd recommend anyone to watch it, for it did have some good moments and if you've seen the first two 'Back to the Future' films you've gotta see this film in order to complete the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Largely forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I saw the first two "Back to the Future" films long ago, and they were cute, a bit fluffy, and mildly entertaining. Really had little desire to see this one. But, I finally did, and found it to be largely forgettable. I only watched it because Mary Steenburgen was added to the cast, and her sad-eyed beauty makes almost anything better. That is the case here. There are a few plot holes/time-travel paradoxes, but you cannot complain too much about that, as this is sort of the nature of time-travel movies. The production values were fine, and I'm sure it was fun to make, but there isn't much to recommend it, aside from the aforementioned Ms. Steenburgen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst of the trilogy, but still fairly entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the crazy fast paced special effects extravaganza second film, that takes us to not just 1985 and '55, but also 2015 and 1985A, you'd expect a just as exciting conclusion. Unfortunately, you'd be wrong, as the third film in the series is the slowest, with less plot than any of the others, and less at stake. With that said, the third film also gives a chance to slow down and see Doc and Marty's relationship, and a chance to no longer focus on special effects and cool set pieces, but instead on the characters. It's the least exciting of the three, but still a fairly good end to the trilogy.1985 Doc is stuck in 1885, and according to a grave Marty and 1955 Doc find, 1985 Doc is going to be killed by Biff's great grandfather, cowboy Bufford "Mad Dog" Tannen. So Marty must travel back to 1885 to stop Doc from being killed, and to get both he and Doc back to 1985. Meanwhile, Doc has fallen in love with Clara (Mary Steenburgen), a science loving resident of 1885. After getting in the middle of things, Marty soon finds that he's the one that will be killed by Mad Dog, and he needs to find a way back.I'll start with the positives on this one. This was the slowest of the films, so it gave a time to stop and really soak up the environment, and linger on the characters. In this way, it was more like the first film than the second. The first one was pretty slow paced, but focused a lot on relationships, and this one does the same thing. The film has a nice atmosphere, and despite not being as impressive a set as the one's featured in the first, and especially the second, the western set is still impressive. This one also wraps itself up nicely, ties up all the loose ends introduced in the second film, addresses all the plot points mentioned in part two, and leaves us with a nice message to sum up the trilogy. The negatives? Well, this film just kind of feels anti-climactic. It's like the first film starts off slow and built up to the crazy fast paced second which is huge and puts everyone's life on the line, and then we get to the third, which is slower than the first film, and only prominently features Marty and Doc from the previous films. The film has somewhat of an exciting climax, that incorporates elements from all three films, but nothing is really new. Most of this stuff is just retread from the first two films, with only a few new elements. This is an entertaining film, and fairly fun, but definitely the weakest of the three films for me. It just feels like it's kind of running out of steam compared to the other two, but the ending leaves a nice message. My rating: *** out of ****. 115 mins. PG for language and violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If BTTF 3 were not the end, then what would become of this film? Notably lacking the wit of the first one, which had such memorable jokes as the "Tab" conversation. If anything, this is more like a past version of the second one...using aspects the previous film had. The first time you see it will be out of curiosity, the second for your friend to see it, and then I doubt that it will leave your shelf. Lucky for you the DVD comes in a trilogy, so you don't have to buy it just by itself to see this finale of one of the most well-loved time travel films around. All in all, a good way to end it...but a so-so stand alone movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Film With an Ending I HATED</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD This movie was the final installment of one of my all-time favorite film franchises, Back to the Future. While not quite as good as the first two (which were phenomenal) this film is still worth watching. The basic story is that Marty has to travel back to 1885 to save the Doc from being shot by the town bully. But things are complicated by Doc Brown falling in love with Clara, the new schoolteacher. Now they have to figure out how to get back to the future, and whether or not to bring Clara along.Now, as I said before, this movie was a lot of fun. You genuinely care about the characters, and the story is quite enjoyable. While it can be definitely classified as a western, it does not beat that to death. We are not treated to an hour and a half of "howdy, y'all". It is a science fiction film within a western, and the result is pretty cool.That being said, this movie was unbearably cheesy at times and I didn't particularly enjoy the love story between Clara and the Doc. But the absolute worst thing about this film was the ending (spoilers ahead, one final warning), in which the time machine is destroyed in 1985 without the Doc or Clara coming through with Marty, only to have them show up a minute later in a new time machine (defeating the purpose of destroying the Delorean). To each his own, but I would have much rather that all three came through, and the Delorean been destroyed more respectfully that being crushed by a train. I loathed this ending, and it almost ruined the whole movie for me.Anyway, now that my rant is done, I recommend that you watch all three of these films one after the other. Like, right now.The weakest in the trilogy, but still a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely the lesser one of the three but that doesn't mean it's bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit that probably the reason why I find this movie to be the lesser one of the three Back to the Future movies, has all to do with the reason that Western has never really been my favorite movie genre. This movie is almost set entirely in the Wild West of the late 19th century.The movie features all of the Western clichs but at the same time it doesn't ridicule the genre. Pistol fights at dawn, hanging, robbing the stagecoach, typical villains, a sheriff, you name it and its in this movie. You may say that Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale pay a great homage to the longtime gone genre of classic spaghetti Westerns, with using all of the typical clichs and small references."Back to the Future" and "Back to the Future Part II" were two brilliantly written movies, with ingenious connected plot lines, moments and characters. "Back to the Future Part III" is also well written and is definitely fun and entertaining but just not as clever or ingenious as the previous two movies. "Back to the Future Part III" surely does still offer plenty of enough entertainment and cleverness. It makes sure that the movie overall is an entertaining one, that is also definitely helped by its characters and good, quick, fun directing from Robert Zemeckis, who with the Back to the Future movies made himself immortal as a movie director.Besides the Wild West concept the movie also differs from the other previous two Back to the Future movies in many more ways. Of course the Wild West already provides the movie with a totally different atmosphere and premise than the previous two Back to the Future movies but also the storytelling and approach makes this movie a 'different' one. You can really say that perhaps this time the real main character of the movie is the Doc. The main plot line (a love story) of the movie involves him. Not much room for Marty and his family this time in this one, unlike had been the case in the previous two movies. I liked the previous two movies so much because Marty clashed in his past and future with his own relatives, that were alive at that time period. It always resulted in some comical- and brilliant written and constructed moments. "Back to the Future Part III" doesn't really have enough moments of that. It still has some fun moments involving time traveling and of course mainly the cultural differences that show what happens if characters from this time period are being set back in the early 19th century. It makes some of the moments in the movie still hilarious, such as Marty's clothes, his choice to name himself Clint Eastwood, Frisbees and the opening ceremony of the well known clock from the Back to the Future movies.The movie of course also future 'distant' relatives of characters that are alive in 1985, the real-time, time period of the entire trilogy. Some play a more prominent role than others. Again the main villain is a Tannen. Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen, to be exact. A typical stereotype example of a dumb but ruthless Western villain. He is perfectly portrayed by Thomas F. Wilson. The entire cast is basically great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd have really grown into their roles and the chemistry is still there. They are being helped this time by the great Mary Steenburgen, as Doc's love interest.What I love about the Back to the Future movies is that they always pick things up were the last movie ended. It makes the movie really a trilogy that can also be perfectly watched as one movie, just as the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars movies.The movie is really great looking with great sets, costumes and make-up effects that suit the time period of the movie just right. What the movie also does well is blending in the different atmospheres of the different time periods with each others. When the movie is set back in 1985, you don't have the feeling like you're watching a totally different movie. Dean Cundey's cinematography of the movie is great and he also plays a small cameo role in the movie itself by the way. Alan Silvestri's musical score is also great but again also the lesser of the three in my opinion. But it's still great, so what am I really complaining about...The early special effects are also quite good, considering its period this movie was made.The movie is really great, fun, clean, adventurous entertainment to watch from start till finish, with fun characters, settings and directing. A fitting conclusion of perhaps the most entertaining movie trilogy of all time.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually didn't like "Back to the Future Part III" as much as I and II, but it's still pretty fun. All the stuff about Clint Eastwood gave the movie a neat dimension (I just wonder what would have happened if anyone from 1885 had lived long enough to see the real Clint Eastwood get famous). If the movie has any problem, it's that they sort of make the Old West look idealistic. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and Elisabeth Shue turn in their usual dependable performances, and Mary Steenburgen is passable. But either way, they probably agreed that it all had to end here.And remember: your future is what you make it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK... First I know that this was/is a movie and my plan would end the move in 30 minutes, but this is what I would do let me know if you agree...Gas tank in the car Marty drove to 1885 from 1955 has a full tank. Doc filled it in 1955. Gas line gets ripped all gas runs out.Doc - Patch the gas line. DO NOT use whiskey as fuel. In 1885 at that point there are 2 time machines there. The one Marty drove from 1955 and the one Doc put in the mine in 1885. That 1885 car should still have gas in it unless Doc drained it before putting it into storage.Get gas out of that car and drive back to the future...Another thing. Doc can build an Ice maker, but can't refine Oil into some form of gas? They had oil back then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that during conversation when someone is hopped up about something they tend to answer before they (the two persons speaking) are on the same page. Car making sounds as if it runs on gas. And also you are dealing with a 12 volt car system , 1.21 Gigawatts or not it is grounded so unless you are sticking two live wires in the gas tank or some outside source is causing a spark you could run watts and watts through it all day and nothing should happen but who knows. As for the physics of the whole car time travel stuff. I think that perhaps the time circuits must cause some sort of warp in space-time like some sort of Spatial Flexure and the 88 mph is so that the mass of the car and person(s)in the car have enough inertia to punch through when the flexure forms.Bottom line Car runs on gas Time circuits required the 1.21 Gigawatts (Plutonium) to open the Flexure.How did they go to a certain point in time?? who knows my guess would be that they calculate certain frequencies to determine what point in time to arrive at. everything vibrates at a certain frequency. Nothing stands still.Ultimately remember that it is just a movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One review covering a 3 BTTF movies, a great series 1985, 1989, 1990.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of this date, the 3 "Back to the Future" films have these IMDb ratings -- #1 (1985) 7.8 of 26,091 votes. #2 (1989) 6.6 of 9492 votes. #3 (1990) 6.4 of 8230 votes. So, it is clear that the first episode is the most popular, no contest, in both rating and number of votes.I, too, think #1 is the best. In fact, I think it should stand among the best films of all time. Not for any one facet, but for the total entertainment that it provides. Almost all of us dream of "time travel." BTTF certainly is not the first to explore time travel, but the way it does it is unique. Plus the fact that this is clearly a comedy, but one that is so well conceived and written that I never find myself think of it as a comedy. I've been a long time fan of Chris Lloyd's, since his days as Jim Ignatowski ("flower child" spelled backward), and he is so perfect as Doc Brown. And, of course, Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly "defines" a role as few have been defined in films.The script is uniformly superb in all 3 versions, and to me that is what really makes them "believable" within the context of a pure fantasy. Plus, although all the "science" in the 3 films is "bad science", which for a scientist makes it even funnier, they don't overlook any details. They always offer a "science" explanation for what Doc is about to do, even though it is completely nonsense.Tonight, at the end of #3, I first realized one of the reasons I like the BTTF films so much. Ever take a vacation to a totally different part of your country or world? And when you get back home after a few weeks, to the familiar, you sorta mentally pinch yourself and think, "Just two days ago I was riding a train through southern France, drinking wine by the river, and sleeping in the 200-yr-old silk factory turned home in the country." And you look around, you're back home to a totally different world.That's what I believe Marty McFly felt when he arrived home, saw Jennifer asleep on the swing. He had just spent a week during 1885, evading a band of Indians, seeing his original ancestors from Scotland, fighting an infamous gunfighter, and making a harrowing escape from the past by being pushed to 88 mph by a train that blows up, and now he is back home to the familiar. We can all identify with that, and the end of each of the 3 BTTF films gives us that identification.The original, #1, involved the existing friendship between Marty and Doc Brown. Marty accidentally gets sent back 30 years to 1955, and must enlist a young Doc's help to get home. Meanwhile he inadvertently gets his future mother interested in him, jeopardizing the future relationship of his "parents." The old newspaper accounts of the lightning strike of the clock tower is used as a source of energy to get Marty back home. His fight with Biff in 1955 has altered history and his 1985 family is apparently much better off as a result.#2 hinges on Biff inadvertently getting a copy of an almanac for "future" events and he dishonestly uses future sports results to gain fortune and power, and drastically change the future. Marty and Doc have to retrieve the almanac before Biff uses it, to restore history to its proper order. It ends in a way that sets up the #3 sequel.In #3 Marty gets a Western Union letter that Doc Brown had actually written in 1885 and requested delivery at the specific time in the future. Doc has ended up in 1885, is content, and insists that Marty not try to interfere. However, Marty discovers a tombstone and historical account of Doc being shot in the back over an $80 issue. So Marty has to go back and help Doc avoid that fate. To me, the original is definitely the better of the 3. The second and third ones are totally different, and I would rate them about the same. The science is funky, a rigorous analysis can uncover a number of "discrepancies", but to me none of that matters. The BTTF films are just great fun, and the good guys always come out on top. And there's nothing wrong with that.2015 UPDATE: I bought the 3-disk BluRay set and they really are an upgrade from the DVDs, better picture and sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem I had with this movie was that it could never have happened. For instance, Marty was planning on returning to his time until he saw Doc's grave. By going back in time he effectively saves Doc so therefore he would have never seen Doc's grave and never have gone back to get him (Doc). This creates a paradox. If they would have talked about that or changed their time theory model then I would have rated it much higher, maybe an 8 or 9, but I really hate it when movies contradict themselves. They can be unimaginable, but not contradictory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too silly with the Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie continues from BTTF2. Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is stuck in 1955 and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is stuck 1885. Doc is happy where he is, and he left the broken DeLorean to Marty. When they find that Doc gets killed only a week after leaving Marty the letter, Marty must repair the DeLorean, return to the Old West, and rescue Doc from his premature demise.While I understand the allure of going to the old West for director Robert Zemeckis, it just makes the movie seem hokey. I understand to go back to the 1955 Well a third time would be too complicated. The old west has a lot of Hollywood traditions tied in. But it feels like little more than one of those frontier amusement recreations. It's no longer profound, and it's the end of the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst of the Trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that the first two Back to the Future films were awesome. So I thought that when I saw the third installment that I would love that one as well. I was mistaken.Basically Marty has to get help from Doc Brown in 1955 to get back to 1985. After they uncover the time machine they discover that Doc was killed in 1885 by Maddog Tanner. So Marty decides to go back in time to rescue Doc instead. Along the way the delorian experiences problems and Doc Falls in love.I think this film does a good job of continuing the series. The beginning starts off right where Number two left off. When it gets to the Western Part is where the problems start.There is a lack of good jokes and action in this one. The other two were way more funny and had much better action.The whole western setting makes this film seem like a comedic western film rather than a back to the future film. It seems as if there was not as much going on and the main conflict of getting back to 1985 was not as pressing as the conflicts in the other films.Also I did not like the whole Doc falls in love part of this film. Maybe it is because the actress who plays his girlfriend, Mary Steenberg, added nothing to this film. Seems like she is just reading her lines rather than trying to act. Doc did not seem like the character that I knew from the first two films in this one.Michael J. Fox is great though. He always is great as Marty in these films and once again is in top acting form. His performance in this film makes the film worth watching.Definitely the worst of the series. Did not seem as exciting and funny too me and the whole love story made it lame. I recommend it the least of the series and at least this film puts an OK end to the series. Still it should have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so Marty gets back to 1985, he goes and gets Jennifer. They go to look at the wreckage of the time machine that was hit by a train when Marty re-entered 1985 from the old west. Then, Doc comes back in his time train and talks to Marty as if they just saw each other, but Doc had a whole life before this time. Doc's oldest son looks at least seven so this would mean that Doc hadn't seen Marty for at least 8 years before taking the time train to meet Marty and Jen in 1985. Yet, Doc doesn't even get out to hug marty or shake his hand. He just gives him a picture and is on his way. Gee, see you in another 8 years Marty! Duh. Horrible ending. Robert must have been in a hurry to finish this movie or he went well overbudget or something. What an idiot. I get the humor they were trying to portray, but it doesn't compensate for that crappy ending. I am so disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The wild west revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mediocre bookend to the "Back to the Future" trilogy ties up the loose ends but the repetitive formula is looking tired, laboured by a contempt that usually follows such familiarity. Fox is this time transported back one-hundred years to the wild west where he passes himself off as 'Clint Eastwood' attempting to save Doc (Lloyd) from a bullet from the perennial badman Biff (Wilson).Very distinguished cast co-stars Mary Steenburgen as Lloyd's love interest of the 1880's, sultry Elisabeth Shue again reprising her role as Fox's present-day GF and the likes of Richard A.Dysart, Matt Clark, Harry Carey, Jnr and Dub Taylor in minor roles; Lea Thompson also re-appears as Fox's present-day mother, and the woman who discovers him after his trademark knock-out shortly after arriving at his time-travel destination.Now familiar plot seems to almost go through the motions in an attempt to sign-off the series where arguably, it needn't have been revisited. Filmed back-to-back with Part II, though the plot contrives the second sequel, there's really nothing new here and I've always felt as if I was just re-watching the original film with temporally adjusted sets and wardrobe. Might make for a well appointed box set, but it's just passable as a stand alone feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely the worst of the series, but still very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first two Back to the Future movies are two of my favorite movies of all time. And I would consider the first film one of the most perfect movies ever made. But when I saw that the third one was going to be a western, my expectations went down a little bit. There's not really anything wrong with that, I'm just not a big fan of westerns, but I will say, this film is very, very good.One thing that has always bothered me, and this may be a spoiler, but Marty decides to go back to 1885 to save Doc because they find out he will be shot. But the 1955 Doc also knows, so why doesn't Marty just say to land the Delorean in a different spot, or why would Doc want to stay if he knows he will get shot. Also when you get down to it, the plot is just a rehash of the first movie, which I guess makes since for a film called Back to the Future, but still. And it suffers from the three curse of having the second one be so epic, but then this one is just a much smaller story.But Doc and Marty are still a lot of fun. I actually don't mind the character of Clara, she's funny, she's charming, and her scenes with Doc are actually kind of sweet. I love that we get a new villain, and he can actually kill some people. There's a lot of subtle and not so subtle references to the other movies. But the best part about this movie is the ending, the scene with the train has me on the edge of my seat every time I watch it.This movie is, good. It doesn't quite live up to the first two in my opinion, but it's still a lot of fun, and a fitting closure to the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the third installment of the series, we discover that Doc is alive in the past and Marty goes back to the beginning of his home town, only to find that Doc may be murdered in the past. This one is not as brilliant as the first two, but to its credit it is a nice end to the series, and in fact was scripted and shot with the second installment. I liked the set, which shows how the town has changed without changing - by the clever use of the layout of the set, as well as some jokes that have now become a classic - in particular the reference to Clint Eastwood. Although this film is not as good as the first one, it is a must watch as it closes the series and although the end is a bit wacky (were they opening the way for a fourth installment?) it is clear that should Michael J Fox be in a position to deliver a fourth installment today "for the sake of cash", the audience would follow. Kids will enjoy this third part more than once. Grown ups once only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back to the Future III is great fun and well done for its time. I love how it has similar characters as the other two movies, especially the sheriff. There are, unfortunately, big holes in plot. For example, when Marty goes back to the Old West, he stays with his McFly ancestors. However, the wife looks like his mother. Therefore, he is actually staying with the maternal side of his family. Their last name should not be McFly, which is his father's last name! The McFlys should actually have a different last name than Marty. It is also very far-fetched that Clara would fall in instantly in love with someone like Doc. She refers to his wild-eyed, wild hair appearance as long silver flowing hair and big puppy dog eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When there is the time-traveling, flying steam locomotive, there is a problem. How would Doc make a flux capacitor with 1885 technology? It's messed up. And just how would he make time circuits and all that? Too many problems here! And where'd he get the train? HE couldn't have just walked up and taken another one. And once in the future, how'd he get the train to the hover-converters? Where'd he get the money? Where'd he get room to get his train to 88 miles an hour for the first trip? This has created a large amount of plot holes. These are holes, however, that are covered up by the important plot. Therefore, the problems are overlooked. I believe this stimulates too much "how?" questions. I'm gonna end this review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the so-called "glory days" of the Old West, the 'good guys' wore white hats and the 'bad guys' proved their ultimate stupidity by wearing all black in the scorching heat. Back to the Future Part III is a return to those roots in a very un-original and un-exciting fashion. Robert Zemeckis' talent that was so boisterous in the first two movies has fallen into a layman's movie that anyone else could have made. Too bad it took Death Becomes Her to reboot his system as to where it belonged.The story is the first problem, the plot is so ridiculously awful that it tarnishes the original beyond belief. Second, Christopher Lloyd is wasted for the first time in a fruitless position. In the original, he was the wacky inventor. In the second, he was the worrisome custodian of the space-time continuum. Here he is the melodramatic sap. Michael Fox isn't much better as he, once again, proves that he's only good for laughs.While not as gizmo-happy as the second movie, the effects leave much to be desired. Even the period of 1885 is not represented well. It is all a bunch of gags and cliches that we have seen before many other times. I preferred the sci-fi parody of 2015 instead, but I'm not a Western aficionado.The editing, yet again, is underdone and the script stumbles along in the middle third of the movie. The camerawork isn't as inventive, but Zemeckis never has been a big stickler about what he projects. Only in Forrest Gump has he been so concerned about that. Finally, Alan Silvestri's score is so inferior this time around. The previous films had a resonance similar to Predator, but The Abyss will remain my favorite compilation on his part. Unfortunately, none of that magic is here. If only it were, how beneficial it would have been... Overall, the weakest link in the trilogy. Why is it these movies only get worse as time goes on? 2 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, granted, I did not entirely hate this movie, unlike the family members that I viewed the film with. I thought that the whole story was way too far fetched and unrealistic and was in the end, just downright dumb. Trying to live up to the original BACK TO THE FUTURE, this film just does not do its predecessors justice. It starts out confusing, but then things start to clear up, and then they get all confusing again.There are many small elements of this film that are really just smaller plots fixed into the big one. They add to the confusion. I must say that this was really not what I was expecting. The whole western thing was okay, because the sets were very well done, and the costumes were pretty good too. The acting was cheesy as always, and of course no one dies in this film, so that just adds to the stupid "kid movie" feel of it all. The ending was what was most dumb of all. It makes absolutey no sense, and is basically in the movie just to confuse you even more. The writers couldn't just leave the story as it was. They couldn't have anyone die. And, they couldn't come up with a story that wouldn't confuse the s*** out of people. This third installment is purely and simply the worst of the series, but it is still something that fans of the first two films must see.BACK TO THE FUTURE PART III gets 2/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back to the future III, is, as the name suggests , the third and eventually the last installment of the famous Back to the Future Trilogy. It's entertaining, funny at times, but i don't cared at all about the story, to be honest. I mean, i really liked the first one film, basically because of it's originality, then it comes the other two sequels, in 1989 and 1990 respectively, telling essentially the same story that was already told in the first one, just modifying the places and the 'villains'. I don't know if the sequels were necessary or not, but in fact they don't bring nothing new or as awesome as the first Back to the Future does, so i am inclined to say that these sequels were pointless. This may sounds weird, but Back to the Future's trilogy kinda reminds me of the Rio's trilogy, whose sequels to Rio Bravo, the Eldorado and Rio Lobo, were almost remakes of the first one. The only difference between both trilogies would be the lack of connection between the films on the Rio's trilogy, while Back to the Future's trilogy follows the traditional linear narrative, connecting all the three films.But anyways, this film may be or not worth a watch, but it's more of the same old Back to the Future. I liked the references to Taxi Driver and Apocalypse Now on it, and obviously, the constant references to Clint Eastwood in the film. Again, it's a well made film, just like the previous installments, but is just repetitive and somewhat forgettable. 6.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>there are fine individual moments and ideas here, but Part III is crippled by an unnecessary love story and lack of initiative and zest that induced the first two movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing as how the science-fiction and the Western are my favorite genres, one would expect "Back to the Future: Part III" to be my personal favorite of the entire trilogy directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. It has some very fine moments and some great ideas in its form, but unfortunately, "Part III" comes across as being the weakest of the entire trilogy for a variety of reasons, but mostly because it lacks the zest and gusto that so wonderfully induced the first two movies.After Doc (Christopher Lloyd) is accidentally whisked back to 1885, Marty (Michael J. Fox) discovers the flux capicator-inhibited DeLorean buried in Hill Valley's soil, buried by the Doc years ago before he was murdered by a notorious gunfighter (Thomas Wilson). Marty recovers the DeLorean and travels back to the Old West to rescue Doc, who has become smitten with a frantic schoolmarm (Mary Steenburgen), who was supposed to have died until they interfered.I think you can see what my first real complaint about "Part III" is. I suppose it was only a matter of time before the screenwriters made the mistake of throwing in a sappy love story for Doc when one was anything but necessary. The first two movies dealt with their romantic subplots with care and tender brilliance, but best of all, they strayed away from Doc. This character needed anything but a love interest. The romantic subplot is sappy, boring, uninteresting, and makes one roll one's eyes and look toward his watch, begging Zemeckis to move along with the more interesting stuff. And also, I'm sorry to say, Christopher Lloyd and Mary Steenburgen are a very awkward screen couple."Part III" also suffers because it simply does not have the same inexorable timing and suspense that made the first two movies so magical. Instead of whipping along, it plods along like a man dying in the heat of the sun. And the climax, which is once again drawn-out with suspense intended to build, comes across as dull and routine with tensions everywhere but on the rise. There is also, I'm sorry to say, a lot of hokey dialogue in the screenplay.Now, however, there *are* some good elements to "Part III." In fact, some of them are brilliant. The idea of Marty assuming the name of Clint Eastwood in the Old West is a fantastic idea and the obvious homage to the climax of "A Fistful of Dollars" is fun and smile-inducing. Performances are once again good. Michael J. Fox's performance is buttoned up and solid; Lloyd is funny when he's not being sappy as Doc; Thomas Wilson is once again sinister and convincing; Mary Steenburg turns out a solid, if whimsical performance, as the schoolmarm; and there are a lot of fun Western cameos by names such as Pat Buttram and Harry Carey, Jr. who can be seen playing poker in the saloon that plays prominently in the movie. All of these good, fun elements do save the movie from being a complete failure, but unfortunately they also make your heart sink as you realize that the rest of the movie falls short of them.Perhaps the change of direction was the fatal flaw of "Back to the Future: Part III." Perhaps the blend of the Western and science-fiction genres was too patchy and whimsical for it to work. And maybe Robert Zemeckis and his crew were running out of steam with this franchise. In the end, "Part III" is not really a very bad movie, but it is uncharacteristically dull and dry for a Robert Zemeckis movie and unlike the first two movies, is rather forgettable save for its few brilliant elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last and weakest film in the "Back to the Future" series. Short on invention (especially compared to "Part II") and not terribly funny, this lighthearted comedy-Western relies heavily on the viewer's good will, established by the previous parts, and his/her familiarity with the characters, to camouflage the fact that the time-travelling premise is already wearing thin. But the frantic climax was impressive enough for me to give this an extra half-a-star. (**1/2)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched all three tonight after having not seen them for many years and am old enough to remember seeing 2 &amp; 3 at the cinema.Two held up okay but in some parts became a spoof of itself but was so dense with plot, settings and gags it didn't matter.III on the other hand comes across as the poorest section of the trilogy by a good margin.The first act is quite dull consisting mainly of Doc and Marty recapping the last film, figuring out what to do and getting huge chunks of exposition out of the way. Interspersed with occasional cheap gags to keep the thing from going dead. Magnifying glass over mouth, dog with a helmet, getting peed on by a baby, stepping into poop, doing a moonwalk, spilling a bucket full of spit down Buford, etc etc.The film feels empty for much of this and the plot only moves on a bit after about the 25 minute mark when he meets up with the Doc but then it still ends up feeling like a 2nd-rate western featuring the guys from BTTF rehashing scenes of the past &amp; turns it into a sketch show. Also worst line "Frisbee! Far Out!" The final act is where the film finally picks up some momentum that carries it through to it's (Spoilers)full happy endings for everyone conclusion.In the end all III did for the most part was (Spoilers)to provide long-time bachelor Doc Brown with a Mrs for a happy ending.It just can't hold a candle to the other two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doubleback to the Past again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I used to dislike Westerns, I actually put off the conclusion to the 'Back to the Future' trilogy a bit. Granted, 'III' is not a real western, but it did take place in the "old west," contained high-noon gunfights, saloons, cowboys, Indians, immigrants, sheriffs, the whole hoe-downs. More of a spoof of Clint Eastwood's older fare, including using his name as an alias, 'III' did, successfully bring back the series to the original roots: barely any time travel (in a time traveling movie), a much slower pace than 'II,' even a theme song ? ZZ Top's 'Doubleback' which I grew to love as much as 'I's Huey Lewis &amp; the News's 'Power of Love.' That being said, it really wasn't that great of a film, though not terrible by any means. Gone, still, is the heart and soul 'I' had. Doc Brown and Marty must "push" the DeLorean up to 88 MPH to, once again, get "back to the future." But wait, Doc has fallen in love for the first time, so conflict arises if he should use his head or heart at the same time Marty (still the "Dick Clark" eternal teenager) must stop freaking out when someone calls him "chicken." Sure, I know it's the teenager's time to grow up (mentally, that is, as he looks fully grown by now) but that "Nobody calls me chicken, or yella!" first introduced in 'II' gets old really fast. I strongly admired 'II's clever closing overlapping the finale of 'I' and 'II,' which to my recollection, hasn't even been done. Unfortunately, 'Part III' really dropped the ball with an incredibly unrealistic, overlong rescue scene on a train. Granted, we're dealing with fictional time-travel, but the perfectly aimed hover board was a bit overboard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My main reason for wanting to see this movie was to find out what happens after part II, and after seeing this, I think they could have easily ended everything in that second part. But, in a way, I'm glad they didn't. It's not as great as the first 2 (final parts in trilogies rarely are) but by now I just liked the characters so much that it was nice to see them on one last adventure. This time it focuses more on the characters than any time travel paradoxes. Doc Brown falls in love, and Marty seems to grow up and take responsibility for things. That's all well and good but I never really felt the same excitement as I did while watching the first 2. I guess because this plays out more like an old west comedy than a time travel movie. As a final entry in a trilogy I found this to be only satisfactory at best.I do recommend this movie though, it's still funny and entertaining. It's just not as funny and entertaining as its predecessors.My rating: 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... but definitely a plot hole. OK, so Doc Brown gets struck my lightening and the DeLorean ends up in 1885. it's left buried in a mine until 1955. A microchip is replaced with a 1950's equivalent that takes up most of the front of the car. It is sent back in time to 1885 where it sustains damage to the fuel tank. Now why bother with all the messing about with the train when there are now TWO DeLoreans in 1885 - the one Doc Brown sealed in the mine, and the one with new tires and a hole in the fuel tank. They could've placed the new not-so-microchip onto Doc Brown's DeLorean and left the holey tanked car in the mine. Bit silly really innit? But there were a lot of funny funny moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You and Marty 'might not be able to think fourth dimensionally' in the third 'Back To The Future' film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Back To The Future III' finally shows that this most successful and popular movie series has come to a disappointing end. Made back to back with BTTF 2, BTTF 3 loses the magic that the first two movies captured, to its detriment. Marty McFly, the hero of the first two movies is now in a bit of bother as he is left stranded in back in 1955. When he receives an urgent letter from his good friend Doc Brown, Marty is told to leave him alone where he is. Marty is dumbfounded as to what he should do. However, more devastating news is about to be discovered by our junior time traveler.Fulfilling a long-time fantasy, Doc Brown has decided to live in the old West of the 1880s. But when he is in danger of meeting an untimely end, Marty travels back in time to rescue him. There is just one problem: Doc Brown is smitten by a school teacher Clara Clayton that he can't think straight! Now, it is up to Marty to keep Doc out of trouble, the DeLorean running, and the past, present and future on track so they can all get back to where - and when - they belong!Again the story of BBTF 3 is a highlight to this film. Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale cleverly interweaved love and time in such a sweet and romantic way in all BTTF films. In the first it was Marty's parents, in the second it was Marty's own romance that needed help and the third focuses on Doc Brown and his love at first sight with the beautiful school teacher Clara Clayton. This movie is also placed in the old west of the 1880's, showing Hill Valley in the olden days. While I feel I have seen better western settings, the way the actors went about creating the 1880's feel, seemed accurate enough.The cast was back once again, to finish off the BTTF story. Michael J. Fox is one great actor. He once more shows why he was the perfect choice as Marty McFly. Marty has been through so much as a character that in no way would his character have been boring to portray. Again Fox had to learn how to do many of the talents that his character has to show off in the old west. Such things as Gun shooting and horse riding are just two of the new editions to the long bow that Fox had to learn. I feel for a guy like Fox who has succumbed to the horrible side effects of Parkinson disease. He has stopped doing full-time acting, which is a great shame.Doc Brown was once again performed grandly by Christopher Lloyd. He is so involved as the Doc, always warning of the dangerous effects that could go wrong if they interfere with the past or the future. Putting on his old west shoes in this movie, Lloyd does a good job in showing that he is not just able to be a wacky 1950s or 80's scientist. The way Doc gets Marty back to the future here is clever and one of the movies high points. The Doc's love interest is the local school teacher Clara (Mary Steenburgen) who was again well suited to her role. I have recently seen Steenburgen in the new release movie titled 'Life as a house', a movie that I really enjoyed.Other cast members include regulars such as Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), who was another actor who made the transition from the first two movies into the old west beautifully. The rivalry that Tannen and the McFlys have on this film is one of the highlights of the entire series. I love it when 'Mad Dog' says to 'Clint Eastwood', `Nobody calls me 'Mad Dog', especially not some, duded up egg sucking gutter trash!' Lea Thompson is back as Marty's aging Mother and long lost relative of the west, 'Maggie McFly'. With all of these actors taking on various roles making them incredibly interesting to watch, as you want to know how different they will be next. There is one another character I want to point out to you that I find interesting. Although he only has a minor role, Chester, the palace saloon bartender (Matt Clark) and I, have somethings in common. We share the same name oddly enough, in addition to the fact that I one day want to be a bar tender as well. Is that ironic? I feel it is!Overall the 'Back To The Future' series was and is still a delight to watch, 'time and time again'. The only problem I have with the second and third movie being made back to back, is that they each take a bit away from each other. I would have preferred a small gap between each one, so they could have both been given the attention they deserve. Robert Zemeckis is a great director and I am sure gives most of the credit for his success as a director to the BTTF trilogy. I am another fan of Zemeckis' work. I would love to have gone through the experiences that Marty McFly did with time-travel into the past and the future. Yet I will always remember what Doc Brown says at the end of this movie `You're future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one.' That is good advice that I feel everyone needs to listen and do!CMRS give 'Back To The Future III': 3 (Good Film)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back to the Future, Part 3 (1990): Dir: Robert Zemeckis / Cast: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenbergen, Thomas F. Wilson, Elisabeth Shue: After two imaginative installments in the franchise they now lower themselves with this unoriginal take on a plot. Weakest entry picking up the cliffhanger of part 2. Marty McFly is stranded in 1955 and he must locate Doc Brown in 1885 old west and save Doc's life. Predictable storytelling with a pathetic manure joke that is getting too old. In fact everything about this film lacks the creative impulses of the first two films. Directed by Robert Zemeckis who is aided by great production values, which is the one element that still works here. Zemeckis previously made the first two films in the series as well as Romancing the Stone. Michael J. Fox once again portrays McFly who wanders into the old west brandishing the name Clint Eastwood. Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown is pretty much following the motions. Thomas F. Wilson isn't as interesting as he was in part 2 where he appears at two different ages and is involved in much better plotting. Mary Steenburgen joins the cast as Doc's love interest and that is about the height of her involvement. Elisabeth Shue again plays McFly's girlfriend although now she seems reciting. Disappointing and unoriginal worthy of the "off" button on the remote control. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

That accomplished, he goes back to 1985 and his wacky inventor visits the 21st century.In the 21st century, the wacky inventor learns that something terrible will befall Marty's son (Michael J. Fox) and his daughter (Michael J. Fox), so he recruits Marty's help to make sure that it doesn't happen, so the wacky inventor can't hear about it, and therefore can't prevent it. He also casually mentions that if too many more impossible things happen then perhaps the whole universe (Michael J. Fox) will explode. Luckily, it doesn't. With pluck and daring, Marty succeeds in preventing the future tragedy that caused him to prevent it, but inadvertently changes the past so that the events of the entire first movie didn't happen, except that they did. When they discover what has happened, except that it hasn't, Marty's wacky inventor friend comes up with a theory that might make sense of it, except that it doesn't. But with pluck and daring, they set everything back the way it was, except that it's also the way things have always been.But now the wacky inventor is stranded in the 19th century.

The second film got away with being decent, but this film went too far, and the villain (although related to Biff) is not as strong a character. This film is more like a western with native Americans, cowboys, and run-away trains. Yes, it is packed with action, but it is missing that extra edge that the other two films had. It also replaced the comedy element by becoming a little more serious. In short, it just did not do it for me, and it's not a very good film. It weakens the trilogy, in my opinion.

		<fullReview>I loved Back to the Future and Part 2, but this movie was not as much fun and/or adventurous. The third should have been the best out of all, but wasn't exciting enough. I thought that they would only be in the old west for a while, and then either go way back in time, or way ahead in time like the year 2525, or 3000. However, the ending was good, and I liked it, but I wish the movie would have been more exciting, and taken place in more times. I also wish they would have let my personal friend Jeffrey Weissman (George McFly in Part 2-3) play Seimus, instead of Michael J Fox. ALSO, Lorraine (Marty's mother) came from the Baines family, so why did they have Lea Thompson play Maggie McFly? Overall it was good, but should have been much better. I give this movie a Grade C.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Admittedly the weakest of the three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 REVIEWS IN 1BACK TO THE FUTURE was a little over-hyped but still admittedly the best out of the series and well thought out but the jokes made me laugh especially the Darth Vader one (it always cracks me up).BACK TO THE FUTURE 2 was flawed with the concept of Biff having a grandson because Biff wanted for 30 years Marty's Mother although we aren't introduced to the concept.BACK TO THE FUTURE 3 was supposed time-travelling to the 1880's when they get there it does nothing except try to live up to the other 2 although I am reminded of They Call Me Trinity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last and worst of the Back to the Future trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What was the time-travel charmer thinking? A trip to the old-west and 1885 please give me and all other movie fans a break. What a terrible way to end a great trilogy. Instead of ending Back to the Future with an 1885 era why not keep the drama unfolding in the modern 1985 era or the baby boom 1955 era it would have had more interest with an audience in 1990. Sure this film like the previous two from the trilogy has excitement and good performances I must once again admire the work of Michael J. Fox. Yet things just don't seem the same I personally felt the final focused to much on the life of Doc (Christopher Lloyd) as in the end he is happy that he finally found his mate for life and returns to the old-west of 1885 more happiness should have been directed at Marty as the film could have ended showing him happy with family and wife Jennifer in the future. Believe I happen to be right about part III it clearly does not get the same numerous showings that the first two Back to the Future movies do as I continue to see Back to the Future get numerous airings on TBS and Back to the Future II get numerous airings on the USA cable network or Sci-Fi network when part III is rarely shown it just goes to show which movies in the trilogy had the best quality and most popularity. Watch the first two Back to the Future movies anytime you will get the best entertainment of your life avoid the third and final it simply just lost it's luster and ran out of gas. Then again you might enjoy if you like the western genre of film but I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was expecting a grand finale trilogy ending. A great closing of the back to the future movies...I expected wrong...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I get into everything let me say this. I don't hate this movie. I just thought it was a great disappointment to the rest of the trilogy. This movie's more like western mixed with comedy, then a back to the future movie. If you've read my comments on the first two back to the future movies, you can realize how much I loved them. The acting was superb, and the plot outlines and the script... It was wonderful. This movie I felt was just slapped together a bit at last moment. I was waiting for YEARS to see this movie, but my video store never had it. You see I had seen BTTF part2 on tv, before I saw no. 1, and then when we rented out the original BTTF, it didn't ruin it, but... I knew what would happen, yet no. 2 had confused me greatly because I was a little kid, and I couldn't understand why two Michael J. Fox's were running around in 1955, and what the time machine was. It was all very confusing. So like I said I rented no. 1 out, and it all started fitting together. So then I saw number 2 again, and seeing the "To be concluded" message, was a bit saddening, but yet I couldn't wait to see the grand finale. So for years the video stores I went to, for some reason never had it. Finaly one day I went there, and they had it, but no copy behind the box cover. SO when I finaly rented the movie out, about 2 weeks after that, the years of waiting had come, I popped open the box slid in the movie, pressed play AND...it got stuck in our VCR. Apparently they must've gotten it second hand, and it was about 6 years old. So then we took our VCR in for them to fix, since it was their film's fault. Lots of things happened, and they ended up forgetting to fix it or something like that. So about another 2 weeks went by, and I forget if they paid for a new VCR for us, but whatsoever, we had to get a new VCR because the other one was unfixable. After that I waited for them to get a new copy in, rented it out. I did the same thing as before, and it got stuck. NO OTHER MOVIE HAD DONE THIS BEFORE..ONLY PART 3 TWICE IN A ROW. This time, i was able to pry the movie out, and took it back, explained, again....and they said the film must've been so dirty inside it just got stuck when it started running. After that we tried different video stores, I was now desperate to see this movie. We finaly found another store with it, and this time the movie worked(GASP!). The beginning of the movie was great, but once he was in 1885...All I can say is this film is ok, but it does not live up to it's predecessors. I'll give it 8 out of 10, in the way of a good movie, but in the way of a sequel...no... a CONCLUSION yet..only 6 out of 10 stars. If you disagree with me, all I can say is you must not of enjoyed BTTF part 1 and 2. Because those, my friends are classic storytelling, at it's very best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an interesting Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie at the weekend and I just found it a bit lame compared to the other 2 But what should I have expected it was quite an old movie and stuff I was also REALLY disappointed in some bits of like for example when the Delorean gets hit by a train I mean I just really hated the fact that Happened and was so agitated that I just switched the Movie off because I mean come on, Who would ever think of destroying that beautiful Delorean at the end! Whoevers idea it was to destroy it at the end was an idiot of the century I hope he got Fired from the Movie Industry and charged Billions of Dollars!UNRECCOMMENDED</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate this movie, I hate the peoples who wrote it, I hate the actors who acted it, I hate the crew members who worked in it, I hate the studio which released it and lastly I hate myself for seeing it!!! Back to the Future 3 (Spoilers******) After Crispin Glover's demand for a salary same to Michael J. Fox, the writers killed George McFly's character for the continuing Chapters resulting a DUMP WEAKE STUPID sequels. Directed by Robert Zemeckis tells the last chapter of Back to the Future Trilogy.Continuing story just from the second part were Marty revisits 1955 which leads him to go to 1855 in this chapter. Why, because those Stupid SUCKING PRODUCERS wanted it! This is the most lame chapter of this trilogy, it has no sense, no ambitions, no morals, it happened only because it had to end. When Matrix sequels released every one started saying those are the worst sequel, but for me Back to the Future sequels SUCKED the Most; especially the 3.rd one! I hate myself for seeing it!!! "I GAVE THIS MOVIE - 0 OUT OF + 100 !"</fullReview>
