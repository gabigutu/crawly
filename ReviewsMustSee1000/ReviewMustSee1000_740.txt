		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies of all time!---10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When someone asks me which movie i have seen the most times, i have to answer Friday. I know the movie pretty much verbatim, and have seen it well over 30 times. Chris Tucker is one of the funniest people ever. This is his best performance, followed closely by Rush Hour. There are so many funny moments in this movie it would be impossible to name them all here. My favorites would have to be when Smokey meets his blind date, who turns out to be fat and bald, and the scenes where Deebo confronts Smokey and Craig, played by Ice Cube. The movie has a hilarious supporting cast, including John Witherspoon, Tiny Lister, and Bernie Mac. Critics don't know anything. If you ever have a chance to see this and enjoy urban comedy and Chris Tucker, don't even hesitate to watch. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chris Tucker's best R rated performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was 14, I first saw Friday and almost choked from laughter. The script by Ice Cube and DJ Pooh is right on target with it's ghetto humor. Another plus point for the film is it doesn't stereotype. But it's Chris Tucker as Smokey who makes this film. His high pitched voice and mannerisms are classic.Hard-core rapper Ice Cube, after appearing in such hard-hitting films as Boyz 'N the Hood and Higher Learning, played his first comic role in this picture he co-wrote with frequent musical collaborator DJ Pooh. Craig (Ice Cube) manages to get fired on his day off (though he claims it's through no fault of his own) and spends the day hanging out with his buddy Smokey (Chris Tucker) and trying to avoid his father (John Witherspoon), who wants him to find another job immediately. Smokey (whose name might have something to do with his tremendous fondness for marijuana) has even more serious problems; he was given $200 worth of weed to sell by Big Worm (Faizon Love), but he ended up smoking it instead, and if he can't come up with the money by the end of the day, he'll be in a world of hurt (and will put Craig in the same place just for being his friend). And Deebo (Tom "Tiny" Lister, Jr.), a gargantuan bully who roams the neighborhood on his bicycle, has it in for Craig, while Craig tries his best just to stay out of his way. As one would expect, Friday features a strong hip-hop soundtrack, featuring tracks by such artists as Dr. Dre, Cypress Hill, Mack 10, and Funkdoobiest, as well as old-school R&amp;B selections from The Isley Brothers, Roger, and Rose Royce</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the best modern comedies. Chris Tucker is great as Smokey, and Ice Cube is great as Craig. The movie starts off perfectly, and ends the same way. It's a very believable film, and is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eleven years ago (one year before this movie debuted), if you'd have told me you can get an entire movie from two guys sitting on their porch on a hot Friday afternoon, I'd have said you were nuts.I first saw this movie on a date with my girlfriend as a teenager way back in 1995 (it's hard to believe that was 10 years ago, I laughed through it then and I laugh through it now.It's also the movie that made me a Chris Tucker mark.I see everything that guy is in.The same goes for Cube.I love this movie's ability to show that ghettos aren't all like the 'Good Times' TV series.This movie keeps it's lightheartedness throughout especially with funny characters to support Cube and Tucker like DJ Pooh, A.J. Johnson and Tiny Lister.It also doesn't hurt to have Nia Long with her fine self in it either.But as I stated this movie is very lighthearted and doesn't begin to get serious at all until the end where Craig tears Smokey a new one for getting him involved in the mess, Big Worm's assassination attempt on Craig and Smokey and Craig coming to the aid of Debbie (Nia) when D-bo (Lister) is beating her up.It's at those two points you almost forget this is supposed to be a comedy movie.The most important message in this movie actually came from Johnny Witherspoon who portrayed Craig's father.He gave his son some very fatherly advise...which I hope to follow with my own son one day.Although I can't say I'd have been that calm if I walked into my son's room and saw him holding a semi-aotumatic 9mm pistol.But I did like his advice....as I believe it was meant to be a message to the audience."You kids today are nothing but punks, so quick to pick up a gun. You scared to take an ass-whipping!" (referring to his fists) "These are all the protection you need. You win some, you lose some, but you live!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe me, If you could relate to SMOKEY and CRAIG, then you would see why this flick is so funny! While Dumb &amp; Dumber and Austin Powers:The Spy Who Shagged Me, had me rollin' at times, it didn't do enough to throw me at that front porch where our two main characters sit and do nothing but get high and jive!Yeah I can understand those critics who say "what's the point"? But in this flick, You don't need a point! Just plain and simple laughs! This is already a camp classic in case y'all don"t know! Please give it a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is hilarious! As far as comedies go about the hood, this one is hands down the best. Chris Tucker and Ice Cube really mix up nicely in this one. This is a feel good movie and doesn't glorify the gritty hard reality violence of the inner city at all, but rather focuses on strugglin to make it with good humor and staying positive. Sure they smoke weed all up and down side to side through this movie, but you have to remember that brings a certain audience and humor to it that wasn't present before. This movie is downright laugh out loud caliber. The situations this odd couple is forced into are interesting and very funny. The re-watch value for Friday is tremendous and the characters are beautifully developed. There are some true memorable moments in Friday, and even more memorable characters. This is just a fun movie from start to finish and never tries to be perfect. Thank you for keeping it light, and to the point. All we wanted was some fun and it was delivered with Friday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish my Fridays were like this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After listening to Ice Cube's song "Friday", I was very curious to know how good the actual movie was. Then when I finally bought the DVD of the film, I was very pleased. The movie was a great comedy, filled with laughs and an interesting story.The whole movie's story takes place on a Friday. It's about two friends (played by Ice Cube and Chris Tucker) who try to get through a regular Friday in their urban neighborhood. Little do these two fellows know, this Friday will be anything but regular. This Friday will be the most different Friday they will ever experience.The best thing about the movie is Chris Tucker. He gives a very comical and humorous performance as Smokey, the weed-addicted home boy. I've heard that Chris Tucker didn't star in the sequels to this film, so I refuse to watch the sequels. Ice Cube was pretty good in the movie too, but I wish he didn't have to star in the Tucker-less sequels, since Cube &amp; Tucker go well together as buddies.The soundtrack of the movie is great as well. There are lots of hip hop songs played in various parts of the film. I particularly like the songs from Dr. Dre, Cypress Hill, and Ice Cube himself.The bad part about the movie is that the story itself seems to be over-simplistic. I think a way to improve the movie would have been to add more sub-plots, therefore making the movie contain many funny twists. But still, the movie is pretty good as it is.To sum up, this is a great movie to watch on a day when you're in need of some good comedy. I'd recommend watching the movie on a good ol' Friday night!I give this movie a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest films of 1995</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Re-review in 2015): It's interesting to see how this has been labeled the first "Hood" comedy. I'm sure there have been others - though written by, of all people, Joel Schumacher, I've always thought of 1976's Car Wash as the grand-daddy of them. It's also become a benchmark for stoners; for the 20th anniversary, it was screened for a special event on 4/20. Sadly, I couldn't attend full of the green stuff, but it was still an enjoyable experience seeing it again. Not great, but good.For all of the comparisons to it being Boyz N tha Hood as a crude comedy, that it is in part. But it's also like the Watts equivalent of something closer Clerks, also by first-time filmmakers: it's mostly about two guys who don't have much going on with their lives or prospects or action, but they're surrounded by so many 'lively' personalities and moments that are meant to get BIG laughs, regardless of a story structure that is super-strong outside of the Day-In-The-Life thing. And both borrow of course from Do the Right Thing, though Cube actually goes for his own version of the violent climax with a fight. The lack of any cops shows this is a fairly insulated world. Works for me.If it doesn't really have the same existential heft as Clerks, well, it's not fully trying to be that anyway. What we get here also, of course, is the breakthrough for Chris Tucker - an opportunity he'd only really pursue for another few years before spending his life, it appears, on Rush Hour checks (and a surprise guest spot in Silver Linings Playbook, of all things). His work here is still electrifying and high-charged, though maybe this time I saw more of the obvious "tics" of the character (like, we get it, the Angel Dust bit is one of the major highlights of the movie, but can't you move on?) And Cube is good as straight man for Tucker's foole, and has a few moments too.This is one of those movies I watched a LOT 'back in the day' as one might say. It's really a movie, despite being rated R, for 13 year olds, black or white, and seeing it at 13 made as big an impression as seeing Clerks or Pulp Fiction or whatever. At the time I thought it was that good on the level. But some things do last better than others, and the seams in Friday show much more over time. Some bits don't work - the crackhead (?) hustler is hit or miss, mostly great in the "HEY, SMOKY BACk HERE TAKING A S***!" bit - though Tony Lister, DEEBO of course in capital letters, is still amazing. And I found myself laughing often through the film, in part due to things still working, like anything with Bernie Mac (and Tony Cox!), and sometimes just nostalgia. It surprised me just how much I remembered in terms of dialog - if only I remembered everything from school like this, I'd be probably a smarter man today... oh well.Bottom line, enough of it holds up to recommend as a fun comedy, but the effect of 20 years of stoner/hood/black comedies have diluted some of its effectiveness; any time Craig narrated, or that quick montage of 'things that happened today' right before the fight, drag the movie down. And why do they go OUTSIDE knowing that the drive-by is going to happen? That they might shoot the houses whether or not they're there? Doesn't make sense.Maybe I'm putting too much thought into it here. But, for what it was, and is, it's fun, dirty stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Tucker and Ice Cube what more do you want for a Movie like this!? This movie was funny, bright and original. theirs not a point in the movie where it goes dull or boring.Its starts off when Craig (Cube) wakes up on a Friday morning with his friend Smokey (Tucker) outside of his house for only Smokey to find out Craig got fired on his day off, Smokey tries helping Craig feel better by Rolling him Joints and drinking beer, Craig doesn't touch weed, until Smokey forces him to, they both end up getting high, Along comes Big Worm, the man that gives Smokey the weed to sell, only for Smokey to smoke, later on Big Worm finds out Smokey doesn't have the cash to cough up so Big Worm gives Smokey a deadline warning, or a drive-by. Craig has nothing to do with it, but nothing matters no more.Through out the movie comes local bully's, Stupid Neighbours, dumb friends, Early 90's rap music, drive-by's, Horney midgets, fights and Craig &amp; Smokey. A lot can go down between Thursday and Saturday!10/10</fullReview>

I highly recommend this to anyone with nothing to do.This is one of Chris Tuckers best performances. This is Ice Cubes best performance. Look out for Next Friday and The Friday After Next.A lot can go down between Friday and Saturday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA, CALI, Colombia &amp; ORLANDO, FL I was feeling like a GOOD Comedy, (SO hard to come by nowadays, ne c'est pa?) I recalled a recent note from a Friend, touting Friday, saying that only ONE Friend had rated it below 6*. Clicked to check...Nine out of Ten = 10* Reviews and one 8* on PAGE One! Takes place in South Central L.A? Hey! I grew up in SOUTH CENTRAL!...WOW! Sounded like a 100% sure bet, Right? (Queue LOUD Buzzer Sounding) WRONG!!! Was REALLY disappointed...Here's WHY: Friday did not really offer up much in the way of anything fresh or original. In a DVD Extras' interview, the principals claimed that Friday would show a much more true-to-life, much less violent HOOD, unlike some other famous late 80's early 90's flicks. Hmmm?...OK, let's see: One of the two main "Buddies", played by a then relatively unknown Chris Tucker, smokes weed, non-stop, 24/7, and is named "Smokey"! Oh! BTW, he also deals Marijuana! ?WOW! We've NEVER seen THAT in an inner- city movie before, huh? Excuse me!?! Did they say "True to life...or True to Stereotype?" Well, how about the "much less violent" angle? Hmmm?Two machine-gun toting Gang-bangers spray their house with at least 100 rounds! Hey, just another typical day of peace and quiet in the HOOD, right! There are a number of other negative stereotypes presented as well.Two things I resent: First, why are these things OK if it's supposedly Black movie?or do I have to say "Afro-American"? Secondly, why are so many people afraid to bring it up, for fear of being labeled, "Racist"? I have African ancestors. They are 6 or 7 generations removed, so I'm pretty bleached out, but I must still have a couple African genes in my genetic profile. So, PLEASE, spare me the racist label, O.K.? Must admit though, HOOD did deliver at least a few good laughs! 5*...ENJOY/DISRUTELA!?!...(I Hope Much More Than I) Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Espa?ol, are most welcome!</fullReview>

White, Black, Asian - It's great and funny! It can be defined in one word: CLASSIC! ACTUAL REVIEW: Wanna laugh? Watch this. Classic characters, classic soundtrack , classic tale, classic LINES! It is also very relate-able. We all know a Smokey "the pothead" or a Craig "the responsible one." Even though it was made in the 90's, this movie defies generations because of that fact. It is truly underrated by A LOT of critics! IN THE END... WATCH IT! RENT IT! BUY IT! STEAL IT! (okay don't do the last one) But just watch it! I give it 9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>F. Gary Gray has made a sweet touching hood film if that makes any sense. A comedy-drama take on the life of two jobless African Americans who basically sit on the porch all day and discuss modern day tactics. My kinda movie.The film is about Craig Jones (Ice Cube) a crabby jobless "two cool for school" type kid and his drug-dealing best friend Smokey (Chris Tucker) sit on the porch all day, thinking it will be an easy day in the hood. When really it will be a life or death type day.The neighborhood bully Debo (Tom Lister, Jr.) harasses them and says they have to pay him $200 by nightfall or they "will not live to see Saturday." Friday is a sweet movie, it his hilarious in most parts. And is loaded with dialogue. Its the kinda movie you watch and chill out too. The dialogue is actually pretty well written. Ice Cube and DJ Pooh provided a script. From two small names in the film industry at the time, they didn't do bad.I too like the sequels of Friday, and find them true to the original. Mainly "Friday After Next" is my favorite of the franchise. I hope F. Gary Gray and Chris Tucker return to do one last Friday. Maybe this time they will move on to Saturday.Starring: Ice Cube, Chris Tucker, Tommy Lister Jr., Nia Long, Bernie Mac, and John Witherspoon. Directed by: F. Gary Gray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>come on, it's not THAT funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic idea of two guys sitting on their porch all day watching the neighborhood go by is good, but the actors need to be really talented to make it funny or interesting. Ice Cube plays the straight man to Chris Tucker but for me both of them weren't funny. At times they would just kind of sit there and look around and at each other with nothing to say. Blank stares. Ice Cube had his shining moment in Boyz in the Hood but let's face it, I'm about as good an actor as he is. Chris Tucker is mildly entertaining in a few scenes, but most of the time just annoying. Sometimes the characters sit around and have conversations that go nowhere and make absolutely no sense.  Now, obviously I'm in the minority. Many people thought this was funny.I thought it could have been great, but only with a scriptwriter who knows how to write a funny line. But I didn't think Scary Movie was funny either so maybe, MAYBE, it's just me. It's obvious you have to be high to enjoy Friday. I'll try that next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably my favorite comedy of all time.I could watch this movie again and again and never be bored by it. Chris Tucker steals the show as Smokey the drug smoking best friend of Craig(played by actor/rapper/co-writer Ice Cube). The whole movie basicly follows Craig Jones and his best friend Smokey who on one friday end up the targets of drug dealer Big Worm(or Big Perm as Smokey calls him:)after smokey smokes up all of the drugs that Worm gave Smokey to sell for him. So Craig and Smokey have to find a way to get the money($200) by the end of the day while also dealing with other problems(Craig getting fired,dealing with neighborhood bully Deebo who pushes them and others around,etc..)or else they wont live to see saturday. Other great characters to look for in this awesome movie include Mr.Jones,Red,Stanely,Mr.and Mrs.Parker,and Ezal. With great music,characters,comedic moments,and acting this movie is definatly worth checking out at least once next time you want to see a comedy.Basicly I LOVE this movie.Give it a chance and it will grow on you.

		<shortDescription>Not funny and without a plot or good acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was fair. Craig (Ice Cube) and Smokey (Tucker) are two young men who live in South Central L.A... Craig has just been fired from his job, and Smokey is a young pot-seller who owes his dealer $200 from the pot that he smoked up. The supposed "plot" is: Smokey and Craig have to get $200 by Friday night, or Smokey's dealer is coming to kill both of them. Why someone would commit double-murder over $200 worth of garbage reefer I do not know. The whole movie they hang around on their porch, swearing and smoking pot (Craig tries pot for the first time at age 22). Nothing funny happens, I do not know why it is considered a comedy. It is basically a home video that tries to appeal to young pot-smokers who drop out of school in 8th Grade. This is NOT funny and extremely stupid. Even if you have a chance to see it for free (as I did, but I regret it), do not waste your time on this. Even if you are stoned while watching the film it will still not be funny. Feel free to email me with any questions or comments.</fullReview>

I couldn't relate to the humor, if indeed humor was the aim, and when Chris Tuker speaks I get angry. I always hear people quoting lines from this movie, it's not Office Space people, don't quote lines rom bad movies. You don't see me walking around quoting Robocop 3. In conclusion, this movie sucks, people say wow I can't beleive you didn't like Friday, you should see it again.

		<fullReview>I like this movie. The screenplay is excellent. The protagonists are strong with clear desires and obstacles to overcome. This allowed the rest of the cast to bounce off of them and shine. The addition of the ticking clock I thought was a wonderful idea that added tension to story. The humor in this film was achieved through conflict and not stereotypes which at times seems to be a favorite ploy of urban films. Many black movies are didactic but this film stayed clear of that and focused on entertaining the audience. This film's appeal is simply that the filmmakers told a great story cinematically. This film shows that a great screenplay is the beginning of a great movie be it an urban theme or not.</fullReview>

The movie setting brought back an old time feel and it was centered around the same neighborhood it also was one of the type of movies where one minute something happens but the next u don't know what to expect until it actually happens in other words the plot was unpredictable throughout the film which kept me guessing and attracted my attention into the film even more</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie today, and I would have to say that I was not really feeling it for the first forty minutes or so. I am glad that I kept on watching, however, instead of giving up on it so early because I really enjoyed how the film steadily rose in pace after about fifty minutes to an hour. I really enjoyed the chemistry between Ice Cube and Chris Tucker; I think that made the film more than anything. Another aspect of the film that I particularly enjoyed was the soundtrack. I found all of the music to fit with the film really well. Overall, this film was very slow-paced at the beginning, but the pace steadily rose making it more enjoyable and it had an awesome soundtrack. Eight out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun ghetto life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Friday. Craig Jones (Ice Cube) loses his job and living with his family. His dad (John Witherspoon) wants him to join him as a dogcatcher. He can't stand his jealous girlfriend Joi and is interested in sweet Debbie (Nia Long). His best friend Smokey (Chris Tucker) smokes weed and sells for supplier Big Worm (Faizon Love). Big Worm wants his $200 and threatens to kill both Craig and Smokey. Deebo is the giant bully of the neighborhood.This is a fun slice of ghetto life. It's a cross of ridiculous and hard. The movie is a fun watch with Tucker joking around. Then the movie takes another step up. When Craig's father catches him with a gun, he tells him that his fists are all he ever needs. That's a big scene. It's also surprising since the father is played as a joke at the beginning. That scene makes this a better movie than a simple weed comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very enjoyable day...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Friday is one the best comedies to come out of the 90s in my opinion, still very enjoyable today...There's isn't a lot of plot to speak of, but there isn't much necessary. What you get with Friday is a day in the life of Craig and Smokeys neighbourhood. Along the way you'll meet a great bunch of well written, funny, developed characters.. Like a fly on the wall experiencing this place, and its an enjoyable ride. On top of that, its Chris Tucker's best role outside of The Fifth Element, he is hilarious in this.Overall: If somehow you have missed this, watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Friday is possibly my most watched movie; I can recite pretty much every line. It has so many quotable lines &amp; memorable moments. Once you have seen it just take a look on the IMDb quotes page and so many of them will jump out at you. I could watch it tonight &amp; then again tomorrow night, it is certainly in my top 5 ever films. The soundtrack is also a massive hit with plenty of great hip hop sounds.The story is simple, two best friends, Smokey (Chris Tucker) &amp; Craig (Ice Cube) spend their Friday unemployed and avoiding the local drug dealer as Smokey owes him money. In this hilarious comedy you really see Chris Tucker steal the show. He is one of my favourite characters out of all the films I have seen. Ice Cube is also great in this and it is Friday that made me look out for all of Ice Cubes later films. As well as those two you have Craig's Dad (John Witherspoon) &amp; Deebo (Tommy Lister) both giving fantastic performances also. The supporting cast are used just right, the make plenty of appearances but do not get in the way of the two leads screen time. It is the chemistry between Chris Tucker &amp; Ice Cube is perfect, they appear at the start to be complete opposites but as the movie grows so does their relationship on screen.Friday is certainly regarded as a classic comedy due hand down, to its script. This is where the comedy comes from; there is minimal (if any) slap stick humour. The script offers so many hilarious conversations and one liners that will have you in stitches. The film has an extremely basic plot; almost 100% of the screen time is taken by Ice Cube and Chris Tucker and is mostly set on a house porch. This is what makes this film perfect! It is simple. It is set over 24 hours, but it is kept simple with just the right amount of story. There are some sub plots and back stories which give more depth to the characters but ultimately it's set in one day.I would go as far as to say that Chris Tucker made this film what it was, Next Friday &amp; Friday After Next weren't a scratch on this, and I believe that is because they were lacking Chris Tuckers presence.It is refreshing to watch a Hood Film that gives off a positive, feel good vibe. Most successful hood films have been gritty &amp; emotional with a negative feel. Friday offers such an upbeat take on this genre and makes you think that the hood isn't all that bad! A Classic.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good one from the 1990s. Craig and Smokey are two guys in Los Angeles hanging out on their porch on a Friday afternoon, smoking and drinking, looking for something to do. Encounters with neighbors and other friends over the course of the day and night, and their ensuing antics, make up the rest of the movie. I like all of the comedians here. Never in my life have I laughed so hard. This movie has gotten me through some dark times. One could say that the film is built on a firm base. The acting is very effective. This film was nearly perfect, but sadly still not made for everyone. It's one of those films for which I could guess the plot exactly before I saw it. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Friday is one of those movies that is pretty pointless but it spoke to a generation. I think the real reason why this movie works is due to the likability of the cast. You can't help but like Ice Cube and Chris Tucker despite them being complete slackers and a bit boneheaded. Their chemistry is great and their comedic timing is solid. The supporting cast also play their individual roles well despite the lack of material.I find that I have no problem watching this movie and to a certain extent enjoy it but it still doesn't change the fact that it is nothing more than a cult hit movie that was released at the right time in history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man I wish I could have been on set when they made the Friday franchise. This was one of the funniest movies of all time. The cast was outrageously funny from beginning to the end. This movie was followed by two more Fridays that was epic as well. I'm praying that Ice cube and company put together one more including Smokey and all the other comedians. Ice Cube put together three outstanding cast. and I also love the way he gave new upcoming comedians and chance to show what they can do in front of the camera. But if i had to choose which Friday was the funnest I think I would have to go with the original just because of Smokeys character But I would love to see Smokey and Dada together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest And Funniest Comedies Of All Time. An Excellent,Hilarious,Funny And Unforgettable Comedy Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Friday is one of the greatest and funniest Comedies of all time,an excellent Comedy that mixes hilarious scenes,great characters,quotable dialog and a great soundtrack. All of those combinations make Friday a Cult Classic,Comedy Classic and one of my favorite Comedies and favorite films of all time.Set in a neighborhood in South Central,Los Angeles,Friday tells the story of Craig(Ice Cube)and his weed smoking drug dealing best friend Smokey(Chris Tucker)who hangout on Craig's porch talking,getting high and dealing with various characters while getting into funny situations and showing that a lot of things can happen between Thursday and Saturday.Friday is an excellent Comedy and a Cult classic that had to be made and came out at the right time in 1995 and it was needed for South Central Los Angeles. Before Friday,the city of L.A was almost in a frozen state at the time because of the L.A Riots in 1992 and urban classics like Boyz N The Hood and Menace II Society gave movie goers dark visions of African-Americans growing in SC L.A where in those films it was always death and doom and gloom with no since of hope and at the time with the exception of the House Party films and a few others Black urban Comedies we're few and far between in the early to mid-90s. Friday took a different and much lighter approach to urban films and basically said while living in the ghetto or hood can be depressing and said,it can also be funny as well giving us one of the funniest films of all time and when you watch the film on cable,video or DVD you never turn it off. One of the many reasons that Friday is such an excellent and hilarious movie is because the situations and dialog are funny and real,because if you grew up in the ghetto you have seen characters in the film in everyday life and it will relate to viewers. The Comedy in the film works so well because the Comedy just strikes a perfect balance between hilarious character driven dialog and at times over the top Humor. The screenplay by Ice Cube and D.J Pooh is wonderful,giving the characters in the film memorable dialog and great moments that don't feel forced or fake,but feel very real and very authentic. I love movies that are set in 24 hours or movies that are set in one day and Friday is one of the best films set in one single day and like the best films set in 24 hours there is Comedy but there's also some lessons learned. While Friday is hilarious and filled with great Humor the film takes a little time to talk about some of the harsh realities of living in the hood and what happens in South Central so while Friday is a Comedy and a very funny one at that it is also morality tale as well but it's not a sad or bleak morality tale like Boyz N The Hood or Menace II Society were. Craig and Smokey are a classic duo because like most great duo's there is a funny character and there is the straight forward character that is serious and the back and forth dialog and banter between the two is classic and iconic. You can tell that Craig and Smokey genuinely care for one another and will do anything for each other and as funny as the characters are they are well developed and likable. Like Craig and Smokey we are watching and seeing the things going on in their own neighborhood which for them is a normal thing,but to most viewers is hilarious and insane. The ending of the film is a classic conclusion that is funny and intense at the same time and after you look at this film you will never look at the day Friday the same way again.The cast is excellent in their roles. Ice Cube is great and funny as Craig,with Cube playing it straight and real. Chris Tucker is hilarious and excellent in his star making performance as Smokey,with Tucker saying funny lines,talking at fast paced and having great chemistry with Cube. Nia Long is wonderful and sexy as Debbie,Craig's love interest. Tiny 'Zeus' Lister Jr. is menacing and great as Deebo,the neighborhood bully. John Witherspoon is funny as always as Mr.Jones, Jones,Craig's Father. Faizon Love(Big Worm),Anthony Johnson(Ezal),Regina King(Dana),Anna Maria Horsford(Mrs. Jones),Paula Jai Parker(Joi),Bernie Mac(Pastor Clever),DJ Pooh(Red),Yvette Wilson(Rita),Ronn Riser(Stanley),Angela Means(Felisha),Kathleen Bradley(Mrs. Parker),Tony Cox(Mr. Parker),Demetrius Navarro(Hector),Jason Bose Smith(Lil' Chris)and Vickilyn Reynolds(Joann)give fun performances as well.The direction by F.Gary Gray is simple,yet great with Gray pointing and shooting,but at the same time still moving the camera and giving the film an a great energy and pace. Great direction,Gray.The score by Frank Fitzpatrick,Simon Franglen and Chuck Wild is is great and memorable and fits with the film's tone. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs from Dr. Dre(Keep Their Heads Ringin),Ice Cube(Friday),The Isley Brothers(Trying' To See Another Day)as well as classics from Curtis Mayfield(Freddie's Dead,Little Child,Running Wild),The Temptations(The Way You Do Things You Do),James Brown(Get Up(I Feel Like Being A Sex Machine),Rose Royce(I Wanna Get Next To You),Rick James(Mary Jane)and War(Low Rider)and other great songs Excellent soundtrack.In final word,if you love Comedy films,Urban films,Stoner films,Hip-Hop,Rap or films in general, I highly suggest you see Friday,a classic Comedy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My feelings towards the movie "Friday" is excitement. The film's quality and enjoyment level is high. It's not quite a family movie but it has adult fun in it. The film, which stars a cast of great African American actors such as Ice Cube, Chris Tucker, John Witherspoon and Bernie Mac, was directed by Gary Gray.A young man who just lost his job gets the help of his best friend to make a quick buck. But this experience is not what either of them expected to go through. They are hassled, hustled, chased, robbed and beat up but still stuck together. The comedy level in this film is through the roof. A true classic movie at its best, the lessons taught in the movie are also good. Ice Cube, who played Craig, was the main actor. His portrayal of a young man who just lost his job and has the pressure of his family on his back was great. Craig's friend in the movie was Smokey, Co-starred by Chris Tucker. His role was to be the joke telling, crazy, loose cannon friend we all have. The films use of small side stories and background stories into the key actor's lives was an eye opener for the viewer. It gave the plot depth and stability. The music choices weren't that important into the story, there really wasn't a soundtrack to the film. Even though this was a comedy, the few serious or important moments were enhanced so that the viewer would sense the importance of that scene.I personal recommend this movie to all who likes adult comedy. This film is a classic and its sequels even deserve a chance. Also the turn at the end is one to remember. My overall feeling towards this movie is a great two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most quotable comedy films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie gets better every time I watch it simply because how well it's written. The acting is great for a comedy film and the story is smoothly played out in the course of one day. Friday is one of those films that doesn't try to be obnoxiously funny every second (like Step Brothers) and because of this, it's funnier than most comedy movies that come out today. Also because it is just plain hilarious all around. The actors were chosen wisely and all do their part great. The story is interesting and funny while not being too crazy in order to generate laughs (like The Hangover Part II, which I still love anyway) There isn't much to say about this movie besides the fact that it's hilarious, quotable and overall very memorable. This is like the Pineapple Express of the 90's. So if you're looking for a funny ass movie, go find it and watch it. You wont regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched the movie 15 years after its release and enjoyed it to its bone. Rent it and watch it in the late afternoons of the summer kind of a movie. The characters in the movie are real funny and the actors have done a good job. Personally i feel this is one of the funniest black movie of all times.Chris's character has pulled off the movie, a smoke head getting in all sorts of trouble not as Chong but saner and much more funnier. This is one of the movies that you want to watch again and again. Ice Cube has done a great job with the script. With a serious situation on the hands of ghetto guys where one is doped and care free, and the other unlucky, find out ways to sort one problem after the other.I don't understand why Chris hasn't done more films, good actor, not bad at all. You watch this and you go to the store looking for more of Chris to find almost nothing except Rush Hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie that introduced me to Chris Tucker casts him and Ice Cube as a pair of ghetto guys trying to bum their way through life. "Friday" manages to keep the perfect balance of serious look at the grimness of a ghetto existence, and hilarious gag-fest. Much of the movie has the two friends getting high while trying to think of how to pay a drug dealer $200 by 10 pm. But there's just a lot of really funny stuff every step of the way. You're sure to love it. Because I'm not just f**king with you.Also starring Nia Long, Tommy Lister Jr, John Witherspoon, Anna Maria Horsford, Regina King, Tony Cox, Bernie Mac, Lawanda Page (Aunt Esther on "Sanford and Son") and a brief appearance by Michael Clarke Duncan. Director F. Gary Gray later directed "The Negotiator" and "The Italian Job".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best 90's Ghetto Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Friday is a clever movie about the funny side of life in the hood. I think it's probably one of Chris Tuckers funniest movies he's been in besides Rush Hour. Ice Cube is also great in it and did a good job with the screenwritng also. I like how the movie is about how one laid back Friday turns into a huge disaster. Some people call this a stoner movie but it's more of a mixed comedy with ghetto jokes, stoner jokes and laid back humour. I think that this movie is probably one of the funniest movies of the 90's. it's also a comedy classic too of all times. You don't have to be black to see this movie. Friday is a movie that everyone can enjoy except young children. There are some great memorable catch phrases also in Friday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got around to watching this movie because my friends kept on bugging me and bugging me about not watching it! So I borrowed it from my buddy and sat down with my girlfriend to watch it.First of all, the thing I noticed about it was that there was alot of pot smoking. I do not do that myself however I am not against it. It's all good as they say. But, again, this film didn't make me laugh as much as say....a Cheech and Chong flick. The Cheech and Chong movies did this 20 years ago and did it way better!There were a few laughs in it however. Chris Tucker can get quite annoying with that yappy voice after a while. Ice Cube's father in the movie (John Witherspoon) was absolutely hilarious and probably was the only character in the movie to make me laugh the most. All in all, the ending was pretty satisfying and I think I'll give Next Friday a chance. Like I said, I hope it's the start of a better weekend, if you catch my drift.</fullReview>

The film is set in a 'hood in LA..and as the title points out, it depicts a day in the two character's lives. The main two characters are Craig (Ice Cube) and Smokey (Chris Tucker) who are two pals. Now, I'm not going to tell you anything that happened, but trust me - I was laughing so much, my stomach hurt from start to finish - it is that funny.If you liked any of Chris Tucker's films you will love this one.

		<shortDescription>No Ghetto in "Friday"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, the movie is great but I will not expound on that. I would like to comment on the error that so many contributors to this forum have made--that the "hood" portrayed in "Friday" was a "ghetto". That, it was not. What it was, was a respectable, black, middle-class suburban neighborhood. There was NEVER any scene in which graffiti was visible, NO dilapidated buildings or "projects", NO trash or abandoned vehicles in the streets. Unlike an inner-city ghetto, the neighbors took care of--and pride in--their lawns. None of the houses need paint jobs. The family was fully intact and both parents tried to instill wholesome values in their son Craig. Both parents were employed and Craig's mother drove a late model Volvo.Obviously, those who think Craig and Smokey's "hood" was a ghetto have never seen a real one. Sure, compared to Beverly Hills (CA), Westchester County (NY), Upper NW Washington (DC)/Chevy Chase (MD), etc. it could be considered lower class but CERTAINLY NOT any "ghetto".</fullReview>

And that's just about it.While this film is simple I enjoyed and laughed frequently. The neighborhood has a lot of colorful Characters and Chris Tucker steals the whole show. Sorry this one is short but There is just not a lot to write about this film.Rated R For Pervasive Strong Language And Drug Use, And For A Brutal Fight.Theatrical Cut: 1hr 31min/91min.

		<shortDescription>Damn, This is Some Funny *^%$!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of my top five comedies of all time. And where as it has spawned two sequels, nothing beats the original. I love this film first of all because it makes a parody of something which we usually see in films as something dark and very negative: living in the ghetto. Films like "Colors" and "Boys in the Hood" have made somewhat dramas of the depictions of gang life and all that, but this film goes in a different direction. And damn, what audiences get is a well served comedy that had me literally rolling on the floor.Ice Cube and Nia Long star, but the real spot light goes to Chris Tucker, a.k.a. "Smokey". His lines are so well delivered, that the character just grows on you, you know? I can't even begin to quote this film because these reviews have to be pleasant and non-vulgar, but damn, this is some funny *^%$!! Also in this movie is Tommy Lister, the neighborhood thug, so to speak and the scene where Red wants his bike back has to be one of the funniest ever!! Probably one of my favorite scenes. John Witherspoon also appears, and he too will have you laughing your ass off! A real comedy classic if you ask me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People tend to overlook this but this portrayal of south central los angeles is exactly how los angeles is. it displays the fun part of living there and it displays the horrible part of living there. This movie is a laugh out loud movie. Smokey keeps you smiling even through dramatic situations. Ice Cube, Regina King, and Nia Long have collaborated before and have done once again in this outrageous movie. You may think that the any movie named Friday must be stupid. On the contrary Friday is a funny movie that is enjoyable to watch. Friday is one of those movies where the person is like "Have you seen Friday" and the other guy says "Who hasn't seen that movie?" Everyone has this movie because it is a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit degrading, but still I have to admit that I laughed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My sister lent me this movie and told me how funny it was. I even told her that I'm not really into those ghetto type of comedies, that it's a bit racist or stereotype, she's the same way too, but she said that I simply had to see this movie. If I loved Chris Tucker that I should definitely enjoy this movie.Well, I have to admit that I got more than a few laughs during this film. Especially from Chris Tucker and Ice Cube, they made a great comedic team. Basically, they owe a drug dealer $200.00 and they owe it by Saturday. The problem is that Ice Cube just lost his job and Chris never really had a job. Ice Cube also has a girl who has a major crush on him and he likes her back, but he also has a bit of a jealous girl who is after any girl who likes her man. The funniest scene in this movie, even though it is kind of insulting, is Chris's blind date with "Janet Jackson". His reaction is priceless.You'll have to see the movie to understand what I'm saying. So actually I would recommend this movie, unless you are highly sensitive. But still, just let go and have fun, you can do that easily with Chris Tucker's brilliant comedy.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie back when I was 15 and I can still remember how hard I laughed all through this movie. It has a simplistic storyline but so what!!! The comedy is continuous and I can never recall a bad time to watch this movie.Chris Tucker (Smokey) is hilarious. This movie literally made me fall in love with him. Okay, maybe that's a bit much but my point is that his performance in this movie is hysterical. Ice Cube (Craig) did an awesome job too.Two brotha's hanging out, getting into trouble, and clowning around on an average day. Just light-hearted laughter, for no reason, is sometimes all a person needs.This remains one of my favorite comedy movies to this day...11 years later. Who doesn't still talk about Debo or quote lines from this movie? You can quote anyone from this movie and I bet whoever you're talking to would know what you are talking about.There's nothing corny about this movie...just straight laughs and enjoyment. Yeah, it's about weed but you'll be laughing so hard that you won't even care. If you haven't seen it...you're missing out!!!</fullReview>

You know, the kind of laughter that creates six packs in the abdomen? For a couple of years this movie actually created a bias in my mind toward other similar comedies! They could'nt live up to "Friday"! They could'nt make me laugh like "Friday"! What a depressing time. It would have been fun if F. Gary Gray would have been on board for the sequels. They lacked the time spacing of the original movie. HIGHly recommended! HIGHly!</fullReview>

Beyond that, see for yourself. i couldn't stop laughing when smokey had to go number 2, basically couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie. next Friday isn't as funny, and Friday after next is no comparison, rarely have sequels surpast their original, and this isn't one. so,relax, put on the movie, sit back, and begin to laugh. i loved this movie... 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing' gets funnier than watching Friday on a pot binge. This movie is great. it was a favorite of mine a long time ago, and it still is a favorite film of mine. A great cast of characters, some funny situations, and a lot of profane joking around make this a great stoner flick for anyone to watch. Just watching' this takes me back to the good old' days when nobody worried too much about nothing'. My favorite parts are when Smokey needs to use a bathroom, and he has to go outback of his house, and Ezal catches him, then comes out and yells , "Hey! Smokey's back here taking' a s**t!". That makes me crack the f**k up. Then there's the infamous meeting with "Janet Jackson" a.k.a. the Fat, Bald chick. Another funny scene is when they are standing outside at night and they see the convertible slowly going along, then they both look at each other and go , "Drive-by!" That is just funny to me. Anyhow, go see it and laugh your ass off.</fullReview>

Would encourage people to give it a try. Chris Tucker is very funny. I liked it so much would see it again. Basically I thought the premise of just two guys sitting on a front porch would be boring, but in fact, it was quite good. The father of Ice Cube also gives a good performance. Lots of laughs all through the film. I have recommended this film to friends. Good film to watch in a party atmosphere. Just think the film was good entertainment. Thought Chris Tucker made the film, and Ice Cube also did a good job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nice a "black" comedy! I even in delight though always, how many myself I remember, could not suffer "black" comedies (it am simple at them humor very original), but this is pleasant exception. Here, unlike other similar comedies, there is no racism, it is few abuse, even and that authors of film have reduced platitude up to an absolute minimum, perhaps, necessary for such comedies. Very unpretentious and even in something instructive film.Simple guys from black quarter live fast, struggle, as can with local "abrupt", quarrel with parents, get in unpleasant situations, meet girls, try to smoke a grass - all this in current of one day and all very much really. Anything supernatural and especially ridiculous in a picture does not occur, but film amusing, with rude, but pleasant humor, with beautiful girls and very simple plot.All comes to an end, certainly, well, bad guy is beaten, good it leaves with the girl, but not a stamp, it is a natural outcome.Has very much pleased Chris Tucker, on it practically and all rate of film keeps - Chris lights on full! In role Smokey it is simply brilliant - surprisingly plastic, and, as always, is awfully talkative. Ridiculous such goggle-eyed monkey that you will not tell about sustained and serious Ice Cube which I at all I do not know how the actor and which especial has not shown anything.Nice film, I shall look it still.</fullReview>

The best line and i think everyone will agree is: "You Got Knocked The F**K OUT!" I recommend this to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crude, but often amusing day in the hood comedy. Ice Cube stars as a chronic slacker living in the rough, truculent, but occasionally risible neighborhood of South Central Los Angeles, plagued with the anxieties of finding a job, pleasing his parents, and trying to survive after his homeboy (an over-the-top Tucker) gets him caught up in drugs and mayhem on an anything but typical Friday afternoon. This probably would have worked a lot better with an actual plot, but there are plenty of laugh-out loud moments, and a talented, enthusiastic cast. A respectable and insightful look at an unexplored side of the typical gangster/hood genre. **?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by: F. Gary Gray. Written by: Ice Cube and D.J. Pooh. Starring: Ice Cube and Chris Tucker. Co-Starring: Nia Long, Tom "Tiny" Lister, and John Witherspoon.Favorite line: "How the hell you gonna get fired on your day off?!"*******WARNING: Possible spoilers ahead*******Friday is a personal triumph of mine because I took the gamble and watched it in the theatre. At the time I thought it was funny (not as funny as Ace Ventura), but over time this has been a cult movie everywhere I've worked, making it even funnier. At least two or three times a week someone will quote a line from the movie, and some of us (ok, me) have even memorized the whole thing. Friday came about because Boyz In The Hood and Menace II Society portrayed ghetto life as bleak and hopeless, and according to Ice Cube not all of it was. He felt that Hollywood was afraid to show the good times and was on a mission to show us all that life in the hood could be fun.Plot/Story: The plot to Friday is so basic that there really isn't one in the normal sense of the word. The plot was this: show a typical Friday in South Central LA. That's it. Or so one would think, but it's really a buddy film standard cleverly disguised. Most buddy film plots go like this: meet the hero (Craig), meet the bad guy (Deebo), meet the goofy sidekick/buddy (Smokey!), meet the hero's love interest (Debbie) and watch as they go on a wild adventure to discover themselves (Smokey and Craig sit on Craig's porch and smoke weed all day), the hero kicks the bad guy's butt (Craig smacks Deebo with a brick and knocks him da f*** out!) and there you have it. The plot is fun and very flexible, much like Clerks they move from scene to scene in a variety of places, but the majority of the action takes place in one spot (Craig's porch), because it's Friday and they ain't got s*** to do.Acting: Surprisingly Ice Cube puts in a solid performance and Chris Tucker is absolutely hilarious as Smokey, playing his best role to date. Lister isn't the greatest actor in the world, but the big crazy bad guy is his specialty (typecast) and he does a great job here. John Witherspoon is a riot and essentially plays the on screen version of his comedy routine. The acting in general is by no means the greatest, but the stars tend to make up for this.Characters: Smokey has to be one of my top five all-time favorite movie characters, funny, funny, funny! Mr. Jones (Craig's dad) probably makes it into my top 20. Between the two of them are a number of classic scenes (Smokey running down the street and smoking angel dust, or Mr. Jones chastising Craig for eating all the food). Other hilarious characters are Felisha (Debbie's crackhead sister, who in fact has a hilarious scene that was cut where she asks Craig if she can borrow his microwave), or Ezal, the crazy homeless person that catches Smokey taking a crap outside. You can't help but laugh at the antics of the characters as they make their way through a "typical day."Effects/Setting: The setting looks authentic enough to me, but being of a lighter complexion I really wasn't welcome in those neighborhoods when I lived out west so I can't say how "real" it was. Doesn't matter, though, the setting's name is more important than the setting.Score/Soundtrack: If you're a hip-hop/classic soul fan and you don't have the soundtrack then someone should kick your butt. The soundtrack to Friday is one of the best soundtracks ever released. There are no collaborations, and with the exception of the classic soul songs, all of the songs are original and can only be found on this album (or on the artist's greatest hits album). In fact it contains one of the funniest comic book songs to date with Funkdoobiest's "Superhoes." Truly classical stuff.I love Friday, maybe more so than most because I've been reciting lines from it for forever now and applying them to all kinds of situations. Hell I'm still waiting for the chance to see someone get clocked cold just so I can get in their face and tell them they got knocked the f*** out! Nostalgia, maybe, but Friday truly is a classic movie that was written brilliantly by Ice Cube and is often overlooked as one of the best comedies of the 90s. You can't go wrong, when I meet people who haven't seen it; I drag them to my place and pop it in the DVD. Never had a person dislike it yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend of mine bought this movie a few days ago and, out of sheer boredom, I sat down and watched it with him. I was VERY surprised to find it an excellent film. While not going for any themes loftier than self-respect, self-discipline, and the physics of smoking A LOT of pot, this is a very entertaining and hilarious movie. Ice Cube's script is extremely quoteable and serves as great fodder for Chris Tucker's loud-mouth persona. I also enjoyed the fact that while most films dealing with life in the "hood" are dark and depressing, this film is able to tell a similar story, of two guys trying not to get killed by a drug dealer they owe money to, with a much lighter attitude. The characters are realistic and the cast playing them has a strong chemistry that supports the story. This very funny movie should be watched and enjoyed by all, regardless of personal backgrounds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just with the title of this movie's name mentioned. It conjures up scenes that made me laugh so hard. In a time of my life when things looked grim. I had just bought my first house for a really cheap price. And after a few months being there. I had invited my friends over to celebrate my good but broke new life. They brought over this movie tucked discreetly under one arm. It was in our minds that this was going to be the last movie for the night. Nobody could say for sure if this movie was going to be good or not. The cover looked cheesy and of poor quality. Ice cube we new well. But everything thing else was saying NO! Don't get bored!! Not Funny!!I too was doing Mary Jane as well at that time in my life. About two years. But had told my friends that I wanted a break. I had just a little (3 ounces) to cover any NEEDS (^_&lt;). We watched Braveheart first. Another great movie to watch. But then came out Friday. This movie really captured a day in the life of me and my friends. The daily language used was right on. It also coined the phrase DAAAAMN!! for all of us. The comedic performances by Chris Tucker and Ice was sharp! Especially Chris. He really made his career with that movie. Because I have seen everyone one of his later films just to see a glimmer of "Smokey" in them. And he hasn't let me down yet! The way the movie flowed on the screen was flawless. Every character was well played and unforgettable. So this movie came at a great point in my life. I can still sit with my popcorn in one hand and laugh my Butt off. The "Next Friday" the sequel was good. And also had it's moments. But it is nothing without Smokey. Make another with him. Pleaseeee!By the way, after the movie we sang with the stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best comedies I have ever seen. The jokes are funny as hell. The cast is the best that could be chosen. The scenes are perfectly shot for that kind of comedy. So what do we got here. Ice Cube plays Craig Jones, an afro American with normal life. He lives in a peaceful neighborhood. His best friend is Someky who is played by Christ Tucker, who is famous with Rush Hour. So Smokey is an eccentric person but the biggest problem, is that he owns money to a guy, he has messed with. And he is with Craig, so Craig gets messed up as well. Another problem appears to be Deebo who is a bad guy with bad mood, with big sizes and a talented criminal. He is another problem for Craig and Smokey. Our famous names, are Bernic Mac as a priest. Tony Cox is here and his character is so funny, no matter that he appears in only 1 scene. Craig's father is funny as hell and he appears in many scenes. He is played by John Whiterspoon. There are some chicks as well. The movie is kind of a satire like Napoleon Dynamite for example. It shows the everyday life seen through the eyes of a couple average American citizens. There is no doubt that it is the best from the trilogy, one of the best movies of 1995 and no, I am not joking at all. I forgot to mention that the movie is atmoshperic. At least for me and atmospheric movies, are always in my list called "I will watch it again". Watch it. It is not only entertainment. At least for me. It is in my all time Top 50 movies of all time which means that it takes place in my Top 10 Comedies of all time. I gave it an excellent 10.</fullReview>

The way people who live down there were portrayed in the movie was very accurate. Chris Tucker cracks me up in any movie he's in, and Ice Cube is just all-around talented. I make it a point to take this movie out and play it at least once a month. For those who haven't seen "Friday", you have to see it, but remember, make sure to watch all three Friday movies in order, as all the movies progress in order.

		<fullReview>WARNING: I will talk about some scenes. I must say this movie is funny and all about drama &amp; comedy. This movie is the classic in the hood with drugs. The fight scene with Craig and Dee-Bo, now i call that drama. I love Chris tucker, man. He is funny as hell. Too bad he wasn't on the other sequel. Dee-Bo is awesome he is very strong and can beat people up very hard. All they do is sit on Craig's Porch, smoking weed, need to pay the owner's weed $200 or they will kill them, Avoid Dee-Bo from getting hurt and taking their valuable stuff (gold watch, and other stuff). "Friday" is populated with stand-up comedians and sitcom veterans (including LaWanda Page as a foul-mouthed church lady). Chris Tucker is also an experienced comedian, which allows him to carry the film. As for Ice Cube, he's funny precisely because he's not a comedian. In his dramatic roles, Cube's raised eyebrows usually unleashed a fearsome glare and a hint of danger; here, his expressions are more quizzical, amused or confused. He plays against type, just as the movie itself plays against hype. I would give this movie a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is popular with a lot of people for its funny lines and funny actors.I have to admit when i saw it i really hated it! I couldn't see were the film was going and it was becoming obvious that this film was going nowhere and it didn't have a plot.But the performance from Chris Tucker single-handedly made me LOVE THIS FILM! I thought it was hilarious when watching it! I especially liked Ice Cubes father. " You'll have to wait 30-40 minutes before going inside that bathroom " Love it!Although it was obvious a lot of the characters couldn't act if there life depended on it you forget all that. The lines, characters and "plot" make up for that easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the simplest but best ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Friday is one of the best films I have ever seen. It has such a simple easy feel about it, at no point does the film try too hard to be funny with cheap gags or silly stunts, it just flows along nicely. The film is about a day in the life of two young black Americans in the suburbs of LA, Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and Smokey (Chris Tucker), who are superb in their own ways. The supporting cast feed off brilliantly, Craig's dad (John Witherspoon) is equally humorous. Craig loses his job because he is accused of stealing, so his friend Smokey decides he's gonna get him high. Unfortunately, Smokey is so addicted to weed that he smokes up what he was supposed to be selling. He gets himself into some bother with drug-dealer Big Worm (who is one funny dude - check out his orange car with air-suspension and matching seats), the story rolls on as Smokey and Craig try and tackle the problem, as well as steering clear of local thief Deebo. It's a film that you can sit and watch over and over - every time you see it you will find yourself laughing at something different, Excellent film, excellent charactersand you know this, MAN!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is pure JOKES!If there is any film guaranteed to make everyone watching LOL at least once,its Friday.Its a film that takes a much more light hearted look at ''life in da hood'',but still manages to have enough serious stuff to not be just an all out spoof in the vein of Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinkin your Juice in the Hood.(also worth checking though.The humour comes from an absolutely knock out script,performed by a a great comedic cast.Chris Tucker is at his loudmouth best as Smokey,cursing,cussing and ripping his way through the film at a speed of 90 words per minute.Superb.Ice Cube demonstrates his gift for delivery doesn't stop at hip hop lyrics,with a subtle,under played performance as Craig,the much quieter and more streetwise counterpart to Smokey.But it is John Witherspoon as Mr Jones that steals the show.He has less scenes than Craig or Smokey but every scene he has,his lines are the funniest,right from the opening credits,where hes sleeping,quite obviously dreaming about his great love....no not Mrs Jones but hotsauce,''Gimme a two piece special,lots of hot sauce,and..all the fries you can give me''.LOL.The first scene see him in (not including the opening credits),the way he appears behind the fridge door,to surprise Craig with a early morning lecture is funny as.The story is quite engrossing,with enough great characters and dialogue to keep the film moving a at a good pace.Its one of those movies where you don't realise two hours or so have passed while you're watching it,which is such a rare thing.Even most of the ''classic''films have segments(tiny in some cases)that drag a bit,but Friday doesn't.The villain of the piece,Deebo,is believable and at times funny too.The story is well played out and straightforward too,but not so much so that it gets boring.I must have watched this film a 1000 times and i still laugh loud at least four times.fantastic comedy,the only adults who wont enjoy this are boring prudes who cant abide swearing and drug references(YES i DO mean YOU BBFC!!)9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe Chris Tucker turned down the role for Smokey in the sequel of this movie, that's a total drag. His character probably makes the movie, with his high-pitched voice and funny catch-lines such as.. "And you know this, MAN".Not only is this movie funny, it also gets you in the mood to get horribly high because they look like they're having A LOT of fun smoking weed haha.. I've seen the sequel and don't like it as near as much as this movie.. I still haven't seen Friday After Next, but I doubt it'll be as funny and likable as this movie. If you're into movies with little plot, but they're probably going to make you laugh anyway, you should watch this.. It reminds me of a lesser serious verious of Boyz N Tha Hood, but not as much of a parody as the Wayan's brother's "Don't be a Menace".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FRIDAY is not only funny and cool, but also pretty smart, unlike NEXT FRIDAY, which is just a good excuse for slapstick comedy. This movie had some element to it, and wasn't just after the funny bone. Chris Tucker got a real career boost after this movie, going on to make RUSH HOUR, another funny and clever comedy. I think it also helped Ice Cube come out of the dark image he was in for a long time, and showed he could be a calm, cool, and funny guy. You could say this film is a black equivalent to "SLC Punk".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is worth watching just for the hilarious and infectious interplay between Chris Tucker and Ice Cube.i've always wanted a movie to be made that didn't present the 'hood's bad points but instead had a more optimistic approach that showed how the 'hood isn't any different from most american neighborhoods.the simple plot gets a ton of mileage from the whole cast with John Witherspoon as Ice Cube's father being absolutely side splittingly funny. i also loved Tom Lister Jr.'s work as the neighborhood bully Deebo and Faizon Love is perfect as the drug dealer Big Worm (of was that Big Perm?)the ONLY place where the film slips is the ending sequence which takes a sharp left turn from comedy into moody melodrama but as a whole this film is well done from all aspects.a great comedy that finally shows a more optimistic view of life in the 'hood.rating:8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Friday was a good comedy to come out in the midst of Menace II Society, Boyz N The Hood, New Jersey Drive, etc. Unlike the urban dramas out, this is a movie that shows that people in the ghettos do have fun - and this I do know from personal experiences in my life. A well-casted movie for one, Ice Cube shows that he can hold his own in a comedy which at the time I wasn't expecting that from him as he just came off of Tresspass and Higher Learning; Chris Tucker introduces himself to the silver screen and acts a total fool(which is a good thing, he's known for it anyway), plus Bernie Mac and Faizon Love contribute with their own comedic performances making the ride worth-while... F. Gary Gray successfully blends realistic situations and humor make this movie a classic comedy and a very fun ride...One of those movies that can easily cheer you up</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The very first time I heard about this film was when I was spending some time with my grandmother when I was younger and she told me that she had got a new movie called Friday. I had nothing else to do, and neither did she so, we pulled out Friday and watched it. Even, though this film does have a lot of language that is pervasively strong spoken. It is still funny due to the fact on how they say it. Now, yes the language might be alittle too strong. But, mainly in my opinion the drug material was pretty unnecessary. And, last time I heard Chris Tucker who plays Smokey, (Craig's friend) refused to return in the two films because he did not want to play a drug dealer. Anyway, Ice Cube as he's called plays Craig who's out of job and has absolutely nothing to do. Except, smoke weed with Smokey, beat up a bratty little kid from knocking over trash cans overthrew, hiding his priced possessions from a thug named Deebo, and keep Smokey from smoking the weed he's supposed to be selling for a guy named "Big Worm", before they "both end up dead meat. Anyway, despite the fowl stuff this film is still pretty good and funny. I would recommend this film to any Comedy lovers out there. This film is a good one. I give it "7". But, before watching it pay attention to the rating. (R) And also why it's rated that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This thing doesn't even try to be funny. It's not tragic. It's not comedy. It's not anything. It's one thing for a movie to try to be funny and miss the mark, but this waste of celluloid doesn't even try. There is literally not one single line in this movie worth remembering. No setups. No punch lines. No antics. Nothing. The whole movie tries to ride on Chris Rocks goofball character but he doesn't actually do anything but sit around, get high, and jabber about nothing. Ice Cubes character is as dull as a doorknob and as flat as Kansas. I've seen wallpaper that was more entertaining than this waste of perfectly good oxygen. It couldn't have taken more than five minutes to write assuming it wasn't made up on the fly ("OK. You guys sit there and ...uh... smoke a joint and.. uh.. I know! Talk about booty or something!!"). It's a good thing Chris Rock found Rush Hour. If this movie had set his career he'd be doing standup at an Elks club in Indiana.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot can, and does, go down between Thursday and Saturday, in "Friday"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1995's "Friday" is one of the best comedies to feature an entirely black cast of actors from the '90s. "Friday" has been a long-time personal favorite of mine since about 1999 - four years after this film's original 1995 theatrical release and just one year before the release of its sequel "Next Friday" (2000).Following in the footsteps of neo-blaxploitation 'hood movies from the early '90s, "Friday" is somewhat of a parody of films such as "Boyz N the Hood" (1991) and "Menace II Society" (1993), but with a Cheech &amp; Chong-styled, urban stoner twist. It comes in between the seriousness of "Boyz" and "Menace" (but before the 'hood-movie silliness of 1996's "Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood") and the PC 21st-century preachiness of Tyler Perry. But that doesn't mean that "Friday" still isn't saying SOMETHING meaningful. In its own unique, un-preachy way, "Friday" critiques the (still-relevant) epidemic of unemployment in the black community while also throwing wickedly pointed barbs at U.S. drug laws (particularly as they pertain to marijuana).A Lot Can And Does Go Down Between Thursday And Saturday in "Friday," which marked the big-screen debut of former music video director F. Gary Gray. On one particularly eventful Friday in South Central Los Angeles, recently unemployed Craig Jones (rapper Ice Cube) wakes up with no job, nowhere to go, and nothing to do. The plot is pretty thin as he and best bud Smokey (hilarious Chris Tucker) observe the goings-on in their neighborhood and all of the film's colorful cast of neighborhood characters. Things get really going when Smokey suddenly becomes indebted to local drug dealer Big Worm (Faizon Love) for $200 after smoking up the same merchandise that he was supposed to be selling, which also leads to a violent ending confrontation with towering neighborhood bully Deebo (Tiny "Zeus" Lister, Jr.)."Friday" really does breeze through its plot and characters and does so with a funny, laugh-a-minute script penned by none other than Ice Cube himself and co-screenwriter DJ Pooh (who also appears in the film as Craig's co-worker Red). Chris Tucker's Smokey seems to get the best laughs and one-liners here. With his nasal, high-pitched voice and manic mannerisms, he proves to be a reliable comic foil to Ice Cube's more level-headed Everyman Craig and is the film's comedic centerpiece. John Witherspoon brings a seasoned maturity to his role as Craig's Dad, a hilarious cameo by the late Bernic Mac as Pastor Clever is perfectly timed, and Nia Long livens up any scene she appears as the girl next door Debbie.Since F. Gary Gray is a former music video director making his big debut here, the movie does also have a wonderful hip-hop/'70s soul soundtrack that features Ice Cube himself, Dr. Dre (still riding high at the time on the popularity of his trademarked "G"-funk sound), Cypress Hill, Scarface (of Geto Boys), Mack 10 and 2 Live Crew, plus old-school funk/R &amp; B talents such as the late Rick James, Bootsy Collins &amp; Bernie Worrell, and The Isley Brothers. Such a selection of artists proves he knows his black music very well.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Rebecca Black Made Friday Uncool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Proof positive that you don't need a big budget and special effects to make a great movie. "Friday" is all about comedy, the characters, and great storytelling.This movie is a classic comedy that stars Ice Cube, John Witherspoon, Nia Long, the late Bernie Mac, Regina King, Anna Maria Horsford and Chris Tucker in his breakthrough role as Smokie. It follows a day (Friday) in the life of Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and his best friend Smokie, who in my opinion, steals the show. This is the movie that would define the rest of Chris Tucker's career.You know that the film is low-budget, but F. Gary Gary's experience as video director shows here with his ability to tell a story on a small budget. The pace of the movie is flawless, as we me from one funny incident to the next. All the elements of the subplots get intertwined together for the climax of the film. It's executed brilliantly.I have this movie in my DVD collect and have seen it at least two dozen times. I know all the words to the dialogue by heart. It's just that good! The two sequels to this film, "Next Friday" and "Friday After Next" were bigger box office hits, but they also had bigger budgets. Still, these two pale in comparison to the original when it comes to great movie making. Not even Rebecca Black can foul this "Friday".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much can happen on a Friday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Craig (Ice Cube) is really having a bad time. He just lost his job and there's nothing to do on a Friday while his sister (Regina King), his father (John Witherspoon) and mother (Anna Maria Horsford) put him down and get on with their daily routine.All that changes on that one Friday when his druggie buddy Smokey (a Hilarious Chris Tucker) drops by the house where they go through adventures like a typical "Beavis and Butthead" episode from encountering peddlers and bullies, checking out women, and hanging out in Craig's front lawn where anything is possible on a Friday. It all changes after Smokey influences Craig to smoke marijuana where things start to happen up front from the two of them getting involved in schemes by the neighborhood bully/thief (Tommy Lister) to Craig hearing from Smokey that he owns a drug thug money or else they're going to do a drive by in the neighborhood to seeing a minister having an affair with the luscious Ms. Parker before her husband comes home to kick her out; Craig even falls in love with a neighbor her age (Nia Long) where maybe something might happen if many people weren't interrupting him.The film is funny, but the highlight is an early Chris Tucker portraying the drug addict where he steals every scene from his first appearance to the last making this film the funniest from the franchise where the rest of the movies without his character happen to fall down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of Chris Tucker. To me, he is annoying, loud, obnoxious and unoriginal: Eddie Murphy had been doing the stuff way before Chris, but with much more originality and inventiveness. Let's face it, Chris Tucker is nowhere near as funny as Eddie Murphy had been in his prime(i.e., Eddie Murphy of post-SNL and pre-Boomerang). That said, I really liked this film. There is a certain laid-back hipness to the film that is very charming and engaging. To me, it is Ice Cube's character, somewhat detached and cool, that helps carry the film.The film focuses on the events of a single day in a predominantly black neighborhood as seen primarily through the eyes of Ice Cube. It is entertaining to see how, in the course of a single day, Ice Cube's character unwittingly falls into a variety of situations that are not of his making. And as much as I dislike Chris Tucker, I found myself enjoying the rapport his character has with Ice Cube's character. Chris' wise-cracking ways work well with the laid-back, always bemused and slightly cynical Ice Cube.And I liked the way the film puts these characters in what we perceive as stereotypically "black" situations(without exploiting such situations in negative ways), and allows the characters to have enough street-smarts and ingenuity to, basically, survive the day. In short, Friday is a real funny film.Unfortunately, the two sequels to this film are real turkeys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] 8:30 AM, Friday morning, Craig Jones awakens and pours himself a bowl of cereal but finds they're out of milk. His mother and father tell him to use water. It looked like a long boring day for Craig because he got fired from his job the previous day. (His day off!) His father was a dog catcher and he wanted Craig to go into that business, but he declined. Craig's girlfriend Joi called to accuse Craig of going to the movies with another girl which he claimed he didn't do. Soon Mom and Dad go off to work and then Craig's friend Smokey stops over. The two hang out and Smokey tells Craig the time Deebo, a big, mean neighborhood bully stole Red's bicycle and gave him a bad, black eye. Craig and Smokey also chase after Lil Chris for knocking over garbage cans. Craig had been asked by his old man to find a job that day but he didn't think he would so he and Smokey go to the store to buy Smokey's mom some cigarettes. When they return, a loan shark, Big Worm, pulls up and reminds Smokey that he owes him $200, which Smokey didn't have. Then along came Pastor Clever who was attracted to Mrs. Parker and they two go in the house. Soon after, one of Smokey's nemesises, Hector, pulls up. Smokey had a bad pot smoking experience with them. Deebo rode up on Red's bicycle then and had Smokey help him rob a house. They spent most of the time arguing but Deebo claimed he got $200. Then he left. Smokey then proceeded to do what he was know for: smoke a joint. Then their friend Debbie's sister, Felisha, arrived and asked to borrow Smokey's car which was definitely out of the question. It seemed as though she was always out to get something. Well, Mr. Parker wasn't too pleased to see Pastor Clever and Mrs. Parker getting it on so he chased Clever off his property. Smokey talked Craig into getting high with him. Craig takes a puff and suddenly hallucinates. Suddenly, Smokey finds he has to go to the bathroom and his mama wasn't home so he squatted at the side of the house. Unfortunately, Ezal, a street hustler, happened by and saw it all. Debbie stops by Craig's house soon around the time Craig's father comes home from work. He had been bitten in the buttox by a dog. Debbie agreed to hook Smokey up with a friend of hers, Rita, who described herself over the phone as looking like Janet Jackson. Smokey was excited. Rita would drop by at 7:30. Big Worm returned to the neighborhood shortly and told Smokey that unless he had his money by 10:30, he would kill him and Craig. As the evening approached, Smokey and Craig finally managed to teach Lil Chris a thing or two. Deebo stopped by again and went to "get it on" with Felisha. Smokey, remembering Deebo had $200 on him, sneaked into the bedroom to get it but that big mouth Ezal stopped by and nearly blew Smokey's cover. Deebo left soon after and Felisha exited the house with a black eye. Deebo was known for beating his women. Soon, Rita arrived. She wasn't exactly what Smokey pictured: she was overweight and he immediately called it quits. Deebo returned soon and Craig decided to stand up to him, although Deebo was pretty big. Craig drew his gun and was about to shoot Deebo when he remembered his father telling him that using a gun don't make you a man, but using your fists does so Craig engaged in a violent battle with Deebo and Craig won! Deebo lay unconscious on the lawn. Red took back his bicycle along with his grandmother's necklace that Deebo had stolen. As for Craig, he and Debbie got close because he had called it quits with Joi earlier. As for Smokey, he promised Big Worm the money then decided to go into rehab...Yeah right! This movie was pretty good. It was funny! Ice Cube and Chris Tucker were good together! Bernie Mac, Nia Long and Tony Cox are here too! Was followed by Next Friday and Friday After Next. Unfortunately, Chris Tucker wasn't in any of them. Hopefully Smokey will return for a future Friday movie. So if you like punk gang movies and movies about life in the hood, then Friday is for you! It's got lot's of strong language which is what made it so funny.-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Friday' is probably the funniest movie I have ever seen. I admit, I did not bother to see it at the theater. I figured it would be another silly movie about absolutely nothing. Actually, it is! My sister purchased a copy when it went to video and loaned it to me. I let the movie sit on my entertainment center for nearly two weeks until she nagged me to watch it.As soon as the movie was over, I had to rewind it and watch it again! I immediately bought my own copy. My family, friends and I each had our own copy and all of us knew the entire dialogue.When my family visited one weekend, I let everyone watch 'Friday'. My grandmother absolutely loved it! She kept referring to Chris Tucker's character as "the little guy who doesn't have a job and is always telling everyone else what to do." I ended up purchasing a copy for her, which she watched faithfully.I introduced 'Friday' to a white male friend of mine. He is quite a clown anyway, and he enjoyed the movie so much that he bought his own copy! He lives in a predominantly white community and did not have to report to work until 3PM. Since the rest of his family was at work/school, he would put the movie on everyday and turn up the volume while he showered! He also knew the entire dialogue from beginning to end. He refers to my 2-year-old nephew as Lil Smokey!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny as hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Friday is about Craig and Smokey just chillin out on a Friday. But there's a couple of things hampering their fun. One is Smokey owes money to a thug named Big Worm. Two, the neighborhood bully, Deebo, keeps robbing everybody of anything. I definitely loved watching this one. Ice Cube, one of my favorite rappers, gives a great performance. But Chris Tucker as Smokey was just plain hilarious. John Witherspoon is also funny as the patriarch. In other words, this is a funny as hell film. AND YOU KNOW THIS, MAN!!! ****stars.

		<shortDescription>Hilarious!! (Despite the bathroom humor)....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not only hilarious, but it also has some surprisingly redeeming social value. It has an anti-gun violence message in it, which is so important because of the demographic audience this film will appeal to. And although I usually avoid movies that have such base humor as bathroom jokes (maybe you have to be a guy to appreciate those things), if you don't laugh your a** off when you see that midget (excuse me, little person) chasing his unusually tall/hot wife down the steet when he catches her cheating on him, then you probably need to just stay away from comedies all together...because you have no sense of humor.This flick isn't for everyone obviously, given the subject matter involved, but I have to say it's one of the funniest films I've seen since the 1980's. If you haven't seen it yet, rent it, or you can catch it every now and then on the USA Network...On Friday nights, of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ice Cube's introduction to pot. Spoilers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>O'Shea "Ice Cube" Jackson's first movie in the Friday series is a good but not great film about a day in the life of two residents of the bleak South Central Los Angeles a.k.a. City Of Compton. The Cube plays Craig, an unemployed ne'er-do-well who just lost another job and is being warned by his parents to look for work or else be thrown out. His best friend is Smokey (played by Chris Tucker), a pot addict. The film is about a day in the life of these two misfits. Smokey's day could be his last, he owes money to his dealer and if he doesn't have it by the end of the day, he could be toast.The film tries and somewhat succeeds to paint a funny picture in a bleak place that U.S. Presidents avoid talking about when they talk about how great America is. The sight of gated doors, people living on the cheap, and the leery, untrustful nature of this unlit powder keg is interspersed with some hilarious situations. Craig's dad (John Witherspoon) is especially funny as his finger-licking, authoritorian father. Tiny Lister Jr. is a hoot as the local thug who rides a bicycle through Compton. Of course, the eventual $20-25 million a film man Tucker shines here. The Cube delivers his usual workmanlike performance. Of course, I've never visited L.A. and I'm sure the S Clubbers never paid Compton a visit even though Bradley wanted to so badly, but I got the picture that even in the cruel streets of Compton, maybe things aren't always so bad. Also this is the film where Craig gets his marijuana baptism, that's why in the sequel and in next week's new Friday movie he's smoking. Not bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cheezy comedy at it's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the world of film there are the greats, casablanca, citizen cane, The Godfather. Friday is not nearly as good as these movies by it by far one of the funniest movies of the last ten years. Ok, it is cheaply made, it does have a lot of toilet humor, and it lacks a plot. However a good funny movie needs none of these. All it needs is some originality and to know what to examine in it's humor. Friday does both of these wonderfully. The story of two slackers sitting on the front porch on a lazy Friday afternoon seems boring and at times the movie can be quite dull. However anyone who's ever lived in a poor neighborhood and has lost their job can empethise with this movie. It's part of life that maybe not all of us are used to, but nonetheless exists. That's where the humor lies. That and a few good jokes about bodily functions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes FRIDAY so good for me is not only is it very funny, but it is also a very RESPONSABLE comedy, and it makes serious points about neighborhood violence. The climax of the film is GREAT filmmaking, where Ice Cube has a clear moral choice and we actually see both options. As for the pot smoking in the flick, it is simply presented with no moral judgement and (okay, with the exception of seeing the head in the fridge: that's more like LSD) very true to life. Some have complained about how this section is a little slow, with the two just sitting in front of the house stoned, but I like this part because it truly communicates the experience of getting baked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chris Tucker makes Friday a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Friday is my favorite comedy of all time. It should really get a lot of recognition because I have not met anyone who hasn't seen it, and didn't laugh until tears rolled out. This movie is definitely a classic and it's different then most films who showcase the hood with too much violence. This film shows the hood in a fun way and I just love Chris Tucker he is my favorite actor and comedian of all time. Everywhere I go people are always quoting lines from Friday like "And you know this man", or " Said she like Janet Jackson, b*tch got out the car looking like Freddie Jackson". Chris Tucker is just so funny it is unbelievable his high-pitched fast talking voice is what made him as successful as he is today. I love him, all his movies are entertainment and he is always doing something different to challenge himself. He is the only reason why Friday is such a hit and why the sequels do not outdo the original from what I heard. I refuse to watch Next Friday in support of Chris Tucker because Smokey is not in it. Chris Tucker turned down Next Friday because after Rush Hour he gained a lot of kid fans and he realized that if he did do a sequel it would set a bad example for the kids. Back then it was different, he was young then now he is older and putting a lot of thought into his career. He is right Ice Cube should have left it an original because it is a classic as far as I am concerned, but I guess a sequel was a good way to make more bucks, that's good for him , but I am glad Chris Tucker turned down the sequel he knows what it would do for his successful international career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Friday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie with a group of friends at a party once; we got about half way through the movie when the machine ate it and we had to stop it. The next day, I went out to the local Blockbuster and rented "Friday", and I have to say, it is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. A lot of the jokes don't require too much thinking and are just visual such as "the bathroom scene" with Ice Cube and John Whitherspoon, I thought it was a little too much but some of the lines are just instant classics: case in point would be when Ice Cube's girlfriend calls him and accuses him of cheating on her, when he asks her where she got this information, she says "my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy told me she went to the show last night and saw you there..." A line like that is just incredibly funny, but I would have to say, that this movie, definitely could not have survived without Chris Tucker. Tucker's "Smokey" character was what made the movie just interesting to watch because you wanted to see what happened to Smokey and the drug dealer who's chasing him. Watching Smokey smoke as much marijuana as he could and seeing what it did to him was very funny and seeing Craig and him...well...Craig learn from the mistake they made of playing with drug money, actually gave the movie some meaning, not to mention Craig standing up to the woman beating character of Deebo at the end. In short, "Friday" is not just a movie of two guys sitting on a porch in the hood smoking drugs, drinking forties, and trying to get laid, they actually do learn from their mistakes, well, at least one would hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I (finally) saw this flick for the first time a couple days ago, and really enjoyed it. When it came out so many years ago, I shrugged it off as another stupid comedy, but now that I saw it, I found it quite enjoyable...and I'm just a white guy from the suburbs who's never smoked weed in his life. Sure, it had its share of gross humor, but it was also very smart and was shot very well. My only gripe is that they cut the final scene where Craig's dad calls him into the bathroom one more time (which can be seen on the DVD version). It seems a little unresolved without that scene. That aside, it's a great movie, and I'm going to have to wait for Next Friday to come out on video now (though everyone seems to hate it).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And I never get tired of it. Since Next Friday is about to be released I thought I'd add my opinion to the rest of them before the memory of the original is ruined by the sequel.What this film has that so many films don't is originality. It is simply a Friday in the life of two young men with not a lot to do. This is the first place I ever recall seeing Chris Tucker, and he's at the top of his game here. He plays Smokey, a drug dealer that smokes more mary jane than he sells. His main goal is to get Craig (Ice Cube), who doesn't do any drugs, to get high with him since Craig got fired from his job and has nothing else to do.This film takes you places you've never been before, like into the bathroom with Craig's father while he lectures Craig and takes care of bathroom business at the same time. The look on Craig's face is comedy enough. All in all, it's just a bunch of silly episodes that could really happen in a neighborhood, strung together around the premise of how will Craig and Smokey come up with $200 to pay back Big Worm (Faizon Love) for the dope that Smokey smoked instead of selling so they don't get shot.It just plain funny whether you're from the ghetto or not. If you haven't picked this one up yet, it's worth your time...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>outstanding 'hood humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a video that grows on you. At first, I was repelled by the extreme rudeness and hostility, and the stupidity of Smokey, who just couldn't stop smoking the marijuana that had not been paid for. But after watching the film once through, the humorous scenes kept coming back to my mind and I began to understand the context of all that rudeness, hostility and stupidity. Smokey is defying the authority of money, and all the rudeness and hostility is driven by the rule of money, which is quite oppressive in the ghetto.This is such a refreshing change from most other films about the 'hood. Guns are waved, shots are fired, and there are fist fights, but nobody is killed or sent to the hospital, and there are no mothers screaming over their bereavement. There aren't even any police or helicopters. In this movie, violence and threats and rudeness are ridiculed. Religious fundamentalism and prohibitionism are ridiculed as well. If you're a zero-tolerance type who believes that marijuana is the crop of Satan, this movie will surely offend you.In the scene where Debbie, a petite teenage girl, confronts the neighborhood bully not with a weapon or martial arts but with words and a look of determination at close proximity, there is a profound lesson in the de-escalation of violence. It reminds me of Gandhi's followers in the movie Gandhi during their march to the sea to produce salt illegally, how they each stood in line and looked the British soldiers in the eye until they were knocked down, one by one. But you may object that Debbie uses the N-word. Again, consider the context: Debbie's sister Felicia has been punched, her neighbors have done nothing but be afraid of the man who punched Felicia, and the whole confrontation is completely unplanned.If this all sounds too serious to be funny, understand that I have refrained from mentioning any of the humorous details, so as not to spoil it for you. Rest assured, it's as funny as a cigarette lighter in your toilet bowl after eating a big bowl of beans!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the few films I can watch repeatedly and still laugh at. Definitely a cult classic and a MUST OWN on DVD. Some deleted scenes are funnier than the ones in the movie. And this one is not to be outdone by its sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You may never recover from laughing so hard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Friday" is one of the funniest movies I have seen in many years. Ice Cube and D J Pooh have filled a simple movie plot with memorable characters, dialog, and scenes. Chris Tucker continues to amaze me in each of his roles by his comic genius. The scene when Smokey tries to lift some money from Deebo while he's sleeping almost made me pass out from laughing so hard. The whole cast is solid with lots of great supporting actors. There's even some good common sense advice from father to son. I dismissed this movie as one I wouldn't like during it's theatrical release, but rented it after someone I work with recommended it. 8 out of 10 overall. Chris Tucker and some scenes are 10+++!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent comedy featuring Ice Cube and Chris Tucker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good comedy if your the type who likes comedies that aren't too heavy on the slapstick. The fight scene with Greg and Debo was pretty cool too. Who knew so much could happen in just one day? Heh. Chris Tucker once again shines as one of the funniest characters, and Jhonny Witherspoon plays a really funny role. Ice Cube &amp; DJ Pooh really poured thier hearts into writing this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ice Cube and Tucker = good show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Craig Jones (Ice Cube) manages to get fired on his day off and spends the day hanging out with his boy Smokey (Chris Tucker) and trying to avoid his father Mr. Jones (the great John Witherspoon), who wants him to find another job right way. Smokey (a marijuana smoke dog) has even more serious problems; he was given $200 worth of weed to sell by Big Worm (Faizon Love), but he ended up smoking it instead, and if he can't come up with the money by the end of the day, he'll be in a world of hurt Big Worm will put Craig in the same place just for being his friend. And Deebo (Tom "Tiny" Lister, Jr.), a dumb gargantuan bully who roams the neighborhood on his bicycle, has it in for Craig, while Craig tries his best just to stay out of his way. This was the best Ice Cube movie, the sequels aren't near as good simply because "you can't have the Kool-Aid without the sugar" no Chris Tucker equals not so great Friday sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was not much on television on Sunday night, so I was just flipping through the channels and this movie "Friday", which I have avoided for years, was just coming on television. What can I say, Ice Cube and Chris Tucker. Just a lot of fun. Funny, funny, funny. I was cracking up so much, I had to put my hand over my mouth to stop from waking the rest of the house up.It was just stupid funny. Who cares about the acting or the character set up, just a stupid funny movie on the stereotypes of a urban neighborhood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Friday was a great film, which should mean a lot coming from a preppy white boy from the north. It seems that the films central theme is random stabs at humour throughout, but that's far from all Friday is; there is an underlying message here: 'Guns are bad and not worth using, you'll regret it for the rest of your life!' That's what I got out of the show also; granted I already knew that!I bieleve anyone who checks out the film will like it, the plot definetly enrichens at the end and turns out to be definetly worth seeing.Ice cube did a good job and Chris Tucker did a great job, and the supporting characters did well also too; I started to bieleve they actually lived in this neighborhood their whole lives...Job well done: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very funny cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm glad this movie received a cult following, because it really is a very funny comedy that simply shouldn't be analyzed. A plot doesn't exist, nor is this a character-driven vehicle, but it's a wild ride from start to finish. Most of the help comes from the supporting characters. Of course, Chris Tucker steals the show with his landmark role as ultra-pothead Smokey. Tucker has that unrelenting comic energy that only a comedian of supreme talent can possess. Even when the film falls flat, he picks you back up. I also have to commend John Witherspoon, as Ice Cube's father. I loved him on "The Wayans Bros." and I loved him in this movie. Though I was laughing most of the time, the gags are indeed crude--very crude. And sometimes that crudeness just wears out. Luckily, it's not too often, and there are some memorable lines and memorable moments in "Friday." I have this movie in my video collection, and I can always fish it out when in search for a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Friday is a terrible film with virtually no plot and no laughs for that matter. Seriously, this movie has nothing even remotely funny. Not once through this whole film did I find myself laughing. Somebody must have written this script while they were high and had a couple of hours to spare. The film desperately, yet fruitlessly tries to draw out laughs by using farts, people getting punched, and people getting high. Then, at the end the movie tries to tie in a serious theme, and does not do it very well for that matter. It was really out of place and ridiculous in a dumb toilet humor comedy like this one. Friday is truly an awful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Appealing laid-back comedy about life in the inner city.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Friday is a moderately funny movie about one day in the inner city. The film's main two characters are played by rapper/actor Ice-Cube (Boyz in Da Hood, Higher Learning) who also co-wrote it and comedian/actor Chris Tucker (Money Talks, Rush Hour). The two play best friends who spend most of the movie sitting on the porch talking. It sounds boring, but is often quite funny. A story line develops though as Tucker (a heavy drug user) owes money to the local drug dealer and in his excuse for not paying it includes Ice Cube. This causes the drug dealer to demand the money in a few hours or they are both dead. This then allows for some dramatic scenes, including a great one towards the end with Ice Cube and the local bully. Ice Cube is a very likable actor and is good as the calmer and less troublesome of the two friends. Chris Tucker, a favorite of mine, gets to do his hilarious comedy for most of the movie, but does well in a couple of short serious scenes. Good support work is turned in by Nia Long (Soul Food, Love Jones) as the neighbor which Ice Cube has a crush on, Tiny Lister Jr. (The Fifth Element, Jackie Brown) as the menancing bully, and especially from John Witherspoon (Ride, Vampire in Brooklyn) as Ice Cube's surprisingly caring father.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was a true comedy classic. Any rap fan/comedy fan should love it!!! i hired this movie when i was sick and had a day off school and i ended up watching it seven times! and i still can't get enough of it. It is a movie you can watch over and over again and still be able to watch it again. Smokey is clearly the stand out character and makes the movie, was VERY disappointed to see he hadn't returned in the sequels but i and most of you must understand that Friday and it's sequels where not big budget movies and Chris Tucker hit the big time with Rush Hour and would require to much to take part is a film like this. in conclusion i suggest you don't hire this movie, but buy it as you will want to watch it over and over again. as Smokey would say " Peaceeee out"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just some teen comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Craig Jones(Ice Cube) and his friend Smokey(Chris Tucker) sit on a porch after Craig loses his job, on an extremely eventful Friday.For starters, this is one funny movie. I've seen many and I mean many, black comedies and I have never found any of them to be as funny as this one. It was simple and great. There is nothing else to it. The movie takes place between morning and night of an eventful Friday. But the movie is more than just the funny things that happen to them. It is about facing one's fears and becoming a man. In one scene, the father sees Craig with a gun and tells him that holding a gun won't make him man, it's having the courage to fight with his fists that will. Now, I know this doesn't sound like the greatest thing for a parent to be telling his kid, but in the projects fighting with one's hands instead of picking up a gun is courageous. I found a much deeper meaning in Friday and I feel as though this is one of the better movies about the hood, even though it was made to be a comedy. Ice Cube's performance is surprisingly great and Chris Tucker adds a nice mix of comic relief to make this movie a wonderful experience.So forget Barbershop and other crappy "hood" movies and see Friday. It blends a vast amount of comedy with the realism of everyday hood life. And when I say "everyday", I mean "everday". Overall, Friday was a brilliant comedic experience and I recommend it to anybody.I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, you have to like "in the hood" type movies to probably enjoy this. Ice Cube does a great job acting (underrated as an actor) and Chris Tucker is hilarious!!! It is Friday and Craig (Cube) gets fired on his day off. The rest is what happens during the remainder of the day...This is the best movie of the three "Friday" movies. But the others are funny as well. You should definitely watch the first movie before watching the sequels. 9.8 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a little story. One day me and a couple of friends were watching Cheech and Chong's classic 'Up in Smoke', and someone said that if we liked weed, then we ought to watch 'Friday'. According to this doorknob, everyone in America who smokes grass absolutely LOVES this film. All sorts of positive epithets were bandied around; 'amazingly funny', 'brilliant dialogue' etc. Well, if you consider the sight of someone smoking a joint inherently amusing then I'm sure you'll probably lap up this mess. If however, like most discerning viewers, you probably require some accompanying and complimentary jokes to make a movie worthwhile, then you might be more than a little disappointed. I actually can't think of anything I found remotely entertaining here at all. Normally for even the worst films, the sappiest rom-coms or the preachiest kid's flick, there's a tiny glimmer of enjoyment, even if that's just a one liner or a micro-second sight gag. Not so for Friday. Lets just consider what may be the highlight: a father lectures his son from the toilet on the importance of being a man while noisely evacuating his bowels. Hysterical. Later on the son demonstrates the value of manhood by throwing a half-brick at the back of another guys head while brawling with him. The rest of the film is made up of lazy stabs at easy targets, all wrapped up in the misogyny and homophobia you'd expect from big-name rap artists. An utter chore of a film, with no artistic value whatsoever.</fullReview>

The humour is non-stop from start to finish. Every character does a marvelous job and contributes to the films humour. I don't see how anyone can think this is not a great movie, but they are entitled to their opinion. This is a film for the ages and a must for all movie lovers collections. **** </fullReview>

It's very very good!! I love Chris Tucker in it! Ice Cube is a great strait man! It's so funny! The smoking pot scene is great! The highlight is the FUNNY DAD! I loved the part when he called his son into the bathroom while he was going #2!!! GHOD that was funny. Also, that mean bully DE-BOE was awesome! He just took what he wanted! He got beat up at the end! That was actaully a very dramatic fight scene. All in all, I loved this movie so much that I bought it! Next Friday was funny to! But it didn't have Chris Tucker.

		<fullReview>Friday. At school there was so much hype about this film that I eventually had to see it for myself, even if it was about a year or two later after its original release. Personally, I didn't find it all that funny, even though there were a good parts (like the little midget guy across the street). I don't know, maybe it's partly because I don't find Chris Tucker very funny either, personally I prefer Chris Rock. Overall, I didn't think it lived up to all the hype. I still like "Fear of a Black Hat" a lot better than this movie, it's a shame Friday gets more press than it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one the the worst comedies I have ever seen. Totally unfunny. And the script. . .the screenwriter definitely needs to take some lessons in the craft! There is a long scene sequence where Chris Tucker and Ice Cube are sitting on a front stoop for hours. Hello, but you do NOT have long scenes where characters are just sitting and talking (and talking about nothing, at that)! The only movie that was able to get away with that was My Dinner With Andre. That scene stopped the movie dead cold for at least 15 minutes. Chris Tucker's annoying screeching voice made things even worse, if that is possible. There's really no plot to this either. It just lumbers along until it mercifully ends.</fullReview>

Oh, throw in a joke about a blind date with a fat woman. And we're supposed to laugh? PLEASE! I really thought people were smart enough to see through this, but obviously I was wrong, judging by all the comments of the people who apparently loved this movie.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie quite some time ago. I am only moved to write this review because of the impending release of Next Friday, which must be stopped at all costs. This movie was just awful in every possible way. For proof of this, one only needs to note that even Chris Tucker couldn't make it funny. Ice Cube just sucked. He's one of the best MC's of all time, but he can't write or act for beans. Back to Compton, Cube!I know I'll be dismissed by a lot of people as some whiteboy who doesn't know what it's like to live in the ghetto and doesn't see the multiple humorous levels of an old, constipated man grunting. If that's what you think, then just catch it next time on TNT (don't rent it, like I did) and post at least one funny line. Hell, post anything that didn't have you either sleeping or puking and I'll reneg on all these comments and eat my keyboard to boot.In any case, I'm already feeling queasy and tired just remembering this movie.

		<fullReview>This movie had lots of funny parts, and wasn't bad at all, but the incessant in-jokes about smoking pot got kind of old. It seems obvious to me that the creators of this flick think that everyone smokes pot and it's cool. This isn't something I'd show my kids and tell them to mimic, but it's a decent movie. The fight scene at the end is really the kicker, with a conclusion that doesn't really jive with the rest of this lighthearted film. If the entire movie had been as good as the ending, this would be a "10". As it is, it's still probably a 6 or 7.
