		<shortDescription>A Fascinating and Moving Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awakenings is the most emotionally moving film I have ever seen. It delves deeply into one of the worst human fears, losing the ability to move and function, but it's never forced or manipulative, and there's no heavy-handed message or moral. It's just a fascinating story that's beautifully told.The acting is as good as you will ever see. Robert DeNiro deftly handles all the emotional and physical challenges of his role, and Robin Williams demonstrates convincingly that he is an actor, not just a comedian. Williams is perhaps a bit too nerdy at first, but he captures perfectly all the hope, fear, exhilaration, and anguish that a doctor in that situation must be experiencing. Awakenings is based on actual people and events, and, to me at least, real events are always more powerful than even the best fiction.Awakenings had big-name talent and Oscar nominations, but I don't think it ever had a big box office or became a popular video rental. That's a shame. I like escapist fare as much as the next guy, but once in a while, everyone should see a movie that you will remember and think about for a very long time. Awakenings deserves to be at the top of your list of movies to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a stunningly beautiful and profoundly moving journey, and, amazingly, based on a true story. I never tire of watching this movie; it was one of my all-time favorites. DeNiro's performance totally blows me away every time. And Robin Williams is wonderful as Dr. Sayer. Even simply remembering the movie by reading others' reviews here is once again giving me chills and putting tears into my eyes. After seeing this movie I also became a huge fan of Dr. Oliver Sacks' writing and recommend it to anyone, especially those who enjoyed "Awakenings." His case studies are fascinating. An excellent movie. Do yourself a huge favour and see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can someone please tell me WHY??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can someone please tell me WHY Penny Marshall never received an Academy Award nomination for this? This is an excellent movie. A truly great film. My opinion? DeNiro's best role to date. He was superb. While I loved "Schindler's List," I think DeNiro's role by far out muscled Liam Neeson as an Oscar contender. (No disrespect to Neeson intended.) But I'm still disappointed over that one.Robin Williams was wonderful, as well. As was Julie Kavner. Can't believe we never saw much of her after this role. She's a definite talent. Excellent casting by Marshall.For anyone out there who hasn't seen it, RUSH to your video store TODAY! It's truly one of those "Don't Miss" films. It will definitely give you some life perspective.As for Ms. Marshall - I believe one of these days, we are going to be seeing an Oscar with her name on it. "Best Director!" She gives all women in film something to strive for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BRAVO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It tore my heart out more than once and I cried a bucket of tears. I watched it 3 times in a row the first time I rented it. I recommended to others and everyone loved it. I have never admired Robin Williams more in a role. He was fabulous. Robert DeNiro, absolutely blew me away. I love him in all of his roles, but this was superb acting at it's very best. Ruth Nelson as the mother played a heart-wrenching role. Penelope Ann Miller was so sweet. When Leonard's mother walked into his room and he first spoke to her, I actually sobbed. It was beautiful. The saddest part was that this movie was true and Leonard and all of the other patients are in the same condition now that they were then. I only wish that I knew what ever became of all of them. If this story would have been fiction, I would not have enjoyed it half as much. Only true life can be this sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What An Incredible Story!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a good example of how you can still make a great modern-day movie without profanity, violence or sex.This is an amazing story, based on fact, about about a doctor who makes great progress fighting an illness that heretofore was considered incurable. These were patients in catatonic states, and the good doctor uses an experimental drug to snap these people back to reality and to a normal life as they once had. The patients, and how they react, both before and after the medications, is really fascinating.Robert De Niro is outstanding as one of the patients, but that's not a surprise knowing all the fine acting performances he's done over the years. Robin Williams, relatively new to dramatic acting when this came out, was also excellent in a very low-key role. Penelope Ann Miller is extremely sweet and appealing. I wish both she and Williams would do more roles like that.With multiple viewings, I came to appreciate the minor characters in here a lot more, such as De Niro's mother, played by Ruth Nelson, whom I fondly remember in the 1945 film "A Tree Grows In Brooklyn." What a treat is was to see her again and this was just two years before she died. Also, Alice Drummund as the patient known as "Lucy" was notable.Language-wise, i's almost stunning to watch a movie which has De Niro, Williams, Miller and John Heard and not hear one profane word uttered! (The film isn't perfect, however, as some idiot decided to insert one f-word, and in a totally unnecessary circumstance.)This is a memorable story and one I guarantee you won't forget because the subject matter is so different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams Should Do Films Like This More Often</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Awakenings" is a positively surprising career change of pace for its two leads, Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro. Based on a true story, the film is about the experimental drug invented by Dr. Oliver Sacks (Williams) and how it successfully awakened many paitents from catatonic states which had lasted as long as 30 years. DeNiro gives an especially moving performance as one of the paitents who also turns out to be one of the drug's biggest success stories. It's a real shame how overlooked this film turned out to be for Williams' career. He should be getting praised for his quality dramatic performances in films that matter like this one rather than for his inferior comedies. This film proves that Williams can successfully expand his range and be a great dramatic actor. The same goes for DeNiro and his performance here as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tearjerker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides when I was a child, I never actually cried during a movie. I've felt the urge to cry during some of them or had tears forming in my eyes, but they never really came out. Before I viewed "Awakenings," "Schindler's List" was the closest one to making me cry. Now, "Awakenings" has done it.Another great thing about "Awakenings," is that it truly teaches us to appreciate the simple things in life that we take for granted, from taking a walk by yourself or reading a book or even just brushing your teeth.I don't care what anyone says, both Robin Williams' and Robert DeNiro's performances were excellent and touching. I found this more touching then "Patch Adams." (But I guess "Patch Adams" is more of a Comedy/drama).Give this great film a try. Grab the Kleenexs during Robert De Niro's first dance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, this is one of the greatest movies ever. This is easily the most powerful tearjerker that I've ever seen, thanks in large part to the brilliant performances by Williams and De Niro. But to be fair, the whole cast was excellent, and they were helped by a script that was nearly perfect. For me, the scenes with Miller proved to be the most emotional, but really, the whole film was heartwarming or heartbreaking on some level. I don't tend to get emotional when watching movies, but this film managed to find a way into my heart, and I can't possibly recommend this movie enough to those of you who haven't been lucky enough to see it yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful and touching film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a tale about a doctor(Robin Williams) taking on a new job in the Bronx. His new patients are something of the unusual. A handful of them share an unexplainable disease. The rare disease has left these people frozen in time. One of his main patients is a man named Leonard Lowe, played by Robert Deniro. Doctor Sayer begins a diligent study. To the present day, there are still many questions surrounding this strange disease. During one amazing season in the late 60's, a miracle happened. In my opinion, both Robin Williams and Robert Deniro should have won Oscars for this film. I always say that Williams with a beard equals an amazing performance. His role as the meek Dr. Sayer is heartwarming. He plays perfectly off Deniro's character. Robert Deniro is golden as Leonard, the disease afflicted patient that gives all of his consciousness to help Dr. Sayer. With the help of a large dose of medicine and care all the patients and hospital staff have awakenings.One of the most important words spoken in the film is: LEARN.This film teaches me to appreciate life a little more every time I see it. It hopefully sends us the message to enjoy life. To love and embrace what we have and perhaps learn not to take the natural joys in life for granted is the message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie i can't stop thinking that there are so many untold true and moving stories which can really impact your perspective towards life. The problem remains that many of these true stories may have happened with a few bunch of people or to a minuscule portion of the society.And the rapid changes conditioned upon this society that such touching incidents are veiled and have to wait for the eventuality of a writer like Oliver sacks to bring it back to life through his book of the same name.Here is a movie of belief and hope that will lift your spirits no matter what you have experienced in life.I was in tears as i watched how unfair life can be.Robin Williams has portrayed Dr.Sayer with true conviction, and Deniro's performance is commendable.Penny Marshall has done a tremendous job directing this Drama.I strongly recommend this to everyone.Mukarram.Dhorajiwala</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many "true stories" has Hollywood been able to really pull off and do it well? Hats off to the producers, writers and the wonderful Penny Marshall for making this film. I cannot say enough about this movie that is positive. The characters are likable, human beings that everyone from every age group can relate to. The set decorations were wonderful. The acting was flawless and the directing very poignant.Robert DeNiro was snubbed by the Academy for no good reason whatsoever. I have never, ever seen him give a finer performance than he does here. Obviously, when given the right story and script, DeNiro is one of Hollywood's greats. Unfortunately, he tries to do too many movies and most of them are either duds, or he plays the same gangster character over and over again. Only in this movie and just a few others do we see his true acting ability.Robin Williams, as usual, is nothing if not charming. He was able to make the viewer believe he was that character.This really is a great movie for the whole family, though I admit it is sad!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been a long time since i saw this movie, but i enjoyed it just as well!!! It's absolutely fantastic! Robert De Niro did an astonishing job, and i won't even mention the great Robin Williams! So, i last saw it last night, and i couldn't believe it...i had tears in my eyes...and believe me, that doesn't happen very often! If you ask me, this movie comes to show (once again) what a truly good actor can do, and that is, he can bring the movie to life, make you fell the happiness, the pain, in one word...he can take you with him on the set! I strongly recommend this film to anyone who can truly understand the concept of "film"! I'll end with this advice: see this movie and make a strong comment, first of all, in your heart and in your life!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Words Would Not Describe How Breathtakingly Amazing This Film Is...But I'll Try</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only have a handful of films i could submit as massively underrated &amp; this would be one of them. I found myself lost for words talking about this film because they are just not enough. What i will say is that if you believe 'raging bull', 'godfather 2' or any other other film by deniro are his best performances then BOY WERE YOU WRONG! &amp; i totally resent the statement Kate winslet made in her guest appearance in 'extras' series 1 about disabled peoples portrayal in film getting the actors an Oscar, which this film totally disproves (sadly).'Rain man' can move over, because this truly is a worthy masterpiece that should have really got the Oscar.Deniro always seems to be typecast as a 'tough-guy' or 'wise guy' &amp; this film goes some way to showing that he isn't all about 'that'.This film also shows us that he has one of the best smiles in Hollywood and is just one minuscule element that makes this film so endearing. Robin Williams &amp; Robert Deniro are Hollywood's greatest actors and this may be the only film you'll see them in together, so go out and get this on DVD (its cheap!) Bare in mind that despite the films early slow pace, you'll find yourself never wanting this film to end as you draw closer to its conclusion, Deniro gives the performance of his life &amp; i wish the Oscar film board had a resubmission/review board to correct there past mistakes/injustices so that i could fill them up in a room with this on screen &amp; watch there faces as they walked out after watching it begging for forgiveness for not awarding it the Oscar!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favorites...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly in the top 15 or 20 of my all time favorite movies!! This movie will move you from joy to sadness to joy to sadness. I remember this film for being one of Robin Williams' first serious dramatic roles. It certainly showed us all what a talented actor (and comedian) he can be if given the right role to play. I feel it is his best "serious" dramatic performance. And, again Robert DeNiro proves that he can play just about any part and nail it. To be frank, it is casted very well overall. It is also a somewhat nostalgic movie, and you feel it with the older cars and clothes, TV's and music on the radio. It is a movie worth owning, and I plan to own it when I find it on DVD. See this film--you will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a psychiatrist I was able to evaluate this movie more accurately than most. It gives a simplified and exaggerated but basically accurate account of using a new drug (at the time--1969) to help neurologically seized up patients. The ward looks just like the one I worked on for years at a State Mental Hospital, even the same design of 50's furniture.The movie is several steps above a Lifetime Television production (which it resembles). Another reviewer said that De Niro was hamming his performance... NO. A dopamine compromised or Parkinson's patient looks exactly like De Niro did only maybe worse. The ending statement was a stupid platitude. Robbins says "the chemical has stopped working but the human spirit advances through friendships family blah blah blah..." what a lot of solace that would be to one of those patients.In this movie one can see the provenance of Cocoon.This movie should get about a 6.5 . Maudlin formula stuff but well done maudlin stuff. I gave it a 7.RECOMMEND</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams and Robert De Niro are amazing in this film, both gained popularity and somewhat lessened, but this film shows them at their finest.The story is based on the memoir by Oliver Sacks who found treatment for encephalitis lethargica, which was an epidemic during 1917-1928.The story is not as I expected, it always had something new and interesting, and when I thought I knew the direction of the film, suddenly it changes.Even 20 years later, this film is as strong as ever. It's an amazing story, both tragic, yet in a way redeeming. There are messages in the film, all of which are positive, but only due to the evident negativity of their situations.If you're interested in a movie film that is both thought-provoking and historical, then you're in for more than you bargained for. Do be warned that it is somewhat hard to swallow, so don't expect a popcorn Friday, more like a movie for laid-back Sunday to motivate you for the next week to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent tear dropping drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Such a great movie, no wonder why in the 90's it deserved some Oscar nominations. A touching, emotional and inspiring story about a shy doctor with no life that arrives to the chronic hospital in the Bronx to work with post-encephalitic patients, there he meets Leonard a man who's been catatonic for nearly 30 years.While he helps Leonard to restarts his life he began to learn how live his own. The plot is totally convincing and very well developed. The directing was great, Director Penny Marshall did a great job with a very simple view of how's the life of that kind of patients and of the people around them with a very good movie rhythm that flows perfectly and never bores you. The cast is simply excellent, having a pair of actors like Williams and De Niro together in the same film its just worthy. Robert De Niro's performance was flawless, there's no doubt that it was an Oscar nomination role, Robin Williams was also great as Dr. Malcolm Sayer, one of his best performances ever. The secondary roles from Penelope Ann Miller, Julie Kavner, John Heard and Ruth Nelson were very good and gave the necessary support to the movie. This was a enjoyable and tear dropping movie that touches the deepest region of your heart and soul and it will make you appreciate the simple things in life. Recommendable for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning film, must-see for all 9 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Penny Marshall's Awakenings is being promoted as a "hurrah for the handicapped" movie, but it's much more than that. Derived from an account published in 1973 by neurologist Oliver Sacks, this too-strange- not-to-be-true story is magical because it doesn't really try to be - as Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams), the miracle-working character based on Dr. Sacks, says, "We have to adjust to the realities of miracles." The realities, as dramatized in Steven Zallian's script, are these: In 1969, Dr. Sayers accepts employment at a chronic-care hospital in the Bronx and is mysteriously drawn to a group of catatonic patients referred to as "living statues." Convinced that the patients are cognitively and emotionally alive, despite their external fossilization (some have been immobile for more than 30 years), he investigates their histories. At first, he is stymied by the guesswork diagnoses on record - "atypical schizophrenia"; "atypical hysteria" - and mutters to his nurse (Julie Kavner), "You'd think at a certain point, all these 'atypical' somethings would amount to a 'typical' something." They do: Dr. Sayer discovers that the statues have in common an episode of viral encephalitis.The miracle is this: Aware that the experimental compound L-DOPA has proved effective as a treatment for Parkinsonism, a disease Dr. Sayer believes resembles the condition in which his statues find themselves, he proposes using the drug on one of them, Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro), a middle-aged man who began "disappearing" into brief episodes of paraylsis at the age of 11 and was permanently hospitalized nine years later, in 1939. When the drug "awakens" Leonard, Dr. Sayer asks for permission to prescribe it to the rest of his post-encephalitic patients.At this juncture, Awakenings itself awakens - it sloughs off the "hurrah for the handicapped" genre and becomes a movie about the handicap of the human condition in general. Unfortunately, it's impossible to discuss what transpires next without giving the story away, but it can be reported that the subsequent events, for all their atypical specificity, become a blanket metaphor for typical human life (much of which is spent sleepwalking) - it's evident that Dr. Sayer was "mysteriously" attracted to the statues because he is one of them.Marshall, director of Big and, in another life, Laverne on Laverne and Shirley, elicits performances from Williams and DeNiro that are exceptional. The former, who can't help being funny, is profoundly serious as the emotionally stunted physician unable to heal himself, and the latter, who can't help being serious, is profoundly funny as the emotionally open patient able to heal his physician. The two strong men are complemented by two stronger women, Kavner as the doctor's sympathetic nurse, and the aged Ruth Nelson (her career began in 1926) as the patient's patient mother. Awakenings is a small, simple movie about a large, complex issue, the waste of human opportunity. It could have been made by Thornton Wilder's Emily, who dies at the end of Our Town and from the cemetery exhorts the living to come fully alive. Benjamin MIller, Filmbay Editor</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Be Alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awakenings follows the story of two men and their will to never give up. Leonard Low (Robert De Niro) fell victim to an encephalitis epidemic at a young age and has been left in a catatonic state for thirty years. His new doctor, Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is determined to to find a cure that will revive his patients. A new drug, L-Dopa, offers hope to the patients. Dr. Sayer ignores the criticisms of his more pessimistic colleagues and drives forward with the drug. During the summer of 1969 the patients of Dr. Sayer awaken and come back to the present after being frozen in time. Led by Leonard the group starts to enjoy life to the fullest. Robert Di Niro and Robin Williams give one of their best performances in this film. Di Niro in particular must have done a lot of research for his role to get down the symptoms of his ailment. Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List) penned this beautiful script, his second screenplay, and director Penny Marshall (A League of Their Own) brings the story to life. Unfortunately good things don't last forever, and the L-Dopa cure fails to work over time. Leonard and Dr. Sayer both fight this fact, but they have to come to terms with the limitations. This doesn't detour Leonard in the end though and he is happy to have experienced life again. It is heartbreaking experience, but Dr. Sayer takes Leonard's words to heart and chooses to be alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'd think at a certain point all these atypical somethings would amount to a typical something.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late 60s and post encephalitis patients are roused by various doses of the drug L-Dopa. But as the patients try to come to terms with the new and alien life they are brought into, side effects starts to rear its head.I guess it depends on your emotional state how you absorb Awakenings as a motion picture. There are those that simply believe it's an exercise in currying sentimental favour, whilst others, such as myself, believe stories such as this need to be told. Based on the novel by Oliver Sacks {Malcom Sayer played by Robin Williams} the only real cause for grumble from myself is that sadly, the film fails to fully form the shock and terror these newly roused patients must have felt. The encephalitis epidemic occurred between 1917-1928, these people got old without knowing it. It's briefly touched on with a couple of tender moments, notably thru Alice Drummond's Lucy, but the main focus of the film, perhaps not surprisingly, is the relationship between Williams' Sayer and Robert DeNiro's Leonard Lowe.DeNiro is on full Oscar baiting tilt here {nominated but lost out to Jeremy Irons for Reversal of Fortune} and it's a magnetic performance, tender and close to heart breaking at times. His interplay with Williams {suitably restrained} is what drives the film on, but as stated prior, at the expense of a fully formed whole. Still, director Penny Marshall and her team have gone the whole hog for the sentimental aspect, is it too forced? yes at times it is, but you would have to have been quarried from granite not to be affected by some scenes, re: a mother son reunion for example. So it's not quite the classic it not only threatened to be, but really should have been. But the central theme of learn and evolve is something that hopefully even the films detractors have taken on board.Sweet and touching. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't really seen any other movies by Penny Marshall before watching this. The only one I'm sure I've seen is Riding in Cars with Boys, and, well, if you've read my review of that one, you'll know I didn't think very much of it. Looking at her filmography, I think this is the best of the films she's directed, quality-wise. The plot is great, and very well-told. The pacing is pretty much spot-on. The acting is all top-notch. De Niro is astounding. My fiancée remarks that it made her forget the stereotypical "De Niro roles", Cape Fear's Max Cady and the various(and more often than not, interchangeable) gangster roles that he's played. Personally, I'd also say that Anthony J. Nici was a good choice for the young Leonard Lowe. I think he looks remarkably like him(right down to the mole... added or not), and he does fine acting, as well. Williams shows that he can make us feel, as well as make us laugh, once again. The music is really good, songs are well-chosen. The editing is very good throughout. Most of the camera-work is, as well, although the zoom-ins don't work in the least. Very engaging and sad film. I recommend this to any fan of drama and/or the actors involved. 8/10</fullReview>

It's about being alive: caring and looking for life in other people even when they seem asleep. Also it's about the fragility of life both physically and mentally/emotionally. This story, aside from being the true story of the discovery that L-dopa could release people from their apparent demented state, is a marvelous metaphor or allegory for all of us in some ways sleeping through parts of our life. The story may not have been intended as a modern morality tale, but it is even more germaine today than when it took place as science is prolonging life indefinitely. (I've spent a lot of time with critically ill and chronically ill people). More simply, to me it's a beautiful, bittersweet, yet life-affirming movie.2. The casting is perfect! And the performances are out of this world: my favorites by DeNiro and Williams, both of whose bodies of work I greatly admire. Every character is a home run.3. I'm no expert, but the combination of the directing, acting, editing and musical score and the visuals seem perfect to me. (As a musician I particularly appreciate the music).There you have it...I can't understand the lack of acclaim for this movie and Penny Marshall the director. I was surprised that the average rating was below 8 on a site for movie buffs...they must know something I don't about movies... I could understand a "9" because the movie lacks a grand ending as far as entertainment goes, but it fits the honesty and grace of the film. SEE THIS FILM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I know it's not 1926, I just need it to be"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... is just one of the many quotable quotes in this film that will stick with you. This one is one of my personal favorites and just about as perfect as modern (post 1970) movie making gets. The messages and comparisons of the film are rather obvious, but the individual scenes, the characters, and the acting are superlative. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is a complex individual - he's a physician - a healer of men - who is scared to death of all mankind. In fact he seems to be scared of all living things including a friendly neighborhood dog. He's gotten away with pure research positions up to the present, but now, in 1969 and in need of a job, he takes a job as a physician in a chronic care hospital. Now here's the complexity - You'd think a man who is afraid of other people would just sit back and perform his rounds and be grateful to be around patients who are as physically catatonic as he is emotionally catatonic. However, his humanity and intellectual curiosity are stronger than his fear and desire to hide as he begins to notice "patterns" in both the behavior and in the records of some of his patients that makes him believe that they may still be "alive inside". This leads to research that pinpoints one illness that all of the patients had in common - encephalitis lethargica that spread worldwide from 1917 to 1928. After the illness subsided, sometimes years later, would the catatonia gradually set in. Dr. Sayer manages - with great difficulty - to get funding to try a new drug on these particular patients, and they awaken, some after 40 years, many in their 60's physically, but in their 20's emotionally. The focus of the movie, though, is on the friendship that forms between Leonard Lowe (Robert DeNiro), a 50 year old victim of the disease, and Dr.Sayer. Leonard's mother (Ruth Nelson as Mrs. Lowe) is one of the few people visiting on a regular basis after all of these years - Leonard has been here for 30 years, ill since age 11, catatonic since age 20. So the focus is on Leonard's love of life once awakened versus Dr. Sayer's fear of it - this is the obvious part of the film. However that doesn't take anything away from De Niro doing a great job of playing someone who isn't a tough guy for a change and from Robin Williams from playing one of his most dramatic roles, both characters extremely vulnerable in their own way. Julie Kavner is pitch perfect as Dr. Sayer's loyal ,hard working, and assertive nurse and assistant. Ruth Nelson gives a performance of a lifetime, just two years before her death, as a mother who has dedicated her life to a son she remembers as and has cared for as a child for almost 40 years but is a bit perplexed when he awakens as a man and his fancy turns towards love. For once she has a rival for her son's attention, which is not unusual. What is unusual is that she has to deal with this 30 years later than most mothers. There are heartbreaking scenes, there are funny scenes, and one scene in particular that brings to light how people sometimes will dismiss something as possible because it just seems too horrible. My favorite scene in this latter category: Dr. Sayer, when doing his research on the catatonic patients, visits the eminent physician Dr. Peter Ingham (Max Von Sydow). Ingham was dealing with the catatonia when it first developed in the 20's and 30's. When Dr. Sayer asks Dr. Ingham how he knows that the virus has not spared the patients higher faculties he responds: "Because the alternative is unspeakable." Classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I could watch the ending over and over again and still be equally moved every time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie for the fourth time or so. This is truly a powerful and magical film, sparkling with emotions and good acting in almost every scene. You can tell that everyone involved with this film wanted it to be good. Not just good, but perfect (and the latter is an understatement.) I can't praise De Niro's performance enough, it is one of his finest performances since "Taxi Driver". Despite being overshadowed by De Niro, Robin Williams pulls off a noteworthy performance. I wish people would one day look back on Awakenings as one of the best movies ever made, the same way that people are looking back on Shawshank today. But sadly, I doubt that will ever happen. This film will most likely be forgotten as time passes. I'm never gonna forget this film, it's gonna stay with me until death.I often find myself comparing this film to The Shawshank Redemption. Both films have two great themes in common: hope and faith. Both films tell a great story: how two men (Leonard Lowe and Andry Dufresne) are locked up, and how both eventually finds redemption through friendship. While DeNiro and Williams are the stars of the movie, enough screen time is given to the staff &amp; other patients too, which is good. I found myself being excited, watching Leonard Lowe interacting with different people, and how they feel for him (and the other way around.)The movie raises a handful of questions, including how our society is today; for example, how some people forgot what it actually means to live, that some people take too many things for granted. This film works very well on a thought-provoking level, as well as on an emotional level. The ending will be very divisive (which I won't spoil) but I came to appreciate it more and more after repeated viewings. Ultimately, after watching it for the fourth time, I couldn't think of a better ending.Probably the best emotional film I've ever seen (along with Shawshank). The film doesn't have a single cheesy scene, and it has some important underlying themes - Moose finds this film worthy of a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Legend!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Oliver Sacks's 1973 memoir by the same name, 'Awakenings' is a legendary film, that reflects a true-story in bold emotions. Penny Marshall makes a film that takes you back in time and makes you feel proud to have a life!A true story of British neurologist Oliver Sacks, fictionalized as American Malcolm Sayer, played by Robin Williams, who, in late 60's, discovers beneficial effects of the then-new drug L-Dopa. He administered it to catatonic patients who survived the 1917-1928 epidemic of 'encephalitis lethargica'. Leonard Lowe, played by De Niro and the rest of the patients were awakened after decades of catatonic state and have to deal with a new life in a new time. 'Awakenings' is one of the greatest true stories into a film ever, mainly, because it moves you.The characters, the situations are so brilliantly executed, that I was left awe-struck. You laugh when the ill-fated people laugh, you cry when the ill-fated people cry. I still have a hangover of this emotional saga! 'Awakenings' is one those rare films, in which everything is flawless. Penny Marshall's direction and understanding to the subject, both, are exemplary. Steven Zaillian's adapted screenplay delivers some very memorable dialogue. Miroslav Ondrícek'c Cinematography is perfect. Editing by Battle Davis &amp; Gerald B. Greenberg is well-done.Performance-Wise: Robert De Niro is GODLY. He delivers a performance that leaves you inspired. It's shame that he lost to a rather average Jeremy Irons at the Academy-Awards in the Best Actor category. Robin Williams is outstanding! The thespian is at his very best! John Heard is superb. Julie Kavner is excellent from start to end. Penelope Ann Miller, in a cameo, is very good.'Awakenings' is a legend! One of the most inspiring, emotional and moving films I've watched to date. A Must Watch for each and every cinema fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came across this movie about two years ago when flicking through channels. It gripped me right away. I then checked it out from library and watched it twice in a single day. The story was so sad that after watching I was desperately looking for some funny things to cheer me up, but it's absolutely worth the tears and depression.Robert DeNiro, who was famous from 'the god father', 'taxi driver', and 'dear hunter', played such a different role in this movie. His Leonard caught me right after the beginning. I was happy for his awakening, applauding for his love, concerned by his struggle and eventually crying for losing him once again. The pleasure was too short which made it invaluable. I paid my deepest sympathy to Leonard's mother as I felt the same pain as she did when nobody can save her son. There was a scene when Leonard gradually lost his consciousness and could no longer recognize the woman he loved so much during his awakening, and nothing, absolutely nothing, could get him back. Sitting there seeing him drifting away is heartbroken.Robin Williams surprised me too. He used to give me the impression of a noisy comedian and I didn't quite appreciate his work. But here he played the doctor so well that I began to think he was very talented but didn't have much opportunity to show us his diversity. Anyone who wants to watch it, be prepared to have your heart broken.Gosh, just writing this comment depresses me again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film, Amazing Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Awakenings" is a film based on a true story. The plot is about Dr. Sayer (Williams), a young and shy neurologist, newly arrived in a mental hospital. Being there, he finds a group of patients who suffer from an unknown form of dementia; these people are completely disconnected from their environment, yet Dr. Sayer discovers that they occasionally respond unexpectedly to some cues. Facing the incredulity of his fellow physicians, he tries an experimental treatment, with his test subject being Leonard (De Niro), a man who has entered this catatonic stage since his childhood, and who has only his elderly mother to take care of him. To everyone's great astonishment, L-Dopa, the drug used by Sayer, works with Leonard: He "awakens" from his catatonic state, thus persuading the hospital authorities to let Dr. Sayer treat the other patients suffering from this disease, as well. Suddenly, the patients who were statute-like until then, become happy, living, people. Everything looks great, yet unfortunately things consequently turn out sour...The story is simple, yet powerful. Although it is very depressing, the message boiling down from the film is optimistic, despite the appearances: Life is good, so try to enjoy it while you can.The performance of De Niro and Williams are both amazing; however, De Niro should perhaps get a slightly higher grade (if there can be a grade higher than "amazing"), since his role as catatonic Leonard is much more difficult to play. Of course, it would be unfair if I did not stress that the rest of the cast is also doing a fine job.In brief, "Awakenings" is a great film. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"People have forgotten what life is all about. They've forgotten what it is to be alive. They need to be reminded."Following the huge success of her 80's comedy, Big, director Penny Marshall decided to approach a much more sensitive and serious subject matter in her next film based on Oliver Sacks' semi-biographical book about his work in a ward with patients in catatonic state. Robin Williams was cast to play Dr. Sacks, although the character's name was changed to Dr. Malcolm Sayer, a shy doctor who prior to have been hired at the ward had very little experience working with patients. He was obsessed with researching and doing lab work, but those skills came in handy when he began treating the catatonic patients at the ward. He discovered that several of the patients that had been in the ward for decades had one thing in common: they had survived a rare form of encephalitis, but the disease left them in their current catatonic state. Most of the doctors believed there was no treatment for these patients, but he began to discover that some of them responded to certain stimuli. Not giving up on them, he decides to attend a lecture where he discovers a new drug that had been effective on patients suffering from Parkinson's, and he believes it might just help awake his patients as well. Casting Robin Williams for the role and having released this only two years after the commercial success of Big, one could easily have expected this to be a comedy, but casting Robert De Niro as the other lead easily put to rest that assumption. De Niro had also worked on Goodfellas the same year as this and he continued to be at the prime of his career. In Awakenings he plays Leonard Lowe, one of the patients who has remained in the same state for nearly four decades and who is still being cared for by his mother, Mrs. Lowe (Ruth Nelson), at the clinic. With the approval of the other doctors at the ward and Leonard's mother, he is chosen for a trial run with the drug. It doesn't take too long for Dr. Sayer to see the results he was expecting as Leonard seems to wake up from his catatonic state. The two begin to form a special bond and the positive results induce Sayer to test the drug on the rest of the patients in the ward in a similar way. As we become witnesses of Leonard's awakening we also begin to see life through his eyes as someone who feels he has lost so many years and now wants to enjoy life to the fullest. His awakening serves the reclusive Doctor as a reminder to begin living life and enjoying human interaction. There is a sub plot revolving his relationship with a nurse from the ward played by Julie Kavner, but the main theme is Sayer's relationship with these patients. Marshall's film was nominated for Best Picture, and just like her previous movie it also earned a nomination for the lead actor, De Niro. De Niro does a superb job playing this awakened catatonic patient, and it is evident that he did his homework and studied every single facial and body tic of the real patients. Sacks had filmed his patients in real life during their awakening periods and so there was a lot of material they had to work with. Robin Williams plays a much more restrained character than what we were used to seeing him do, so his performance might not seem as delightful as his other films but he delivers a solid dramatic turn. The third nomination that the film received was for Steven Zaillian's adapted screenplay which was powerful. He didn't win the Oscar for this film, but he went on to win it two years later for his work in Schindler's List. Spielberg said it was his adaptation in Awakenings that earned him the job for his film. This movie is emotional and touching without being manipulative because it sticks to the true story which was definitely one that had to be told in the big screen. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is a new doctor working at a local hospital. Sayer takes a particular interest in the catatonic patients and soon discovers patterns in their behaviour - they all have excellent reflexes. Sayer soon deduces that the catatonic victims were all victims of encephalitis which the patients had contracted several years earlier. Sayer discovers through various tests and experiments that these 'catatonic' patients are of sound mind, but their bodies are effectively paralysed. When Sayer learns of a new drug called L-DOPA he believes that this drug could give the catatonic patients a much better quality of life. Sayer is given permission to test this new drug on his test subject Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro). With the test on Lowe being a resounding success, Sayer eventually gets enough funding to administer the drug to all the 'catatonic' patients which essentially gives them a new lease of life...I personally thought that this was a wonderful film which gives the audience an excellent insight into the lives of patients that are catatonic. I believe that the modern interpretation of the illness depicted by Lowe and the others is now known as Locked In Syndrome - whereby the mind functions, but the rest of the body doesn't. Of all the disabilities out there, I suspect that this is one of the worst as it gives you such a low quality of life - being in a wheelchair or being blind doesn't restrict you quite as much as you think (the Paralympics have paved the way for many disabled athletes), but Locked In Syndrome is an entirely different kettle of fish.Lowe and Sayer form a tight bond throughout this film. Once Lowe has received several doses of L-DOPA, he starts to get his life back and understandably wants to take full advantage of the fact that his mind is no longer locked in his body. His new lease of life leads to some touching moments and a few funny moments (the scene where Lowe picks up the electric razor and doesn't know how to use it did make me laugh). It was also interesting to get an insight into the other catatonic patients thoughts once they have received the medication - when they're talking we get to see their various personalities which as I say was both interesting and funny. This also lead to one of the doctors uttering the line 'I preferred them the way they were' which did get a chuckle out of me.De Niro for me is the star of the show. I've always found him to be a good actor, but he very much plays against type here and for me this is probably his best performance. For De Niro to play so against type and to make it work this well means that he deserves extra credit for this role. Williams was OK as well, but he wasn't given as much to do (acting wise). This really was the De Niro and Williams show where the rest of the cast are given little else to do.There are several tender moments in this film (most notably the scene where Paula dances with Lowe in the hospital) - that scene was so touching and moving and was probably one of the best scenes in the film. The film ends strongly, although it is slightly more downbeat than I was expecting.Awakenings is a very good film that is funny, touching, heart-warming, sad &amp; incredibly moved and well-acted. Recommended for fans of moving drama, although I do think that it is a film that everyone should watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heartbreaking Tearjerker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After recently watching "Mrs Doubtfire" and "Old Dogs" a movie from the latter part of the late Robin Williams's career. I decided to revisit some of his earlier dramatic work. My first choice was 1988's "Dead Poets Society". Then I settled on this movie from 1990. Plot In A Paragraph: In 1969 Malcolm Sayer (A brilliant Robin Williams) discovered the effects of the drug L-Dopa. He administered it to catatonic patients who survived the 1917?28 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica. Leonard Lowe (A brilliant Robert De Niro) and the rest of the patients are awakened after decades of catatonia and have to deal with a new life in a new time. Robin Williams Robert De Niro and Penelope Ann Miller are all brilliant as is Julie Kavner, John Heard and Ritchard Libertini (Who I always enjoy watching on screen) are both good value too. In fact there is not a weak link in the cast. It also features Vin Diesel in his movie debut as a hospital orderly. I'm not quite sure why the Academy nominated De Niro for Best actor, and yet they snubbed Williams. Yet the Golden Globes nominated Williams for Best actor, Yet snubbed De Niro. As I think both actors superb. I'm not sure how good Jeremy Irons was in reversal of fortune, but I'm guessing he was excellent, because based on this movie, I think De Niro should have won the Oscar, and Williams should have won the Golden Globe. It would not be the first time the Academy and Golden Globes got it wrong. I also think that Penelope Ann Miller should have been nominated too.One of Robin Williams best, and one of Robert De Niro's best. Says it all. Everybody needs to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sifting through the endless words that have been written about Robin Williams' untimely death, my focus seems to be on his work.The things you see between 8 and 14 years of age leave some of the deepest impressions. To this day I remember when I first saw "Awakenings" in early 1991. I was 13 going on 14 and the movie, the performances but especially the subject matter touched me immeasurably.It is one of the few films and books that complement each other, in the best sense of that word. Both are unique in their own way, but depend on the other. The movie conveys many emotions and truths that the book sometimes buries behind its analytical character. And the book gives us a real sense of what the day-to-day struggles of these patients were.Robert De Niro and Robin Williams fulfill similar functions, because as individuals they are very much opposites and yet represent a complete picture of empathy and desire.Remembering the scenes, the book and my life, the sadness over Mr. Williams death starts to unfold. Not because of a personal connection but in recognition that to live means to be aware. And that sometimes the simplest things, as they are described in this film, can be the hardest.To review "Awakenings" is to review ones own life. To see, feel and be able to accept."The ending is sad," the real Leonard L. once observed, and with this sadness I cherish Robin Williams who was alive....and awake.</fullReview>

He administered it to catatonic patients like Leonard Lowe,portrayed here by Robert De Niro, and the rest of the patients were awakened after decades of catatonia.They have to deal with a new life in a new time. It also stars Penelope Ann Miller,John Heard and Max Von Sydow. It was directed by Penny Marshall.Dr. Sayer takes a job at a Bronx psychiatric hospital in 1969. Here he's put in charge of several seemingly catatonic patients who, under Sayer's painstaking guidance, begin responding to certain stimulant. Apprised of the efficacy of a new drug called L-DOPA in treating degenerative- disease victims, Sayer is given permission to test the drug on one of his patients. Leonard Lowe, who has not communicated with anyone since lapsing into catatonia as a child. Gradually, Lowe comes out of his shell, encouraging Sayers to administer it to the other patients under his care. Robin Williams and Robert De Niro give tour de force performances in this touching and moving medical drama.Williams definitely excel in his non-comedic role while De Niro was truly believable as a catatonic patient.While the story maybe somewhat good but not great as it contains too many subplots like the doctor's own problems and his romantic affair instead of focusing on the doctor-patient relationship and the effect of the drug especially during their awakening,the performances of both actors alone is worth the price of admission.Aside from that,it also provides us awareness about catatonic patients and what they go through.</fullReview>

In addition to being a heart warming story (and most of it being true), the performances by both Robert De Niro and Robin Williams are definitely super! For both of them, they were placed in roles that neither of them had done before, nor what they had been known for. De Niro, up to that point in his career, had been in mostly "tough guy" roles, and Williams had been in quite a few somewhat comedic roles. But, the two of them played their parts perfectly! And, how De Niro was able to so accurately portray Leonard Lowe's condition was a gem! This movie, and similarly "Murder In The First", both definitely deserve WAY more recognition. And, I can watch either of these films over and over, and still never get bored!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A memorable piece of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I met this beautiful movie accidentally one year ago, but I'm really grateful of finding it. The writer of the movie, Steven Zaillian is a real genius who wrote films such as Schindler's List, The girl with the dragon tattoo, American Gangster. It was nominated for 3 Oscars and won 6 other awards. The two main roles are played by Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. The story ( based on reality) is about: the victims of an encephalitis epidemic c many years ago have been catatonic ever since, but now a new drug offers the prospect of reviving them. In the first part of the movie the doctor ( played by R. Williams) is in the center of the story. He's a little bit antisocial, but really kind and light-hearted, lovable and what's the most important: human. But after about the half of the movie the patient ( played by R. De Niro) wiped the floor with the doctor. The way that De Niro plays is unforgettable and extremely touching, I think the most stone-hearted person would also cried during this movie. There's a love-line in it, but It's not a clich?, like the whole movie is not a typical American blockbuster. The evil's appearance can be a stereotypical part of Hollywood movies, so we expect an evil person, like it could be the severe doctor, played by John Heard. But the director didn't make a stereotyped figure of him, he stayed in a human way too. Briefly, It's an amazingly touching story, with memorable performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams' most complete performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awkward Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) has more difficulties dealing with people than with worms. He is a new hire to the understaffed psych ward. One day he noticed a previously assumed catatonic patient actually has reactions. Soon he finds other such patients including Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro), and a drug that could possibly save them.Penny Marshall created a film that plucks the heartstrings. It is a well crafted emotional tour de force. Robin Williams is able to restraint his manic energy to make Dr Sayer is a compelling man who learns to grow. Robert De Niro is playing the showier part, and he excels at it. The movie will leave you with a tear and a hope in your heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story opens and ends in a psychiatric ward, but this is no Cuckoo's Nest grim comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Ebert, bless his immortal and great talented soul, wrote that Awakenings was "no tear-jerker." For once Roger was wrong, if we must take him literally, for I and most of our readers by their admissions, teared up all over the place, and I'm a hard-bitten retired trial lawyer. I didn't have the pleasure of watching this great film in a theater, because Nadja and I were enjoying ourselves sailing Baja California and the Mexican Pacific Gold Coast, but I watched it on two DVD rentals this year, and wept appropriately both times. I must say, however, that I was turned off by the ridiculous scene where Robert DeNiro whips his fellow suffers into a frenzy. This instantly reminded me of the scene in the 1977 version of The Island of Dr. Moreau where the animals, surgically and at great pain transformed into human beings, in their misery proclaimed "We are men. We are men." This scene, in my humble opinion, was entirely unnecessary because the actors, by their body language both before and after, quite adequately made the point. I suspect that some Hollywood executive who fancied himself more knowledgeable than the script writers insisted on this scene to give it more action. Whatever, it sure cured my teary mood. I also wish the DVD had come equipped with subscripts for people with hearing problems, which means probably 60% of viewers over 60. But the acting was so good, I believe I understood what was going on. As noted my brief comment in the Summary section, this story's beginning and ending with the ward's patients being in and reverting to catatonic trances intrigued me. This device was used in the unexpurgated edition of the satirical psychiatric novel "Paper Doll, The Times and Tribulations of George Selkirk, M.D."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartbreaking look at a patient's awakening and adaptation towards life; DeNiro &amp; Williams are outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this doesn't move you to some degree, then I legitimately think you might be a sociopath. In all seriousness it does have a lot of sap, but what I really appreciated about it is that it's non pretentious. It could have easily gone either way, but in my humble opinion, it remained perfectly fine. What I got out of this film is this. People really do take life for granted, myself included. When Leonard starts functioning like a proper human being, it's joyous to watch. Leonard had spent most of his life in a catatonic state due to an encephalitis epidemic years ago. Watching Leonard be constantly catatonic is not pleasant to witness, so when he does start functioning rather normally, it was very uplifting. I'm often quite selfish, and so are others. I worry about meaningless things in life, whilst Leonard was simply just jovial to be fully alert. He enjoyed simple things, such as fresh air, walks, smiling. We often forget how precious life is and how it can be taken away from you in an instant. Robin Williams is technically the lead in this film and he gives a flawless show. Williams is an exceptionally talented comedian, but what people forget once in a while, is some of the standout serious roles he's given us over the years. I loved how he evolved in the second half; going from a confident &amp; optimistic, into irreparably beaten as he spends more and more time with Leonard near the end. His scenes with DeNiro are a treat to witness. Robert DeNiro is just as good, perhaps even Oscar worthy. He looked, acted, and felt like someone that was catatonic. DeNiro is one of the finest actors to ever grace our T.V screens, and I put this in his top 5 of best performances. P.S. Look closely and you'll see a young Vin Diesel as an extraFinal Thoughts: This is an excellent film. It's an emotional journey that is alternately uplifting and saddening. It'll really make you think about the proper values in life, and how quickly it can be snatched away from you. Highly recommended8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Awakening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awakenings (1990)This film is amazing. It is biographical drama based on Oliver Sacks's 1973 memoir with the same name. Awakening tells the powerful story of Dr. Malcolm Sayer played by Robin Williams, who plays a fictionalized version of British neurologist Olver Sacks. In 1969 he experienced incredible results after he administered a drug called L-Dopa (which is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease), to patients who had been in a catatonic state since the 1917-28 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica. These patients 'awaken' after decades of catatonia and are forced to adapt to their new life in a new time. The performances by both Robert De Niro and Robin Williams are spectacular and moving. In fact, Robert De Niro narrowly missed out on winning an Academy Award for his performance as Leonard Lowe, one of the patients that Dr Sayer treats. It has been years since I have watched a film that has moved me enough to get me close to turning on the water works, but I am man enough to admit I could feel a couple swelling in the eyes on this. It is incredible to think this is based on a true story, and makes you reconsider how insignificant our daily problems in life are compared to what these people have gone through. The things we take for granted are emphasised in this truly touching story. Do yourself a favour and watch this film.

		<fullReview>I don't have a lot to say about Awakenings except from that it is an amazing masterpiece and one of the most touching films I have ever watched. The performances by Robert De Niro and Robin Williams are fantastic and this is one of the best movies of 1990. There are moments in this movie which made my cry and weep and others which made me laugh because a thought of how beautiful and valuable life really is. I recommend this movie to anybody who loves cinema, art and life. And I also recommend the book from which the movie was adapted because it is also brilliant and extremely touching and gives more details about the lives of the people involved (doctors and patients). 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Penny Marshall directs this film based on a true story that everyone with a pulse should be able to relate to. The notion that catatonic patients, here long suffers of an encephalitis outbreak, are fully aware of their surroundings but are trapped is heart wrenching enough, but add the personal challenges, triumphs, and disappointments of Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams), nurse Eleanor Costello (Julie Kavner) and patient Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro), and the emotional story is elevated even higher. Health, family, dignity, human contact and compassion, many things in life that we may take for granted, are shown to have immense importance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oliver Sacks... Fictionalized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The victims of an encephalitis epidemic many years ago have been catatonic ever since, but now a new drug offers the prospect of reviving them.Dustin Hoffman as an autistic man in "Rain Man"? You have nothing on Robert DeNiro as a post-encephalitic Parkinson's patient in this film! The tics, the walk, the antics... obviously I was not there when this actually happened, but I was impressed. Robin Williams did alright, too, playing it straight in one of his many turns as a doctor on film.I love Oliver Sacks and his writing, and I am glad they were able to make such a great adaptation that was both educational and entertaining (like his books are). Was the transformation so sudden and dramatic in real life? I have my doubts. But you have to cut corners to fit within two hours, so if this was one way, it is forgivable.Ebert gives this four of four stars. I think he was spot on with this one, and his longer-than-average review (stuffed with praise) is excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a blessing it is to be alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Awakening, we see what a blessing it is to be alive?to be able to wake up in the morning, brush our teeth, and even comb our hair.The patients in this movie are alive but they are not. Then they receive the gift of life, for a time. I left this movie with a deep sense of thankfulness for being a non-disabled (i.e., able) person, free to live my few years on earth without much physical impediment. As there is nothing that's holding me back (except my laziness and other sins), I owe it to myself and God to live with all my might, while I do live.I suppose dying (as one gets older and his physical ability dies slowly long before the last breath) is somewhat like what the patients experienced in this movie. It is a cruel thing, and there is nothing noble about it.A very moving scene: Robert De Niro, as the symptoms (tic) come back and start to gain control over body, fears what is coming and says, "This is not me!" What a misery it is when I do things that I don't want to do, but there seems to be some force (inside me) that makes me do it!</fullReview>

Robbie's performance is superb, also the performance of Robert De Niro has a greater degree of difficulty but achieved. The problems of existence of the sick upon awakening reveal feelings very similar to those we have in everyday life but causes a change in thinking to improve and especially to love our loved ones. Surely you are gonna cry many times watching Robert's character struggles to have a life that we take for granted most of the people and as the doctor struggles to him, as the human spirit makes it possible to love in that place where the least there is love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a movie critic, although I have seen a lot of movies in my life. All I know is that I watch this movie far more often than Citizen Kane, and often on my birthday, as a special treat, because it moves me. As a person who struggles with bipolar disorder (thank you Robin Williams for coming out of the closet for a lot of us), I have often related to the patients in this film who have a very different diagnosis.There are many aspects of the film I enjoy. Randy Newman is one of my favorite musical artists, and his soundtrack for this one always moves me. All of the lead and character actors seem so well cast in this film, and I enjoy all of them every time I watch it. One of the main criticisms I have heard is that it is overly sentimental. Some people have no respect for tearjerker films. Then again, some of us need to or want to have our tears jerked out of us sometimes.I do not know how to contact Penny Marshall, but I have always wanted to thank her for her work on this film and everyone else who participated in it. It moves me, as very few films I have ever seen. I am hoping to check into a mental facility today if there are any free beds here in California, and I am so delighted that I have a model for how to keep my sense of humor as I take this step today.Every time I see this film, I laugh and cry in ways that I do not for any other film.

		<shortDescription>Beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films based on a true story, when done right, have a certain nuance to them that gloriously elevates them to a deeper emotional level. It's evident that Awakenings has a lot of respect for its source material. It takes its true story and dramatizes it just enough to make it a very compelling drama that doesn't tip too far into the realm of melodrama. Awakenings takes place in the Summer of 1969 when Dr. Malcolm Sayer, played by Robin Williams, begins work at a mental hospital. There are numerous patients at the hospital with a disease which puts them in a state of catatonic paralysis. Dr. Sayer takes a particular interest in one of the patients, Leonard Lowe, played by Robert De Niro, and sets out to find a cure for the disease. It's a tearjerker and a heart wrencher, but it is all done so beautifully.Awakenings puts you in that somber and entranced mood that only good films can put you in. It takes a little while to get the ball rolling, but once it does you lose yourself in this movie. Everything draws you in . The music, the quiet direction, the fantastic acting, everything. Your sympathy for these characters only grows during the entire film despite how idealistically dramatic the film tends to get. It has an excellently captured mood which makes your emotions run deeper and deeper as the film develops. For a while everything seems to be going fine and there seems to be little conflict in the film as Dr. Sayer creates the drug to cure these patients. And just when you feel like there isn't enough going on in this film, the true meaning of the story emerges and blooms into a beautiful and moving tale.Now you just can't talk about Awakenings without mentioning Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. Their performances are truly incredible. Robin Williams goes far outside his normal range when he plays a painfully shy and incredibly timid doctor who has a very difficult time interacting with people. Robert De Niro is catatonic for half the film but the way he pulls of his character awakening from this thirty year long catatonic state is incredible. The character of Leonard Lowe is tragic yet brilliant in the way he is designed and developed. Your sympathy for this character runs so deep and watching everything that happens to him in this movie is absolutely heart wrenching. Rarely does a study of the human mind and the human condition elicit such incredibly moving results as we see in Awakenings. This movie provokes a lot of thought and a lot of reflection on what it means to be human and how we perceive our own existences. The essence and meaning of this film is truly profound and is a moving miracle to watch on screen.Awakenings is an excellent film and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Dramas like these just aren't capable of reaching a certain status in my opinion on films, but there is no way I can deny that this film is very well made and provokes a lot of thought. The last half of the movie is profoundly better than the first, yet the film obviously wouldn't have had the same effect without all of the setup. I could easily see myself watching this film again and maybe catching on to a few more things earlier on that I may have missed. Awakenings is a quiet film with so much heart and feeling that you just wont forget what you have seen here. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming with some great performances...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a heart-warming tale about a doctor and his work to find a cure for his patients who are stuck in a catatonic state. There are some great performances and it has many ups and downs along the way. It is based on a book by Oliver Sacks, a true story which will play at your heartstrings at times. More of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please help get Leonard back into bed while I write the next paragraph).Dr. Malcolm Sayer has always worked in research because he doesn't really get on with people. He has to take a job at a hospital where he has no choice but to work with the patients. There he meets, amongst his patients, Leonard Lowe, who has been in a catatonic state for thirty years. With the help of his assistant, Eleanor Costello, Dr. Sawyer carries out a series of tests to discover just what is wrong with him. He eventually discovers it is to do with an encephalitis epidemic back in the 1920's and it is now the late 60's. Convinced he can find as cure, reads up on all the current medications and finds an experimental drug that might do the trick. His boss, Dr. Kaufman, will only let him try it on one patient, he chooses Leonard and thus begins the awakenings? but will it last, and what are the consequences? I'll have to leave it there so as not to be beaten by the Spoiler Police.This is a really well made film with a beautiful score by Randy Newman, enhanced with many songs, both old and new. Great performances all round, particularly from Robert De Niro as Leonard Lowe and Robin Williams as Dr. Malcolm Sayer, who both went and observed Oliver Sacks and his patients prior to making this film, and it showed. I also have to mention Julie Kavner, it's nice to see the voice of Marge Simpson as a real person for a change. Honourable mentions also go to; Ruth Nelson as Mrs. Lowe (Leonard's mother), John Heard as Dr, Kaufman and it was also nice to see a brief cameo from Max von Sydow as Dr. Peter Ingham.Although it starts off a little schmaltzy, this film grows into an engrossing drama with engaging characters and an interesting plot. There are hints of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) here and there, but I can forgive that, after all, it's not a bad film to be compared with. Over all, it's pretty good and well worth a viewing? Recommended.My score: 7.6/10</fullReview>

But even he is completely outplayed by De Niro. Incredible acting, even for his standards. How did he not get an Oscar for this role?

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Pairing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a superb movie. Based on the book by world renowned neurologist Oliver Sacks, it portrays the summer of 1969 at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx, which had become the final resting place for a tragic group of patients whose exposure to the 1917-1928 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica left them hauntingly catatonic. But Dr. Sacks' learned that the newly discovered drug L-Dopa helped patients with certain kinds of Parkinson's disease manage their symptoms. Making a connection between the Parkinson's patients and the catatonic patients in his charge, Dr. Sacks administered L-Dopa to them, resulting in an awakening from their decades-long slumber - hence the title of the film (and the book).In this fictionalized account, Robin Williams plays Dr. Malcom Sayer, a shy, reclusive and socially awkward neurologist newly arrived at a psychiatric hospital. This might well be Williams' finest performance ever - subdued, understated and nearly flawless. His first and most dramatic success in administering L-Dopa involves Leonard Lowe, whose resulting awakening is literally miraculous. And here is where, I believe, the movie approaches the miraculous as well.Robert De Niro's portrayal of Leonard Lowe is the most seamlessly perfect performance I have seen any actor give in any movie. Period. The obvious physical dimension of Leonard's condition might easily have overshadowed his character and turned it into a caricature. Yet De Niro utterly mastered the physical portrayal the the illness in its varying degrees while painting in the most emotionally touching way Leonard's abrupt ascent to wellness and gradual descent back into catatonia. And his depiction of Leonard's awakening to confusing and unfamiliar emotions is as delicate, nuanced and powerful as one could imagine.But the entire cast is remarkable, from Julie Kavner to Ruth Nelson to Penelope Ann Miller and everyone in between. Each character fits perfectly into a mosaic of an astonishingly believable group of patients, professionals and family who shared a miraculous summer of awakening.Quiet, unassuming and powerful, Awakenings is greater than the sum of its parts. As someone who battles a psychiatric illness, I was profoundly touched both by Williams' portrayal of a compassionate, yet doubting doctor and even more so by De Niro's understanding of the poignant tragedy of being trapped in a body and a mind beyond your control.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable old-fashioned movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that never really appealed to me but found myself watching because there was nothing else on. Overall, I'm glad I did. Awakenings is a sincere and moving account of a true episode in which several patients in (for want of a better phrase) a near-vegetative state) awoke from their condition after being administered L-Dopa, a wonder drug used in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease. All things considered, it's quite a surprise that Hollywood took more than 20 years to make a film about it.There's plenty of room for over-sentimentality here, but for the most part director Penny Marshall and writer Steve Zaillan manage to sidestep the obvious pitfalls, straying only occasionally into Hollywood schmaltz. Robert De Niro delivers a convincing performance as Leonard, the middle-aged man who lapsed into this vegetative state when he was 20-years-old after suffering encephalitis as a child. Robin Williams tones down his manic persona for the role of the shy doctor who brings about this miracle cure - and given that he couldn't have been an obvious casting choice he does extremely well.Although it avoids overt sentimentality, the film does contain some typical Hollywood touches which, given the nature of the story, may be unavoidable. For example, people who haven't spoken or moved freely for 30 years are able to speak and move with little difficulty while in reality they would, like coma patients, need months of physio and speech therapy. But unless, like me, you're naturally cynical about the amount of truth contained in 'based on a true story' films, this can be written off as nit-picking on my part I suppose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is Just Amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sometimes love to lie before my computer screen and watch a movie that turns out to be great at the end or in the middle and I just did so this Friday. I was handed a DVD by one of my friends filled with couple of crap on it but as I guessed earlier there was still hope to see some good stuff on it? It was Awakenings (1990) starring Robin Williams (one of my favorite actors) and also Robert De Niro. The story commences with a quick flashback of Leonard's childhood and kind of gives the reasons of his solitary and of course being so devoted to reading (as a symbol of knowledge) and next thing you know; Bang; it's 1969 (the poster of a Apollo 11 Armstrong on the moon surface tells is well ? of course it was July!!) and Robin Williams (Dr. Sayer) with all his unsociable behavior is marching in. He definitely prefers to work in a research lab than a hospital but anyhow he's employed in the hospital. He realizes that even those half dead creatures (syphilitic patients) were alive inside and he believed in that by his heart. Of course there was another reason, they answered as quick reflex to sudden moves. The patients are not happy and they're not bumped out either, they just don't realize the world. They're isolated. Suddenly Dr. Sayer finds out a solution for the illness and wakes the patients up from the long long term illusion. They're happy at first but it's darn hard to cope with the fact that they're wasted 30 years of their lives or that their parents were dead or... When a man steps into this world he expects freedom and that's what one of them, Leonard (Robert De Niro) expected the most. He also knew more than the others and he didn't seem to enjoy the entertainments of those folks, he preferred to go and find some love and he did. Of course the power all above the actions opposes any new kind of change because let's face it, bosses are stupid and they resist innovations. Leonardo is back to the world again but surprisingly he's the one who failed and didn't stand the situation of brand new world of the others! Now he's the "Little Prince" and gets started with taking the entire outside world in. Soon after he's not the only one who experiences the life for second time. The point is the Leonardo sees the world as it really is and it's hard to get along with so he gets through another revelation and hates the world, he wants out. Out of the prison and out of his world to see the truth that he's hoping for so and that's when he grabs the barred window and gazes the outside world to watch his beloved girl walk away for the last time while she seems looking back and not seeing him. It's like they got another awakening and this time it didn't seem as funny as the first time. At the end it turns out, it's the latter awakening that wins over the reality. They don't want it they get better (become like the rest of the people) but they never hang on the real world as they did for the first time. If you enjoy watching this picture, I guess you'd better check these out too: "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", "Dead Poet Society", "Little Prince ? the story", "Animal Farm?the story 'cause the movie sucks" or for some cases "Amelie Poulan" and "A Beautiful Mind".http://rushville.blogspot.com/2006/10/awakenings.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awakenings is the story of Dr Malcolm Sayer, played surprisingly well by Robin Williams, who discovers a way to wake up catatonic patients for whom there is thought to be no hope.One of the patients is Leonard Lowe (a great performance from Robert De Niro), and he, alongside the others who are 'awakened', celebrate the changes in their life and opportunities with great joy. There are great scenes where the patients come to grips with their new status, and make the most of their time, however brief.The problem is that of course this medication-induced rebirth is transient, and that there are no happy endings here. This makes the film a mix of celebratory love of life, and a deeply depressing conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an A+ film. I had extremely high expectations for it because of the two main men: Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. They definitely did not disappoint! I am often a fan of movies based on either a book or on a true story; I was in for a treat because this one is both! The film is medically accurate and intriguing without overdramatizing the real-life events. Robin Williams greatly portrays the shy, (clearly) genius, Dr. Sayer. And Robert De Niro does an amazing job of playing a catatonic patient, which I imagine would be amazingly difficult.I enjoyed how the film shows the audience how the medical field operated during the time period. Currently, in most hospitals, most doctors are unceasingly looking for the answers - the whys and the hows. They will not stop until they know why a patient reacts this way or how a patient ended up this way. In 1969... it was completely different and I appreciate that the film showed how different the world was without making it seem like doctors were barbaric and soulless creatures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A doctor discovers a drug to wake up catatonic patients.Starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro.Written by Oliver Sacks ( Novel) and Steven Zaillian ( Screenplay )Directed by Penny Marshall.This is superb!It ticks all of the boxes as to what a movie should be. To be honest I've had it on my Sky box for a few weeks and never really fancied watching it for some reason. But it really is worthy of as many accolades as it's been given.The story sucks you in right from the beginning and two two main actors are brilliant. I've seen a few De Niro films now and this is the best I've seen him by far. His portrayal of the first catatonic patient to wake up is worthy of an Oscar. I knew he was a great actor but this performance is top drawer. Robin Williams is brilliantly understated and together they are perfect castings.Awakenings is tearjerker and the plot won't have you on the edge of your seat, it will have you reaching for the tissues. It's an incredibly moving film. Well acted, well directed and with a great soundtrack. Brilliant!This could be an early favourite to be my favourite movie watched this year.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Will Awaken the Minds of Movie Lovers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awakenings is what I would call an underrated film despite a big-name duo and a slew of Oscar nominations. This drama is a little-seen movie about people who are given a second chance to see the world. I like how the film does not sugarcoat the story. Sure, there are intense moments of happiness, but that doesn't last and wasn't meant to be. The film is well-written, well-acted, and one of the most underrated film of the past 2 decades. Penny Marshall's film is about a new doctor who is given a ward full of catatonic patients. He is not happy what he sees and is given permission to administer a chemical drug. When the first patient, Leonard, awakens for the first time as an adult, Dr. Sayer realizes there could be hope for these patients. I thought the film was well-acted. Robert De Niro does a great job as Leonard as he represents a catatonic patient quite well both physically and mentally. Also doing a great job was Robin Williams. I think this could have been the first true film proving that Robin was just not a comedian. Overall, Awakenings is a great character study and it's a better film than I have anticipated. Another film that people should definitely try and see. The film will warm your heart, but it is also a kind of film that will make you sad as well. But this is certainly a good film to watch and I highly recommend it.My Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>De Niro plays the role of a patient (Leonard Lowe) with a neurological disorder (Encephalitis Lethargica AKA "sleepy sickness". The disease attacks the brain, leaving some victims in a statue-like condition, speechless and motionless; the cause of Encephalitis Lethargica is not know). He was treated by this doctor (Robin Williams), who used a psychoactive drug called L-DOPA during the treatment. The drug awoke Leonard.It's the true story of British neurologist Oliver Sacks (it's based on Oliver Sacks's 1973 memoir "Awakenings") and a great movie!(Curious stuff: between 1915 and 1926, an epidemic of Encephalitis Lethargica spread around the world; no recurrence of the epidemic has since been reported.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must be one of the few viewers in the minority who believe that Robin Williams (RIP) was a better dramatic actor than a comedian. I believe that this performance serves to confirm that. Playing opposite a very convincing Robert DeNiro, Williams turns in a top-notch performance as consistent and convincing as his roles in "Good Morning Viet Nam", "Dead Poets Society", "Moscow on the Hudson", and "Good Will Hunting". Both DeNiro and Willaims have taken on a variety of roles throughout their respective careers. Here, they assume the doctor-patient relationship and are very convincing. The storyline is very original and the tempo and flow of this film are both enjoyable. Julie Kavner turns in a really excellent supporting performance. A great story that was very well acted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert de Niro and Robin Williams make a great pair in this touching medical drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Penny Marshall, and starring Robert de Niro and Robin Williams (along with a few other familiar faces), AWAKENINGS is a wonderful film which explores the deep-seated human need for personal connections and the vitality they bring to life. Robert de Niro plays Leonard Lowe, a patient who has been catatonic for 30 years. Robin Williams plays Dr. Malcolm Sayer, a neurologist who works at the hospital where Leonard and many others like him are patients. The plot is about how Dr. Sayer treats these patients with an experimental drug and monitors how it affects them, with Leonard being his first/initial test case. At this point, I'll refrain from describing the plot. What needs to be said more than anything is that the character work by de Niro and Williams is some of the best I've seen from them, and really showed a devotion to their craft. In particular, de Niro stands out because his role as a catatonic patient probably required extreme physical discipline as well as having to internalize his character's thoughts a lot of the time. Robin Williams is also excellent as the introvert doctor who gradually comes to an awakening of his own. The film isn't particularly subtle about what the audience is supposed to take from these two parallel characters, but the subject is treated deftly and not spoon-fed. I also liked the insight into the workings of a hospital in the late 60's, and the interactions between the various members of the supporting cast. In particular, Julie Kavner (voices Marge on The Simpsons) gave a wonderful, understated performance as the head nurse, and who also develops a special bond with Dr. Sayer. The only minor complaint I have is that de Niro might have gone too method at a couple points in the film, with his characterization bordering on the cartoonish. Still, he manages to make his character accessible and sympathetic. Overall, I felt that this film was a sweet look at human interaction, love, and making up for lost time. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awakenings is one of the most heart-warming and amazing movies you will ever watch. The fact that it was based on a true story makes it doubly fascinating and brilliant. Robin Williams show us his dramatic ability in Awakenings, and Robert DeNiro's performance is probably one of the best acting jobs I have ever seen. I think one thing that makes this movie stand out is the amount of respect and empathy shown, in the direction, for all of the characters.., even the initially-resistant and conservative director of the hospital, played by William Heard. This must have been a difficult movie to execute, because some complex, abnormal psychology, as well as pathology, is involved. Technical lexicon is kept to a minimum, though, and handled in a very concise, comprehensible fashion. Julie Kavner's character, as the head nurse in the ward, is memorable. She shows that sometimes, kindness is the cure.A movie that compels us to use both our intuition and our analysis to a greater degree, Awakenings stands with very few other movies as a testament to the tenacity of the human spirit.</fullReview>

I am very pleased to say that this one was absolutely amazing. The fact that it is based on a true story makes it that much more brilliant. Robin Williams is a doctor who, when joining the staff of a hospital, tries a new medicine on the unresponsive patients that reside there. Although the staff has high hopes when the medicine seems to work, things may not be as wonderful as they appear to be. Robert De Nero is flawless in his role which was Oscar-Nominated and, as far as I'm concerned should have won. Be prepared to cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Leonard Does Not Have to Remain Lost"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Awakenings" can measure if you are asleep or awake.The "will of the ball" is one such test.In life, you can throw the ball to someone and no one is there (emotionally to catch it). Maybe the television is throwing the ball, and everyone is catching from there.In our political and social correct environment, some do not know if they are suppose to throw the ball, or, wait for someone else to throw the ball, or, if there is even a ball to throw anymore.Sometimes you resort to throwing the ball to yourself. It's not the same as someone throwing to you, or, you throwing to someone; but, at least the ball is getting thrown.Sometimes in such a time, people stop throwing the ball. Some people stop looking for a ball to be thrown to them. And if a ball does get thrown, it's as if it is a strange, yet, marvellous thing.Though some may not even try to catch the ball. Maybe, it has been so long, they don't care to play "catch" or "ball" anymore. Some may resent it took so long for a ball to be thrown they let it drop to the floor; others may catch it only to throw it violently back at you. But, at least the ball is being thrown.People being "awakened" by the "will of someone else" reminds me of Ecclesiastes 4:9-12. "Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken." We can strengthen each other. Someone may be down and someone come along and say, "Come on, lets..." and that person may get up only because of the will (strength) of the other. Some commit suicide because they are at the end of their strength, and at that moment, the will of another does not strengthen them to continue on.Having people to throw the ball to you, and people you can throw the ball to gives life to life.It was sad to see these people "awakened" and seeking life, only to go back to sleep. Some things came to my mind. I have been "awakened." Everyday, whether any human throws a ball to me, I have many balls thrown to me. I don't just mean a sunrise, or a sunset, or the color of the leaves changing; though I catch these. It's not just the majesty of mountains or the peace of the ocean; though I catch these. It's not just the ever-changing formation of clouds in the sky, or an orange moon rising in the night sky; though I catch these. These things come from the same source, but it is the Source (Jesus Christ) whom my will is one with. He is my strength. Of all things in this world, His will is greater; His strength is greater - and I am joined to Him and He is joined to me - and He throws many balls - as many as I want, as many as I need, at any time I need them, at any time and at all times. He is always there ready for me to catch. I can throw to Him at any time and at all times.I thought of the people being "awakened" and finding life, only to go back to sleep. Ephesians 5:14 says, "...awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light." Jesus said to "...take heed...watch...lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping." Mark 13:36.In this life, we are born apart from life. We are born with a physical life, but that life ends in death. We must be born again.In the course of our natural life we mature. We may "awaken" along the course of life to things at each stage of maturity. But they only remind me of those being "awakend" only to go back into a state of sleep unto death. The cruel irony of man who "awakens" only to find he ends in eternal death. He may have sought life in things; he may have thrown the ball in life and caught the ball in life and lived to the fullness that life can give, and die, and "awaken" in eternal death. He never "awakened" to eternal life in Jesus Christ. He never caught the ball thrown from Jesus.Jesus said, "For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul." Matthew 16:26.In "Awakening" the soul of man is seen lost. He awakens to life, only to lose his life again. "Leonard" wanted to keep his life; he wanted to be alive, he wanted to live; and, yet, we see him go back into a lost condition.We, the soul of man, are born "Leonard"; but, our soul does not have to remain lost; for Jesus said, "...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost." Luke 19:10."Leonard" in the greater sense is still lost; but "Leonard" does not have to remain lost - he can be found.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never cared for Robert De Niro very much. After watching Awakenings, I realised that this was actually the greatest of compliments to his acting, for what I really didn't like were the characters he played.In Awakenings, De Niro plays Leonard Lowe, a middle-aged patient who has been catatonic since contracting an illness in childhood. Doctor Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) tries the experimental drug L-Dopa on him, and he wakes from his catatonia to discover that over 40 years have passed. However, the effects of the drug turn out to be temporary, and Leonard - and the other patients similarly awakened - slip back into catatonia.This story - at first sight, perhaps a riff on Flowers For Algernon - is a fictionalised version of a true story, which makes it all the more heartbreaking: these people, to the extent that they are still living, remain in the same catatonic condition. Should be we be pleased or distraught that they were wakened to enjoy this brief window of life.De Niro (and Williams) are both phenomenal, playing parts which are completely contrary to the sorts of part they had played up until that point in their careers. In both cases, this was something out of the blue and, in both cases, it woke me up to what remarkable talents these two men are (which is not to ignore Julie Kavner - Marge Simpson pulls one out of the bag, too).This film is uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time, and is thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Awakenings" was one of several movies in which Robin Williams play a man with his own ideas about how to do things, which may or may not unnerve his superiors (others include "Good Morning, Vietnam", "Dead Poets Society" and "Patch Adams"). In this case, he plays Dr. Malcolm Sayer, looking at catatonic patients in 1969 New York. While catatonic, these patients can catch a ball if you throw it at them. This leads him to look into how he can cure them.This shows that when he tries, Williams certainly can do very well in drama. Equally good is Robert DeNiro, as Dr. Sayer's patient Leonard Lowe. Showing an unusual ability to play a non-mobster role, DeNiro really does make you feel for Leonard.Overall, it's a very well done movie. Given that Penny Marshall started out as either LaVerne or Shirley (I've never seen that show, so I don't know which), we might think that she'd never be able to direct a serious movie, but she certainly can. A great movie. Also starring Julie Kavner, Ruth Nelson, John Heard, Penelope Ann Miller, Alice Drummond, Max von Sydow, and even a very young Vin Diesel.</fullReview>

I especially was emotionally touched when the mother was upset that Deniro was no longer a catatonic dependent. It was like he was a teenager all over again. The song that she sings to him is priceless, and his sweet demeanor and relationship with her could bring one to tears. Most importantly, Can anyone tell me if Danica Mckellar was an extra in the movie Awakenings? You might remember her as Whinny from the Wonder Years with Fred Savage. Awakenings is one of my favorite movies, and I have seen it several times. In the scene where Williams takes Deniro for an outing to the ocean, the camera scans the crowd to a young girl who looks exactly like Danica. However, IMDb doesn't list Awakenings as one of her films. Can anyone help me out, I'm dying to know!!</fullReview>

Robin Williams and Robert De Niro again illustrate how old pros can handle challenging roles convincingly. I can't imagine this film doing a lot of business at the box office; there's nothing to appeal to teens. And there is probably little to win over the critics, currently enamored of the likes of Reece Witherspoon. But don't miss this superb film. It will appeal to your mind and tear your heart out.

Williams gives an extraordinary performance as Dr. Malcolm Sayer. Sayer is a physician who had spent his entire medical career doing research. He feels unprepared and overwhelmed for his new post as staff physician at a psychiatric facility. But he is a caring and sensitive man who is unwilling to let patients in the "garden" lead the rest of their lives as unwilling statues. His relentless pursuit of new therapies and drugs aimed at releasing his patients from their bodily prisons will easily leave you in tears.

		<fullReview>I approached this movie differently from most people, because I'm a nurse and I worked with patients receiving experimental chemotherapy. I was absolutely floored at the sensitivity and talent that so accurately presented the desperate clutching at hope, the anger and grief when the response is less than ideal, and even the patient's own concentration on the physician learning from the process. The line about "get the camera" was completely true to life. (Nearly every patient I personally explained an experimental protocol to, who signed consent, said something like "even if it doesn't help me, maybe you'll learn something that will help someone else.") Everyone involved performed superbly. Two comic legends, Robin Williams and Anne Meara, played straight roles with tenderness and a touch of pathos. Steven Zaillian should have won the Oscar he was nominated for for the screenplay. Randy Newman's music set the mood for each scene perfectly. Penny Marshall was robbed, I have no idea why she wasn't even nominated as Best Director.Hollywood does not have a good track record with medical themes, much less mental health themes. This is a jewel of an exception and deserved much more hoopla than it received.</fullReview>

He stars as somewhat of a paralyzed man that is stuck in therapeutic hospital in New York. Robert Williams plays his doctor and in most of Williams' movies he portrays as innocent looking character. The movie is very touching where patients like Deniro get in touch with reality once again after years of being in a comatose state. Deniro played an excellent role in this movie and in general is a great actor. The way he portrays one of Oliver Sacks(The real life doctor who tend to those patients) patients is magnificent. But from being able to walk and talk again then suddenly going back to becoming a vegetable is really depressing. The movie is optimistic with finding a cure for these patients though unfortunately they couldn't remain normal for long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One frustratingly tragic step from greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fascinating source material probably deserves half of the credit in this case, it was a great film waiting to be made. This said, especially Deniro, who sadly since this film has almost constantly taken roles beneath him or gone over the top in roles he obviously didn't even understand or was taking for the money, is fantastic in what I'd argue has been to date his last great dramatic performance. Not that he might not do it again with the right material but that seems less and less likely. All departments, directing, music, acting are first rate. The trouble is that in a film this great in so many ways there is a central dramatic and potentially horrifying question the film doesn't even ask. This could be considered a minor spoiler if you want to stop reading but it really isn't. Anyway the central issue here is do these "frozen" patients who are "unfrozen" by this miracle medication remember what has been happening during their years in "freeze" If they did or do "feel" what is going on while "frozen" do they think, then they deserve to be treated as human beings, or you could argue deserve to be put out of the misery rather than suffer so cruelly. It seems to be too important a question and deep a one for the filmmakers to want to deal with. A cowardly stance that robs the film from that step into one of the greats. A real shame. Or more disturbingly no one even thought to ask the question, or the answer was cut out of either the script of the final film. Too bad, but too much good stuff here to miss, especially for Deniro fans who want to see him really act again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Awakenings" is more than just two brilliant actors casted in something that might first look like a cheap over sentimental Saturday night movie. This movie tells a story of hope, a story of courage,... It's the true story of Dr. Malcolm Sayer and he believe in an awakening of his patients. It's hard to say which actor gave the best performance in this movie. Robin Williams as well as Robert De Niro were both amazing. I love Williams the most when he plays characters like Dr. Sayer. Those intimate portraits of truly good and honest men, like Sean in "Good Will Hunting". Brilliant! Robert De Niro was great as well. Touching and a bit a sad role as well, but nevertheless truly great. "Awakenings" is by far Penny Marshall's best movie as well. I also like the double meaning of the title, at least I suppose it has two meanings. It the first place, the awakenings refers to the patients who awake from their 'non-active' state. But it think the title also refers to the people who are taking care of the patients and I think Robin Williams mentioned it in the movie as well. When those patients awake, after a while the realise that they have missed quite some time of their own life. They didn't experience a lot of things, things that might not seem that important, but nothing is less true. And by seeing what those patients missed, the other people realize what is really important in life and how lucky they are that they really have a life and can experience it as well.But that's only how I see it. Moving and brilliantly acted by both leading actors. A must see! 8,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of the very best dramas on film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the film several times before and when I was at Wal-Mart over the weekend, trolling as usual in their dump bins for cheap films, I found a VHS copy. Sat down to watch it again last night. First, the music: I have adored almost everything master Newman has penned all these years he's been at the ivories. There are only a few of his caliber in the States who can reach the depths of emotion on so many levels. His soundtrack has always had a very warm place in my heart and one can just enjoy it on it's own and return to it over and over.The actors: if I had to choose the manic versus the subdued Robin Williams I'd say that his quiet and controlled energies are even more overpowering than his ability to make us laugh right down to the bottom of mirth. If there has been a more effective part where he has brought into being a more humane and vulnerable person than I have not seen it.De Niro: what can you say about this man? He has no limits to what he can imagine and project. His portrayal of the tortured adult with a strange illness is so incredible that when he "awakens" we just have to cry with joy.The rest of the cast are perfect in all ways. This is a film that I come back to when I need to feel centered, need to be reminded what life is worth living for. This and "Contact" often help me get back to that point where life is livable. It is certainly one of the greatest films of all time and the only person I bow to with more humility would be the loving soul of Dr. Oliver Saks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin WIlliams and Robert DeNiro. A seemingly unusual on-screen duo for a drama movie come together to create some of the best acting in film history. Williams plays an anti-social doctor who, in desperate need of work, takes a job as a doctor at a chronic hospital facility. As his job goes on, he relentlessly tries to figure out what is wrong with most of his patients. One in particular is a man named Leonard (DeNiro). He uses the compassionate stories of his patients to encourage people to fund his quest to find a cure. A very powerful story with superb acting make this movie a must see for anyone. To a lot of people this movie is a sleeper, so if you haven't heard it, don't let it discourage you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Awakenings" is one of my favorite films, and I would like to point out that it was released in 1990, seven years before "Good Will Hunting." Those who think Robin Williams' performance is a rehash of "GWH," (and I notice that there are several) have it backwards."GWH" is enjoyable and worthwhile in its own right; but it seems to me that "Awakenings" takes time to breathe, and has a quiet charm and dignity that is far too scarce in our gotta-have-it-all, gotta-do-it-now existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Learning What's Important In Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie several years ago (shortly after its release) and remember at the time not being particularly enthusiastic about it. The passage of time must have done something to my sensibilities because I've just had the opportunity to see it again and this time I was quite taken with the film.The movie is a true story based on the work of Dr. Malcolm Sayer, a New York neurologist who discovers a potential treatment for patients who have lived in a catatonic state due to encephalitis and succeeds in "awakening" several of them during the summer of 1969. The story is emotional and tugs at the heart as we deal with the joy of the patients at being awakened, but also at their grief in discovering the passage of time (some have been in this state for almost 40 years), their own aging and the deaths of those they loved. Finally, there is the fear they feel as the experimental drug begins to lose its effect on them and they face losing the lives they have just begun to rediscover.There are good performances in this movie. Robert Deniro was excellent as Leonard Lowe, the first patient treated and reawakened by Sayer, and around whom the movie revolves. Robin Williams put on an effective performance as Dr. Sayer, a shy man who would be happier in a lab than dealing with flesh and blood patients, who learns much from these special patients about the value of life and how to live it. There's also a strong supporting cast including the likes of John Heard (Dr. Kaufman) and Julie Kavner (Nurse Eleanor.) This certainly isn't an "action pic," and if you're looking for edge of your seat excitement you should look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a movie with a strong emotional pull and a solid life lesson, "Awakenings" might well be the one.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>****1/2 out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A true story based on the research of one doctor who wanted to make a difference (a subdued Robbin Williams in what could be his most heart felt role to date). Williams plays a doctor who believes that patients with a disease that makes them pretty much dead on the outside are still alive on the inside. He researches day and night on the disease and finds a drug made for parkensins disease that may just be the cure. Robert De Niro, a treat for the eyes as always, is the first to be giving the drug and the results will melt your heart and break it at the same time. One of the saddest scenes is where De Niro's mom walks into the room and sees her son cured and they hug for the first time in a very lon while, powerful stuff. Not exactly 100% accurate to what really happened but Williams and De Niro are perfect together and everyone who liked Patch Adams but thought Williams didn't take the character seriously enough will eat this movie up. A must see for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breakthrough In The Bronx</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Second time I've seen this and the last time was probably about 9 or 10 years ago. Such a difference the years made. I now have a much greater appreciation for filmmaking, for good writing, for fine acting performances. I can truly today say about this - what a fabulous movie. Most of it, at least. I had this feeling that everything was working so nearly perfect. For about the first 45 minutes this movie had me glued to the screen. Unbelievable but very sad. Then came the miracle of L-Dopa. Wow. All of a sudden a man made a breakthrough, one that no one in the hospital ever imagined. From a powerful setup to this powerful moment of hope, Penny Marshall and cast were working a bit of magic. One little thing that was on my mind, though, was the fact that directing such a powerful movie very early on in her career wasn't the best move. Everything was working so nearly perfect, as I said, but just not quite there... almost but it just missed by a hair. Had she directed this movie now or someone more established took a shot at it then, then maybe it could have gotten a solid A+. It didn't suffer...at least not much. After the L-Dopa breakthrough, for awhile there, it kinda got a little loose which I didn't think was so great. Previously things were so tight, so mesmerizing, it had me so sucked in, so interested in the story. Then everyone was up and around and on a field trip and in came in Penelope Ann Miller as a character that should have had more to do with the story. For a little while there is la di da di da, what happened to this really powerful story? It did come back, thankfully, and through everything Robin Williams was magnificent. Amazing how he's normally one of the funniest men in all of show business but here he is as this socially inept, nerdy scientist doctor... who had that hope that things could be fixed even when every outside factor was against something better. Twice as magnificent as Robin Williams was Mr. De Niro's part in this. Totally wow. There are VERY few actors who could have played that character so incredibly. He is a pro and this proves it. All in all an excellent movie despite its inconsistency. Wonderful performances. A story that basically wouldn't let me go. I'm giving this a grade of: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Penny Marshall is an excellent director &amp; "Awakenings" is proof of that. She did a wonderful job bringing this true story to the screen. A lot of attention was paid to depict the years this story took place (Bronx streets circa 1969 was wonderfully nostalgic). Robin Williams gives a great performance as a clumsy, nebbish doctor who has zero clinical/people skills. His experience has been mainly in research. He reluctantly takes a position as a doctor in a Bronx hospital where there are several people in a catatonic state, some for decades. Researching their files he sees they have all had encephalitis. He must endure many obstacles, to get his superiors to allow a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease on these patients, because the symptoms are similar. Robert DeNiro's character is the first to be treated with the drug (L-dopa). His mom (the late Ruth Nelson) has been at his side since he was a child inflicted with this illness. He is successfully "awakened" after 30 years. Imagine the devastation plus exhilaration of going to sleep as a child &amp; waking up a man. With so many years gone, this is a person who truly feels blessed &amp; just the thought of going for a walk alone would be the most joyous experience in the world to him. Robin Williams' character is also "awakened" but in a different sense. He becomes friends with his patient &amp; gets close to a kind nurse, played by Julie Kavner, through these events. Julie Kavner (Brenda Morgenstern/the voice of Marge Simpson) as nurse Eleanor Costello is very impressive. Her part is not big but it's pivotal in bringing the doctor out of his self-contained shell. She's so subtle &amp; touching as an ordinary woman in the midst of a modern day miracle. As the drugs eventually &amp; unfortunately wear off, Robert DeNiro's excellent, heartbreaking performance as he plunges beck into his disease is very difficult to watch. Especially after seeing these people talk, walk, laugh, cry, hug loved ones, experience feelings of romance, &amp; dance for a much too brief time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film alerted me to the diagnosis of a real patient.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a retired internist. Several years ago, doing consultative volunteer work in another country, I saw an elderly man who lay immobile and rigid in bed, unable to speak, choking on secretions which he could not swallow and which could not be cleared adequately by suction. He had pneumonia and was critically ill despite antibiotic and supportive treatment. He'd been immobile for a long time and his doctor's presumptive diagnosis was some sort of dementia. I had never seen this condition before, with total body rigidity, but I had seen "Awakenings" and my memory of the remarkable portrayal prompted me to suggest to his physician that he give a trial of anti-Parkinson's medication, which he did.The next day I was stunned on entering the patient's room to find him propped up and smiling alertly. He said "Good morning, doctor," as I recall, and was able to overcome his pneumonia, able to eat, to converse, and to be helped easily to move.Unfortunately, after about a week or so, as I recall, his locked-in syndrome relapsed despite medication. However, the movie had helped me to make the proper diagnosis and to bring at least some brief comfort into a desperately ill person's life.DiNiro's portrayal was absolutely outstanding. Williams also was superb, as usual. And kudos also to the perceptive doctor who was the inspiration for the story, as well as to the entire wonderful production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife called to tell me Patch Adams was on TV. After a few minutes I saw Robert De Niro. "De Niro wasn't in 'Patch Adams' was he?"And so my awakening began! I soon realized that this film wasn't the one I thought, but by then I had become captivated by it...Well, you can never forget De Niro was in 'Awakenings'. A performance which is so convincing you will not avoid being affected by it. Williams also delivers the very best of character acting, supported by a wonderful cast. How I wish we saw more of this kind of sensitivity in our film culture. Few films illustrate the emotions of joy, zest for life, compassion, frustration, longing and tragic farewell so convincingly, totally engrossing the viewer in the world of these people. Films like this elevate the soul and help us re-evaluate, instead of concentrating of the destructive and base.Few other movies have affected me so profoundly, but I would like to mention 'The Color Purple', 'October Sky', '(Freak) The Mighty', 'The Hurricane' and the classic 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Watch all these films in the same weekend and you'll be reduced to a mass of emotional jelly! (But you'll be better for it!)Just like the patients felt cheated of life, I felt a little cheated that I hadn't known of this marvelous film until now. An experience I will cherish - and repeat on occasion, when I feel that I need to be reminded of what's important in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Penny Marshall climbed her steps with this movie, which grabs the true story of catatonic patients who were awaken from their apatic state to life due to a Parkinson's disease medicine. The movie has its pace, and is crafted with special care. Williams is once more the portrait of the sensitive and shy person that can be decisive at some times. The supporting actors are all top-notch. But fact is that this movie wouldn't be the same without that walking, talking legend that is Robert de Niro, who gives one of his best performances ever as one of the patients who manages to grasp life once more. His technique is perfected to the point that we can't imagine him stopping after the end of the take. And has he? During his time on screen, he gives one of the most difficult actor's work to ever be achieved, and it's a shame that he didn't get the oscar that year. The moments when he is half-way between illness and health are among the best performances ever. A definite tear-jerker, it will break you heart, but is a great test to director Marshall and she comes out really nice. Kudos to Randy Newman's touchingly epic score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the best movie of the 1990's. I couldn't believe it. I was so impressed, this is in my top ten films. Robin Williams was outstanding as real life Dr. Malcolm Sayer, this is his best movie. I also really liked Julie Kavner as Eleanor Costello, and how she was constantly trying to befriend Dr. Sayer.But of course, Robert De Niro was absolutely magnificent! This was his most diverse roll, and (in my opinion) is tied with Raging Bull as his acted movie. He was *so* convincing as Leonard Lowe, Dr. Sayer's first patient to awaken. The scene where he tells Penelope Ann Miller goodbye and that he won't be able to see her any more, that was the saddest scene I've ever seen in a movie.I had a similar misfortune with a family member who came out of a coma, so this movie is a very personal film to me, and it will always be one of my favorite movies. I recommend this movie to everyone! It is the saddest, and at the same time, most breathtaking movie I've ever seen.

		<fullReview>In one of his finest and most understated performances, Robin Williams portrays real-life doctor/author Oliver Sacks (changed the name for the script to Martin Strayer), who used the drug L-dopa to bring patients in a virus-induced vegetative state back to consciousness. Prior to taking the job at a Bronx hospital for incurables, the shy, recluse Dr. Strayer worked only as a research physician in laboratories. Unsatisfied with the status quo at the hospital, Strayer manages to uncover a common cause for the condition of a group of unresponsive patients, and finds a drug that brings them out of their state. Robert DeNiro superbly plays Strayer's first patient, a victim of this condition since childhood, who is the first to be "awakened." As the patients regain consciousness, the introverted doctor Strayer also manages to come out the world of plants and opera he is trapped in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Huge Spoilers Ahead--STOP READING UNLESS YOU DON'T MIND SEEING A HUGE SPOILER!!! I WARNED YOU!!! "Awakenings" is a pretty good movie and I do recommend you see it. I just think that the film is a tad overrated. Most of my feelings about this are because, ultimately, all the miraculously revived patients fell right back asleep! I know this is a big spoiler--but it might make it so many won't even want to bother with the film. However, on the plus side, at least they didn't give the film a phony happy ending--since it is based on a true story.Robin Williams is very nice in a non-comedic role. He plays a doctor who has a unit of supposedly hopeless cases. These folks have a weird disease (encephilitis) that makes them zombie-like. However, instead of giving up on these poor folks, he decided to try again and again to revive them. He is successful, to a point.Much of the pleasure in watching the film is seeing the folks reconnect with the world as well as the fine acting. But, as I said above, a short time later, they all fell back into their stupor--where they remained until death. This makes for a MEGA-depressing movie--something odd, since the film is billed as quite the opposite. Worth seeing but a real downer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 'awakening' experience regarding the value of life ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Penny Marshall's "Awakenings" had one effect on me, it's certainly to make me think about life. Not as an existential notion, but as daily physical condition. We take for granted our capability to walk, to speak, to eat, to drink, to think by ourselves, to be able to control our movements, our choices and decisions, but have we ever questioned the significance of these little things? To a certain extent, the word 'awakening' doesn't only relate to Dr. Sayer's patients but also to the viewers.Robin Williams plays Dr. Sayer, a shy and amiable physician who's hired in a Bronx hospital to take care of catatonic patients although he's more used to handle animal living forms. Dr. Kaufman (John Heard), one of the executives can see that and is reluctant to hire him, but the patients need a doctor so he just knocked at the right door. But the first act only provides sorrowing sights of patients stuck in an immobile position, incapable of making the slightest gesture, let alone communicating. The ward is named 'the garden' in reference to their vegetative state; indeed, they live like plants do, and even animals have much richer lives. All the patients survived the 1917-1928 epidemic of encephalitis lethargy, a strange epidemic that quickly disappeared but plunged its survivors in a strange comatose state, despite a period of brief recovery.One of the film's most haunting images is the archive footage shot of a person extending her arm with a sort of crisped and desperate look in the face, the mouth wide open, the patient is like asking for something, help maybe? Is that human being even thinking, asks Dr. Sayer, disturbed as we probably are by those images. No, retorts the retired Dr. Ingham who treated them (played by Max Von Sydow). Why not? Because the alternative would be unthinkable! In other words, the very idea that these creatures would be capable of thoughts or sheer awareness but incapable to express them, like caged in their own body, would be properly intolerable. Maybe Ingham is right but then how about these little signs that Sayer starts to notice during his extensive study.The pivotal moment occurs when he treats a patient named Lucy (Alice Drummond) he notices that she caught her eyeglasses before they fell in the ground. Later, it appears that not only Lucy but also all the comatose patients are capable to catch a ball thrown at them. It's a reflex, suggests Kaufman, the reflex, according to Sayer, would be to bat the ball away. Sayer is convinced that there is still life inside the patients, that the sickness spared their faculties, only they don't have the will and can only borrow it, like the stone-face Lucy borrowed the 'will of the ball'. Sayer's colleagues concur that the theory is absurd, but it makes an impact on Nurse Costello (Julie Kavner) who encourages Sayer to go further in his investigation.Sayer focuses then on the case of Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) a man in his fifties, comatose since his early teens. Mrs. Lowe (Ruth Nelson) takes care of him everyday, resigned that she's the mother of a man sentenced to be a perpetual baby. But she admits she can communicate with him, not with words of course, but a language Dr. Sayer would understand if he had children. Sayer sure agrees with her, especially on the fact that Leonard can communicate. He proceeds to a graphical record of the electrical activity in his brain, and the resulting graph shows one peak, occurred when Sayer said his name. The 'will of the ball' theory was a fiasco but this discovery is Sayer's first little victory. He knows he's on his way.And step-by-step, the researches of Dr Sayer will lead to a theory assimilating the symptoms of his patients to an extreme stage of Parkinson disease where the movements are so acute that they cancel each other out. With the permission of Mrs. Lowe, he experiments the L- Dopa, the medicine used for Parkinsonism, on Leonard, with various dosages. Tired of waiting, Sayers almost turns to a half-doctor and half sorcerer's apprentice, he tries the highest dose on Leonard and the results are immediate and spectacular, almost miraculous. Leonard awakens from his state and is like born again, he can hardly speak but it doesn't matter because the magnificent smile on his face says enough. The eyes still have the innocence of a child, a man whose adulthood was stolen, and the smile sweeps off Dr. Ingham's theory: Leonard knows and understands what he's recovering from.The film takes a magical and delightful turn into happiness and rediscovery while we follow, not only Leonard, but all the patients, awakening, learning to speak, to feel things again, to eat, to control their emotions, to live and to love. It's funny, inspiring, touching and carried by two wonderful performances by both Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. De Niro's eyes and smiles convey an exhilarating attachment to life that would confine to a heart-breaking desperateness when some secondary effects moderating the enthusiasm of the first results would appear; it's one of De Niro's very best performances. On the other hand Williams's timidity, in the polar opposite of all the characters he played, enriches the film with another dimension, a realization about the little things that make life worth living: such abstractions like friendship, respect or love.It's precisely in the name of friendship, respect and love that no sickness can dehumanize a person. That's the inspirational message and eye-opening vision of "Awakenings". The film was Oscar-nominated for Best Picture, Best Writing and Best Acting in a Leading Role (Robert De Niro), it's based on a true story, and it's hard to imagine that miracles like this could happen, but they do. In fact, the simple act of living is a miracle by itself that we should value every day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb film that will make you cry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Awakenings" (1990) is a film by veteran and master director Penny Marshall. This is the type of film that works all the way around - from the strong screenplay by Steven Zaillian (who also penned "Schindler's List"), to the strong acting by Robin Williams as the shy Dr. Sayer who helps to diagnose a certain catatonic state by 15 patients in a hospital, including the first to be given the diagnosis and treatment that causes his "awakening" - Robert De Niro in one of his strongest and emotional role as Leonard Lowe. To accompany the already strong elements listed above is the emotional charged score by Randy Newman. All of this will be sure to cause you to shed at least one tear by the film's end. A true gem - 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was probably fourteen or fifteen when I saw this film. Sometimes, especially on Saturdays the Dutch TV channel that we could see although living in Germany (but close to the Dutch border) would show films in their original version with Dutch subtitles. And I distinctly remember seeing Awakenings. There were two scenes that stuck to my memory ever since. Number one: the scene where Robin Williams recites the poem by Rainer Maria Rilke. Although it was only the English translation of this German poem, I immediately understood the beauty of it and the analogy to the Robert DeNiro character. I also remember going to the library on the following Monday and borrowing a book with poems by Rilke. I learned the poem off by heart and I can still quote it. Number two: The scene where Robert DeNiro wants to leave the hospital and go for a walk. I really felt like crying when I saw this scene. It made me think how blessed all of us are who do not suffer from any malign disease. Thanks to God I am OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary &amp; poignant tale of dual awakenings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an absolutely magnificent and incredibly moving story, all the more poignant since fact based, and an under rated, lesser known movie for its two stars, Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro.The film chronicles the tale of a shy young research neurologist, Dr. Malcolm Sayer, who obtains a position in a Bronx mental hospital, which houses a number of catatonic patients, victims of an encephalitis epidemic several decades earlier. After some observations on its inadvertent effects on a patient, Dr. Sayer experimentally tries the Parkinson drug, L-dopa on a patient named Leonard Lowe, with amazing results. Leonard awakens from his coma, reconnects with his ecstatic mother whom he hasn't known since a teenager, eagerly embraces the simplest of pleasures in his new world, and even embarks upon a romance with a girl visiting the facility. Dr. Sayer moves on to treat other patients as well, with similar results. The formerly catatonic victims awaken to a new life and flabbergasted relatives, though these patients must now readjust to their much older age, their missed years, and sometimes news of family members who have passed away or spouses who have divorced them during these intervening years. However, all is not well for these patients and their newfound life. Leonard begins to develop side effects, ever increasing tics, and alas, his awakening is short lived. The effects of the drug wear off within two or three months, and, sadly, the patients revert back to their former catatonic state.The performances of the two stars, both extremely versatile actors, are beyond stellar. Robert DeNiro is amazing in his portrayal of Leonard, both in his catatonic state and later as the eager but vulnerable adult given new life, only to realize tragically that it is to be quickly snatched away. Indeed, as another also noted, the scene where Leonard has his first (and last) dance with his new love is one of the saddest in all the movie world. Although DeNiro was nominated, he fully deserved to win an Oscar for his performance in this movie.Robin Williams is also endearing as the bashful, somewhat reclusive Dr. Sayer. Indeed, this is a tale of two awakenings. Not only do we see the patients aroused from their catatonic slumber, but the doctor, hitherto wrapped up in his solitary earthworm research and experiencing little meaningful human interaction, is also awakened socially and emotionally by his experiences. He develops a heartfelt emotional bond with his patients, especially Leonard, and even warms to a potential romance himself (or at least a good friendship) with the nurse, Eleanor Costello, who has shared his experiences, the joys and the sorrows, with these unfortunate patients.Great supporting cast, including Julie Kavner as Eleanor. My hat goes off to the film's director, Penny Marshall, who for me always remains Laverne, star of her old TV series, Laverne and Shirley!It's unfortunate, as another also commented, that someone sneaked in an f-word, so inappropriate for this film. I guess modern cinema simply cannot manage without.This is a poignant tearjerker, to be sure, but comes across as an uplifting and inspiring story rather than, as you might picture, a depressing one. These adults were given new life and their loved ones were able to reconnect, however briefly. It teaches us to appreciate our own lives and our loved ones, enjoying each day to the fullest. Though it's certainly a tragic, heartbreaking, and seemingly cruel ending for these patients and their families, the personal transformation of the shy doctor leaves some sense of fulfillment. This film should have received a lot more attention and credit. It's one of the best roles for both its extremely talented and deservedly famous stars, DeNiro and Williams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a forgotten De Niro performance in an unforgettable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is really a forgotten gem. It portrays the humanity of a group of doctors, that is inspired by the compassionate Dr.Sayer. They manage to revive a group of living statues from catatonicism including Leonard Lowe, a boy who lost 30 years of his film from childhood to a mystery disease that has paralysed his mind.However, as they become human beings again they find it difficult to assimilate back into normal life. They struggle to cope with the new world around them, yet they remind the doctors and the hospital staff what life is really about. The simple things that are neglected are what really matter, which is beautifully recreated by the recovering patients. We, as human beings always try to find difficult and complex solutions to our lives - what we always neglect are the basics, the fundamental parts of life - freedom, health, friendship; and these are what need to be addressed within our lives for true happiness.This film was extremely poignant and touching without being over sentimental and patronising. De Niro and Williams capture the great beauty of the human spirit that lies within us - that inspires compassion, love and care. This film is extremely profound and really made me rethink my life. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The outstanding beauty of this true story lies in the extreme originality in performance of the main actors. Only at the end of the movie could I sit back and say ` Wow, Williams and De Niro are really great actors'. Throughout the movie the sensation one gets is that of living the honest emotions of two determined men, and friends, in a world in which many would rather not communicate their true feelings.On one side, a Medical doctor, Malcolm Sayer, convinced he can `resurrect' his encephalitic patients, in a role similar to Williams' - `Will Hunting'.On the other side the first of those patients to be cured, Leonard , in another proof by De Niro of his ability to fit into those roles which require the reviving of lived emotions ? see `Men of Honor' and `The Untouchables'. Surely two of the best actors these days.The music is just perfect, fitting into the emotional flow of the movie; feel Dr. Sayer as he walks through his cured patients, a very intense scene.Beyond the movie one can see criticism of a society darkened by its eventual enlighteners, armed with a cure suitable enough in satisfying their interests The movie is unnecessarily lengthened by attempts to show the revived patients regain pleasure in their former hobbies. Overall the contribution to a better social build-up is one which requires much thanks.Rating : *** (3/5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Story Tear-jerker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are introduced to a young man who later becomes a pivotal character, in an incredibly moving and true story. The character is Leonard Lowe, played with intelligence, compassion and wisdom by Robert De Niro. Leonard develops a degenerative illness, which affects the functions of the brain to send signals to the body. It is like being trapped inside a body that cannot listen and cannot communicate, but still exists on another sphere. It is scary to imagine that we could be locked away so easily, for being misunderstood, misinterpreted or overlooked.The film awakens our understanding for sufferers of this rare disease that affected a generation of people, and has now affected us, the viewers. Penny Marshal has directed this incredible, haunting movie with vision. She develops the drama in such a way that we cannot help being affected by the lives of each of these characters. To know there is life under the surface of these seemingly vegetative patients, is horrifying and, at the same time, incredible. Robert De Niro gives an incredible screen performance. His contrast in emotions, coupled with clever directing, leaves you feeling sad, overjoyed and shattered. Robin Williams touches us with his portrayal of a man with almost painful social awkwardness and naivete, contrasting with the genius of his medicine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a ripoff of the movie Charlie, except this time instead of one Charlie there's an entire ward full of Charlies. The movie does have a certain charm, but in total the story is contrived and is heaped in sentimentality. The acting is good, but the story is engrossed in wishful thinking and the principal characters are stereotypes. There is the sensitive doctor (played by Robin Williams), the long-suffering patient (played by Robert De Niro), the concerned relatives, the skeptical doctor, the nice orderlies, the supportive nurses, the eccentric patients - all hokey, all contrived, none believable. Literary license if given free reign in this transparent attempt to evoke audience response. Absent in this movie are the day-to-day mundane, yet critical, routines that characterize health care, especially in large institutions. Nor does the movie deal with the ethical or clinical implications of the kind of distorted doctor-patient interactions or of the medical experimentation depicted in this movie. This movie is another attempt by Hollywood to dramatize a topical issue - in this case medical ethics. The results are mixed. Nevertheless, given the nature of the story, which is about a doctor truly wanting to do something good, and failing, it is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Performances by DeNiro and Williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awakenings (1990) **** (out of 4) Incredibly powerful drama based on a true story about Dr. Sayer (Robin Williams) who gets a job at a mental hospital where many patients are suffering from some sort of catatonic disease that leaves them motionless. Sayer begins to experiment on a man named Leonard (Robert DeNiro) who hasn't moved in over thirty-years but soon the drug works and brings the man out of this state. This is an extremely fascinating and at times very depressing tale that works on several levels. One level is that we can look at Leonard and ask ourselves what life would be life if it was taken away for thirty years, given back to us for a short period only to have it taken away. This is where the film remains the most powerful because Leonard is someone we can feel sorry for but at the same time his level of wonder is something that we can all hope for. DeNiro's performance here gained him an Oscar-nomination and it's certainly one of the strongest of his career, which is saying quite a bit considering how many great performances he has out there. What makes this one so special is that when we think of DeNiro it's that tough guy but here he brings so much heart and passion to Leonard that we quickly fall in love with him and care for everything that's going to happen. All the various ranges and emotions this character goes through is something pretty remarkable and DeNiro takes each one and really does a marvelous job with it. Whether it's the early stages of Leonard's awakening where he's pretty much like a child learning again or towards the end when the drug or the illness starts to take his life back over. Even if you withdraw yourself from the emotions of the story and just watch DeNiro, the way he walks, talks and has the seizure like movements are just amazing to watch and he doesn't miss a beat. Williams also turns in one of his strongest performances. It's important that we can believe him in this role and for the most part he holds his own with DeNiro. The two work extremely well together and have countless memorable moments. Julie Karver, John Heard and Penelope Ann Miller add nice supporting performances as well. This is at times a hard film to watch due to how depressing it gets at times but it's still a very rewarding experiences due to its message as well as the excellent performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awakenings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Penny Marshall (Big) this is a really powerful drama about the treatment of an intriguing subject, based on a true story. Basically shy Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams, in one of his first really serious, non-comedic roles) has started work at a ward filled with all kinds of incurable patients with mental disabilities. But he is fascinated by the comatose and catatonic patients, basically staying completely still and never speaking, but will have a reflex action to catch a thrown ball. He investigates further, and might have found an experimental chemical as a cure, and decides to give it first to Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro), who you saw a quick flashback of at the beginning of the film. In orange juice it is ruined by the acids, but in milk and with high amount this experiment, allowed by Leonard's mother (Ruth Nelson) of course, is successful! Leonard is moving about and talking on his own after being in a coma since his teens, he has been "awakened". Soon enough, the other comatose patients are given the same treatment, and they too are revived. To see all these poor people brought pretty much "back to life" is very touching and delighting. I was hoping it not to, but Leonard gets higher amounts, and the chemical may have created a reaction, or is failing because he is having angry moments, and his movement is suggesting going back to his coma status. In the end, Leonard and all the other comatose patients go back to what they were before, and to this day, Dr. Sayer and others are still trying to find the right cure, but will possibly never come as close as he did in 1969. Also starring The Simpsons' Julie Kavner as Eleanor Costello, Home Alone's John Heard as Dr. Kaufman, Penelope Ann Miller as Paula, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective's Alice Drummond as Lucy, Judith Malina as Rose, Barton Heyman as Bert, George Martin as Frank, Anne Meara as Miriam, Dexter Gordon as Rolando and a brief Max Von Sydow as Dr. Peter Ingham. A very believable drama that has similarities to Cuckoo's Nest and (with Williams in it) Patch Adams, both De Niro and Williams excel in their roles. Robin Williams was number 19, and Robert De Niro number 2 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, De Niro was also number 50 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Al Pacino) on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not too sure what I was hoping for going into Awakenings, but it turned out to be the worst case scenario. Written by Steven Zaillain and directed by Penny Marshall, it tells the true story of a doctor who uncovers a miracle drug which he uses to heal a ward of comatose patients. The narrative awkwardly splits itself into focusing on the doctor, played by Robin Williams who you can tell is in a dramatic role because he has a beard and is wearing a leather jacket, and one of the patients named Leonard Lowe, played by Robert De Niro.The focus is split between the two of them, but not in a very cohesive way at all. Instead, we open up focusing entirely on Doctor Sayer, after a brief look at Lowe's beginning of his disease, and spend the entire first half of the film just with him. Then, as the drug is introduced to Leonard we change the focus almost entirely to him and Sayer becomes a background character instead. It's a really jarring shift in character and the change was hard to adjust to. The focus of the film becomes how someone reacts to the world after decades in a comatose state, which is obviously where they were headed all along so certainly there could have been a more fluid way to transition into that.Marshall never establishes a proper tone, constantly in this limbo between comedy and drama that feels awkward, inappropriate and ultimately just falls flat. At the start it wasn't that hard of a film to watch, but around the halfway point it began to become increasingly dull until the last half hour was almost unbearable in it's tiresomeness. Zaillain's script never takes on the real issues that these characters would face, taking the heavy themes and glossing over them aside from a few scenes of apparent emotional manipulation.Williams gives a serviceable portrayal but his character gets tossed aside once the "more interesting" one comes along, and De Niro gives maybe the worst performance of his career. He got an Oscar nomination for it which is just a hilarious display of their tendency to throw any kind of award to a popular actor playing a disability, because this performance is so absurdly hammed up it's borderline appalling. His whole display is laughable and every time I was supposed to feel for this character (as I was so unsubtly told by the writer/director) I ended up laughing.Toss in an unnecessary and dismally undeveloped romance subplot for each character and this is a film that doesn't know what it's doing but makes sure it ticks all of the boxes this kind of wreck is made to be. Awakenings is the worst kind of exploitative garbage and it does a disservice to the real-life people it's portraying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very very slow movie based on a true story, which is remembered particularly for the outstanding performance of Robert de Niro. How on earth did he not win the 1990/91 Oscar hands down after his portrayal of Leonard Lowe? Every time I watch this movie I have tears in my eyes from the scene where he tells the girl he loves he can't see her again, and watches her leaving from the window until the end. Robin Williams is...well, you know what you're gonna get from Robin Williams - for me the best actor of all time (DeNiro is second, in my opinion the two best actors star in 'Awakenings'.) Robin Williams plays a brilliant, yet incredibly shy and nervous doctor who joins a Psychiatric Hospital in New York where many of the patients are in a coma and dead to the World. Thanks to Dr. Sayer brilliance, a number of the patients including DeNiro 'awaken' from their state - some after decades - for a brief period in the summer of '69. There's a sad scene at the end where Dr. Sachs tells his nurse how Leonard had told him what a kind man he was...only for him to effectively give someone their life back, then take it away again and not be able to do anything about it. That's a sad scene played brilliantly by Robin Williams. Incidentally, the leading female is Julie Kavner who plays Nurse Eleanor Costello - she is world famous for the voice of Marge in The Simpsons!</fullReview>

This is one of the movies to remind us that no one really needs a supernatural theme or pure fiction to produce an impressive film.

It's not everyday that we get to catch such high quality movies, I can't understand why this one did not receive any Academy Awards, to be honest. What else do you need to call it a masterpiece?

		<fullReview>Why must I torment myself with movies like this one? All alone at home, 2am, in the dark, still exhausted from the end of this movie.. Face a teary, snotty mess, no chance of falling asleep before watching some Monty Python or anything mindless and funny..The reason I do it is because as crummy as I feel, I truly enjoyed this movie. I get a slight lump in my throat every now and then when movies or TV shows have sad scenes in them, but actual tears are much harder for me to produce. The only other movies I can think of where I've seriously cried have been Spielberg's masterpiece Schindler's list and Bay's not-as-great Armageddon (stop judging me, it's a guilty pleasure!). But lets forget about Armageddon, for the sake of my point.The reason this movie is so touching is because it combines a great plot that's based on true events; likable, yet imperfect (i.e. realistic) characters; pretty good writing and absolutely sublime acting. If Robert De Niro isn't one of the greatest actors in history, I don't know who is. I'm personally not a huge fan of Robin Williams, but even he was really good in this.I'm not going to really say anything about the plot, except that it works, and it is based on a non-fictional book by Oliver Sacks. After a moment of research it has become clear to me that the director has modified the story quite a bit and renamed all the characters. Still, judging by Sacks' website, at least De Niro's character was a real person, as were many of the other characters. The doctor's romantic interest seems to have been 100% fictional, in a Patch Adams sort of way, which is a tad disappointing..(luckily that and Robin Williams seem to be the only noticeable similarities between the two movies)All in all, 9/10, mostly because the story wasn't 100% accurate. Other than that I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. If you haven't seen it yet, do. I personally recommend watching this alone, not only because tears are sort of embarrassing especially for us guys, but also because you really want to get into the story of this movie to enjoy it to the fullest.</fullReview>

My dad was the first person outside of this clinic to be administered L-dopamine on a trial basis for Parkinson's Disease. The drug never really quite worked as well as shown here but did help for a period of time, then only for a few hours, then not really at all. Other drugs followed but never any signs of improvement. He was bed ridden for 14 years with the symptoms, and then some, that are seen in this film, plus all of the drug side effects not shown.Only wish there was truly a cure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very emotional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent little drama, that was practically overlooked at its release and remains underrated today, Awakenings succeeded in aging better than most films from the late 80's and early 90's, and in particular remains one of the most emotionally effective films ever made in the US. It might legitimately be said that the emotional content is piled on too high, at times forcibly or even exploititively, but the emotional response is still very authentic and very intense. Awakenings rejects the viewers' resistance and may move the most cynical of them. It boasts excellent performances from two stars who were still at their peak - Robert De Niro and Robin Williams; though for my own taste, I liked Williams' surprisingly subtle and mellow performance more than De Niro's intense, Oscar nominated one.The film's biggest weakness, for me, was that it failed to follow through on some of its more interesting points. A great deal of emphasis is put on the relationship between Williams' and De Niro's characters, and especially on Dr. Sayer's (Williams) personal journey, but not enough on the implications of some of the comments made throughout the film - what were the patients feeling during their long catatonic states? Were they fully aware of their environments? And more importantly - how do you deal with losing several decades of your life? Leonard (De Niro) seemed to be having an easier time than most patients in dealing with this, there are a couple of moments like him staring at the mirror or being bemused by hearing rock music for the first time, but just how unthinkably difficult these adjustments would be for him are only briefly explored through short scenes with some of the other patients. Leonard's rebellion over not being allowed to leave the hospital (a scene almost too reminiscent of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) is mostly triggered by fear of regressing to his previous state and not by the unimaginable shock of suddenly finding himself forty years older.That doesn't detract much from the emotional impact that Awakenings hold, or from the fact that it's constantly engaging and enticing. I'm not completely at ease with the ending that puts far too much emphasis on the changes Sayer went through and far too little on Lenoard's own perspective, but it makes for a good and satisfying ending, and for a nearly flawless film experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Warning: possible spoilers.* I liked "Awakenings," a whole lot more. Call me biased, but when it comes to Robin Williams doing drama, I much prefer his good-guy characters to his bad-guy characters. And, his portrayal of a doctor, in this film, is outdone only by his performance in the title role of "Patch Adams!" Furthermore, Robert Deniro proves he doesn't have to swear in thirty-second bursts, every five minutes, to give a realistically human feel to his character!! Just wish he'd do that, as a rule, rather than an exception. Final analysis? A perfect four-stars!</fullReview>

Deeply moving and powerful film (nominated for Best Picture) based on true events about Dr. Oliver Sacks whose use of a "miracle" drug L-dopa helped resurrect several coma patients who suffered from an epidemic of encephalitis including first-patient De Niro(nominated for Best Actor) who is brilliant as is Williams as the dedicated physician. Above average direction by Penny Marshall. Best scene: De Niro's dance of faith with Milller; I dare you not to cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant movie about a terrible medical problem, and a heroic doctor that tries to relieve its victims.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie "Awakenings" Years ago I thought it was very good, and was surprised at the change of character typing in the role played by Robin Williams. I felt very sad for the plight of the victims of encephalitis that remained catatonic until Dr. Malcolm Sayer tried dopamine, and had some success reviving these patients. The saddest part was that in the end they all ended up going back into a catatonic state. When I realize these patients are real people with a real disease, the movie really bothers me, because of the utter helplessness of these victim's in their condition. It is as if they are caught in some sort of a time warp, and their bodies remain motionless while their minds are racing forward. Over the years I have often wondered if it wasn't some sort of an irregularity in the flow of electro magnetic impulses in their nervous system. If it is, why can't a device similar to a rheostat, pacemaker or defibrillator be surgically implanted to regulate the flow of this energy to the muscles, or from the brain? I have asked this question at several different times since I first saw the movie, and the various doctors and scientists I spoke with all seemed distant and uncaring about the situation of these humans. I even tried to contact Dr. Sayer, but I couldn't get passed his secretary. I had not given it too much thought since the last time I mentioned it about four years ago. I was again reminded of the victims of this terribly debilitating disease, when I read a Guidant advertisement on the back of my latest issue of "Saturday Evening Post," It seems to me that this type of approach to the problem, is at least worth some thought and a few experiments, after all these patients are real, and what have they got to lose? I can think of no greater form of inhumane torture, than to be locked up in a catatonic body with a brain that is processing every sensory event in the immediate vicinity without being able to react or respond. I hope someone in the influential entertainment field can inspire the medical field to give some serious thought to my idea. I am only a writer of words, and a thinker of thoughts, but I thank God every day that I am able to act upon the thoughts that I have. I sent a similar post to the Guidant company, but I'm sure that the powerful entertainment industry will be able to get far more attention than an unknown such as myself. Maybe you could do a sequel to "Awakenings," and have an older Dr. Sayer (Robin Williams) get a brilliant idea, insert an electronic device and awaken an aging De Niro from his catatonic state to emerge into a brilliant new modern world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my 8 favorite films... when i first saw it i was so touched... i mean i almost cried... the scene where doctor Sawyer finds Leonard awake for the first time when he tells Leonard... its late... everyone is sleeping... and Leonard answers: I'm not asleep, I'm awake... makes you fell so good inside... that scene is full of emotion... what a beautiful movie...and now lets talk about the performances: first of course Robert DeNiro... I'm his fan #1, I've seen and loved almost everything he's done... and this in my opinion is his best performance and the best performance I've ever seen of all... (2nd.- cape fear, 3rd.- raging bull) i mean what a great performance superb I'd say... flawless... i was amazed by seeing that great performance... the way he first improves himself and later the way he gets worst and worst is... you know i don't even have the words to say it... as i already said the best performance ever... obviously the academy didn't give him the Academy Award... but who cares... we all know the Academy sucks... Robin Williams did also a terrific job playing Doctor Sawyer... Penelope Anne Miller... everything was great... if you haven't see it... do it NOW... you wont regret... my rating 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes you think about your life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so beautiful, and so very sad. I cried during this movie, not just because of the subject matter, but also for the fact that this movie is actually true; and the truth is what makes it so sad. After seeing how these people in this hospital, in the Bronx, who suffered from this terrible disease were only able to "live" almost their entire lives' in the brief summer of 1969, I seriously thought about my life and just how fragile it is. When the character Lucy says, "I know it's not 1926, I just need it to be," and how she's living in a 69 year old body, with only the life experience of a 22 year old; my heart just aches. How sad it must be to go into a comatose state at 22 during the Roaring Twenties and wake up at the end of the Age of Aquarius in an elderly body, with no memory of the years in between. I'm so glad this movie was made, and made so well. Bravo Penny Marshall.Robert DeNiro is amazing in this film. Leonard's story is so particularly poignant because he fell under this illness as a child, "waking up" at middle age, having never experienced his teens or young adulthood, and more importantly, true love (which he begins to experience through his child-like curiosity with Paula (Penelope Ann Miller-who is also excellent)). This may be a spoiler so beware--but when Leonard has to accept that his "awakening" is coming to an end and he has his last dance with Paula, I was in tears. The relationship between Leonard and his mother is also very emotional. She's spent her life taking care of her invalid son, never knowing if he can hear or see her. The way Robert DeNiro portrayed his character's rapid maturity (which he never got to experience in real time), is so superb that he deserved that Oscar nomination 100%. Robin Williams is also outstanding, keeping his usually exuberant sense of humor subdued to play Dr. Malcolm Sayer. You can feel his sense of confusion at trying to get the hospital administration to allow him to try this experimental medication on these patients. It's heartbreaking when he has to finally say goodbye to Leonard, who has a difficult time dealing with the rapid progression of the disease at the end of the summer after the medication is no longer effective. All of the characters in this film were cast perfectly, from Nurse Eleanore to Mrs. Lowe and all of the patients. I would recommend this film to EVERYONE! It captures that lost time period perfectly, and you can actually feel how much these people want to live the lives they were so cruelly cheated out of. If you keep in mind that this really happened in 1969, you'll think about how delicate and immensely important life is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro and Williams are amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't understand why De Niro was considered one of the world's greatest actors until seeing this film. His mastery of this part, with all its complex physical and emotional nuances, is the mark of a very gifted individual. This is also the role where I think Williams did his best work to date (2001). The contrast of his character with the patients is obvious, yet works well; while they are confined by their physical condition, he is highly confined emotionally. Williams' performance is therefore a vital component to the story.It's nice to see the talented Kavner do something other than Marg Simpson; she has the unusual role (for her) of being the Dr.'s romantic interest, but it works very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awakenings is the true story of a doctor (Robin Williams) who takes a job in a hospital and discovers that the comatose patients affected by encephelitis (sp?) still have life in them. (Does this sound like the Maltin summary? Damn it.)The movie begins with three boys playing outside. One of them, Leonard, goes to a bench to scratch his name in with a knife and discovers a stiffness in his hand that twists it out of shape. Leonard's condition worsens as he gets older. That's in the 1920's-1930's.Fast forward to the Bronx,1969. The aforementioned doctor has a job interview in a hospital. He is interviewed by the Exorcist guy and the guy that shot Steve Buscemi's face up in Fargo. (Max von Sydow and Peter Stormare) They hire him even if he seems to lack someting. Everything goes well until a nurse (The Simpson's Julie Kavner) brings him a patient who seems to be completely paralyzed. However, Williams discovers some movement in a reflex.Whenever he drops a pen, the until-then frozen patient grabs it before it hits the ground. Soon, Williams gathers up all the patients who have this sickness and conducts tests on them. He picks one of them, Leonard (Robert DeNiro), to give him a treatment of new drug. The treatment works, and Leonard is in a period of "awakening".To say more would be ruining a wonderful movie. In my opinion, this is Robin Williams' last good role before he went soft (Patch Adams, Jumanji, What Dreams May Come, Bicentennial Man,Hook...the list goes on like this for a long time). I admit that I was doubtful about this movie. I love Robert DeNiro. He could star in a remake of Attack of The Killer Tomatoes and I would like it. But Robin Williams, I was less sure of. Both of them are great. Robert DeNiro gives 150% as Leonard, especially in the last half in which the nervous tics start coming over him. Julie Kavner (which I knew only form the Simpsons) is fine. In fact, everyone is in top-shape. There are shades of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest thoughout, but that can ony be a good thing. Let's see...looks like my favorite movie,has my favorite actor in it...this should get 10 right? Well...not quite. The second half, although supremely acted by DeNiro, lacks the polish and originality of the first half. It has more of a Hollywood "sad" feeling than would have been needed. However,this movie should not be missed. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert DeNiro Adds to His Legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Awakenings" was quietly nominated for the Best Picture Oscar in 1990. The film deals with a subdued doctor (Robin Williams) who uses an experimental drug on a group of catatonic patients and they all show that they are still alive. The first person who has access to the drug is DeNiro (in an Oscar-nominated role) and his recovery is the basis for the others to have the same experience. DeNiro dominates like only he can. He adds a whole new dimension to his repertoire which had included "The Godfather, Part II", "Taxi Driver", "The Deer Hunter", "Raging Bull", and "GoodFellas" before this. His performance is nothing short of amazing and he carries the film for the most part. Williams is good as usual, but without DeNiro the film would have sunk. This is Penny Marshall's best film as a director. The screenplay is based on actual events which supposedly took place in the early-1960s. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams shows the flexibility of a truly great actor in portraying Dr. Oliver Sacks, the gentle and shy Neurologist. Robert de Niro's performance as the hospitalised Leonard Lowe is also a Tour de Force, and the developing relationship between Williams and Julie Kavner is innocently beautiful - again, from a flexibility point of view, compare Julie Kavner's performance with the voice of Marge Simpson ("The Simpsons") coming from the same voicebox !!!And as if this were not enough, take into account the fact that the film is based upon a true story, and add to that the music of Randy Newman, which complements the sensitive acting of all the characters - the music alone is sometimes sufficient to bring a tear to the eye.A really memorable film excellently directed by Penny Marshall.Trivia point though - anyone spotted that when the teacher is looking through her register, the name "Leonard Lowe" appears AFTER "Lowery" when it should (alphabetically) be before it ??Sorry, I'm being pedantic - it's a wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A stunning and deeply moving film. Robert De Niro gives a performance that's rarely equalled on the big screen (easily beating Dustin Hoffman's performance in "Rainman"), and Robin Williams is superb as well as Dr. Malcolm Sayer. These are two characters that we really come to care about, and the chemistry between them is palpable. These actors (especially De Niro) should have won Oscars for their roles in this movie.There's little audience manipulation here... most of the scenes ring very true. There is humor here, and pathos, and joy and innocence. This is one film I never get tired of seeing. If you let it, it will touch your heart, and maybe even change your life. Aside from a few predictable elements in the plot, this movie shines like a supernova -- it's much better than either "The Doctor" or "Regarding Henry" (two other movies with vaguely similar plots and similarly high production values). I rank it even higher than "Children of a Lesser God." 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching, surprisingly well-acted adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a film that could have been a disaster if it were not for the work of two very different actors: Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. Although De Niro is known for powerful dramatic roles, Williams had rarely done drama. Aside from Oscar-nominated work in "Good Morning, Vietnam" (1987) and "Dead Poets Society" (1989), his dramatic roles had been limited.In "Awakenings," Williams completely does away with his usual zaniness found even in his previous serious parts. He is subtle, subdued and in character through-out. As a doctor with a vision of life for his comatose patients, he creates a likable, shy, determined, three-dimensional portrait.Robert De Niro is also sympathetic and moving as one of the key patients who Williams tries his experimental therapy on.Although the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including De Niro, the screenplay and the picture itself, Williams was unjustly snubbed. So was director Penny Marshall, whose confidence in straightforward story-telling and getting superb performances out of her actors, makes this her greatest achievment as a film maker thus far. It is also one of the best movies of its year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is celebrated for the wrong reasons, I think. The arc of tragedy/elation/tragedy is nothing new; the 'elation' bits have long since been co-opted as the greeting card sentiment that inhabits the center of most Hollywood dramas.If you scrape away the cloying confectionery goop, there's some pretty solid movie construction underneath. Three things pop out...First off, this is not about reanimated people -- it's about reanimated movies. The period covered in the film is right before VHS technology, so the only convenient visual data storage medium was--you guessed it-- movies. Marshall smartly gets Von Sydow to translate this for us. The 'awakened' people live in the movie memories taken from the time they fell 'asleep'. And she makes another period film within, starring DeNiro; surprisingly smart and effective.Secondly, the presence of Ruth Nelson is no accident -- compare the elements and tone here to those in "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn". Third, the movie itself invests in the cinematic world of 1969. I don't mean the costumes and settings, although Marshall gets that right - I mean the grain of the film, the framing, the pull-in with the lens technique...all evoke the film-making of that period. Good congruence of subject and medium.Note also that Williams, the perpetual juvenile, acts his age, to our great relief. The only other time he's done this is in "Garp". Here it's a welcome, if temporary, respite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awakenings holds its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Penny Marshall's Awakenings (1990) is based on the true story of Dr. Oliver Sacks, a neurologist who used the "miracle drug" L-dopa to treat patients who had been catatonic since they contracted a form of encephalitis years before. This dramatized version of that story stars Robin Williams as Dr. Malcolm Sayer, the protagonist, and Robert De Niro as Leonard Lowe, the first patient to be treated with the drug. In many ways, the catatonic patients were not the only ones to be "awakened;" people whose lives they touched were changed forever. Dr. Sayer is a painfully shy neurologist who has just gotten his first hospital job, after years of doing only research. He finds an unusual amount of comatose patients and begins investigating. He finds out that they all had suffered the same form of encephalitis a long time ago. They are not completely catatonic and he finds ways to "move" them, such as playing music or throwing a ball to them. Aided by his faithful nurse, Eleanor (Julie Kavner), he arrives at a theory that a drug called L-dopa, which was used to treat Parkinson's disease, could help these patients. The action centers around Leonard Lowe, who is the first to be administered L-dopa. When he is "awakened," he has a lot to learn about things that have changed when he was catatonic, as do the rest of the patients. Dr. Sayer, too, begins to learn a lot about interacting with other people, and living one's life to the fullest. While the film is kind of a "Hollywood-esque" over-dramatization of a true story, the main points that are made in the film are valuable. Leonard warns Dr. Sayer to recognize the beauty that is everywhere and not waste his life. The music, while purposely overdramatic at times, is beautiful and adds to the tear-jerking quality of Awakenings. Basically, even though the film was made for the purpose of inspiring emotions, that is not necessarily a bad thing. It's about courage and hope, things we all need more of in our lives. If we all could realize that we have been walking around asleep most of our lives, and could experience the same "awakening" as these patients, and see life as the miracle it truly is, the world would be a far better place.</fullReview>

So does Robert DeNiro, a patient who Williams tests a new drug (L-Dopa) on, bringing him out of his almost vegetable state.I especially recommend this movie to teens who are not sure what they want to be, and have an interest in medicine/helping people.

		<shortDescription>Awakenings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moving drama based on the writings and works of Oliver Sacks', a neurologist who discovers the life force within abandoned patients within a Bronx chronic card ward. DeNiro is showy as one of those patients who awakens from a 30 year coma, while Williams is exceptional as the at first shy doctor who gives his patients a new sense of hope. Marshall was the wrong director for this film and it shows in the way she presents the film to us. It's as if she was rooting for us to cry or laugh. DeNiro was Oscar nominated, as was the picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Panther" bu Rilke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I saw a reference to the poem "The Panther" by Rilke made by a patient with schizophrenia - he described that this summarized his feelings of despair and entrapment. There was a reference made to this poem in the movie I was curious if this poem had often been used in association with patients with various mental disorders. It is a beautiful poem and captures very well the hopelessness of a mind that refuses to function normally. I can't remember who said it and what context it was mentioned in - does anyone remember? If anyone has read the book by Sacks is there a reference to "The Panther" by Rilke? The screenplay may be the original and only reference prior to the mention by this patient - I would like to know if that is the case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story meets great acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story develops nicely, although the first five minutes or so demands a bit of our patience in having the details move in. The introduction about the hospital, the patients, and the illness itself is blended well into the story that it doesn't bore me even as it takes a long duration. It's quite a drag that the story, based on a true events account, must end in a disappointment, lest it would be worth more on the score. I truly enjoy watching Robert DeNiro's performance. He went nicely total here, but without overacting his role. He can depict all those compulsive moves a Parkinson patient does. And he does them well that it doesn't look stupid, it just looked as a normal Parkinson patient would look like. Robin Williams also did a good job, although I think I've seen better performances. His role here doesn't really let him explore his talent. Yet he managed in performing the heart-warming scenes with less facial expressions, yet without making those scenes look lifeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Academic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite an engaging premise, the treatment of patients suffering from Encephalitis lethargica, Penny Marshall delivered a totally academic movie. The story of this doctor and its discovery is depicted without any ounce of originality, everything is predictable and unsurprising from start to finish, and while you were expecting a powerful drama, you just end up watching a dreadfully banal and uninspired movie where every scene seems more melodramatic than the one before thanks to the schmaltzy violins. Robin Williams does the job rather well but what is intriguing is the cast of Robert De Niro in such a limited role that doesn't fit him. Conclusion : not a bad movie, but not a good one either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy but overly sentimental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr Malcolm Sayer is in charge of a group of patients who are comatose and cut off from the world. When he treats one with a new chemical he brings him back to normal and they begin a friendship of discovery, or living for the day and of eventual heartbreak.We'll never get a Rainman 2 being made ? but this is not too far away from that type of Oscar chasing stuff. The film is partly true so it is very worthy and you can't help but be moved by some of the scenes as they are really touching. However it's main weakness is that it's overly sentimental and is willing to exploit the tears out of the audience by any means necessary. This is not a bad thing if you like that sort of thing but it still cheapens it slightly.De Niro is very good but you can't help but think that maybe he feels like it's been a while since his last Oscar. However he is still convincing and it's good to see him do something outside of his usual tough guy roles. Williams isn't great but at least he's understated (Patch Adams anyone?) and doesn't overdo the sugar. The rest of the cast are good but you do fee like some of them have too much respect for the material and that they're acting like they're in the presence of God or something.Overall, I don't like tear jerkers but I still recognise this as a good, if soppy, film at heart. With a different director at the helm this could have been a more powerful and less sickly-sentimental film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>doesn't need much for a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awakenings is truly a great movie based on a great story. Note, a true story. That't what makes it even more touching. The idea of being unable to move or act and still have the capacity to think, to feel, to understand your environment is devastating. The film surely leaves behind a bitter feeling and a will to try to do something for those people, for all people with disabilities. It makes us appreciate the value of everyday, common life which some times we take for granted. Yet it is not always like that.A most demanding role for De Niro (much different than most of the others) who is worthy of all praise as he manages flawlessly. Robin Williams at his best in a role that suits him like a glove. I believe that the selection of them two was an absolutely excellent choise. Congratulations to the director too for making this film so simple, straight and clear in the details, yet so vague in the taste it leaves as it ends.</fullReview>

But the acting done by Robert De Nero was just a copie of the work done by Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man and the part of Robin williams as the doctor who never gives up hope was just a replay of his part in Good Will Hunting. Except for those (little) drawbacks it is overal a good movie. You really get carried away by this touching story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"How do you feel?" "My parents are dead. My wife is in an institution. My son has disappeared out west, somewhere. I feel old and I feel swindled. That's how I feel.""Awakenings" is another story from Penny Marshall about a young boy who falls asleep one night and wakes up a grown man. The twist this time is that it's a true story--"Awakenings" details the events that took place in the Bronx in 1969, when Leonard Lowe -- a thirty-year catatonic -- suddenly...awoke.Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) believes that the catatonics he works around all day long are still alive, on the inside, and not merely shells -- people who are unable to control their bodies but are still able to control their thoughts. He decides to try giving the patients doses of medicine intended for sufferers of Parkinson's disease. To his amazement, the first test subject -- Leonard (Robert De Niro) -- wakes up in the middle of the night. "I was gone for a long time. I'm back."The movie is loosely based on true events of an encephalitis epidemic that spread across New York City. It sent the victims into a deep catatonic state for the rest of their lives. The film is based on the work of author/neurologist Oliver Sacks, who used the drug L-dopa, for Parkinson's patients, on the catatonics. To his surprise they began to "wake up" again, but soon after-effects of the drug began to kick in. Eventually, Sacks' patients slipped back into their old states again. But during the time they were able to explore the world once more, they felt free -- and Robert De Niro captures the essence of that freedom very well in "Awakenings."Marshall (director of "Big") seems to have some sort of fascination with this idea of small children turning into adults overnight. Although I wasn't a very big fan of "Big," it did seem to capture the awe of adulthood and childhood yearning. "Awakenings" isn't a comedy like "Big" was but, as Leonard roams the streets of the Bronx visiting his school, and areas where he used to hang out with his friends, it exudes the same sort of message, and asks us: If you went to bed as a child and woke up an adult, what would you do?De Niro and Williams give terrific performances (albeit forgettable compared to past roles) and are supported by a top-notch cast including Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) and John Heard ("Home Alone"). Marshall's directorial style is a bit schmaltzy sometimes but overall doesn't hurt the flow of the film.As a whole the film works but unfortunately thinks it is much better than it is -- after an excellent opening credits sequence it slowly slips into mediocrity. Ranking in at almost two and a half hours long, like many dramas of the genre, the film is unable to suspend interest while keeping fairly true to the facts. But the ending redeems everything. It's a sad film, one that made many cinemagoers break down into tears when it was released in 1990. It's occasionally too heavy on the Spielbergian-esque schmaltz but as long as you don't expect a masterpiece, "Awakenings" is an entertaining film that serves its purpose. I expected more after viewing the trailer but I can't say I was too terribly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice film, it avoids the cheesyness of some in the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie about a chronic disease and a doctor's determination in improving the conditions of his patints, and how it eventually accounted for little.Despite exploring a topic I dislike in other movies, that of exploring the "cuteness" or "cry-factor" of bad situations or diesases, such as Simon Birch, A Beautiful Mind, etc. this one avoids a certain feeling of cheesy underlying morality, except for perhaps the last part.Responsible for this are convincing interpretations by Williams and de Niro (even though he is clearly overacting) and the storyline based in a real case.It is a nice portrayal of one of life's miracles, how it inexplicably appears out of the blue, and out it equally inexplicably crawls right back. Worth a good look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective tearjerker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess the story on which this movie is based is well known, so I won't go into details about that. I just want to give a few notes.The patient's stories are all intensely fascinating and moving. I dare you to watch Leonard and Paula dance without tears streaming down your face.Praise should go to Randy Newman for his wonderful score. Again, the dancing scene...Well done also Penelope Ann Miller. I think she only appeared in a couple of scenes, but just her acting alone makes this movie worth seeing.Now, some minor nits.I think the movie could have stood on its own if it just focused on the patient stories. I did not care one bit for Robin Williams' character. Or any of the non-patients for that matter. Except 'Paula' of course then.Robin Williams in particular is pretty bad as a stereotypical absent-minded academic. Also I just totally did not buy the doctor/nurse 'romance'. Doctor Sayer has an 'awakening' himself at the end of the movie ... come on!Finally I did not care at all for the sequence where the action suddenly moves to a separate ward, and Leonard goes through his paranoid phase. That whole bit should have just been cut.Sorry to be so negative at the end there. This really is an all right movie. Especially if one is into tearjerkers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not unpredictable but very well made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer Steven Zaillion's textbook tearjerker blends equal parts Rip Van Winkle and 'Flowers For Algernon' (by way, sadly, of 'Rainman') into a heartfelt case history, based on the true story of an unassuming New York doctor who successfully (if only temporarily) cures the catatonic victims of an unknown neurological disorder. The familiarity of the material, and the predictability of its outcome, is nicely camouflaged by Penny Marshall's understated direction, and by Robin Williams's sensitive (believe it or not) portrayal of the socially disabled doctor who comes to life alongside his patients. If Robert De Niro is less effective in the flashier role it's only because his character is so well adjusted after suddenly emerging from a thirty-year trance. The consequences of his lifelong nap are ignored, but so too, for the most part, is the expected sentiment, not including Williams' redundant final soliloquy, in which an already obvious message is needlessly spelled out (and at considerable length) in exactly so many words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finely tuned tear jerker with just a few flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think it is a spoiler to tell you that this movie is really about two "awakenings". The main one concerns patients who have been left in an apparently catatonic state due to a poorly understood post-encephalitic syndrome. Dr. Sayer recognizes this and manages to awaken these patients after decades of sleeping through life. This part of the story is handled excellently, creating a wonderful balance of suspense, entertainment, and just enough lightly handled melodrama to occasionally leave you justifiably teary-eyed. De Niro is the glue which holds this part together even though he barely appears in the first hour of the movie. As he always does in his best performances, he makes all the actors around him look outstanding while he does nothing more or less than become exactly the character he is supposed to be.The second awakening is that of Dr. Sayer himself, a timid, insecure, and socially withdrawn researcher who much like his patients has been mostly sleepwalking through life. From this experience comes the hope that he too will finally awaken. Unfortunately, this part of the story is presented with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer blow to the head. It's entirely predictable and made that much worse by the terrible overacting of Robin Williams and the use of a painfully stereotypical evil administrative-type doctor. But it isn't so bad as to seriously detract from the rest of this wonderful story, so it is well worth sitting through for the pleasure of experiencing the full package.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I highly recommend AWAKENINGS to all the fans who love stories inspired by true events. Don't expect a fast paced movie but just relax and enjoy it. I liked especially all the nice great efforts and miracles from the patients under the lead of Dr. Sayer. Both, Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, played their role very convincing. I won't forget an important message told by Dr. Sayer and this is that people have to learn again to live and just to be proud about simple things as family, children, games or music. At the end I had nearly some tears in my eyes. 6/10. Well worth the three Oscar nominations. If you liked this one then don't miss another dramatic movie called PHILADELPHIA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentimental actors' piece...well-made (with one eye on the box-office) but nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1969, a shy, modest neurologist (Robin Williams, hiding his usual tics behind a beard) working on the east coast tries out a new medicine (in real-life, levodopa, sometimes called L-dopa) on a ward full of patients suffering from various degrees of catatonia; the results are successful, at least initially. Screenwriter Steven Zaillian, adapting Oliver Sacks' non-fiction book from 1973, probably didn't intend his narrative to get gummed up with feel-good montages and romantic encounters, but the material is very 'Hollywood'. Robert De Niro received an Oscar nomination as a patient who discovers the world (and girls!), but there's no room for spontaneity in the performances because Penny Marshall has directed the whole thing as an exercise in sentiment; it's meant to get us in the throat and in the chest, and those who make a connection are responding to the smoothly-designed mechanization of an old movie formula (which isn't even updated for the benefit of those who have seen all this before). The doctor is a self-effacing saint who is first applauded and then brought down to size once the effects of the medicine wear off, while his patients are lovable, impaired angels who are able to break out of their cocoons just long enough to show us their beaming personalities. There are few dimensions in Marshall's execution--she wants an emotional home-run and aims for the rafters. It's a wet valentine which has already been cried over. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the novel by Oliver Sacks and screenwriter Steven Zaillian comes this very moving and funny portrait of life in a hospital for the terminally ill, where an unusual doctor (Robin Williams) discovers a drug that is effective in awakening post-encephalitis sufferers from a deep coma-like sleep.Robin Williams is good, but Robert De Niro steals the show as Leonard Lowe, one of Dr. Sayers' miracles. Lacks the power of "One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest", and director Penny Marshall may have gotten carried away with her huge stars and not put enough into the story.
