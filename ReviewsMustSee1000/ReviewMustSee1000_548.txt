		<shortDescription>Brutally Classy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this at the cinema and had to write my first review! Having lived in Glasgow for eight years and seen the number of Chelsea smiles on show, this film hits the nail on the head as to how brutal Glasgow is for deprived kids. The acting is first class. Connor McCarron puts in a mighty performance as a child with a promising future, only to see his dreams disappear as he gets increasingly involved in the Glasgow gangs. 1970's Glasgow is flawlessly recreated and the mood of the film grips you within the first minute. If you've seen it you'l know what i mean! The pace is perfect, Peter Mullan does an excellent job in showing the downfall of the characters and asking questions of society and how tough life can be for a young kid in what is a violent city. I honestly came out of the cinema traumatised and spellbound, which is no mean feat. I would recommend to all, but warn you it will affect you, the violence is intense and the language is pretty grim, but realistic, thats how it is! Possibly s good as Scotlands finest film: Trainspotting, which is something i never thought i'd say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good film that gives a very accurate portrayal of what life can be like for a young kid growing up in Glasgow. The film is set in the 70's but the main themes are just as applicable for youngsters in 2011 (trying to fit in, feeling like part of a group/gang).The highlight of the film is the performance of Conor McCarron as a bright student who makes the wrong choices and finds himself part of a young gang. Peter Mullan does a good job of keeping the film at a high tempo and he avoids all the familiar clichés that are common in these types of film.However, the last twenty minutes or so are a bit of a struggle as Mullan seems to find it difficult to find a suitable ending to the film. At just over 2 hours, it could be argued that "neds" is a tad too long. Perhaps omitting the "Jesus vision" would have been a good start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Growing up in inner city Glasgow in the Seventies, gangs are ubiquitous. The stories of stabbings and kickings have an awful, magnetic allure. Jimmy Boyle, mythologised by his lack of presence due to incarceration, like an Anti-Mandela figure, is the archetypal hardman in a town still nicknamed No Mean City. Glasgow's Miles Better has yet to be thought of. And school is not where you learn, it is where you survive.Like Lynne Ramsey's Ratcatcher, Neds resonates with Glaswegians born in the Sixties who grew up in this mayhem, and now look at it with the benefit of age and distance and wonder how we ever took it for normality.John is the academically gifted younger brother of a locally respected/ feared ned. His father is mostly missing or drunk, his mother struggles to cope. Like many Scots, the family role model is the one who has exiled herself. Joe's big brother Benny (a charismatic Joe Szula) provides a buffer between him and the worst of the violence - but also gives him a free pass towards initiation. Mean, visceral humiliation from local bully Kanta propels John away from study and towards Benny's sphere of influence. After many trials and betrayals, John survives that, till another humiliation at the point of a crossbow pushes him again to the brink.Cinematically, Mullen is playful and challenging here. The director says Kubrick and Peckinpah were evoked in keeping with the time; the duct taping of knives to hands is pure Peckinpah, and the juxtaposition of foot-tapping music with jaw-breaking violence recalls Kubrick. The ending is big canvas cinema, but it worked for me. There is also a lovely rhythm here, the gangs running toward and away from each other more often than not. That's how I remember it in Maryhill - big boys always running after or away from other big boys.Drunk Dads (Mullen in an acting career best), Bolan, six of the belt, winchin' up the graveyard, change on the buses, Provvie cheques - I loved it. But then I grew up with it. Outside Glasgow, and a certain generation, this might be more difficult to access. It will do better in Europe and Asia where the subtitles will help, and the essential coming-of-age story will rise to the fore more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's like a long, hard scream in the face, followed by a hammer to the head. A brilliant portrayal of anger and life on the wrong side of the tracks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Mullan has proved himself to be as good a director as he is an actor with some very good films and shorts. His short film "Fridge" in 1995 was one of the most eerie and disturbing pieces of film I think I've ever seen, primarily due to the nihilistic and tense atmosphere. "The Magdalene Sisters" in 2002 was a tremendous film that finally opened an nations eyes here in Ireland to the horrors that took place in these institutions for decades. Now, in 2010, Mullan returns home to the Glasgow of his youth with "Neds" (Non-Educated Delinquents). Set in the 1970's, the film charts the fall of a very smart kid who one summer falls into the wrong crowd and subsequently discovers an evil and dangerous person inside himself.The film begins at a primary school where John McGill is receiving a school award for his outstanding academic achievements. He is finished primary school now and after the summer he'll be in secondary school. On this same day, he is verbally attacked by an older boy from the school who tells him that next year when he comes to 'his' school, he's going to get the crap beaten out of him, so to speak. McGill is terrified at first, but he goes to find his older brother Bennie who is a notorious thug around the estate. Bennie and his friend Fergie sort this bully out. And it looks like everything will be fine for John, and as the years go by, he finds himself top of all his classes. But when he is about seventeen, one summer changes it all and he finds himself heading down a violent and dark path that he won't be able to come back from...I've been eagerly awaiting "Neds" ever since I seen the trailers for it months ago. When I rented it the other day, the inscription on the box further excited me: "Trainspotting meets This is England". Well in terms of nihilism and it's 'hold-back-no-punches' attitude, "Neds" is like "Trainspotting". In terms of the coming of age story and brutal empathy, "Neds" is like "This is England". However, "Neds" goes beyond the drama and horrors depicted in these films and is like a long, hard scream in the face. It's pretty violent, brutal at times, but it's all necessary for Mullan to bring to us what life was like, and today still is, for many young people who can find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time or just mixed up in a crowd that they can't get out of. Or, in McGill's case, they've done things - some horrible and barbaric things - that they just can't run away from. The past is never far behind.Conor McCarron is superb in this film, and I found it very hard to believe it when I saw on his profile here on IMDb that this is his to date only performance. What a debut role to take on. His transformation from a quite, shy intellect into an absolute apathetic savage is brilliantly charted by directer Peter Mullan, and is evidently displayed in all it's horror and glory by McCarron. Mullan plays a role in this film himself, as McGill's abusive alcoholic father. Gary Lewis ("Gangs of New York") appears in quite a strange and quirky role as one of the teachers in the school."Neds" portrays teenage apathy and anger exceptionally well, it's definitely one of the best I've come across. It depicts gang activity and violence to the point that it's so realistic and devastating you want to look away, and unlike many other films (Such as "Green Street" for example), it can portray the gangs and culture and violence without glamorizing it. I came away with this film with a very strange and profound feeling of empathy in my gut, and it was as though I was shell shocked from it. The final, metaphoric scene, is amazing and just goes to show and prove the extent of Peter Mullan's brilliant talent. I look forward to his next project, and indeed, McCarron's next role.I recommend "Neds" to everyone. It's a must-see because it tells it as it is in many places in society, and is a haunting testimony to does who find themselves on the wrong end of the tracks and never come back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Mullan and NEDS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You are a swat Mister Mcgill"Peter Mullan's Neds has become one of the small number of electrical Scottish films that have been made within the last 20 years. As it goes Peter Mullan has always been interested in directing and from my point of view has a Ken Loach appeal about it when it comes to writing and producing scripts.NEDS a film which portrays a young mans will to succeed in any circumstance and every hurdle which is played by society must be dealt with-in an appropriate 70s fashion. Living in Scotland not only is there defaults within any of the class systems but a constant bombardment from Parents,Police and Schools to do well. John McGill (Conner McCarron) becomes victim to this. He has the potential to fulfil any career prospect which is becomes knocked around by his unstable nuclear family and his authoritative teachers.I have read some of the reviews on here and are somewhat critical. It is hard to understand what living in a poor background with an alcoholic father, a troublesome brother and horrible weather if your not partial to any of the surroundings. If you do not reside in any of these categories then it will be hard to acknowledge why (NEDS) want to fight each other over a measly piece of unfurnished turf which they themselves have no own-age rights.If you liked Small Faces,Sweet Sixteen then this is a must. All credit to Peter and Cast. Please make more films in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, disturbing, funny and emotional. A class act again from Mullan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS******N.E.D.S is a fantastic coming-of-age story with remarkable authenticity and outstanding performances from a young and untrained cast. Peter Mullan has captured the essence of Glasgow gang culture impeccably while challenging oft-heard current notions of "it wasn't like that when I was a boy".The film is brutal, touching and, thanks to an excellent script which oozes with the tension and volatility of the darker side of Glasgow's character, it carries an ever-increasing level of tension which culminates in an explosion of violence and emotional turmoil that is heart-breaking as much as it is disturbing.The dialect is definitely a potential stumbling-block to the film's chances of appealing to a world-wide audience, despite it's themes of tribal-like warfare on the streets ringing true in all corners of the world. However, those who can deal with the relentless (and utterly realistic) F &amp; C-words and interpret the thick Glaswegian lingo will be rewarded with a hard-hitting experience that will evoke hugely varied responses.Interestingly, I found moments in the film very funny when they quite probably shouldn't have been. An uncomfortable laugh of recognition for these types of character and their "poetic" use of language. Many's the time while growing up that I saw people like this hanging around the streets or witnessed these animalistic and unprovoked square-offs or challenges for dominance between young guys protecting their turf of the local play-park (which also served as an under-age drinking/smoking area). An innocent boy passing by and being threatened with violence, merely for existing it seems, by a lad (often smaller than him) trying to prove how "hard" he is to the other members of his pack was a regular sight.The film captures these incidents with a style that is bordering on documentary it is so authentic and I simply couldn't help myself but laugh at these moments. Others, such as two gangs standing at opposite ends of a foot-bridge "tooled-up" with anything sharp or heavy enough to inflict injury, taunting each other with "verbals" about each others' mothers and preparing for battle, before stopping to allow a lassie with a pram to pass through unharmed, carried a dark sense of humour about the rules of engagement adopted during these fracas. Indeed these battles reek of ancient battles such as Stirling Bridge or Bannockburn and carry a bloody brutality that echoes with the same passion and hatred for challengers to territory.Despite a couple of dips into unnecessary weirdness, such as the Jesus- vision, the film maintains a solid pace and, while a little long for some, it captivated me well enough that I never became disinterested. The characters are magnificently portrayed and the break-down, attempt at redemption and ultimate open-ended journey of the leading man is pulled-off tremendously.The film is visually as raw as the content of the story and has a very Ken Loach-style to it, which aids in giving a much more stomach-churning impact to the violence and the effects it leaves behind.The film concludes with a lack of real resolution for the character, but rather an almost frustrating sense of uncertainty about what is in store. He is left (almost literally) thrown to the lions, unsure about where he will go and what he will do, dragging the ball and chain of his previous atrocities behind him with no-one left to turn to, no-one to back him up, everyone has given up on him and left him behind.Peter Mullan has delivered yet another fine film with N.E.D.S and one that will no doubt bring mixed reaction through both it's realistic and uncomfortable portrayal of Glasgow youth and its unwillingness to adopt a sweet and audience-satisfying end which gives a conclusive answer to all that has gone before. Having met Peter Mullan while I was at university, I know that he is not one for happy endings or giving the audience what they want. He is far more in favour of showing what happens in the real world. Frankly, it doesn't always end up nice and Rosy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard-hitting and heartfelt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't really watched many (any?) Scottish films but I am familiar with Peter Mullan, having seen his completely depressing TYRANNOSAUR previously. NEDS is equally grim, but also uplifting. It's a film with a nostalgic '70s ambiance and an autobiographical feel, featuring the misadventures of a shy, chubby schoolboy who ends up becoming a fearsome teenage gang member.NEDS is a lengthy, slow-paced and frequently hard-hitting movie that tackles some uncomfortable home truths. It's a little off-putting, with sometimes impenetrable dialogue from the Scots cast and a simmering undercurrent of violence that sometimes erupts on the surface. This is very much a realistic movie that tackles cause and effect without sugar-coating the answers.I found it compelling and often heartfelt, managing to elicit pathos and humour from the grim situation. Conor McCarron delivers a quietly effective turn as the put-upon lead and Mullan himself has a strong supporting role as the frightening alcoholic father. But it's the young cast who really shine in their parts, giving performances so authentic that this feels like a documentary at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, Very True to Life ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me point out a few things, to people who obviously didn't get this.People who complained about the silly music, you really couldn't see that the director was trying to show how ridiculous the violence was?People who didn't get the Jesus thing, well, you've obviously never come from a dark enough culture, where solvent abuse is rife, and people have extremely vivid hallucinations.I was raised in the area the movie is set, and the time it was set, and i can tell you, its very accurate. Yes, they have accents, its set in Scotland, did you expect them to say "Kwoffee?" and no, there are no bothers in this movie, but take it from me, i never seen anyone of African descent until i was in my teens, and even then it was quite a rare thing in Scotland, and a real minority.The movie itself is very well done, and tells a cautionary tale, that could translate to anywhere in the world. The production values of the movie are good, and its certainly way better than average and keeps you entertained, i watched this as a piece of "World Cinema", even though i come from the area, and had no trouble at all with the dialogue, but then again, thats me, i can see who others would find it difficult, then again, i would moan about this spoiling the movie, when in Rome ... i would accept it for what it is.If you get the chance to see this, then do so, with an open mind, its entertaining, moving, shocking, and everything a good movie should be.:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Mullan has produced a film of outstanding beauty, raw brutality, warm humour and real pathos. Even without being unable to understand a fair deal of the dialogue, the excellent acting and characterisation was enough to convey the powerful storyline with ease. This is brutal British cinema at it's best. John McGill, a promising schoolboy in 1970s Glasgow, is a sensitive and gentle child routinely subjected to intimidation. As John becomes increasingly angry and determined to fight back, he begins a descent into violence and apathy that threatens to overwhelm him. Will he succumb to the dark allure of gang life, or will he regain the strength he needs to get his life back on track?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film successfully exposes the frustrations and impotence of failed systems in religion, education, friendship, families, government and employment. Scenes that are funny one moment take on deeper and darker meaning the next. Excellent acting, writing and direction. What is referred to by one reviewer as the Jesus scene, I felt is central to the thread of religion that runs through the movie, though each viewer can interpret it as they wish. It is just as appropriate as Rentons withdrawal scenes in Trainspotting for comparison. It seemed to me that the characters could deal with the physical beatings, but the subtle, and silent violence was more brutal, insidious, and damaging. It is one of those films that will keep you thinking long after the credits finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neds (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another powerful drama after The Magdalene Sisters from Peter Mullan, set amidst the adolescent gang culture of 70s Glasgow, and loosely based on personal experience. John McGill, played with both menacing brawn and sensitive intelligence by McCarron, turns his back on his academic successes in favour of his older brothers gang lifestyle after experiencing prejudices within society and hypocritical, violent authority figures.The film doesn't hold back on the violence that gang mentality stirs up, often contrasting the boys as softly spoken individuals from decent homes against their violent gang behaviour. It's genuinely disturbing to see a good kid at heart fall so low, but Mullan's real stamp on the material separating it from countless other grim rites of passage social realist films is an almost comic absurdity. Highlights include Gary Wells as a piggy-back offering teacher, a kicking from Jesus himself in John's lowest point, a safe passage through a group of genuine predators and in the films most intense sequence John turning into a cross between Travis Bickle and Freddy Krueger.It is to Mullan and his actors credit that such deviations in tone don't unbalance the powerful, realistic drama at the heart of the film, even if they start to confuse and put into question the main characters state of mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third time unlucky for Mullan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mullan has provided us with 2 excellent films in Orphans and the Magdalene Sisters but NEDS is disappointing in the extreme. I went to the cinema expecting a hard-hitting, funny and accurate portrayal of school and life in the 1970s in Glasgow. There were some funny moments and some brutal moments but the major letdown of NEDS....was the story. Were we really to accept that a young, quiet, bookish lad who excels at Latin and at school in general turns into a knife-wielding thug within the space of 4-5 weeks in the school holidays because his friend's mum takes a dislike to him? We also get very little character development for many of the characters. Mullan plays the typical Glaswegian drunk father but Mullan the director never takes the time to give us a clue why he has become a menacing lush. (You people in Glasgow in the audience who laughed at the father's drunken abuse of the mother -shame on you as this was not funny nor was it intended to be.) The film has been commended for its attention to detail and portrayal of Glasgow in the 1970s. I'm sure some of the detail was right for a Glasgow seen through Mullan's eyes but in no other school did teachers smoke in the classroom. I think a bit of fanciful mis-remembering is going on there. The feel of the 1970s didn't come across and at one point the main character 'John' calls himself a 'ned' - not a term used by ordinary people at that time. I agree with one of the early reviews that at 2 hours, the film is far too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John McGill is a bright student and hounded by a local bully. His father is a volatile drunk. His older brother leads a local gang. He is put into the lower class due to his brother's reputation. He gets out at the first opportunity by being the top student of the lower class. As a teen, John becomes more brash and more rebellious. He becomes a volatile leader of the local kids taking on all rivals.I like these two movies and they are two separate movies. John McGill as a kid is interesting in his struggles. Then the movie jumps in years to a teenage John McGill and he's a completely different character. The in-between years is missing. It seems like interesting things happened during that time but it's not on the screen. The teenage years do hold some fascinating violence but it gets a little repetitive and the movie goes on a little too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Neds tells the story of John, a Catholic teenager growing up in 1970s Glasgow. The story line follows John's involvement with his city's Ned culture and the consequences of it on his teenage years. The movie won Best Film at the San Sebastian Film Festival in January 2011.Good points: The characters were well portrayed and gave a good performance, making it realistic and a good representation of how life would have been like as a young Scottish boy. Also, the music that is played in the movie is well suited to it and is the correct year when released.Bad points: The accents were very strong, at some points I couldn't understand what they were saying. The ending, might have had a good meaning to it, but was a disappointment as I was expecting something that was exciting. Also the film is over two hours long, which was too long.Overall: I would give the film 6.5/10, because the acting was good, along with the representation of teenagers in1970's Scotland, but the film was very long and the overall story line could have been better scripted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different style of this type of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning John (Connor McCarron) excels as a child in his studies, but the rough, hard environment around him soon has an effect on his personal character and, as he grows up in 1970s Glasgow, he moulds into one of the pack, as problems at home and school breed the violent character within him, going up against the hard drinking, knife wielding thugs that are the sworn enemies of the hard drinking, knife wielding thugs he's in with.Glasgow still holds the notorious accolade of being 'the knife crime capital of Great Britain', so this could have been just as hard hitting and unflinching as it was setting out to be being a modern day drama. Instead, director Peter Mullan has presented a sprawling, overlong if I'm brutally honest, exploration of a young man's despairing, senseless dessension into mindless thuggery, possibly based on his own experiences. As a result of this, it comes off as very hard to get into to start with, lost as it is in it's own mood, atmosphere and style. But it's these same things that somehow manage to make it a more absorbing experience if you stick with it long enough, slowly drawing you into the life of this troubled character and the various ups and downs he encounters as he trawls through the rough landscape of his youth. Still, this feels like quite an undisciplined effort from Mullan, which veers into outlandish, arty moments (such as the lead character duking it out with the Lord Jesus Christ) that only serve to make it an even more alienating experience than it already is. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Peter Mullan has achieved with N.E.D.S exactly what Shane Meadows achieved with This Is England, he has captured a raw coming of age drama that is honest and accurate in every way imaginable.. The film is set in Glasgow in the early 70's and it deals with the struggles of youth growing up at a time when knife culture was rife and the threat of violence lingers in the air..We follow young teenager John McGill and his low-life friends in and around Glasgow, as we follow his time at school where at the start he is a model student, however his notorious brother who is a member of a gang and who is well known amongst the other NEDS, casts a shadow over Conors life as he is soon sucked into the gang life himself, now this may seem like a cliché but trust me there are a few good surprises that rises this film above all the other British films made over the past 10 years...Now this is the real kicker, i live in Paisley that is right next door to Glasgow and the heavy Scottish accent (Glaswegian) that is used throughout the film is a real joy to listen to, there was so many times i was laughing my ass off at how funny this film can be, but there are some harrowing moments as well, i have no idea how this film will translate over seas?? I assume they may need some subtitles over in America for the audience to understand what the youths are talking about. This is a great movie that will touch your heart for anyone that has been raised in tough neighbourhoods around the world..Great performances from the entire cast, solid direction from Peter Mullan, and a good story that needed to be told especially in Scotland, if you get the chance check it out, you'll be glad you did...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let down by the script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Mullan's film about Glasgow's Non-Educated Delinquents is not quite as straightforward as it may at first seem: there are some fairly common elements (the bright kid trying to learn his way out of poverty, the drunken father, the violent street gangs) but also some odd, surreal imaginative scenes, and an overall narrative that grows more opaque the longer the film lasts. It's the scenes set at school, which showcase the diversity of approaches employed by the teaching staff, that are most powerful, making the point that if your rear children as animals, animals are what you're going to get out the other end. The almost total absence of any positive virtues: humour, love, progress are all absent from the narrative; ultimately make for hard watching. Mullan himself is mesmeric in a small role, but the failure to make that role more central is just one of the film's narrative oddities; as a writer, Mullan could have done with some help to better shape his material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak and desperately sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have very mixed feelings about this film. Admittedly I was expecting a lot as it's a Peter Mullen film and he deals very well with the dirtier side of British social history. A majority of his work is heavy going and usually leaves me with lots to think about, having first had a good cry! This certainly is not for the faint hearted.The violence I found incredibly difficult to watch. I am sure that is a nod to its realism but it wasn't easy viewing by any means. It wasn't gratuitous but as advertised, it was brutal. I didn't feel resolve or any sense of justice or come away feeling like things have much improved or changed over time. It has been compared a lot to 'The is England' but in truth it doesn't have a patch on it. The characters just aren't as well developed and I didn't particularly like or feel compassion to many of them, apart from the fact that this is the sad reality for many children, even now. I also can't recall many moments of light relief in this, which This is England managed frequently with its emphasis on comradery and friendship. I feel ultimately it is an unfair comparison though so don't watch it on that basis.You can make all sorts of excuses or explanations as to why disillusioned young men become gang members or vandals/ criminals but in this case I didn't feel as though the main character made this transition in a subtle or realistic fashion. It was closer to a personality transplant than the slowly trodden down morale of gentile lad with a potentially bright future. Okay so it makes the valid point that we as a society have to nurture our young, protect them, educate them, communicate with them, lead by example, give them the opportunities that they need to grow. But I felt like this was more about poor management of a possible mental health issue rather than just the story of an average boy with a troubled background. (I know the two often go hand in hand) I just didn't feel like the character development justified the direction that the plot went in.So plot was so-so, performance wise it was pretty solid, particularly for young, amateur, Scottish kids. The camera work was pretty good and the retro 70's feel was definitely apparent. I can't pin point the moment at which it started to lag but it did, it lost my attention and I lost hope of it ever reaching a conclusion that would satisfy and I was right. Ultimately I found myself wanting to enjoy the film more than I actually did.Sidenote: I grew up in Scotland, not too far from Glasgow and for a long time 'Neds' didn't necessarily know they were 'Neds'. Ned was always an insult, it is a a discriminatory, class issue and although they may now have embraced the word, reclaimed it, like the use of the 'N' word amongst the Black community, it certainly was not something that people used to refer to themselves as, or be proud of. I was interested to see the character in this refer to himself as a Ned. I know that the word itself goes way back and I am sure it is accurate in the film makers experience, but interesting how that differs from people who live just a few miles away (admittedly that was 80s/90s/early 2000s) I also appreciate that Glasgow gang culture has a long and complex history where as I lived in a more rural area where groups were mainly interchangeable (apart from the great Neds Vs Goths War of '97!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the first hour is controlled and captivating, the second hour becomes script-messy, loses intensity and is too long: the movie should have been 15-20min shorter.As for John's character, though there was material, he lacks depth, his psychology and increase in power are not enough controlled, and I failed to feel strong emotions towards him.Neds can be compared to This Is England, and though the latter was a little different, I preferred it because everything was better described: script, character, psychology, message. Neds, still, is a fair movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing - but still engrossing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that this movie's title put me off right from the start and I was dreading watching another 'Scum' type shock-flick. Real-life Neds had a name change (and style change!) in the Naughties! They've been known as Chavs for the past decade. However, with the current financial climate denying them their 'bling', Neds are back?! They've borrowed their 'uniform' from the 90's and can be spotted anywhere in Glasgow with their shell-suits, hooded tops and Burberry baseball caps (or a combination of all 3..) Enough of my commentary on current society...Yes there's violence in spadefuls but it's not gratuitous and does not take over the movie at any stage. The school belting's were almost chaplinesque (speeded up) in delivery style and not quite how I remembered witnessing such events at school. This would be my only criticism on the attention to detail front.What's it all about? Personally, I think Mullan makes a valid point throughout this movie. Gifted kids from poor backgrounds have a huge uphill struggle to fully achieve their potential. To be labelled a 'swot' and experience ridicule from both your peers and some teachers is hardly inspiring - to say the least. Yes, the most disadvantaged will find it harder and that's a fact of life.To go from being a meek mannered kid who's top of his primary school class to the toughest and hardest nut (Ned?) in the 'hood' is maybe a stretch of the imagination but not entirely unbelievable. He is, after all, expected to follow in his big brother's footsteps! Despite almost losing it completely towards the end, there does seem to be a last final chance for some redemption for young John McGill...The final scene at Blair Drummond safari park reminded me of Peter Sellers walking on water in his last movie - Being There! Not as surreal but equally poignant and thought provoking. This movie will have more resonance with Scottish viewers, but there's a message there for a larger audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cult Of The Proleteriat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sort that wins lots of plaudits and it's not difficult to see why . It's like jumping in to the Tardis and finding one self in a distinctive time and place so much so you sometimes find it difficult to believe that you're watching a mere film and genuinely believe you're stuck in the time zone it's set . Then suddenly the social realism of the film starts over doing things a little and the hyper realism starts detracting from the reality There does tend to be an element of British cultural bourgeois mind set called " The cult of the proletariat " . By this I mean the bourgeoisie have an instinctive intrigue of all things relating to the lower working class environment but have a dread of ever experiencing it . It's no coincidence that protagonist John McGill is academically gifted and instead of pursuing the academic dream of attending University starts descending in to a path of crime and self destruction . There's no convincing incitement for any of this and the fact McGill could have been someone instead of a no one is quickly forgotten . All this gives the impression that McGill's life is a Shakespearian tragedy From a technical point of view there's absolutely nothing wrong with Mullen's film and shows what can be achieved with a small budget . It's superbly and convincingly acted by everyone especially by Conor McCaron as John McGill . The problems lie in exaggeration . When the film was released Mullen was on record as saying what violent times the 1970s were and he's not wrong . The strap was commonly , perhaps too commonly used by teachers at school but yet would you ever hear a teacher swear ? The dialogue might be authentic but the Glasgow vernacular constantly using the F word and the C word and ending nearly every spoken line with " Man " will make it very difficult for a non working class Scottish audience and one suspects the working class Scottish proles may not be the target audience</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As per previous review it is episodic but an excellent piece of film. Throughout the film I was able to reflect on my youth and others I knew. Several segments where exceptional reflection. Characterisation was spot on.Belts whipped out from the shoulder and the flowing gowns - who'd have thunk it wasn't only my school!!! Looks like it ran out of an ending. Should be thought provoking but director should be able to direct to the end. Thrown to the lions is poor explanation for what has went before. Yes the Jesus vision is poor - but this is tempered by the almost anonymous but iconic cameo by the director.Anyone any other insight to the contrived ending?I would like to think that there are some insights that I have not considered that will improve this film scoring in my view. Maybe I just didn't twig to the ending!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was positive discussion of this British film on Film 2010 with Claudia Winkleman, and it looked like a good mix of This Is England and something like (a more understandable) Sweet Sixteen, so of course I wanted to see it, from director Peter Mullan. Basically, set in 1970's Glasgow, Neds (Non-Educated Delinquents) are roaming the streets, and school boy, ten year old John McGill (Greg Forrest) has been surrounded by it for some time, but ignores it to do well in his studies. After a very good academic career, fourteen year old John McGill (Conor McCarron) is ready to start secondary school, but with a dysfunctional family consisting of a drunken and violent father (Peter Mullan), troubled mother Theresa (Louise Goodall) and brother Benny (Joe Szula) constantly getting into trouble with the police, dark clouds appear in his personality. He makes friends with Julian (Martin Bell) and hanging out with the wrong crowd, John transcends into the Neds territory as he talks back to teachers and isn't bothered about punishment, and of course going against other young street thugs. Also starring John Joe Hay as Fergie, Gary Lewis as Mr. Russell, Mhairi Anderson as Elizabeth, Richard Mack as Gerr, Gary Milligan as Canta, Christopher Wallace as Wee T, Marianna Palka as Aunt Beth, Steven Robertson as Mr. Bonetti, David McKay as Mr. Holmes and Linda Cuthbert as Mrs. Matherson. I agree with the critics that it loses some grip towards the end, but all the actors, most of which are newcomers, especially McCarron and his younger self Forrest are fantastic, the realism in parts with the violence and school punishment makes for good viewing, an interesting coming-of-age drama. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film about bad problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I have to admit that one reason that made this film more appealing for me was that at the moment I live in Glasgow, right in the area, where the film was filmed and here the "neds" are a part of daily life, only in different uniforms that in 70's. So to say, if living elsewhere I would not find this film as interesting as now. How ever it is still quite good movie.Some say that the language is difficult. Probably yes, if you are not glaswegian. Though even I understood almost everything with a background of three years in Glasgow (English is not my native language).Surprisingly there were even a few moments when everybody laughed (I was not expecting comedy), but still it was not awkward. Few shocking moments, but no unnecessary gore. Though it might have been good to show little bit more the gruesome results of stabbings as it feels here, and in that movie too that sadly many of these young "neds" do not even realise the fact that knife can kill and is not a toy. The characters are a little bit hollow. In Neds everything just is how it is, some further explanation and reasons would be really fruitful. I would have appreciated some deeper view of the main characters thoughts and reasons for his actions. I was looking for some explanation to the whole ned-culture, gang fights and meaningless violence. From this movie I learnt only that things were the same in Glasgow 40 years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>neds - A great film with a superb cast of young actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like zanderd69 from Scotland I feel compelled to writing my first IMDb review with this superb film and to give it 10/10. I had to travel into London to watch it as it was not playing at my local cinema. It is classed as "special interest" meaning less UK screenings sadly. Watch out in the future for Conor McCarron who plays young John McGill, the bright schoolboy who has so much hope ahead of him as he leaves primary school. He is a top performer, only to be sucked into the violence of 1970's Glasgow which is shown graphically. It is hard to watch sometimes but very accurate. I found myself really sympathising with the lead actor (I rarely do this). He really was on his own in so many ways in this film and bravely took (in his own mind) the whole world on. The film has lots of twists and turns. I want to talk about the ending which I have strong theories on, but that would mean ticking spoiler alert which I do not want to do. So many wonderful young amateur actors in this film. Look out too for Steven Robertson, who play the teacher Mr Bonetti. He is pure class. Top marks to Director Peter Mullan and all who took part in this wonderful "real" &amp; "no holding back" film of a time in Glasgow's history which is not known about by many outside of the area.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising take on teenage gang culture which ultimately lacks the strength required in the lead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neds falls into the broad category of "coming of age" movies that automatically have words like "gritty," "uncompromising," "brutal" and "realistic" pinned on to them far before we're given the opportunity to make up our own mind about them. Set in Glasgow in the 1970's, it tells the story of John McGill, a promising student who falls in with gangs and goes off the rails. Let's start off by saying this; Neds has absolute flashes of brilliance in some parts but is ultimately a very flawed experience. Whilst those who are into their Shane Meadows style dramas will certainly find a lot to like, the rest of us might leave feeling somewhat unsatisfied. Whilst by and large the events that take place in Neds are similar to those of other youth dramas (abuse, violence, searching for belonging etc) and are in part delivered very well compared to its peers, it's difficult to sing its praises purely because of the major flaw that runs throughout the film; the strength of its lead character. This isn't a major sleight against newcomer Conor McCarron as much as it is a comment on the development of John McGill as the crux of the narrative (saying that though I couldn't quite tell if McCarron was meant to look like he was on the verge of bursting out laughing at any given moment or whether this was just a poor job on his part). The real issue for me is that we're never really given enough insight into why John does anything that he does. Some things are made painfully obvious but we don't have the ability to join the dots as we're never explicitly told how they affect John. We know that he has an abusive alcoholic father, but we never really see John reacting to this up until the point at which he snaps. We see that he initially lives outside of the gangs but don't really see much of what it is that leads him to become involved in them; what's driving him? The lust for power? Respect? Control? These questions are never satisfactorily answered and we see John move from one thing to the next without really knowing why he's doing what it is. Unfortunately this leaves the whole movie a somewhat hollow experience: even after we've seen John go full circle and head back to school under the banner of reform, five minutes later he's off beating the sunshine out of someone else and we're never really filled in on the blanks. Don't even get me started on the whole hallucinogenic Jesus scene... The whole package is rounded off nicely (in terms of supporting my previous points rather than satisfyingly) with one of the most bizarre finales I've seen in a movie in a long time. Obviously I don't want to give the game away here, but I'll just say that its attempts at being metaphorical are heavy handed and overtly obtuse. Once again a suggestion is made towards what these events might mean to or show from the characters, but ultimately they're not obvious or relative enough to previous events for you to be able to make your mind up definitively to their meaning one way or the other. I'm all for ambiguity and audience interpretation, but a crucially for both of these things to actually work, you need to ensure that the audience has the right information to base their judgements on, and in this case they just don't. Before I complain too much though, let's consider that it's not all about the narrative, as a lot of this film relies on its Scottish setting. The most obvious thing to pick up no is the language. The swearing in Neds is prolific but, if my experience is anything to go by, is quite representative of how Glaswegians speak. Whilst in other areas of the UK (and indeed the English speaking world) fillers within sentences may take the form of "er," "um," "like" or "you know," it's perfectly normal on the west coast for these to be f*ck or f*cking. These are not usually meant offensively (when used in the aforementioned manner) but those not familiar with its use as such might initially find the language used in Neds a tad excessive. Whilst the language in this film might at first seem a bit over the top, it's fair to say it's a fairly accurate portrayal of Glaswegian dialogue. Even though I live in Scotland and am very accustomed to the accent, there were parts in which I found it difficult to understand what characters were saying; nothing there to spoil the movie particularly for me ? but others who aren't as used to the accent might find it hard to decipher what the characters are saying and thus lose some of the film's (oft implied) subtleties. Still, it was in parts an enjoyable watch that perhaps suffers from being slightly overlong and needing better thought in explaining character motivation. Or, if you read every other review I've seen of it so far; it's a gritty, realistic, brutal and uncompromising view of gang youth in seventies Glasgow. Feel free to make your own mind up.</fullReview>

Quite unbelievable that 6 weeks is all it takes for him to turn to the dark side.

		<fullReview>I heard mixed reviews from my friends about this film. Some said it was OK, others thought it was rubbish. Well I watched it last night and I felt motivated into leaving my first ever review.Ultimately I thought the film was terrible. My reasons: Firstly, the plot was weak and the events and actions of the main character were not justified.Secondly, the character development was very poor. Take the father for example - he was a drunk and abusive to his wife. But that was all we saw of him. This is similar with the boy's brother who we didn't get to know or the weird auntie character. Not only were most of these poorly cast but also we were left not feeling anything towards any of them.Another point - there were loads of things that didn't really mean much or were used just to be able to allow the director to go in another director. There could have been numerous films made about individual parts of the movie. E.g. the father wanted to kill himself... What was that all about? Mullens touched on it and then we never heard about it again. In the dance hall, the main character gives his brother the w&amp;^*r sign (you wonder what this means?) but then they are best of friends and the boy is planning leaving for Spain (another aspect of the film which is raised and then forgotten about). Same as the posh boy Jullian and his mother. Where was the police in all of this? surely Julian's parents would have phoned the police since it the firecrackers were tied to the football boots? Fourthly, the film jumps about all over the place. One minute he's an exceptional student, the next a total nut-case, then a student, the a nut-case.Fifthly, the way the violence is trivialised. Spending years in Glasgow, and also being stabbed by a little ned, I know that this sort of violence occurs in Glasgow. But Mullens plays some uplifting/light hearted music while people are fighting and slashing people's throats. I didn't think that fitted well at all.Lastly, the 'symbolism' of the ending with boy holding hands with the guy he attacked while they walked through the lions den was laughable! Again, it was very weakly put together and meant nothing. Who is the director trying to kid? I'm sure some idiots including Mullens will think this is a master piece but i found it very disappointing.Overall - could have been a great film but fell far short of it. I would advise people to not even watch it at all - I recommend very similar film called Small Faces which I thought was really good..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not an original film in many ways, and not the most uplifting movie either, "Neds" is one film that will not appeal to everyone.For those not au fait with Glasgow patter, a ned is basically a social delinquent or casual. Clichés of shell-suits, drink bottles, smoking and loitering in parks and you get the idea of what a "ned" is meant to be.Peter Mullan makes this partially biographical film about the slide of a precocious teenage boy from star pupil to the dregs (in the 70s). Filmed without taking any shortcuts, the crew all speak undiluted Glaswegian (with no vulgarities cut) and use cutting humour. The film show physical abuse as it was, first in the classroom, then at home and finally in the streets (gang fights and the like). It doesn't dwell or linger on the violence which is thankful (avoiding pandering to some) but it is strong when it comes.Acting is exceptionally good and the story is intriguing, plus there is a good soundtrack that captures the period very well. In some ways, it's a film that follows in the same sphere as "This is England", but it follows its own path nevertheless.If you want social realism, then I'd say this is a good film to watch. Won't appeal to everyone, but most people will find it of interest. A good watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im left feeling frustrated and empty after 2hrs in the cinema. The worst part being the ending which was just insulting. This movie had all the ingredients to be utterly fantastic but instead it was a completely weak portrayal of what can only be described as a psychopath. Mullen tries and fails miserably at convincing the audience that the lead character is a product of his environment. As an early review stated, it was an exercise of join the dots. As stages, I actually thought I'd drifted out of conscientiousness and missed parts of the movie. I can only believe that the character had serious mental issues and absolutely nothing to do with his upbringing which is supposed to be the sole grit of the movie because Mullen was unable to translate the main triggers in McGill's life that made him what he turned out to be. He skirted about the issues and put the stereotypical father, poverty, intimidation, fight or die etc etc in but it was limp, unconvincing and incomplete. I do, however, understand Mullen using the terms NEDS for a story set in the 70's. Although the term itself only arrived in the late 80's / early 90's, he used it to show the irony in that the lead character himself was in fact an intelligent individual with huge potential. If it wasn't for my own hope while watching and for filling in the the blanks throughout I would give this movie a 2 out of 10, otherwise I give it a 3. Such a disappointment</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John McGill is a boy with promise. He is well-mannered, respects his elders and passes exams with scholarly ease. He is unique in Peter Mullan's depiction of 1970's Glasgow, where the only real aspiration for him is to not become a NED ? a non-educated delinquent. Connor McCarron, who plays McGill, is cruelly put through his paces in his debut film. He does things many seasoned actors wouldn't. Sometimes it seems his acting can't hide that he doesn't want to do some of those things. He doesn't give as urgent a performance as Martin Compston gave for Ken Loach in 'Sweet Sixteen' nearly 10 years ago, but my goodness do you feel for him. I couldn't quite figure out who is to blame for McGill's plight; everyone is condemned ? from the Catholic Church (the fight with an imaginary Jesus is silly when it wants to be profound), to bellicose teachers, a bigoted police force and even the middle class. We feel sorry for McGill because he never feels sorry for himself. He never challenges those who do him harm. A teacher lashes him for lying about not knowing the answer to a Latin translation. McGill takes the lashes and asks for more. Intelligence is a weakness and being a swot is dangerous. He has no choice but to become a NED (although he is more an ED than a NED). The violence is upfront and brutal. Call me a wuss, but those gang fights are terrifying. Mullan makes you a victim. I'm sure I detected a semblance of Mike Oldfield's 'Tubular Bells' ? a wise musical choice to dramatise McGill's declining sanity. Every time I predicted something the story surprised me, though it loses its way a bit as McGill is drawn deeper into delinquency.Mullan is honest in interviews about his inspiration for the film's content. The drunken father he plays worryingly well is meant to be his own dad. So, when McGill smashes his face ceaselessly with a frying pan, that's Mullan exorcising a demon. You're closer to authenticity with autobiography, and Mullan is closer to being the heir to Leigh and Loach than any one else Britain has.www.scottishreview.net</fullReview>

Why follow that up with throwing fire-crackers into a friends house? Granted, I was into my 8th Té Bheag when the third act started, but what a mess. Is he a kid again and meets his delinquent future self? Was he really having an existential epiphany? How does that help an otherwise entertaining story? Was I just drunk? Help me out, I really wanted to like NEDS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It looked good and was a fun watch, even if I couldn't find subtitles. The shift from good to bad was great but the struggle back seemed rushed and incomplete.To be perfectly honest, I believe the struggle of trying to put that old lifestyle behind would have left a much larger impact on me as I walk away from having seen this film. I don't think that showing the darker side of the violence and gangs would have been lost if it had taken half the time it did.7/10 is a little generous but in the end. I was entertained.I think I said what I needed to say but sadly I cant submit this without a certain number of sentences. It seems slightly ridiculous to me that I need to be forced to add text after saying what I came to say. Sad to think that fluff needs to be added to meet a length quota, I'm sure there is something to be said about this and the extra fluff in a lot of today's cinema as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this film as part of the Tribeca film festival in New York yesterday My biggest concern with this film is that it's too White washed. I have lived in that part of the country and now living in New York with friends from that part of the world I find it hard to digest that everyone in the movie was white. I do understand that its not set in current day but even back in the day ethnic groups existed. They would have called for a greater conflict had they been represented. The movie doesn't seem to a true representation.Also the has moments of being too cheesy or calculated. The Jesus scene is completed uncalled for and it almost feels its a scene belonging to a different genre. I was extremely disappointed to see this film part of Tribeca's programming because there is nothing unique about this film.</fullReview>
